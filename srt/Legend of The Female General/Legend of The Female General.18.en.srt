=Episode 18=

23
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:39,669
Thank you, Commander.

24
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:41,428
Last night,

25
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:43,148
I behaved too boldly.

26
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:47,976
It's nothing.

27
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,669
No one saw us anyway.

28
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,949
Even if seen, it wouldn't matter.

29
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:55,148
The Qiao couple spent
the night on a sampan.

30
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,069
If word spreads,

31
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,628
it'll be a romantic story.

32
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:01,269
Then we will

33
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,308
leave openly in the crowds

34
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,269
conspicuously.

35
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:13,864
Commander.

36
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,908
Are you alright?

37
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:17,428
It's my fault.

38
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:19,708
I lay on your arm all night

39
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,109
and made your hand go numb.

40
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,908
It's fine. Really.

41
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:26,549
You don't need me

42
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:27,708
to massage it for you?

43
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,428
Stop being stubborn.

44
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:42,908
Flatbread.

45
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:44,509
Flatbread.

46
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:45,188
Flatbread.

47
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:46,468
I want flatbread.

48
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:49,069
Sir.

49
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,989
Two flatbreads, please.

50
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:51,912
Alright.

51
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:52,789
A pot of hot tea.

52
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,188
Your hot tea.

53
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:56,936
Thank you.

54
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:57,908
Your flatbreads.

55
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:58,920
Enjoy.

56
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:17,868
Commander.

57
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,669
Freshly baked flatbreads.

58
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:21,748
Don't you want to try?

59
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:25,349
Not hungry.

60
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:27,589
Such a stick-in-the-mud.

61
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:45,589
Unlike a Wei man.

62
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:47,229
When drinking tea earlier,

63
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,109
he added salt,

64
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:49,909
ginger,

65
00:04:50,388 --> 00:04:50,989
and pepper.

66
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:51,549
Exactly.

67
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,268
That's a Wutuo custom.

68
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:54,748
It's used to fight

69
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:55,669
the cold.

70
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:24,308
This Wutuo man

71
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:25,508
has accomplices.

72
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:27,109
They're leaving the city.

73
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,589
Should we follow?

74
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:34,909
Look at those two.

75
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,428
Though the girl is coughing violently,

76
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,709
her grandmother

77
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:42,709
shows no concern.

78
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:44,508
She's gripping the girl's hand

79
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:46,428
like fearing an escape.

80
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:47,989
That old woman's suspicious.

81
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:49,428
Intercept her.

82
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:52,188
Stop!

83
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:59,229
Hand over the girl.

84
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:01,589
Surrender quietly,

85
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:03,029
and I'll spare your life.

86
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:05,709
If I can't take this girl,

87
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:07,669
she'll die here.

88
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,029
These Wutuo people are cunning.

89
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:40,828
He.

90
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:42,828
Master.

91
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:45,909
Let's leave first.

92
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:47,268
Follow me.

93
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,989
Master, what happened earlier?

94
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:56,469
Who's this girl?

95
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:57,748
That old woman

96
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,029
was a Wutuo spy

97
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:00,149
infiltrating Jiyang.

98
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,192
I've been

99
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:02,229
tracking them

100
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:03,149
for some time.

101
00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:05,149
This child

102
00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:06,549
is Princess Mengji's daughter.

103
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:08,868
They nearly abducted her earlier.

104
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,748
No wonder Cui Yuezhi's frantic.

105
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:12,388
I'll return first

106
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:13,628
to report finding

107
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:15,388
the kid and the Wutuo spies.

108
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:17,068
Go with your master

109
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:17,909
to escort the kid.

110
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:23,229
Stay vigilant.

111
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:32,040
(Herbal Apothecary)

112
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:44,188
To locate

113
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:45,149
that injured Wutuo man,

114
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:46,789
we searched many apothecaries

115
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,549
but found no trace.

116
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:49,416
No rush.

117
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:50,508
He must still be

118
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,789
in Jiyang.

119
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,128
(Herb Names)

120
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:14,549
That's him.

121
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:17,748
Follow him.

122
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:39,388
I was wondering earlier

123
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:41,829
why the Wutuo people spared me.

124
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,544
(Xu)

125
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:47,469
Later, I found out

126
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:48,469
it was

127
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,388
because they saw

128
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:50,668
the Xu token.

129
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:52,229
Judging by this,

130
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:54,268
they are connected to Chancellor Xu,

131
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:56,109
perhaps even acting under his orders.

132
00:08:58,429 --> 00:08:59,628
For Chai Anxi,

133
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:01,349
so many Wutuo agents have come here.

134
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:02,868
I fear Jiyang City

135
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:04,548
is headed for turmoil.

136
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:11,912
(Cloudbird Manor)

137
00:09:15,148 --> 00:09:16,028
Cloudbird Manor?

138
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:18,189
Master, why here?

139
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:19,908
This child's been drugged.

140
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:21,109
I must go inside

141
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:22,148
to prepare an antidote.

142
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:23,508
Bring her

143
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:24,349
and follow me in.

144
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:49,069
Earlier,

145
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:50,628
who was that gentleman?

146
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:52,808
Also,

147
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:54,508
why change into women's clothes?

148
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:59,309
He's General Fengyun, Xiao Jue.

149
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:00,829
We came to Jiyang

150
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:01,949
on official business.

151
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:03,709
As for the clothing change,

152
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:05,388
it's to conceal my identity.

153
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,829
So that's General Fengyun.

154
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,109
No wonder he immediately

155
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,349
started giving you orders.

156
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,388
He's the Right Army Commander.

157
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:17,508
I'm just one

158
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:18,189
of his soldiers.

159
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:19,709
Of course he can order me.

160
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,388
You seem quite protective of him.

161
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:24,840
What?

162
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:25,908
Do you like him?

163
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:36,908
Between us,

164
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:39,189
there's indeed some history.

165
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:41,788
But my own path

166
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:43,508
is not yet clear.

167
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:45,788
I suppose

168
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:48,148
nothing will come of it.

169
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:53,069
Let me divine

170
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:53,829
your fates.

171
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:37,309
The hexagram is Kan.

172
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:39,268
It represents water.

173
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:40,989
From peril to greater peril.

174
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:42,508
Trapped between dangers

175
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:43,709
with no escape in sight.

176
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:45,908
Does this mean

177
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:48,388
being with him would bring

178
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:49,908
certain disaster?

179
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,508
Remember what I said

180
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,429
earlier?

181
00:11:58,189 --> 00:11:59,109
It signifies danger,

182
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:01,309
but water is adaptable.

183
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,069
Navigate through hazards

184
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:04,788
and find passage in peril.

185
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:10,148
Human conquers fate.

186
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:11,829
Don't bow to destiny.

187
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:05,748
That melody sounds so familiar.

188
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:07,829
My mother often plays this

189
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:09,469
in her leisure time.

190
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:11,469
I think it's called

191
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,589
Slow Passing Years.

192
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:23,432
(Cloudbird Manor)

193
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,628
(Clouds and birds fade from memory.)

194
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:40,189
(One day, we'll reunite
at the city tower.)

195
00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:42,189
(Cloudbird Manor.)

196
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:44,309
(So that's how it is.)

197
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:52,539
(Cloudbird Manor)

198
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:00,109
Mr. Cui,

199
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:01,469
you've finally arrived.

200
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,268
Sorry for the delay.

201
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:08,069
Are you okay?

202
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:09,268
I nearly

203
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,148
came close to

204
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:11,069
being killed.

205
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:13,028
Mr. Liu saved me.

206
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,189
I'm Cui Yuezhi.

207
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:18,469
My deepest gratitude

208
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,109
for saving the little princess.

209
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:21,788
Thanks to your information

210
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,349
about the Wutuo spies,

211
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:24,309
I've sent people

212
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:25,429
to catch them.

213
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:26,548
It was nothing.

214
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,949
Don't mention it.

215
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:29,229
You'd better return

216
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:30,908
with the little princess.

217
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:31,868
We shouldn't let

218
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,349
her elders worry.

219
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:34,788
Of course.

220
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:36,589
I should report this

221
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:37,668
to Princess Mengji.

222
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:38,989
Would you

223
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:39,829
accompany me?

224
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:41,668
When she learns

225
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:43,069
of your heroic deed,

226
00:14:43,668 --> 00:14:45,469
she'll surely reward you generously.

227
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:47,868
I avoid worldly ties.

228
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:48,868
No need.

229
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:50,908
Alright, alright.

230
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:52,788
Your Highness.

231
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:53,800
After you.

232
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:57,268
Mr. Liu.

233
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:58,349
Visit me sometime.

234
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:08,388
He.

235
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:09,788
You two

236
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,829
may return.

237
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:11,908
Be careful.

238
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:13,949
- Yes.
- Yes.

239
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:24,424
What's wrong?

240
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:26,548
Your master

241
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,668
cares a lot about the little princess.

242
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:32,589
He rarely speaks of the past.

243
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:34,748
But I can sense

244
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,028
he harbors many regrets in his heart

245
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:38,148
and sorrows.

246
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:41,109
I don't want to see him sad.

247
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:42,229
That's why

248
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,469
I never mention it.

249
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:52,827
(Mengji Mansion, Jiyang)

250
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:57,340
(Cultivate Virtue)

251
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:10,189
The little princess

252
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:11,628
entered to see Princess Mengji.

253
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:12,788
We'll wait here

254
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,349
for her summons.

255
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:16,109
Uncle.

256
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:17,388
Tell us

257
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:18,349
about Princess Mengji,

258
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:19,989
so we don't offend her later.

259
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:23,508
Back then,

260
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:26,028
the old lord had a son and a daughter.

261
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,469
The eldest son died before 18.

262
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:31,709
In those days, the Mengji Mansion

263
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:33,868
was like a boat in stormy seas.

264
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:36,229
To stabilize the situation, the Princess

265
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:38,309
married the son
of a high-ranking official.

266
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:39,989
After her husband's death,

267
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:41,748
she took charge of governance,

268
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:43,189
quelled internal conflicts,

269
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:44,548
won over the people,

270
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:46,229
and steered

271
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,148
Jiyang's slow return to stability.

272
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,949
The Princess arrives!

273
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:15,432
(Mu Hongjin, Princess Mengji)

274
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:17,308
I'm Cui Yuezhi.

275
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:18,629
Your Highness.

276
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:20,229
Huanqing, Yuyan,

277
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:21,508
greet the Princess.

278
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:27,149
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

279
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,508
Mr. Cui.

280
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:31,869
These two

281
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:33,669
are your long-lost nephew

282
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,389
and niece-in-law?

283
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:37,429
Your Highness,

284
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:38,709
this young man

285
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,548
is my nephew, Huanqing.

286
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:41,909
Beside him

287
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:43,429
stands this lovely and dutiful lady,

288
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,068
his recently wedded wife,

289
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:45,748
Yuyan.

290
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,028
Huanqing

291
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,548
is handsome, clever, and skilled in

292
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:51,949
both civil and martial arts.

293
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:53,709
His demeanor

294
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:56,028
greatly resembles my late elder brother.

295
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:57,548
Every time I see him,

296
00:17:57,949 --> 00:18:00,949
I'm filled with melancholy.

297
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:02,989
I never realized

298
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,229
the Right Army Commander had free time

299
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:07,588
to impersonate someone

300
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,869
to come to my place?

301
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:18,189
You old fool.

302
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:20,508
Falling for such an obvious deception.

303
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:22,429
He resembles your dead brother?

304
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:24,229
Have you looked in a mirror?

305
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:26,229
Your family

306
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:27,989
are never known

307
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,308
for handsomeness.

308
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:29,928
I...

309
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:35,748
Please stop

310
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,108
beating around the bush.

311
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,108
Why did you infiltrate Jiyang City?

312
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,588
What's your true purpose?

313
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:43,909
My apologies, Your Highness.

314
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,068
My visit here

315
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:47,828
aims to find someone.

316
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:49,828
Chai Anxi,

317
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:51,709
once my father's subordinate,

318
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:53,788
went missing in the Mingshui Battle.

319
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,149
After tracking him all this way,

320
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,748
I had no choice

321
00:18:58,229 --> 00:18:59,149
but to hide my identity

322
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:00,229
to enter Jiyang.

323
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,068
Mr. Cui was kept in the dark.

324
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:04,748
Your Highness,

325
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:05,788
please forgive him.

326
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,709
Is that your excuse?

327
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:09,909
Do you know

328
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:11,189
nowadays, Jiyang

329
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:13,149
has been infiltrated

330
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:14,068
by many Wutuo spies?

331
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:16,429
Is this true?

332
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:18,669
Jiyang City is impenetrable.

333
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:20,429
How did they infiltrate?

334
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:22,229
Your Highness,

335
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,149
as General Xiao mentioned,

336
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,068
the Wutuo people

337
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:26,469
used unknown methods

338
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:27,748
to infiltrate Jiyang City.

339
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:30,389
They ambushed the little princess

340
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:31,828
during her outing,

341
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:32,909
probably

342
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,028
to blackmail you.

343
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:35,788
Please don't worry.

344
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,588
I've deployed people to capture

345
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:38,828
the Wutuo spies.

346
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,669
Given current circumstances,

347
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:42,429
merely catching them

348
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:43,709
won't suffice.

349
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:45,268
What's your proposal?

350
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:46,669
As you said,

351
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:48,469
Jiyang is impenetrable

352
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,588
as the world knows.

353
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:50,748
But now,

354
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:52,709
the Wutuo agents have managed

355
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:53,989
to infiltrate effortlessly

356
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:55,989
and target the little princess.

357
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:57,348
This proves

358
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,389
their actions are premeditated

359
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,308
and well-prepared.

360
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:03,528
Your Highness,

361
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,869
for Jiyang's citizens' safety,

362
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:07,788
we must prepare early

363
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:08,989
and take precautions.

364
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:11,108
This is our business.

365
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:13,669
We'll handle it ourselves.

366
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:20,429
Your Highness,

367
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,429
Military Inspector Chu Zhao is outside.

368
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:25,909
Let him in.

369
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:41,629
Your Highness.

370
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:42,989
Skip formalities.

371
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,028
Why would a military inspector

372
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:47,189
visit Jiyang?

373
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,149
Are you sent by the court?

374
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:51,469
You misunderstand.

375
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:52,909
I'm returning to the capital

376
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:54,508
and merely passing through.

377
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:57,548
Then why request this meeting?

378
00:20:58,068 --> 00:20:58,669
I

379
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:01,429
spotted a Wutuo spy.

380
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:11,028
Where?

381
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:12,869
At an herb shop.

382
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:14,189
A wounded man had

383
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:15,748
a wolf-head tattoo

384
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:16,989
on his right arm,

385
00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:18,828
a Wutuo identifier,

386
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:19,989
revealed during treatment.

387
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:21,709
I tracked him

388
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:23,748
to a group of Wutuo spies.

389
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:25,389
There were over a dozen.

390
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:27,629
Clearly,

391
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:29,108
multiple Wutuo groups

392
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:29,989
have infiltrated

393
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:31,389
this city.

394
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:33,989
Please reconsider

395
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:35,389
my proposal,

396
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:37,788
Your Highness.

397
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:40,149
We appreciate your warning.

398
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:41,989
But we'll handle

399
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,348
our own affairs.

400
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:45,548
You may leave.

401
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:47,788
Host them at the mansion tonight.

402
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,899
(Self-Revealing Virtue)

403
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:08,588
Mr. Qiao?

404
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:11,788
I didn't expect you in Jiyang

405
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:13,108
under a new name.

406
00:22:14,348 --> 00:22:14,869
There's more.

407
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:16,508
I've even gotten married.

408
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:19,432
Mr. Chu,

409
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:20,989
we're destined to meet

410
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:22,108
wherever we go.

411
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:24,508
Putting it that way,

412
00:22:24,949 --> 00:22:26,788
it seems we're always reuniting.

413
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:28,669
Then you must be very busy, Mr. Chu.

414
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:30,068
Even crossing a street

415
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:31,508
would make you reunite

416
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:32,748
with many 'destined ones'.

417
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:44,429
Commander, night approaches.

418
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,508
Let's dine.

419
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:00,028
Xiao Jue's arrival was abrupt

420
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:01,028
and impolite.

421
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:02,709
But a general of his caliber

422
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:04,028
never acts rashly.

423
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:05,588
Mobilize defenses,

424
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:07,429
increase patrols and drills,

425
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:08,669
and stockpile herbs

426
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:09,508
just in case.

427
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,548
Understood.

428
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:12,712
Moreover,

429
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:14,629
he saved Lou.

430
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:16,748
Keep his presence here

431
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:17,748
confidential.

432
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:19,669
Help his search

433
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,028
for the person.

434
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:23,368
Yes.

435
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:34,920
(Self-Revealing Virtue)

436
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:00,629
Slow Passing Years.

437
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:26,469
Your Highness.

438
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:29,108
Slow Passing Years.

439
00:24:30,348 --> 00:24:31,989
Have you heard this song?

440
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:34,709
My master often plays it.

441
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:39,709
I heard Lou mention it.

442
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:40,909
Her savior

443
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:42,909
also included a white-clad hero

444
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:44,508
with a sword in hand

445
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:45,949
and a zither on his back.

446
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:48,028
Do you know

447
00:24:48,828 --> 00:24:49,748
who he might be?

448
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:52,629
That was my master

449
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:54,989
Liu Buwang, the Cloudforest Hermit.

450
00:24:59,149 --> 00:24:59,989
Liu Buwang?

451
00:25:02,508 --> 00:25:03,308
Is he well?

452
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:06,344
No.

453
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:08,308
No need to tell me.

454
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,108
I don't care.

455
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:16,108
May I ask you

456
00:25:16,828 --> 00:25:17,748
if you

457
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:19,548
and my master

458
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:21,909
were once acquainted?

459
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:27,669
(Many years ago,)

460
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:29,828
(to escape my marriage,)

461
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,348
(I secretly fled the mansion.)

462
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:40,748
Run faster, little lady!

463
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:42,920
- Try running!
- Where can you flee now?

464
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,308
Help! Is anyone there to save me?

465
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:46,229
Run!

466
00:25:47,108 --> 00:25:47,669
Scream!

467
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:48,949
Yeah, keep running!

468
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:06,344
Sir.

469
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:07,869
Help me, sir!

470
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:09,669
Carrying a zither?

471
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,348
You fragile man

472
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:12,909
want to be a hero?

473
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:13,909
Scram.

474
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:15,828
Sir.

475
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:17,508
Still here?

476
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,709
Get him!

477
00:26:34,508 --> 00:26:35,272
Sir.

478
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:58,348
Thank you.

479
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:00,068
I'm Mu Hongjin.

480
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:01,588
What's your name?

481
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:04,828
Liu Buwang.

482
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:06,268
If you're unharmed,

483
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:07,508
I'll take my leave.

484
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:09,748
Mr. Liu.

485
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:14,588
I think my ankle's sprained.

486
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:16,389
In for a penny,

487
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:17,629
in for a pound.

488
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:18,869
How about

489
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:20,469
you carry me?

490
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:21,224
No.

491
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:22,869
That's improper.

492
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:28,149
It really does hurt

493
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:29,588
when I move.

494
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:34,068
Please, sir.

495
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:43,880
Miss,

496
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:45,032
where's your home?

497
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:46,469
I'll take you back.

498
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:47,629
I have no home.

499
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:49,469
I was kidnapped and brought here.

500
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:52,068
My home is very far away.

501
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:53,788
I'll follow you.

502
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,508
Wherever you go, I go.

503
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:57,068
What do you mean

504
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:57,869
by "follow me"?

505
00:27:58,669 --> 00:27:59,669
Why would you follow me?

506
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,748
Since you saved me,

507
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:03,308
see it through to the end.

508
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:06,268
Or escort me home.

509
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:07,748
My home is far away.

510
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:08,669
Can you do it?

511
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:09,384
Of course.

512
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,469
My home's in Yaojing.

513
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:17,028
Don't worry.

514
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:18,268
I don't eat much.

515
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:19,748
I won't cost you much.

516
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:20,669
Having me along

517
00:28:20,788 --> 00:28:21,909
won't be a burden.

518
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,508
No.

519
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:27,588
Please, please.

520
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:31,989
I'm begging you.

521
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,748
Thank you.

522
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:51,588
I'm starving.

523
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:52,869
Sir.

524
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:55,189
Can we have a proper meal?

525
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:56,360
No.

526
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:57,548
After a month,

527
00:29:57,949 --> 00:29:59,108
my money is nearly gone.

528
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:03,149
Candied haws for sale!

529
00:30:05,108 --> 00:30:05,949
Candied haws.

530
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:06,709
Want one?

531
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:08,072
Take a look.

532
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:14,308
Sir, one please.

533
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:15,629
Alright. Thank you.

534
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:17,508
Here, hold this.

535
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:28,348
You still care about me.

536
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:29,229
Want some?

537
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:30,869
Miss.

538
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:32,264
Boundaries.

539
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:42,909
Take a bouquet if you like it.

540
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:43,828
This one, then.

541
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:44,629
Take care.

542
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:50,308
This looks nice.

543
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:54,108
These bracelets
are called Joyful Hearts.

544
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:55,828
My husband and I

545
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:56,949
carved them together.

546
00:30:57,748 --> 00:30:58,989
Joyful Hearts bracelets.

547
00:30:59,548 --> 00:31:00,469
Any special meaning?

548
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:01,629
If lovers

549
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:04,108
wear these bracelets,

550
00:31:04,348 --> 00:31:05,709
they'll never be separated.

551
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:09,469
Is this your lover?

552
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:11,788
Buy a pair for the lady.

553
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:12,869
A lifetime

554
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:14,268
of togetherness.

555
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:16,189
You heard that, Mr. Liu?

556
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:17,748
Buy me one?

557
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:32,548
She's not my lover.

558
00:31:39,788 --> 00:31:41,348
- Great!
- Great!

559
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:42,229
You sure

560
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,629
I'm not your lover?

561
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:50,068
No flowers?

562
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:51,669
No.

563
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:05,588
It's me.

564
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,989
Soldiers are everywhere outside,

565
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:19,989
checking everyone.

566
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:21,709
Seemingly searching for someone.

567
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:27,508
Tomorrow,

568
00:32:28,588 --> 00:32:30,108
I must return to Qiyun Mountain.

569
00:32:31,268 --> 00:32:32,669
Will you come with me?

570
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:34,308
You'll meet my master.

571
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:37,229
I can't go with you.

572
00:32:41,788 --> 00:32:42,308
Why?

573
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:45,189
I'm Prince Mengji's daughter.

574
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:48,389
The person those soldiers are hunting

575
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:50,308
is me.

576
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,548
My father wants

577
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:53,669
me to marry

578
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:54,989
a court official's son

579
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:57,469
to strengthen his political standing.

580
00:32:58,709 --> 00:32:59,229
I refused.

581
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,229
That's why I fled.

582
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:02,229
But then I met you.

583
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:04,508
This past month

584
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:07,189
has been truly joyful.

585
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:11,669
Mr. Liu,

586
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:13,748
I don't want that marriage.

587
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:16,909
But I can't go up the mountain with you.

588
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:18,788
What should I do?

589
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:23,588
In that case,

590
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:25,588
wait here at this inn.

591
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:26,909
I'll go

592
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:28,469
tell my master

593
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:30,028
and then return in two days.

594
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:31,548
We'll resolve this together.

595
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:34,748
Must you leave now?

596
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:36,508
I'll definitely return.

597
00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:37,828
Liu Buwang,

598
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:41,229
remember your promise.

599
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:44,028
You must come back.

600
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:49,548

but the answer never came.

618
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:28,789
Deep down, I know

619
00:35:29,668 --> 00:35:30,389
we are

620
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:31,429
in separate worlds.

629
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:52,508
He remains a coward.

properly.

632
00:35:56,749 --> 00:35:58,269
