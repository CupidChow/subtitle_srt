(Xiao Zhongwu, Song Wan)
Father, Mother.

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,060
I cannot abandon the Xiao Army.

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,620
Nor can I be her obstacle.

26
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,259
If we're not destined to be a couple,

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,180
then I'd rather be

28
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,860
single and alone.

(Virtues' Enduring Legacy)

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,300
Your Majesty.

31
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,259
Shall I

32
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,740
change it with fresh flowers?

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,820
I ruined Xiao Jue and He Yan's marriage.

34
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,420
They

35
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,140
must hold resentment toward me.

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,900
I suppose

37
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,540
you have your reasons, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,220
The imperial court requires

39
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,980
a balance.

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,940
But now,

41
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,380
two powerful generals

42
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,020
seek to unite.

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,140
How could I

44
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,700
rest easy with this?

45
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,820
Their grievances were predictable.

46
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,660
Since that's the case,

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,140
I shall

48
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,220
make their division

49
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,660
more absolute.

50
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,020
Your Majesty,

51
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,060
General Fengyun requests an audience.

52
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,980
(Xiao Mansion)

53
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,260
Your wedding gown
was rushed to completion.

54
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,220
It just arrived.

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,579
Quickly try it on.

56
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,820
If it doesn't fit,

57
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,700
we'll alter it.

58
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,300
Come on.

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,940
Come.

60
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,420
The embroidery and fabric

61
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,540
are truly first-rate.

62
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,100
Huaijin is thoughtful.

63
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,420
But this dress looks so complicated.

64
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,060
How do I wear it?

65
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,500
Don't worry.

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,380
We'll help you.

67
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,380
Go try it.

68
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,540
Miss He looks stunning.

69
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,940
Huaijin chose well.

70
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,700
In Yaojing, these past years,

71
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,900
no bride's gown

72
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,380
could compare to

73
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,900
what you're wearing now.

74
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,740
Truly magnificent.

75
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,100
Rongwei.

76
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,980
Miss He.

77
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,340
Huaijin has returned.

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,340
Let him try his attire alone.

79
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,180
Right now,

80
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,780
he shouldn't see
the bride's full ensemble.

81
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,060
He's returned with an imperial edict.

82
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,220
Xiao Jue.

83
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,580
Is anything wrong?

84
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,780
He Yan, heed the decree.

85
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,980
His Majesty

86
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,820
decrees that

87
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,180
He Yan,

88
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,260
a scholar and warrior,

89
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,580
has done great feats,

90
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,060
protecting Jiyang,

91
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,140
defending Rundu,

92
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,860
and repelling Wutuo.

93
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,580
For her contributions,

94
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,620
she is granted
the Mansion of General Feihong.

95
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,500
May she continue
exceeding my expectations

96
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,060
with tireless dedication

97
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,980
and loyalty.

98
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,340
- Thank...
- Another edict.

99
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,500
General Feihong,

100
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,220
He Yan,

101
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,620
has noble character

102
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,180
and dual expertise.

103
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,900
Lord Shijin's son,

104
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Chu Zhao, Vice Director

105
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,420
of the Secretariat,

106
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,260
has honorable bearing

107
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,860
and exceptional talent.

108
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,780
They are

109
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,220
a most fitting match.

110
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
By imperial decree,

111
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,980
the two shall wed

112
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,260
(Imperial Edict)
on a day

113
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,900
of good fortune.

114
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,620
That's all.

115
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,740
He Yan narrowly escaped death

116
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,620
to reclaim the General Feihong title.

117
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,020
Forcing her to abandon it

118
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,860
would erase

119
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,260
her very essence.

120
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,900
The Xiao Army

121
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,180
is my father's life's work

122
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,980
and remains my duty.

123
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,220
Let me let go.

124
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,340
Then I

125
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,860
cannot remain myself.

126
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,060
It seems

127
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,620
you've made your choice.

128
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,980
You left me no other choice.

129
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,020
I shall have you perform another task.

130
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,940
This marriage decree.

131
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,940
You shall personally deliver.

132
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,100
No,

133
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,980
I won't.

134
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,540
You are defying my order?

135
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,100
Please

136
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,500
punish me.

137
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,460
You...

138
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,340
Aren't you afraid of

139
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,940
dragging down your family?

140
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,780
If that's your order,

141
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,380
I obey.

142
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,100
What did you say?

143
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,180
Repeat that.

144
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,700
You broke plum branches

145
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,220
and made bridal attire for me.

146
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,540
In the end,

147
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,780

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,660
At ease.

195
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,060
Perfect timing.

196
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,420
She wants me to retract my decree,

197
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,420
but it's inappropriate.

198
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,500
Your Majesty,

199
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,780
I will cherish He Yan wholeheartedly

200
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,940
and make her understand my sincerity.

201
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,020
Given time...

202
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,020
This is unnecessary.

203
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,100
Your Majesty,

204
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,340
I know

205
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,420
you just want to prevent

206
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,780
a marriage between two military leaders.

207
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,580
I won't marry Xiao Jue.

208
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,180
But

209
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,500
I won't marry Chu Zhao either.

210
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,660
Outrageous!

211
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,940
Please calm your anger.

212
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,420
I

213
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,540
won't defy the decree,

214
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,020
but I refuse to settle.

215
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,060
If I can't spend my life
with the one I love,

216
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,180
I would rather

217
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,060
remain alone forever.

218
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,620
Please grant me.

219
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,820
Your Majesty,

220
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,860
if He Yan

221
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,940
refuses to marry Chu Zhao,

222
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,540
I implore you

223
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,900
to grant her

224
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,740
a choice.

225
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,300
Fine.

226
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,140
Have it your way.

227
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,340
I shall

228
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,460
take my leave.

229
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,460
(Have I)

230
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,180
(truly erred?)

231
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,820
Were you involved in

232
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
this arranged marriage?

233
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,820
Yes.

234
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,620
I requested it.

235
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,900
But Xiao Jue still dumped you.

236
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,780
You're an intelligent man.

237
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,020
You should understand

238
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,460
that decree cannot constrain me.

239
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,260
We were never

240
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,420
in the cards.

241
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
There's no future

242
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,540
for you two.

243
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,100
Why not turn your eyes to me?

244
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,220
Can you not tell

245
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,580
my heart is as true as his?

246
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,700
That's not love.

247
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,900
It was all a calculated game.

248
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,780
Should I cut open my heart?

249
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,140
Is a calculated heart any less worthy?

250
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,260
Tell me!

251
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,500
You're insane!

252
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,780
How much ambition is hidden

253
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,620
behind the love you speak of?

254
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,620
Was every single thing you did

255
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,060
truly only for me?

256
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,860
Stop deluding yourself, Chu Zhao.

257
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,380
I'm just

258
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,540
a pretty excuse for your ambition.

259
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,340
You know what?

260
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,700
You're becoming another Xu Jingfu.

261
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,420
(Chu Mansion)

262
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,660
Miss Xu, your meal is served.

263
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,820
Chu Zhao had you send these

264
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,740
for me to eat?

265
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,700
You're overthinking, Miss Xu.

266
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,260
Our young master

267
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,260
is extremely busy.

268
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,980
He has no time to care about it.

269
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,420
You wretched maid.

270
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,580
You!

271
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,540
Still acting high and mighty?

272
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,620
Listen up.

273
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,060
His Majesty has decreed

274
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,580
a marriage between our young master

275
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,460
and General Feihong.

276
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,060
Abandon your foolish hopes.

277
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,100
What did you say?

278
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,020
Chu Zhao is marrying He Yan?

279
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,580
Y-Yes.

280
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,180
The news has spread everywhere.

281
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,700
No way.

282
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,300
Chu Zhao,

283
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,900
you won't get your way.

284
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,820
Have you met with Miss He?

285
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,740
How about

286
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,060
your marriage?

287
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,500
There will be no marriage.

288
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,980
Don't bring it up.

289
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,780
I heard about
your imperial marriage decree

290
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,460
and came specially to congratulate you.

291
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,340
Why the haste, Mr. Chu?

292
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,300
I once thought

293
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,980
only fools like me

294
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,300
would cling to unrequited feelings,

295
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,140
be used by others

296
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,820
and then discarded like trash.

297
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,500
I never imagined

298
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,980
that a shrewd man

299
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,980
like you could also

300
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,220
experience unrequited desires.

301
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,780
Miss Xu,

302
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,940
if you continue this outburst,

303
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,700
I'll have to ask you to leave.

304
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,820
If you're done venting,

305
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,380
I'll arrange your return.

306
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,180
Return?

307
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,220
Return where?

308
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,100
You killed my father.

309
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,140
My family home is sealed.

310
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,220
I have neither a home nor a father.

311
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,820
Even the lowest servants
look down on me.

312
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,420
You tell me to return.

313
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,300
Tell me where I should go.

314
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,580
Where should I go? Tell me.

315
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,420
Tell me!

316
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,820
Miss Xu.

317
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,340
What?

318
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,780
You think yourself the greatest victim?

319
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,980
What of those sold into slavery
and forced to grovel?

320
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,220
Or those displaced
and begging on the streets?

321
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,060
Your father's death

322
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,780
was nothing but his deserved punishment.

323
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,980
You still live in luxury.

324
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,660
Only deprived of your former status.

325
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
And you're whining now?

326
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,700
You deceived me,

327
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,380
betrayed me,

328
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,780
and dumped me.

329
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,340
But I'd let it all slide.

330
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,980
How could you betray my father?

331
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,500
He may have been a monster to the world,

332
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,660
but he never did you any harm.

333
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,020
In this situation,

334
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,580
you still act superior.

335
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,180
I don't know if this is pitiful

336
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,860
or laughable.

337
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,220
Chu Zhao.

Guards!

345
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,180
Go fetch a physician. Hurry!

346
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,020
Yes.

347
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,580
Yingxiang.

348
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,020
It's okay, Yingxiang.

349
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,140
It's okay. Don't worry, Yingxiang.

350
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,980
You will be okay.

351
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,460
I

352
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,220
don't fear.

353
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,260
I only fear

354
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,940
in the world,

355
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,620
you'll end up alone.

356
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,380
From now on,

357
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,140
stop pushing yourself so hard.

358
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,780
Spare...

359

Spare yourself.
