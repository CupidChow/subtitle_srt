=Episode 24=

23
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,890
I heard Wutuo has attacked Huayuan.

24
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,730
Really?

25
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,931
Wutuo just got defeat in Jiyang.

26
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:53,051
They attacked Huayuan?

27
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,491
It's true.

28
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:56,810
Someone just reported it to Mr. Shen,

29
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:57,931
and I overheard it.

30
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,730
(Wutuo attacked Huayuan?)

31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,971
(First Jiyang, now Huayuan.)

32
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,051
(Wutuo)

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,331
(seems to be probing)

34
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:07,691
(our military capabilities.)

35
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,530
(They might plan to start a war.)

36
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,810
General Feihong's leading

37
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,970
the troops to Huayuan.

38
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,891
He'll surely crush

39
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,011
those Wutuo soldiers!

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,570
Definitely.

41
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,611
(He Rufei is going to Huayuan?)

42
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:27,912
(Yezhou Garrison)

43
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:30,931
What a spectacle!

44
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,370
Who are they receiving?

45
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:35,880
Fine.

46
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,370
You'll find out soon.

47
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,211
Been in the army so long,

48
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,171
surely you've heard of Yan He?

49
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,331
A classmate of Huaijin and me.

50
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:51,688
Look!

51
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:53,250
Now he acts all dignified.

52
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:03,570
(Exam Paper, C)

53
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,291
Why am I second from last again?

54
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,891
Why am I still last?

55
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:10,248
(Exam Paper, D)

56
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,650
Didn't we agree

57
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,771
you'd let me win once?

58
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:14,810
First,

59
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,291
I never agreed.

60
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,211
Second,

61
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:18,051
am I

62
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,530
much better than you?

63
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:20,968
Well...

64
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,810
- I...
- Look!

65
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,850
This...

66
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,810
Who are you?

67
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,456
- The Second.
- The one you beat.

68
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,611
I'm Yan He.

69
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:40,931
In the next exam,

70
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,491
I'll take first place!

71
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,370
How dare he say so?

72
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,731
Xiao Huaijin,

73
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:48,130
mark my words!

74
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:50,690
Let's wait and see.

75
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,370
Oh my.

76
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:12,051
(Yan He, Wei Dynasty General)

77
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:12,611
Hello.

78
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:13,771
Long time no see.

79
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:15,130
General Fengyun.

80
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,491
Long time no see.

81
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,851
It's been many years,

82
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,291
they are still at odds?

83
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:36,851
Chu Zhao?

84
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,010
Came to award someone?

85
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,171
Right.

86
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,210
You have

87
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,171
defended Jiyang.

88
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:51,731
He Yan, heed the decree!

89
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,291
Yezhou Garrison He Yan,

90
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:05,832
you have exceptional loyalty

91
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:06,971
and combat prowess.

92
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:09,450
Your repeated victories against Wutuo

93
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,770
have pleased me.

94
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:12,570
Hereby you are promoted

95
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,890
to be General Wu'an.

96
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,171
General Wu'an.

97
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:23,810
I, He Yan,

98
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:24,931
appreciate it.

99
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,611
Xiao Jue, you've defended Jiyang,

100
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,010
but disobeyed orders

101
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,171
and got absent.

102
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:42,051
By the imperial decree,

103
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:43,651
you shall be caned

104
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,051
by 20 strikes.

105
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:48,690
(We share the same merits.)

106
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,770
(I got the reward,)

107
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,491
(yet Xiao Jue got punishment.)

108
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,690
(This is to)

109
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,851
(drive a wedge between us.)

110
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:55,531
Commander won the battle!

111
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,531
Why punish him?

112
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:57,330
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

113
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,931
This is

114
00:05:57,931 --> 00:05:58,851
unfair!

115
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,130
Punish the general,

116
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,648
what for?

117
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,330
Exactly!

118
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:02,051
He defended

119
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:02,890
Jiyang too!

120
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,010
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

121
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:06,491
Silence!

122
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,810
If order-breakers go unpunished,

123
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:13,570
and others will follow suit,

124
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,016
where's the discipline?

125
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:25,731
I

126
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,611
accept it.

127
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,171
Good, Xiao Huaijin.

128
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,370
You uphold your family's honor.

129
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,531
Then I'll carry out the punishment.

130
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,491
Chu Zhao from the Ministry of War

131
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,651
will oversee it.

132
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,531
Seriously?

133
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:41,531
20 strikes

134
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,370
could kill him!

135
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:43,250
Back off.

136
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,370
20 strikes!

137
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,250
Exactly.

138
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:57,010
Punishment...

139
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,130
Why?

140
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:43,651
Yan Nanguang

141
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,411
shows no mercy at all.

142
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,091
Might be doing it for a private grudge.

143
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:10,731
Xiao Jue.

144
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,651
Your merits offset faults.

145
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:13,690
Remember,

146
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:14,531
never again.

147
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,411
I

148
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,330
get it.

149
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:43,592
Huaijin.

150
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:49,810
Congratulations!

151
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,850
You petitioned for my promotion?

152
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,512
Right.

153
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:59,450
You did very well.

154
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:00,411
This reward

155
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,610
is what you deserve.

156
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:04,891
I left Yezhou Garrison
without permission too.

157
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:06,651
Regarding the discipline,

158
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,970
I am also guilty.

159
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:12,011
It was the Chancellor

160
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:13,730
who advised His Majesty

161
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,011
to offer fair rewards and punishments.

162
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,850
Commander Xiao

163
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:20,011
is a regional commander,

164
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,690
should lead by example

165
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,610
and set the standard,

166
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,291
so should take this minor punishment.

167
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,371
(As expected,)

168
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:31,730
(Xu Jingfu is behind all this.)

169
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:37,931
In that case,

170
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,490
convey my thanks to Chancellor Xu.

171
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,664
Huaijin.

172
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,171
Let me tell you,

173
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:32,891
if I hurt you

174
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,570
carelessly,

175
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:35,610
forgive me.

176
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,730
Why are you silent?

177
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,730
Are you displeased with me?

178
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:20,651
How about

179
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,251
I find someone else

180
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:23,090
to apply medicine?

181
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,210
Like

182
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,280
He Yan?

183
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,291
Shut up!

184
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,090
You ungrateful guy!

185
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:39,411
Wait a moment.

186
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:40,810
I'll go check

187
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,371
the decoction.

188
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,272
(Xiao)

189
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:36,171
Being publicly caned

190
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:38,210
must have humiliated you.

191
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:39,931
Chancellor Xu

192
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:40,970
deliberately used

193
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,090
such a trick

194
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:42,690
to annoy you.

195
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,051
Don't blame it on

196
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:45,011
Miss He.

197
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:46,850
She disguising as a man

198
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,850
remains a hidden danger.

199
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,810
If it gets exposed,

200
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,131
she would be punished.

201
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,490
Now she gets promoted,

202
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,730
I wonder if it's blessing.

203
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:05,051
You, Yan Nanguang!

204
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,131
Why come here?

205
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,051
You hit him hard!

206
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,210
With so many eyes watching,

207
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,531
I can't show mercy publicly.

208
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,376
You!

209
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,291
Not my face!

210
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,330
Cold Xiao.

211
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:22,330
Sorry.

212
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,011
No need.

213
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,291
You were just doing your duty.

214
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:29,891
Don't be sorry.

215
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,144
Hey,

216
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,931
you came empty-handed?

217
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,891
I wanted to bring medicine,

218
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,011
but then realized

219
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,690
you are

220
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,251
here.

221
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,011
Why bother?

222
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,131
You two,

223
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,210
at Xianchang Academy,

224
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,210
were really at odds,

225
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,210
yet now seem quite close.

226
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,450
That's all

227
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,850
in the past.

228
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,610
Now we're all comrades.

229
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:51,592
Right?

230
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:52,651
Moreover,

231
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,251
I'm now a married man,

232
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,931
should be magnanimous.

233
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,371
Otherwise,

234
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,891
Chengxiu will nag me again.

235
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,810
We know your wife is expecting.

236
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:02,051
No need to tell us again.

237
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:04,210
I want the whole world to know

238
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,291
Chengxiu and I are

239
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,171
having a child!

240
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,490
Then on the battlefields,

241
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:08,970
stop acting recklessly.

242
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,371
Think about your family.

243
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,490
Of course.

244
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:12,771
Anyway,

245
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:13,891
His Majesty didn't pick me

246
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:15,090
to Huayuan,

247
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,051
but that He Rufei.

248
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:17,810
What?

249
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,891
Why He Rufei?

250
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,570
I'm tired.

251
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,651
You guys go out.

252
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:30,931
Take your medicine.

253
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,610
Let me tell you,

254
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:35,171
you were too harsh.

255
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,490
20 strikes!

256
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:37,970
Just plead for him.

257
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,090
Too many people there.

258
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,051
Has Feinu's message

259
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:50,024
arrived?

260
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,570
Commander.

261
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:53,291
After the Mingshui Battle,

262
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:53,891
Chu Zhao once

263
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,011
visited Que City.

264
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,651
Our agents discovered

265
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:58,570
he made contact with Chai Anxi.

266
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,411
How about before that?

267
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,690
Before that,

268
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:02,651
we detected

269
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,291
nothing on Chu Zhao.

270
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,531
The Mingshui Battle

271
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,171
might have nothing to him.

272
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:10,690
And He Rufei?

273
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:12,171
He Rufei

274
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,090
and Xu Jingfu

275
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,051
had no interactions

276
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:15,371
before Mingshui Battle.

277
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,531
But after the Mingshui Battle started,

278
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:18,490
the two of them

279
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,610
grew close.

280
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,011
But before the Battle,

281
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:22,690
Chancellor Xu once

282
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:24,610
visited Yuhua Temple

283
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,490
to meet the lady from He family,

284
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:27,810
He Rufei's sister.

285
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,490
I wonder

286
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,210
what he is up to.

287
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:38,651
Now He Rufei's deployed to Huayuan,

288
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:41,371
Mingshui Battle's tragedy

289
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:42,090
might repeat.

290
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,771
Send a message to Feinu.

291
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,251
Tell him to

292
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,730
keep watching He Rufei.

293
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,032
Understood.

294
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:06,690
Why are you here?

295
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:08,610
I parted from you

296
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:09,771
without thanking you.

297
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,291
I asked around

298
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,450
and knew you're here.

299
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:13,730
For what?

300
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,570
For you saved me in Jiyang!

301
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,651
I still remember it.

302
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,570
It was nothing.

303
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:20,531
Not at all.

304
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,011
At present, in the imperial court,

305
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,171
many fear and resent Xiao Jue.

306
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,570
His future is unclear.

307
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,291
If anything occurs,

308
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,690
you might be implicated.

309
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,210
Though General Wu'an's post
holds low rank,

310
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,810
it allows you

311
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:39,570
to go wherever you want

312
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:41,131
and have broader options.

313
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,651
Isn't it good?

314
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,330
Promotion is undoubtedly favorable.

315
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,051
I should be pleased.

316
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:53,171
Mr. He,

317
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,330
have you ever considered

318
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,011
that to achieve greatness,

319
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,450
you needn't

320
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,931
limit yourself to Yezhou?

321
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,770
Would you like to see the world

322
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,571
and venture into it

323
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:12,050
with me?

324
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,131
I appreciate it, Mr. Chu.

325
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:31,131
Perhaps one day,

326
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:33,131
I'll leave the Yezhou Garrison.

327
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,970
That's because

328
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,250
I need to do

329
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,530
what I must do,

330
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:39,770
but not Yezhou's harsh conditions.

331
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:43,210
Is that all?

332
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:45,210
Not because of

333
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:46,891
someone?

334
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,770
In this world,

335
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,651
everything can change.

336
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,450
No one

337
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,891
can stay by anyone's side forever.

338
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,010
I'm simply doing

339
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:05,450
what I want.

340
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,040
Mr. Chu.

341
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,160
It's getting late.

342
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,536
See you.

343
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,032
Commander.

344
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:37,928
What is it?

345
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,112
General Feihong

346
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,450
won the Huayuan Battle.

347
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,530
He Rufei has

348
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,450
so many soldiers.

349
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,210
Even a child could've

350
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,010
won.

351
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,171
Any other updates?

352
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:51,010
The battle was won,

353
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:52,490
but seven deputy generals

354
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:54,210
under General Feihong died.

355
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:55,931
So,

356
00:18:56,651 --> 00:18:57,931
he won the Huayuan Battle

357
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,450
in a tragic way?

358
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:00,970
Many people died,

359
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,411
even including

360
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:04,970
seven deputy generals?

361
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:07,651
Doesn't this feel familiar?

362
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,171
The Huayuan Battle

363
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,530
mirrors

364
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,010
the Mingshui Battle's trajectory.

365
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,931
Though appearing flawless,

366
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,851
it's full of suspicions.

367
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,376
Exactly.

368
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,091
I've never met them,

369
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:22,010
but Fuyue Army's seven deputy generals

370
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:22,811
were legendary.

371
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,450
Each was capable,

372
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,290
yet all died on the battlefield?

373
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,010
There's no such thing

374
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,931
as coincidence here.

375
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,851
Did He Rufei

376
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,250
murder them

377
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,730
on purpose?

378
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,331
In that case,

379
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:37,131
what for?

380
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,091
He must

381
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:41,171
do it for

382
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,611
hiding something.

383
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,010
(So,)

384
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,891
(this He Rufei is)

385
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,331
(the schemer)

386
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:50,770
(from the Mingshui Battle.)

387
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,200
Where's He Yan?

388
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,488
(Maningbu, Wutuo Chancellor)

389
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,891
You're late.

390
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,371
Three penalty drinks.

391
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,530
I need to act in discretion,

392
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,970
hence being cautious

393
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:31,931
delays me.

394
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,450
I beg your forgiveness.

395
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,250
Don't be.

396
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,984
Take a seat.

397
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:38,888
Here.

398
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,371
I heard, at the Huayuan Battle,

399
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,770
your emperor

400
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,651
sent you to lead the troops.

401
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:48,891
You are quite

402
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:50,290
well-informed.

403
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:52,611
You asked me to come

404
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:54,091
not merely for drinks,

405
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:55,250
right?

406
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,010
Since we

407
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,250
are old acquaintances,

408
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:00,690
so I'll be direct.

409
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,411
I must win

410
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:04,290
the Huayuan Battle.

411
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,931
We got defeated in Jiyang,

412
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:10,730
and need this victory

413
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,730
to restore morale.

414
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,611
I'd ask you to let us

415
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:14,371
win once.

416
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:15,811
Losing Huayuan

417
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,490
would leave me

418
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,131
unable to face our king.

419
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,250
How about

420
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,411
compensate by exchanging Rundu

421
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:24,651
for Huayuan?

422
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:26,931
Rundu?

423
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:29,091
Rundu is the gateway

424
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:30,010
to Yaojing,

425
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,171
more crucial than Huayuan.

426
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,331
Do you mean it?

427
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:41,851
This is...

428
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,091
(Rundu Military Defense Map)

429
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:46,891
Rundu Military Defense Map?

430
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,091
General Li Kuang defending Rundu

431
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,450
is one of the Eight Warriors
from the Fuyue Army.

432
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,290
Once Wutuo attacks Rundu

433
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,530
and he's overwhelmed,

434
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,250
he'll request aid from the Fuyue Army.

435
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,450
And I

436
00:21:57,811 --> 00:21:59,450
will never aid him.

437
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:01,530
To show my sincerity,

438
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:02,931
once war breaks out in Huayuan,

439
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:04,371
I'm willing to sacrifice

440
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,490
the lives
of other seven deputy generals.

441
00:22:08,931 --> 00:22:09,891
The Eight Warriors

442
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:11,811
and Rundu city,

443
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,050
in exchange for Huayuan.

444
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,811
What a bargain!

445
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,131
Since you show such sincerity,

446
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:23,891
I shall

447
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:25,530
do you a favor.

448
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:26,091
Good.

449
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,811
Surprise,

450
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,050
He Yan?

451
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,050
All seven of your warriors

452
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,690
have died in Huayuan.

453
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:35,720
Rest assured.

454
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,010
The remaining Li Kuang

455
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:39,891
won't escape either.

456
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,091
Once he's gone,

457
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,651
you will never

458
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:49,571
see hope again.

459
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,730
Did you sneak food

460
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:54,010
last night?

461
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,091
That must be Wang Ba!

462
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:57,371
Why would I do so?

463
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:58,411
Anyway,

464
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,411
that General Feihong

465
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,371
is utterly useless.

466
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:03,450
- He.
- He.

467
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:04,611
Congratulations!

468
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:06,611
He

469
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:07,571
won't stop here.

470
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,131
You are brave and astute,

471
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,530
must achieve something big.

472
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,488
Jiang Jiao.

473
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:13,611
What did you say

474
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,730
about General Feihong?

475
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:17,331
General Feihong?

476
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,171
All seven men he led

477
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,371
died on the battlefield.

478
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,131
He's not a General at all!

479
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,611
Seven Warriors

480
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:29,490
died on the battlefield?

481
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:17,171
(As)

482
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:18,210
(General Feihong's plan),

483
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,730
we'd push them back

484
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:20,730
through the valley

485
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,371
and watch them flee.

486
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,210
How pleasant!

487
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,530
Right!

488
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,490
(All soldiers!)

489
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,131
Yes!

490
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,250
Today's battle

491
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,730
is fought for Wei,

492
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,970
and peace across the land!

493
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,651
Be fearless of death!

494
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,210
Return only victorious!

495
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,851
Never

496
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,131
dishonor our Fuyue Army's name!

497
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,050
Be fearless of death!

498
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:52,730
Return only victorious!

499
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,290
(Be fearless of death!)

500
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:56,091
(Return only victorious!)

501
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,891
(Be fearless of death!)

502
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,730
(Return only victorious!)

503
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:31,411
Seven Warriors

504
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,210
were important to you.

505
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,690
Now that they died,

506
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:37,770
you must be in pain.

507
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,450
However, you shall not be punished,

508
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,131
but He Rufei.

509
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:46,010
He Rufei!

510
00:26:48,651 --> 00:26:50,010
I will

511
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,690
revenge you!

512
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:13,960
Let me.

513
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,331
My seven men died.

514
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:11,171
I can't kill the murderer for them,

515
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,371
nor pay tribute to them.

516
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:21,490
And I can't even shed tears.

517
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,131
If not for me,

518
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:26,970
they wouldn't have died!

519
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,450
This pain

520
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:36,171
constantly reminds me

521
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,171
I must

522
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:42,690
make this vengeance.

523
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,450
Both my parents passed away,

524
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:57,010
I had no time to mourn properly.

525
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,450
Everyone accused me

526
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,450
of being heartless and cold.

527
00:29:03,891 --> 00:29:05,571
But every time I don this armor,

528
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:07,891
every time I carry

529
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:10,010
the pouch made by my mother,

530
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:11,690
I realize

531
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,690
they've always been

532
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,730
in my heart.

533
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:26,091
You and I

534
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,411
always share similar experiences.

535
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,171
Be it our pasts

536
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:34,571
or present,

537
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,530
your pains

538
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,411
resonate within me.

539
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:48,490
It was you...

540
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,690
Because of you,

541
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:57,730
I choose to believe.

542
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:00,891
General Fengyun Xiao Jue,

543
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,851
immediately go to Peidu
to meet His Majesty.

544
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:18,952
(Xiao)

545
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:23,730
Commander, take care.

546
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:27,210
Won't you come with me?

547
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,490
I won't go.

548
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,411
Wait for me at Yezhou Garrison.

549
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:34,970
When I return,

550
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,131
I have things to tell you.

551
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:28,970
This is soaked

552
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,290
with Commander Xiao's blood.

553
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,131
I've been scrubbing it for long.

554
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,250
That General Yan He

555
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:35,450
is truly ruthless.

556
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,490
Though he's dashing,

557
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,530
quite accomplished for his age.

558
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:44,931
He's dashing, but he's been married.

559
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,371
Stop dreaming.

560
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:48,931
I'm not dreaming.

561
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:51,171
My ambitions remain unfulfilled.

562
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:53,411
I have no time for that.

563
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,450
I'm not as ambitious as you.

564
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,131
I'm thinking of a lady.

565
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:16,931
Who is she?

566
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,010
She's determined

567
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:20,450
with a temper.

568
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:23,411
What?

569
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,210
Yet she's wise,

570
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:26,371
possessing

571
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,290
a compassionate heart.

572
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:31,690
That's all?

573
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,331
She's never hypocritical,

574
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:37,210
always genuine with others.

575
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,690
This is why she captivates me.

576
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:56,187
(Wei's Palace, Cheng'an Hall)

577
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,050
Xiao,

578
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,730
you are being hesitant,

579
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,210
not quite

580
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,131
your style.

581
00:33:42,091 --> 00:33:43,290
You are a strategy master,

582
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:44,424
so I have to

583
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:46,131
be cautious

584
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:47,690
in my actions.

585
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:49,651
You are

586
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:51,010
really flattering me.

587
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:52,611
If I am

588
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:55,210
really a strategy master,

589
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,571
the borders

590
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,851
wouldn't be in such turmoil

591
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:01,530
and our people tormented.

592
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,291
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:11,130
I deserve punishment.

594
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,610
I'm merely reflecting,

595
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,331
not blaming you.

596
00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:15,848
Sit down.

597
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,130
Our game is still going.

598
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,650
After taking 20 strikes,

599
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:32,650
you must be injured.

600
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,731
I'm

601
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:37,610
mostly healed.

602
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:39,490
Thank you for your concern.

603
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:42,090
Being caned

604
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,931
20 strikes publicly,

605
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,650
do you think

606
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,891
I'm unfair?

607
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,010
I wouldn't dare.

608
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:54,291
I deserved punishment

609
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,130
for being absent in my post.

610
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:00,891
On the one hand,

611
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,610
as a commander,

612
00:35:03,211 --> 00:35:04,691
you violated military discipline,

613
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:05,731
shall be punished

614
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:06,888
to restore discipline.

615
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,211
On the other hand,

616
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:10,811
you risked your life
to achieve great feats,

617
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:12,731
yet I had to punish you.

618
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:13,970
Thus,

619
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,970
I owe it to you,

620
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:18,891
and seek to compensate you.

621
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:35,650
Don't be.

622
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,570
I don't deserve it.

623
00:35:41,211 --> 00:35:41,736
However,

624
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:44,291
I do have something to report.

625
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:52,022
(Lanhui Pavilion)

626
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,192
Mister.

627
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:10,931
Is

628
00:36:11,411 --> 00:36:12,251
His Majesty asleep?

629
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:13,331
Not yet.

630
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,211
His Majesty and General Xiao

631
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,371
are in a chess game.

632
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,371
Then please inform His Majesty

633
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,731
that I am here

634
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,291
to beg for punishment.

635
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:24,170
His Majesty said,

636
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:25,970
before the game concludes,

637
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:27,771
no disturbances shall be permitted.

638
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,851
Then I shall wait here.

639
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,490
I see.

640
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:47,251
This outcome truly surprised me.

641
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,570
This isn't merely complicated,

642
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:53,130
could even be called

643
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,170
extraordinary.

644
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:56,456
Your Majesty.

645
00:36:58,970 --> 00:36:59,650
Rest assured.

646
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,291
I keep my word.

647
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,970
Having granted your request,

648
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,211
I shall not regret.

649
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:14,811
I

650
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,170
appreciate it.

651
00:37:20,892 --> 00:37:24,571
(Lanhui Pavilion)

652
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,360
(Lanhui Pavilion)

653
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,291
General He.

654
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,170
Long time no see.

655
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:58,530
Indeed.

656
00:37:59,211 --> 00:37:59,851
General Xiao,

657
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,731
I heard you were punished.

658
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:03,811
How are you

659
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,130
now?

660
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,170
Better than you.

661
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:09,320
After all,

662
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:11,450
you rushed here to claim merits,

663
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,811
yet spent the night chilled outside.

664
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,970
You might catch cold.

665
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:18,530
General Xiao,

666
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,411
this joke

667
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,251
isn't amusing.

668
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,251
Indeed, compared to

669
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:27,731
your performance at Huayuan Battle.

670
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:29,411
Xiao Jue.

671
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,251
Don't try to

672
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,010
slander me here.

673
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:35,931
I've heard,

674
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:37,331
in the Huayuan Battle,

675
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,450
you're late for reinforcements

676
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,490
somehow.

677
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,490
This reminds me of

678
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:46,291
your late arrival

679
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:50,411
at the Mingshui Battle as well.

680
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,090
I wonder if you deserve your title,

681
00:38:53,691 --> 00:38:55,411
General Feihong?

682
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:58,650
Or perhaps

683
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,291
there's some secret?

684
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,570
Xiao Jue!

685
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,291
Heed the imperial decree!

686
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,490
For crushing the Wutuo Army at Huayuan

687
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,090
and returning victorious,

688
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,691
General Feihong,

689
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:20,851
you've performed well,

690
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,291
and pleased me.

691
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,811
Considering your arduous journey

692
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,090
and the strain of travel,

693
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,130
so court formalities are waived.

694
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:29,891
Return promptly to camp

695
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,450
and prepare the troops.

696
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:35,970
I want to see His Majesty!

697
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,650
His Majesty is asleep.

698
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:41,731
I

699
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,291
accept it.

700
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,771
His Majesty truly concerns you.

701
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:54,851
Please don't

702
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:56,450
let His Majesty down

703
00:39:58,891 --> 00:39:59,970
and return to your camp

704
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,530
soon.

705
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:16,291
(Yezhou Huayuan)

706
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,211
Li Kuang is my remaining subordinate.

707
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:20,211
He Rufei will certainly eliminate him.

708
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:21,970
If Rundu faces danger,

709
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:24,090
He Rufei won't send reinforcement.

710
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,010
By that time,

711
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,050
it'll be too late.

712
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,371
(Rundu)
Rundu is defended by Li Kuang

713
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,650
and is a military stronghold.

714
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:35,211
I must go there.

715
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:10,931
(I won't let Li Kuang die.)

716
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:13,450
(Nor will I let Rundu fall.)

717
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:27,944

to aid the Rundu crisis.)
