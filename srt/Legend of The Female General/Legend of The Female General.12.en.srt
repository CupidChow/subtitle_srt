23
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:02,991
You're awake.

24
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:06,911
How do you feel? Feeling better?

25
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:09,631
Thank you for your concern.

26
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:11,240
I feel better now.

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,112
By the way,

28
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:13,471
what's your name?

29
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,552
My name is Hu Yuanzhong.

30
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:16,751
All these years,

31
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:18,392
I've made my living by hunting.

32
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:19,992
Thank you for saving me.

33
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,152
Stay still.

34
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,791
Your wound might reopen otherwise.

35
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:24,592
Well,

36
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:26,312
let me apply the medicine.

37
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:28,152
The oral medication isn't ready yet.

38
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:30,712
Cheng Lisu is always so slow.

39
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:32,392
No need.

40
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:34,112
I can do it myself.

41
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,071
Miss Song.

42
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:38,671
You're a lady. This isn't proper.

43
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,592
I'm a man. Let me do this.

44
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:43,392
Well,

45
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,791
I'll go hurry Cheng Lisu.

46
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,312
Okay.

47
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,832
Thank you, sir.

48
00:02:58,911 --> 00:02:59,471
No problem.

49
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,951
Judging by your attire,
you don't seem to be from Wei.

50
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:14,432
I'm from Liehe.

51
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:16,071
However,

52
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,272
I left the Liehe tribe

53
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:18,351
many years ago.

54
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:20,992
You're an experienced hunter.

55
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:21,832
Why did you

56
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:23,152
go out in such harsh winds?

57
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:26,032
My wife

58
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:27,751
just passed away.

59
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:30,071
I miss her terribly,

60
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,791
so I visited her grave,

61
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:32,832
braving the winds.

62
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:35,832
I notice many red rashes

63
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,152
on your hands.

64
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:38,392
I'll ask Taotao

65
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,231
to prepare medicine?

66
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:42,272
No need.

67
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,312
Poisonous weeds hurt my hands

68
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:46,191
when I climbed up the hill.

69
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:47,191
They'll heal soon.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,511
Alright then.

71
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:06,632
Medicine's ready.

72
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,751
Thank you.

73
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:13,552
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:14,231
Are you okay?

75
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:15,071
Are you hurt?

76
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:16,192
Give it to me.

77
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,192
Liehe's characters.

78
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:27,671
My late wife wrote it.

79
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:30,032
It's a love poem in the Liehe tribe.

80
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:33,671
My apologies.

81
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:36,231
I don't know it's your wife's stuff.
I was just curious.

82
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,832
You're not mad, are you?

83
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:46,184
What's wrong?

84
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:48,311
He.

85
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:49,712
When his injuries heal,

86
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:50,832
he'll leave naturally.

87
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:52,592
Stop being jealous.

88
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:23,152
He.

89
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:24,351
Miss Song.

90
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:27,871
My apologies.

91
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,032
I was practicing archery
and accidentally missed.

92
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:30,632
Are you okay?

93
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:31,871
He.

94
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,832
I know you dislike Hu Yuanzhong.

95
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:35,911
But he's just a patient.

96
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:37,832
Your repeated targeting of him

97
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,592
has gone too far.

98
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:41,832
It's fine.

99
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:42,712
I guess

100
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,152
he was joking with me.

101
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:45,911
I'm fine

102
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:46,752
and uninjured.

103
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:49,111
If this happens again,

104
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:50,871
I'll get angry with you.

105
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,029
Got it.

106
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:53,192
Excuse me,

107
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:54,512
I'll take my leave now.

108
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:09,471
Stop!

109
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:14,192
Oh, no.

110
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:14,952
It's a trap.

111
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,592
I didn't kill him!

112
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,072
A man in black

113
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:22,111
acted strange.

114
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:23,072
I wounded him,

115
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:23,952
but I didn't

116
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:24,991
kill Instructor Ma.

117
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,431
Instructor Ma
must've been killed earlier.

118
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:28,431
The killer

119
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:29,671
intended to frame me.

120
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:30,671
Fine.

121
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,032
I'll give you a chance to explain.

122
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,712
I suspect the killer

123
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:36,991
is Hu Yuanzhong.

124
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:40,712
He's from Liehe.

125
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:42,072
The Liehe tribe

126
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:43,072
is forested,

127
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:44,392
dark, and damp

128
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,072
all year round.

129
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:48,272
The Liehe tribe uses

130
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:49,952
distinctively designed scimitars.

131
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,152
(Their soldiers)

132
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:52,392
(used that kind of weapon,)

133
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,072
(making them develop rashes)

134
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:54,991
(on their hands.)

135
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,272
Hu Yuanzhong

136
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:57,952
claims to be a hunter.

137
00:07:58,272 --> 00:07:58,871
Typically,

138
00:07:59,111 --> 00:07:59,712
hunters

139
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:01,231
don't use scimitars often.

140
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:02,512
So, why

141
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:04,752
are there the same rashes on his hands?

142
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:07,592
Moreover,

143
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,072
he said he missed his deceased wife,

144
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,032
yet he secretly

145
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,871
lusts after Miss Song's beauty.

146
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:17,471
Do you have solid evidence?

147
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,832
He carries a note on him,

148
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:22,512
claiming it's a poem
in Liehe's language from his wife.

149
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:24,272
But I believe

150
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:25,471
it's not that simple.

151
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:27,431
Let's find someone

152
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,351
fluent in Liehe's language
to decipher it.

153
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:30,471
Also,

154
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:31,832
during the earlier fight,

155
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,071
I struck his chest

156
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:34,071
with a bamboo pole.

157
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:35,632
You can have someone check

158
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,071
if he went out tonight

159
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:38,152
and if he

160
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:39,032
has fresh injuries.

161
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:42,671
Sir.

162
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:44,272
From Hai hour to Zi hour,

163
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:45,392
I was on patrol duty.

164
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:48,352
The light in Hu Yuanzhong's room
is out at Hai hour,

165
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:49,512
and he didn't go out.

166
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:50,536
Go.

167
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:51,711
Bring Hu Yuanzhong here.

168
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:52,552
Yes.

169
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:03,911
Sir. Hu Yuanzhong is here.

170
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:08,311
Sir.

171
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:10,512
Strip his clothes.

172
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:14,112
You...

173
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:14,664
Stop it!

174
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:16,791
Stop this!

175
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:17,711
Stop!

176
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,032
Sir.

177
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:19,752
May I know why?

178
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:32,752
By your account,

179
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:34,311
you beat him with a stick.

180
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,591
His body should get the bruise.

181
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,311
Yet as you saw,

182
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,272
no bruise on his right shoulder.

183
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,591
Mr. Shen.

184
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:42,632
He must have an accomplice here.

185
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,791
Maybe the accomplice

186
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,872
is in Yezhou Garrison.

187
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:45,791
Enough.

188
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:46,632
Mr. Shen,

189
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,392
you distrust me?

190
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:48,591
I can't trust your side

191
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:49,671
of the story.

192
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:51,992
We caught you red-handed.

193
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:52,951
Guards!

194
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:54,352
Take He Yan to the dungeon

195
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:56,032
and await judgment.

196
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:57,711
Imprison me if you must,

197
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,112
but you must

198
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:00,272
investigate this thoroughly,

199
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:01,431
or Yezhou Garrison

200
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:02,392
faces grave peril.

201
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,520
Take him away.

202
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:05,352
- Yes.
- Yes.

203
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:30,791
(Now that I'm imprisoned,)

204
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,000
(Yezhou Garrison has only recruits)

205
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,632
(who never go to war,)

206
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,191
(with Liehe infiltrators among them.)

207
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,656
(Enemies lurk in shadows.)

208
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:41,352
(I guess they tried so hard)

209
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:42,352
(to frame me)

210
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:43,951
(for something big.)

211
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:47,711
(Well,)

212
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:50,671
(if the news from Litai)

213
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:51,992
(is fabricated)

214
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:54,311
(to lure Xiao Jue away,)

215
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:56,472
(then the Yezhou Garrison)

216
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:57,992
(will be controlled)

217
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:00,272
(by the enemies.)

218
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:29,831
He.

219
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:31,272
He.

220
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:34,232
Miss Song.

221
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:45,032
Stay out of this.

222
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:45,736
Go back now.

223
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:47,392
I have medicine.

224
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:48,512
If I have to,

225
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,032
Cheng Lisu and I will drug them all.

226
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:51,232
We'll rescue you first.

227
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,791
Wait for Commander Xiao's return.

228
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:55,152
By the time he returns,

229
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,911
it'll probably be too late.

230
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:02,952
Can you give me the knockout drug?

231
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:10,831
May I

232
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:12,551
have your belt too?

233
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,392
In the coming days,

234
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:35,152
Mr. Cheng and you

235
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:36,591
must stay close

236
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:37,752
to Mr. Shen at all times.

237
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:38,831
He can protect you.

238
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,431
Help me deliver this to Mr. Shen.

239
00:12:47,752 --> 00:12:48,311
Alright.

240
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:51,272
Hurry back now.

241
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:08,911
He asked me to give you this.

242
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:22,632
Why aren't you saying anything?

243
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:23,911
He is so kind.

244
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:25,152
How could he possibly kill?

245
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:26,591
Release him immediately.

246
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,431
Mr. Shen,

247
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:29,288
killing a comrade is a grave crime.

248
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:30,671
Moreover, He Yan has no motive

249
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:31,591
to kill Ma Damei.

250
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:32,711
So, we should

251
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,951
carefully examine the corpse

252
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:35,632
to verify if there's
only one fatal wound

253
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:36,680
before making judgments.

254
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,191
Mr. Cheng makes a valid point.

255
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:41,272
It's late.

256
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:42,992
You two

257
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:44,632
should go back.

258
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:45,512
Guards!

259
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,232
Escort Mr. Cheng

260
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:48,191
and Miss Song back.

261
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:49,671
If anything happens to them,

262
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,112
I'll hold you accountable!

263
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,752
Understood.

264
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:54,280
Please.

265
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:00,911
Issue orders.

266
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,431
Tighten security and increase patrols.

267
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:05,032
Sentries in pairs,

268
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:06,232
rotating

269
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:07,352
in five watches

270
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:08,711
until dawn.

271
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:09,544
Yes.

272
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:40,512
He is still in prison.

273
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:42,591
We must figure out something.

274
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:44,632
The weather is getting cold.

275
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:45,791
The dungeon has nothing.

276
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:46,911
The cold might

277
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:48,472
make him sick.

278
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,671
Cut it out!

279
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:52,671
Go to find Mr. Shen

280
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,368
and plead for mercy.

281
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:55,951
Go!

282
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:56,711
Come on.

283
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,144
(Yezhou Garrison)

284
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:31,872
Who's there?

285
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:33,752
How dare you barge in!

286
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,272
I am General Rida Muzi

287
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:38,071
of the Liehe tribe!

288
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:39,431
I came today

289
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:41,752
to annihilate the Yezhou Garrison.

290
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:45,071
Rida Muzi?

291
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:48,992
Surrender obediently,

292
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:50,791
and I might consider

293
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:52,951
sparing your lives.

294
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:55,632
(He Yan didn't lie.)

295
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,272
Commander Xiao and his men are away.

296
00:15:57,671 --> 00:15:58,671
He remains imprisoned.

297
00:15:59,191 --> 00:15:59,951
What should we do?

298
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,752
Mai, shut up!

299
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:03,392
Don't let them hear.

300
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:00,671
I've waited long for you,

301
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:01,911
Lei Hou.

302
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,232
You used the same move

303
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,712
during the flag contest.

304
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,432
I remember it well.

305
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,631
You killed Instructor Ma and framed me.

306
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:12,071
You feigned illness

307
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,752
to stay for something.

308
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:14,912
Now,

309
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,311
you rush to assassinate me.

310
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:17,871
Is it because you know

311
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:19,712
you can't beat me?

312
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:29,232
Now, you finally realize

313
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:31,472
who's the number one
in the Yezhou Garrison?

314
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:38,311
Years ago,

315
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:40,631
General Feihong
defeated the Liehe tribe.

316
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:41,631
I thought

317
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:43,992
the Liehe tribe had
been thoroughly subdued.

318
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:46,432
When my army

319
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,512
crushes the Xiao Army,

320
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:51,032
it will be too late for you

321
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:52,912
to beg for your life.

322
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:54,591
The Yezhou Garrison

323
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,232
is defended by General Fengyun.

324
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:58,432
How dare you act so recklessly!

325
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:02,631
General Fengyun?

326
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:28,391
Commander.

327
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:29,311
Something's off.

328
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,111
General Fengyun

329
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:50,432
can't even protect himself now.

330
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:53,551
Don't expect him to save you.

331
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:55,016
Commander might be in danger.

332
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:56,631
These bandits

333
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:57,952
planned this all along.

334
00:18:58,752 --> 00:18:59,952
People die on the battlefield.

335
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:02,752
How can we be shackled by fear of death?

336
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:05,192
Soldiers of the Yezhou Garrison

337
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:06,992
would rather die in battle

338
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:08,791
than live in cowardice.

339
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:10,272
Xiao Army!

340
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:11,712
Go into formation!

341
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,551
- Yes!
- Yes!

342
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:16,512
Fine.

343
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:18,472
Since you all seek death,

344
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,791
we'll slaughter every one of you

345
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:22,472
and drown Yezhou Garrison in blood!

346
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:38,432
How dare you!

347
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:41,232
Who are you?

348
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:43,551
(Commander won't return soon.)

349
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:44,871
(Our troops)

350
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:46,791
(can't match Liehe's soldiers.)

351
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:48,551
(Fighting recklessly)

352
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:50,391
(would make us die.)

353
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:54,664
(Capturing their leader)

354
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:56,311
(will make things easier.)

355
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:01,071
I am He Yan,

356
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,351
the top warrior of Yezhou Garrison.

357
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,272
I hear Rida Muji, your brother,

358
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,232
is the former general.

359
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:12,551
He loved

360
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:14,232
to behead

361
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:14,992
captives

362
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:17,232
and tie them to his horse's tail.

363
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:19,192
Everywhere he went,

364
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:21,591
Wei people trembled in fear.

365
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:24,631
Guess what?

366
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:26,032
Before long,

367
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:27,912
General Feihong

368
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:30,032
effortlessly

369
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,272
chopped off his head.

370
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:34,311
Exactly!

371
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:35,831
General.

372
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:36,831
Why don't we

373
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:38,232
hold a duel here

374
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:40,472
today?

375
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,071
Who do you think you are

376
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:43,712
to challenge me?

377
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,591
You're so arrogant!

378
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:49,712
I just want

379
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:52,672
to see if I can chop off your head

380
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:53,952
and tie it

381
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:56,311
to my horse's tail too.

382
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:58,432
Very well.

383
00:20:58,631 --> 00:20:59,391
Teach him a lesson.

384
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:01,151
In that case,

385
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,111
I'll give you a quick death.

386
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:05,512
By the way,

387
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,232
what's your wager

388
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:09,391
for this duel?

389
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:10,591
Well,

390
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:12,391
let me propose first.

391
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:14,351
If I lose,

392
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:15,712
do with me as you will.

393
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:17,591
But if you lose,

394
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,432
you must call me Father.

395
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:41,432
Very funny.

396
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:43,912
It's surprising

397
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:45,391
to meet an interesting

398
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:46,752
and brave man like you.

399
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:50,672
You deserve to be the top one.

400
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,472
Very good.

401
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:54,032
I like to play

402
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:55,311
with a tough guy.

403
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:57,591
It will be enjoyable

404
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,311
to crush you.

405
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:02,071
Let's see

406
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:04,992
who will

407
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:07,232
be crushed first.

408
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:13,591
You're impressive.

409
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:16,311
Same to you.

410
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:25,351
Let's see how much longer you can last.

411
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:27,192
Your blood

412
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:29,591
is nearly drained dry.

413
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:51,512
In his condition,

414
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:52,631
he won't last long.

415
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:54,071
He's wounded.

416
00:24:54,712 --> 00:24:55,472
We can

417
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:56,952
fight together.

418
00:24:57,591 --> 00:24:58,952
Anyway, we can't watch him die.

419
00:24:59,112 --> 00:24:59,656
True.

420
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,551
Mr. Shen.

421
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:07,472
Should we attack?

422
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:08,752
- Charge!
- Charge!

423
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:13,912
Mr. Shen.

424
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:22,032
Are all people in the Central Plains

425
00:25:22,952 --> 00:25:24,472
as pretentious as you?

426
00:25:24,952 --> 00:25:25,952
Not exactly.

427
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:27,192
However,

428
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:29,831
I'm exceptionally good at pretense.

429
00:25:31,752 --> 00:25:33,631
You remind me of someone.

430
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:34,672
Who?

431
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,032
My unfortunate brother once said

432
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:39,551
that when He Rufei, the General Feihong,

433
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,871
took an arrow in battle,

434
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:43,752
he could take out the shaft

435
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,232
and keep fighting.

436
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:47,871
You

437
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:50,472
resemble him greatly.

438
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:53,311
You're wrong.

439
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:55,551
I'm not He Rufei,

440
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:58,232
nor do I resemble him.

441
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:02,631
But every warrior of Wei

442
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:04,912
shares my resolve.

443
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:06,712
As long as we're alive,

444
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:09,071
we'll fight to the end!

445
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:10,472
- Fight to the end!
- Fight to the end!

446
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:12,032
- Fight to the end!
- Fight to the end!

447
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:16,871
The Central Plains

448
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:19,631
breed countless generals
like General Feihong.

449
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:22,712
How many generals

450
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:24,351
can the Liehe tribe produce?

451
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:55,672
Is this all you've got?

452
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,111
You're quite weak.

453
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:16,831
(Xiao Jue will not)

454
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:18,192
(fall for a diversionary trap.)

455
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:19,831
(I have to buy more time.)

456
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,888
He!

457
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:26,831
Taotao!

458
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:44,992
Watch out, He!

459
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:45,631
Look out!

460
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,351
He Yan!

461
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:14,280
Are you okay?

462
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:17,032
I'm fine.

463
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:18,232
But He...

464
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:21,391
All soldiers!

465
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:22,391
- Yes!
- Yes!

466
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:24,311
Capture those men!

467
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:27,912
- Attack!
- Attack!

468
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:49,928
Nine Banners Battalion.

469
00:28:58,568 --> 00:28:59,272
He Yan.

470
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:11,032
Xiao Jue.

471
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:13,351
You're back.

472
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:19,272
(The messenger is suspicious.)

473
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:20,512
(That is)

474
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,752
(a path for Wutuo's invasion.)

475
00:29:22,432 --> 00:29:23,871
(They must be remnants from battle)

476
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:25,391
(in Que City, ambushing there.)

477
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:28,871
(They tried to divert us.)

478
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:30,992
(Yezhou Garrison is in danger.)

479
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:31,631
Commander,

480
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:32,871
what should we do?

481
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:34,792
You'll impersonate me.

482
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:35,831
We'll go with it.

483
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:39,192
(Feinu will lead the troop)

484
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:41,071
(to ambush Wutuo's main force.)

485
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:42,712
(Coordinate with him)

486
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:44,272
(and annihilate enemies.)

487
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:47,624
(I'll take a squad
to reinforce Yezhou Garrison.)

488
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:13,064
Why is it that every time we meet,

489
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:14,311
you end up

490
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:15,311
in such a pitiful state?

491
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,712
Maybe because,

492
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:22,351
well,

493
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:26,791
I always know

494
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:29,992
you'll help me out.

495
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:35,791
He Yan.

496
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:52,672
What?

497
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,280
Check her pulse.

498
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:55,071
No need.

499
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:56,351
I can tell what's wrong.

500
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:57,480
Dress the wounds first.

501
00:30:58,536 --> 00:30:59,192
Listen,

502
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:00,232
check her pulse.

503
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:02,871
Fine.

504
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,311
She's...

505
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:21,192
A girl.

506
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:22,752
Xiao Jue.

507
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:24,311
So, you've been

508
00:31:25,512 --> 00:31:26,472
keeping a beauty.

509
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:28,992
No wonder you've been

510
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:30,551
so attentive and accommodating

511
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:31,591
to her.

512
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,032
You always took her with you

513
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:34,432
and even let her

514
00:31:34,512 --> 00:31:35,672
stay next door to you.

515
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:38,071
Turns out you are

516
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,311
in love.

517
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:39,912
Are you done?

518
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:41,992
Keep blabbering, and she'll die.

519
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:45,311
How could you curse

520
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:46,232
a lady like that?

521
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,912
It's pretty embarrassing.

522
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:50,791
I kept calling her Mr. He

523
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:51,752
all this time.

524
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:54,151
Now,

525
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:56,591
should I switch to calling her Miss He

526
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:58,111
or Mrs. Xiao?

527
00:31:58,111 --> 00:31:59,432
Stop nagging, or I'll punish you.

528
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:09,631
She's severely injured.

529
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:11,432
Even most men can't bear it.

530
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:12,992
I wonder how she

531
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:13,791
endures this?

532
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:17,032
Remove her garment.

533
00:32:17,032 --> 00:32:17,752
Expose her back.

534
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,784
Clean the blood with warm water.

535
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,151
Then apply the medicine.

536
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:22,831
You were wounded too,

537
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,351
so you know the routine well.

538
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:25,591
Uncle.

539
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:30,351
And you?

540
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:33,032
I'll decoct herbal medicine for her.
