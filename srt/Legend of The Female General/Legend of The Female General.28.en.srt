22

=Episode 28=

23
00:01:44,624 --> 00:01:45,464
The lord and lady

24
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:46,783
are really adaptable.

25
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:48,984
Now that you're in a high position,

26
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:50,703
they've become servile.

27
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:52,863
But in my opinion,

28
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:54,583
they agreed readily enough,

29
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:56,583
but there's little sincerity.

30
00:01:57,063 --> 00:01:58,143
Sincere or not,

31
00:01:58,303 --> 00:01:59,184
it doesn't matter.

32
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:00,984
I want them

33
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:02,583
to bow their heads before Mother

34
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,544
and admit their wrongs.

35
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:05,223
But that is

36
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:06,583
a very lenient punishment.

37
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:09,784
Not at all.

38
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,863
Their resentment is the point.

39
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:13,463
Mother doesn't need

40
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:14,664
fair-weather relationships.

41
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:16,824
I want them

42
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:17,944
to swallow their pride

43
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:19,743
and humble themselves

44
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:20,824
before Mother.

45
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,504
Let them taste

46
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:25,664
the humiliation Mother endured.

47
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:28,023
Glad to see your wish was fulfilled.

48
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:29,984
Not yet.

49
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:31,583
What?

50
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:33,984
Well.

51
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:35,463
Are you done?

52
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,583
Can we go take a walk?

53
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:38,264
Why are you here?

54
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:39,784
If you don't come to me,

55
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:41,423
I'll come to you instead.

56
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:44,903
I have official paperwork

57
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:46,064
to complete.

58
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:47,863
Chu Zhao,

59
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:49,264
is it on purpose?

60
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:51,303
It seems

61
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:52,344
my paperwork needs

62
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:53,303
your approval?

63
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,023
That's not what I meant.

64
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:57,984
Yingxiang, let's go back.

65
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:00,784
What?

66
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:02,183
Not even some tea

67
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,264
for me?

68
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:04,944
Must Lady Shijin

69
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,064
personally host me?

70
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,064
Sir.

71
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,264
I'll prepare tea for Miss Xu

72
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:10,183
and be back shortly.

73
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:19,984
Aren't you serving me tea?

74
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:21,064
Let's go.

75
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:27,064
Enjoy your tea, Miss Xu.

76
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:31,183
It's cold.

77
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:50,623
This one seems scalding hot.

78
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:51,903
Bring another cup.

79
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,023
Is this

80
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:58,064
how you treat guests?

81
00:03:58,463 --> 00:03:59,903
What has Chu Zhao taught you?

82
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:06,944
Though I'm a servant,

83
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:08,463
I keep proper decorum.

84
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:10,104
You're a lady of status

85
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:11,984
but lack dignity.

86
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,143
How dare you?

87
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:15,423
My young master

88
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:16,984
taught me this.

89
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:18,303
When above others,

90
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:19,704
treat them as equals.

91
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:21,144
When below others,

92
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:22,623
maintain your integrity.

93
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:23,984
I've learned it.

94
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:25,224
I wonder

95
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:26,984
if you've grasped it.

96
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:35,823
If you're satisfied now,

97
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:37,823
I'll take my leave.

98
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:57,623
Father.

99
00:04:58,183 --> 00:04:58,664
Pingting.

100
00:04:58,863 --> 00:04:59,303
What's it?

101
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:00,183
What happened?

102
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:01,584
Tell me.

103
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:05,344
He doesn't care about me at all.

104
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:08,183
That's why he let that wretched maid

105
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:09,823
humiliate me like this.

106
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:12,823
Don't cry.

107
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:16,984
I'll make this right for you.

108
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,183
A mere fourth-rank official.

109
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:23,743
Who does he think he is?

110
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:33,904
Zilan.

111
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,344
Aren't these hibiscus flowers

112
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:38,664
laughable?

113
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:39,823
Laughable?

114
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:40,943
Yes.

115
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,303
See how they

116
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:44,904
bloom so vibrantly now.

117
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:47,464
Unaware that winter's chill

118
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:48,984
will soon arrive.

119
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,224
When bitter winds blow,

120
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:54,224
how long can they last?

121
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,224
Your maid...

122
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:00,904
What's her name?

123
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:07,784
A lowly person.

124
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:08,984
Not important.

125
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:14,544
These gorgeous flowers

126
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,623
can hardly survive winter

127
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:20,984
without someone to shield them.

128
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:24,104
Not to mention those worthless weeds.

129
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,224
One careless mistake,

130
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:29,623
and they'll end up
getting crushed underfoot.

131
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:32,263
Zilan.

132
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:35,024
What do you think?

133
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:41,383
Thank you for the reminder.

134
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:42,823
I know

135
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:44,263
I was wrong.

136
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:21,904
Rufei.

137
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:22,664
Rufei.

138
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,584
Are you okay?

139
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:26,024
I'll fetch a physician for you.

140
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:29,863
I'm the mighty General Feihong.

141
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:31,383
A minor injury like this

142
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,784
means nothing to me.

143
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:37,704
Right.

144
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:40,183
Rufei,

145
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:43,144
you've been frail since childhood.

146
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,784
I've always worried sick

147
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:47,183
about you.

148
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:49,584
But now, you command troops in battle

149
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:50,584
and have become

150
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:52,383
the true General Feihong.

151
00:08:34,903 --> 00:08:37,064
Young Master. Please take your medicine.

152
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:42,023
Young Master.

153
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:43,584
Your health

154
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:44,623
has barely recovered.

155
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:46,503
Don't stop the medicine.

156
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,984
What's the use of recovering?

157
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,263
I'm still trapped

158
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,704
in this wretched courtyard,

159
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:15,263
unable to go anywhere,

160
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:17,824
and unable

161
00:09:18,944 --> 00:09:20,263
to do anything.

162
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,543
What do you want to do?

163
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:38,424
Who are you?

164
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:40,824
Xu Jingfu.

165
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,023
I know

166
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,464
you're the real He Rufei.

167
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:55,623
I am the real He Rufei.

168
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:05,704
Sir,

169
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:09,344
what brings you here?

170
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:12,023
I can help you

171
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:15,464
become the real General Feihong

172
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:19,064
and achieve your deepest desires.

173
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:31,104
What do you need

174
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:32,903
me to do?

175
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:55,623
(He Yan,)

176
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,584
(every drop of blood I shed,)

177
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:01,704
(you'll pay back in full.)

178
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:04,503
(Times have changed.)

179
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:06,863
(General Feihong's swordsmanship
is peerless,)

180
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,584
(and he couldn't possibly be
an invalid.)

181
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,184
(I can't be who I was before.)

182
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:20,424
(Chai Anxi resents Xiao Zhongwu)

183
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:21,704
(for warmongering)

184
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:24,143
(and has long held grudges.)

185
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:25,704
(Son Chai Qian)
(Recently,)

186
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,903
(his only child died in battle,)

187
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:32,663
(deepening his hatred for Xiao Zhongwu.)

188
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:36,184
(We can exploit this.)

189
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:50,984
You're General Feihong, He Rufei?

190
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:54,783
Our family heirloom jade pendant

191
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:57,023
is only passed
to the eldest legitimate son.

192
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,383
But you're supposed to be

193
00:11:58,424 --> 00:11:59,663
on the front lines.

194
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,743
You want revenge for your son,

195
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:02,464
don't you?

196
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:07,623
I can help you.

197
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:14,184
That message-carrying lieutenant

198
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:15,623
was later killed

199
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:17,064
by Ding Yi in battle.

200
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,464
Flawlessly executed.

201
00:12:20,184 --> 00:12:21,104
That's why Xiao Jue

202
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:22,584
couldn't find any evidence.

203
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:24,903
I never imagined

204
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:26,743
you'd done so much

205
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:27,984
for Chancellor Xu.

206
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:29,743
My son!

207
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:31,984
Each of these deeds

208
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:32,944
warrants beheading

209
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,623
or even clan extermination.

210
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:36,503
Chancellor Xu

211
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:37,464
just wants

212
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,344
an obedient general

213
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,863
to counter the Xiao Army.

214
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,104
But if things go wrong,

215
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:42,783
the blame

216
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,503
will fall solely on you.

217
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:45,743
I'm not afraid of him.

218
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:48,944
I'm not his pawn.

219
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:51,503
I am

220
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:55,263
the undeniable proof of his guilt.

221
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:56,304
But...

222
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:57,023
Father.

223
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:59,704
As the eldest son
of our family's main lineage,

224
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,263
everything I've done

225
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:02,903
has been to strengthen

226
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:04,143
our main lineage.

227
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:06,104
So, from now on,

228
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:07,824
no matter what happens,

229
00:13:08,263 --> 00:13:09,224
both of us

230
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,184
must stand united.

231
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:13,023
Understand?

232
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:17,064
Yes.

233
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:21,503
I understand.

234
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:25,464
Father,

235
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:28,503
He Yan isn't actually dead.

236
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:30,224
What?

237
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:32,944
And she's about to return.

238
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:36,584
But rest assured.

239
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,344
I absolutely

240
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:40,984
won't let her enter the capital alive.

241
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,543
Gentlemen,

242
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:49,383
you look weary.

243
00:13:50,023 --> 00:13:50,783
Please come inside.

244
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:58,376
(Prosperity Inn)

245
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:01,584
As we're near Yaojing,

246
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:03,023
Yan He has vanished.

247
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:04,783
Seems he's eager to return home.

248
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,263
Sir, your tea.

249
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:09,623
His wife is pregnant.

250
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:11,383
He's concerned.

251
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:14,424
You'll be home soon too.

252
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:16,104
Right.

253
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:19,464
That's good.

254
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,104
Where will you stay?

255
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:52,224
I...

256
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:54,623
I'll just stay at any inn.

257
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:56,863
I have recently received some rewards.

258
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,023
So I'm better off now.

259
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:02,743
Waiter.

260
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:03,464
Two steamed buns.

261
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:04,263
Coming.

262
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,783
Why not stay at the Xiao Mansion?

263
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:18,984
It has a big yard.

264
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:20,464
And you're Commander's man.

265
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:21,783
It's appropriate

266
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:22,584
to be there.

267
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:26,944
No need.

268
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:27,263
Okay.

269
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:27,584
I...

270
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:00,903
Gentlemen,

271
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:03,064
our freshest tea.

272
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:05,344
Please enjoy.

273
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:16,704
Here.

274
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:17,783
Sir.

275
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:19,824
Gentlemen,

276
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:20,704
fresh tea.

277
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,584
It's best enjoyed while hot.

278
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:23,383
Alright.

279
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,704
Go.

280
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:49,824
Who sent you?

281
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:08,464
Commander,

282
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:10,263
these men seem to be targeting you.

283
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:13,263
I have many enemies.

284
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:23,984
Don't fear. All's well.

285
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:54,823
It appears

286
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,464
they're after me.

287
00:18:58,384 --> 00:18:58,944
Are you hurt?

288
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:02,144
I'm fine.

289
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:03,503
They couldn't defeat me.

290
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:19,464
Suicide operatives

291
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:20,944
with poison in their teeth.

292
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:22,624
They took it

293
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:23,464
when cornered.

294
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:24,704
We're in Chonghuai.

295
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,944
I'll have Yang Mingzhi

296
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:28,664
from the county office come

297
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:30,944
and look into their origins.

298
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:33,224
Okay.

299
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:35,263
But I know

300
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:37,224
who sent these assassins

301
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:38,263
without an investigation.

302
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:42,864
They've tried to kill me again.

303
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:49,512
(Chu Mansion)

304
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,023
My painting is crude.

305
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:28,783
Don't look.

306
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,144
The essence of painting plums

307
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:34,783
lies in layering and variation.

308
00:20:37,823 --> 00:20:38,263
Like this.

309
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:46,783
Here.

310
00:20:59,343 --> 00:20:59,864
Zilan.

311
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:04,063
My bad.

312
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:05,464
It's okay.

313
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:06,823
I'll get changed

314
00:21:07,103 --> 00:21:07,743
and return soon.

315
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:25,743
Sorry.

316
00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:28,184
Our plum painting is unfinished.

317
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:29,664
Continue?

318
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:33,424
Yes.

319
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,184
Here, look.

320
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:52,144
(Yaojing City)
Pendants.

321
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:55,543
Come and take a look.

322
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,136
(Yaojing City)

323
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:10,384
- General Feihong!
- General Feihong!

324
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,944
- General Feihong!
- General Feihong!

325
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,184
Do you intend to cling to

326
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:14,944
an identity that isn't yours

327
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,184
forever?

328
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:18,103
But

329
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:20,063
your current achievements

330
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:21,343
are entirely built upon

331
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:23,543
being the He family's legitimate heir.

332
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:29,624
Yaojing.

333
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:32,823
I've finally returned.

334
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:37,904
I've sent people to Huayuan

335
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,144
to look for

336
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:40,263
evidence.

337
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:41,303
Besides,

338
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:42,503
recently,

339
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:43,743
I received a letter from home.

340
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:45,624
We're commanded to attend

341
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,103
the Mid-Autumn banquet

342
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:48,783
at the palace.

343
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:52,063
By then,

344
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,263
Xu Jingfu and He Rufei

345
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,624
will surely attend.

346
00:23:57,944 --> 00:23:58,864
They must have received

347
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,103
news of our return.

348
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:02,743
But under the Emperor's watchful eye

349
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:04,704
and considering our positions,

350
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:06,823
they won't make any moves

351
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,864
before the Mid-Autumn banquet.

352
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:11,063
You're General Fengyun,

353
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:13,224
and I'm Attendant Wu'an.

354
00:24:14,343 --> 00:24:15,103
We should naturally

355
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:17,063
enter the palace banquet with dignity.

356
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:19,224
If He Rufei

357
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:20,664
provokes us,

358
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:21,944
I'm not afraid.

359
00:24:23,103 --> 00:24:23,624
But if he

360
00:24:24,424 --> 00:24:25,464
avoids confronting me,

361
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:28,263
I'll certainly seek him out.

362
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:29,904
I'll plant suspicion

363
00:24:30,664 --> 00:24:31,864
in mind of His Majesty

364
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:33,384
and the court officials.

365
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:36,424
General He,

366
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:37,984
you're meticulously planning

367
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,303
every move.

368
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:41,664
By the end of the Mid-Autumn banquet,

369
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:43,583
the investigation

370
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:45,224
in Huayuan will have yielded results.

371
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:47,063
Then,

372
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:48,904
we'll determine our next steps

373
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:51,023
based on the situation.

374
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:53,023
Stolen things

375
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:55,624
must eventually be returned.

376
00:24:56,224 --> 00:24:56,984
He Rufei,

377
00:24:58,023 --> 00:24:58,864
between you and me,

378
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:01,664
it's a fight to the death.

379
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:11,343
Sir,

380
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:12,743
the Master and Mistress

381
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:13,823
ask you to have dinner.

382
00:25:16,823 --> 00:25:17,184
Sir,

383
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:17,783
your

384
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:18,743
jade pendant...

385
00:25:43,656 --> 00:25:46,760
(Xiao Mansion)

386
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:07,704
Jing.

387
00:26:08,704 --> 00:26:09,184
Madam.

388
00:26:11,343 --> 00:26:12,224
You're finally back.

389
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:13,823
I'm back

390
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,424
with a friend.

391
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:17,664
This is He Yan.

392
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:21,704
I am He Yan.

393
00:26:22,343 --> 00:26:23,704
Mr. Xiao and Madam.

394
00:26:24,144 --> 00:26:25,464
So you're Huaijin's friend.

395
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:27,023
How extraordinary.

396
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:28,543
We've never seen Huaijin

397
00:26:28,624 --> 00:26:29,743
bring friends home before.

398
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:31,224
Your friendship must be

399
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,103
exceptional.

400
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:34,743
Good to see you.

401
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:36,224
Rongwei personally made dinner

402
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:37,823
while awaiting your return.

403
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:39,704
I want

404
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:41,583
to first see Father and Mother.

405
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,696
(Ancestral Tablets of the Xiao Clan)

406
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:08,159
(Xiao)

407
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,755
(Commemoration)

408
00:27:27,263 --> 00:27:27,704
(Jing,)

409
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:29,864
(only by retaking Que City)

410
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:33,543
(can we uncover the truth of Mingshui,
clear Father's name,)

411
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:35,464
(and honor the 30,000 fallen men.)

412
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:37,184
(I)

413
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:39,424
(deserve to die for this.)

414
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:06,583
Mr. He,

415
00:28:09,224 --> 00:28:10,384
he's been away so long.

416
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:11,944
Let him spend time

417
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:13,263
with Father and Mother.

418
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:15,343
How about

419
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:16,823
we wait in the parlour?

420
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,023
After you.

421
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,944
Ancestors,

422
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,343
your descendant,

423
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:32,624
Xiao Jue, have returned.

424
00:28:33,224 --> 00:28:34,184
This time,

425
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:36,184
I will surely expose

426
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,224
the disloyal officials,

427
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:39,503
purge the imperial court,

428
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:41,783
clear our family's name,

429
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:43,503
and get justice for our army.

430
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:46,823
May you protect us.

431
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,760
(Tablet of Father Xiao Zhongwu)

432
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:11,063
(Tablet of Mother Song Wan)
Father, Mother,

433
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:12,783
I have something

434
00:29:13,743 --> 00:29:14,743
to tell you.

435
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:18,904
I've found the most significant person

436
00:29:19,543 --> 00:29:20,503
in my life.

437
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:22,904
But she still has unfinished matters.

438
00:29:23,503 --> 00:29:24,904
When everything settles down,

439
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:26,664
I'll surely bring her

440
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:28,144
to meet you.

441
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:43,704
These coming days,

442
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:45,144
I'll be troubling you

443
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:45,984
and your wife.

444
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,583
No need for formalities.

445
00:29:47,864 --> 00:29:49,103
Since you're Huaijin's friend,

446
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:50,303
you're our friend too.

447
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,224
Treat this place as your own home.

448
00:29:52,503 --> 00:29:53,944
Stay as long as you wish.

449
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:54,783
Just relax.

450
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:56,864
Don't trouble yourself.

451
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,144
The guest room

452
00:29:58,343 --> 00:29:59,543
to my west will be fine.

453
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:01,303
Huaijin,

454
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,023
didn't you always prefer tranquility?

455
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,023
Why this sudden change?

456
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:11,624
It seems Huaijin and Mr. He

457
00:30:11,704 --> 00:30:12,503
get along well.

458
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:13,864
Eat a lot.

459
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:29,904
The mushroom and chicken stew.

460
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,303
Your favorite.

461
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,184
Eat it.

462
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:35,263
You remember?

463
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:39,184
Your favorite.

464
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:40,303
Of course, I do.

465
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:44,144
You two share a brotherly bond.

466
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:46,704
He's never shown this level of care

467
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:48,144
toward me as his elder brother.

468
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,984
Eat a lot.

469
00:31:03,783 --> 00:31:04,263
Eat.

470
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:12,904
Miss,

471
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:13,984
come take a look.

472
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:16,704
How terribly rude of me

473
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:18,263
to visit Mr. and Mrs. Xiao

474
00:31:18,303 --> 00:31:19,464
without bringing gifts.

475
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:20,583
I came empty-handed.

476
00:31:27,864 --> 00:31:29,103
What should I buy?

477
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:39,543
You're sent by He Rufei, right?

478
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,503
Sir,

479
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,263
what?

480
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:42,783
I'm merely passing through.

481
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,743
I'll spare you today.

482
00:31:46,263 --> 00:31:47,503
Tell your master.

483
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:48,743
Your debt

484
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:50,464
will be paid.

485
00:31:57,224 --> 00:31:57,664
Sir,

486
00:31:58,303 --> 00:31:59,583
our people

487
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:00,823
were discovered by He Yan.

488
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:07,384
"Discovered"?

489
00:32:11,224 --> 00:32:11,864
Young Master,

490
00:32:12,023 --> 00:32:12,664
I am useless.

491
00:32:12,704 --> 00:32:14,184
You failed at both tracking

492
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:16,063
and assassination.

493
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:16,783
Useless!

494
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:21,543
Where is she now?

495
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:23,023
In the mansion?

496
00:32:23,624 --> 00:32:24,063
No.

497
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:24,864
She said,

498
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:25,743
"Your debt

499
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:26,743
will be paid."

500
00:32:31,543 --> 00:32:32,023
Right.

501
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:34,583
Now that she's in the capital,

502
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:38,503
it's either her destruction or ours.

503
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:47,904
Let's go to that cosmetics shop

504
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:49,343
we went to the other day?

505
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:49,743
