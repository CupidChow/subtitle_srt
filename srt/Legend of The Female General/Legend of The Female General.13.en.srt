I'm exhausted.

24
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,652
You slept for a full day,
so you are exhausted.

25
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,652
Xiao Jue, you're still here?

26
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:35,413
No.

27
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:37,293
Commander.

28
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:50,853
No need.

29
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:51,212
I will

30
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,332
take it all at once.

31
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:53,413
Cheng Lisu said

32
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:54,612
it works best when hot.

33
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,212
Commander.

34
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:01,332
Mr. Shen is here.

35
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,052
Let him in.

36
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:19,533
Mr. Shen.

37
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,052
Commander.

38
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,452
As the chief instructor,

39
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:24,533
I hesitated in making decisions,

40
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:25,853
which cost us the chance.

41
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,253
Hu Yuanzhong led

42
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:28,013
the Liehe men

43
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,732
to kill a dozen new recruits.

44
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:31,492
I don't want your mercy

45
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,652
but your punishment.

46
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:36,772
Commander,
Mr. Shen fulfilled his duties.

47
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:37,693
What's his fault?

48
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:41,293
Hu Yuanzhong is too cunning
and Lei Hou is too deceptive.

49
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:42,413
How could we defend?

50
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:43,652
By that logic,

51
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:45,892
I should be punished.

52
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,013
No, Commander.

53
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:48,373
I failed your trust.

54
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:49,573
Moreover, He Yan

55
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,652
had given me

56
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:51,533
the defense layout.

57
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:52,813
But I still...

58
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:55,813
Defense layout?

59
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:16,072
(Defense Layout)

60
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,013
You may leave.

61
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:22,024
Yes.

62
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:29,448
(Defense Layout)

63
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:50,253
Explain.

64
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:04,972
Commander.

65
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,133
I was framed for murder

66
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:23,772
and thrown in jail.

67
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,053
You weren't at Yezhou Garrison.

68
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,652
If something had happened,

69
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:30,133
we would've been in danger.

70
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,573
So I drew a map

71
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:33,772
and had Miss Song

72
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:35,933
deliver it to Mr. Shen.

73
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:40,772
Great layout.

74
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:43,253
Quite detailed.

75
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,412
After all, I've been

76
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:52,292
at Yezhou Garrison for half a year.

77
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:53,332
I know the place

78
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,573
quite well.

79
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,053
Bring any new recruit here

80
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:01,160
and guess

81
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:02,892
if he can make

82
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:03,933
this defense layout?

83
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,613
My memory is perfect.

84
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:14,452
I'm gifted.

85
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,253
You're lying again.

86
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:20,813
Right?

87
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:23,573
Commander.

88
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:24,972
You always doubt me.

89
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:26,573
At least, show me some proof.

90
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:29,013
You've kept me by your side for long

91
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,212
and only discovered

92
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:31,693
my loyalty, quick wit,

93
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:32,613
courage, and wisdom.

94
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:33,693
Anything else?

95
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:34,892
Nothing.

96
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:39,332
Commander,

97
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:41,053
a true leader

98
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:42,933
rewards and punishes people fairly.

99
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:44,613
I helped resolve

100
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:45,652
Yezhou Garrison's crisis.

101
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:46,693
That's a merit.

102
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,412
Shouldn't you reward me?

103
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:50,693
Reward?

104
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:52,813
What reward do you want?

105
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,173
Can I join the battalion?

106
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,693
You're being unfair?

107
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,400
Approved.

108
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:10,813
Really?

109
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:14,053
Thank you.

110
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:14,772
Don't worry.

111
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,532
I'll lead the battalion well.

112
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,573
What makes you think

113
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:23,892
you can lead the battalion?

114
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:26,813
I believe I was born

115
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:28,013
to be a general.

116
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:30,133
Sometimes, I even feel

117
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:32,412
I was a female general in my past life.

118
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:38,733
Don't you believe me?

119
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:40,693
Or do you think

120
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:42,452
women can't be generals?

121
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:49,412
In this world,

122
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:52,332
whether men or women,

123
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:54,212
everyone can do

124
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:55,532
what they want.

125
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:57,772
Just do it well.

126
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:06,452
Thank you.

127
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:08,173
Don't get excited.

128
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,532
I allow you join the battalion

129
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:12,892
because your skills qualify you,

130
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:15,693
not because I believe your lies.

131
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:21,813
You are too competent.

132
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:25,892
A woman like you

133
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:29,652
joined Yezhou Garrison as a new recruit.

134
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,373
I don't believe there's no hidden story.

135
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:35,572
The day will come

136
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:38,333
when your secrets will be uncovered.

137
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,213
What secrets could I possibly have?

138
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:42,892
You and I were

139
00:08:43,812 --> 00:08:45,093
simply meant to meet each other.

140
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:03,613
Thank you.

141
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,412
It's too bitter.

142
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:29,853
Isn't this

143
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,093
the candy I gave him last time?

144
00:09:34,812 --> 00:09:36,213
Using my gift

145
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,493
to repay me?

146
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:39,093
How stingy.

147
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:57,000
(The Art of War)

148
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:02,344
Come in.

149
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,253
Isn't it my dear Miss He?

150
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:16,613
Stop that nonsense!

151
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:17,733
What are you saying?

152
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,253
I already know it.

153
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:22,772
What happened?

154
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:23,656
Tell me.

155
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,093
I was originally

156
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,812
the daughter of a minor city official.

157
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,052
Due to my beauty,

158
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:39,932
a local bully took an interest in me.

159
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:40,853
So I had to

160
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:42,812
disguise myself as a man and flee home.

161
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:45,172
Later, with no other choice,

162
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:46,172
I joined the military.

163
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,333
Mr. Cheng,

164
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,292
you must keep this secret for me.

165
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:51,812
Do you think

166
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:53,093
I'm easily fooled?

167
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:57,812
Fine.

168
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,412
I trust you.

169
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:01,973
Whatever you say,

170
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,333
I'll believe it.

171
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,093
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

172
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:06,652
Take your medicine.

173
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:11,812
But that fool

174
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:14,412
is destined to take a fall.

175
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:30,733
Was it

176
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:31,613
after I warned you

177
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:33,493
that you started suspecting Lei Hou?

178
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:35,932
While investigating you,

179
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,133
we discovered his forged identity

180
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:39,652
was suspicious.

181
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:43,292
Then

182
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,052
doesn't that count as a merit for me?

183
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:50,333
I was wrong.

184
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:51,733
I won't do it again.

185
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:53,133
Cut the crap.

186
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:54,133
Follow me.

187
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,093
(Dungeon)

188
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,088
- Commander.
- Commander.

189
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:01,932
Save your efforts.

190
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:06,932
I'll reveal nothing.

191
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:13,973
Remember this?

192
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:18,812
My brother's longevity lock.

193
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:19,652
Xiao Jue,

194
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:21,373
don't involve my family.

195
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:23,052
My brother knows nothing.

196
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:23,932
Spare him.

197
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:25,172
Do whatever

198
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:26,412
you want to punish me.

199
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:27,692
Even kill me if you must.

200
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:28,412
Please spare him.

201
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:29,932
You should've anticipated this.

202
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:31,453
As a death warrior,

203
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,733
how could you cling to false hopes?

204
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,652
Maybe you should've hidden

205
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:38,932
your family better.

206
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:40,292
Xiao Jue,

207
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:43,812
what exactly do you want?

208
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:45,892
Tell everything you know.

209
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:49,532
No rush.

210
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:50,973
I have time.

211
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:53,213
Take it easy.

212
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,093
What if I refuse?

213
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:13,812
You can try that.

214
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,052
I guarantee

215
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:15,692
next time,

216
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:18,932
I won't bring mere objects.

217
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,412
You truly live up to your name.

218
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:38,572
Such ruthless methods.

219
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:40,692
I've learned my lesson.

220
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:45,853
You seized power shortly after
Xiao Zhongwu and his wife's deaths.

221
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,052
In Que City,

222
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:50,412
you showed no remorse
while drowning tens of thousands.

223
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:53,692
No one

224
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:57,613
is more ruthless than you.

225
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,853
It seems you understand
what kind of man I am.

226
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,052
I never give others second chances.

227
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:13,733
Wait.

228
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:17,532
I was originally from Que City.

229
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:20,213
After the city was flooded,

230
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:22,453
our home was destroyed,

231
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:25,052
leaving only me

232
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,532
and my dying younger brother.

233
00:14:27,772 --> 00:14:29,373
When we were desperate,

234
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:32,213
we met Hu Yuanzhong.

235
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,253
He said he was

236
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,853
a Liehe merchant in Que City.

237
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:38,133
His wife and children died.

238
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:40,052
He wanted revenge

239
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,412
and asked if I'd join him.

240
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,412
Then you agreed?

241
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:46,892
Hatred consumed me then.

242
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:48,093
I agreed immediately.

243
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,172
He forged me a new identity

244
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,373
to enlist in Yezhou Garrison.

245
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:54,892
So you joined the battalion

246
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:57,292
to get close to Commander Xiao?

247
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:58,824
Yes.

248
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,692
But you are too capable,

249
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,373
as the main challenge
to my joining the battalion.

250
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:05,253
I bribed Zheng Xuan

251
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:06,652
and tried to kill you through him.

252
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:09,333
But you survived

253
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,532
that wolf pack attack.

254
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:11,733
Recently,

255
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:13,213
Hu Yuanzhong contacted

256
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:15,333
Rida Muzi and Liehe forces.

257
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:17,572
They planned a coordinated attack.

258
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:20,453
Hu Yuanzhong came

259
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,772
to the barracks first

260
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:24,453
to inform me.

261
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:28,213
Every single one

262
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:29,733
of these things

263
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:31,493
couldn't be done

264
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:32,892
by Hu Yuanzhong,

265
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:33,772
a mere Liehe commoner.

266
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,733
There must be someone more powerful

267
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:37,812
pulling the strings.

268
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:39,333
Whether it's him

269
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:40,733
or the mastermind,

270
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,412
they planned this long ago

271
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:44,172
with grand ambitions.

272
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,373
I know I'm being used,

273
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,493
but I'll do anything

274
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,052
to get revenge.

275
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,133
Who is the mastermind behind him?

276
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:55,812
I've never met them.

277
00:15:56,532 --> 00:15:57,572
Hu Yuanzhong has always

278
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:58,812
handled communications.

279
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:01,613
Xiao Jue.

280
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:03,692
I've told you everything

281
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:04,613
I know.

282
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:24,424
(Dungeon)

283
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,613
War's cruelty lies

284
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:29,412
in forcing impossible choices

285
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:30,493
upon people

286
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,692
everywhere, anytime,

287
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:33,412
trapping them

288
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:34,772
in moral dilemmas.

289
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:40,213
Hou.

290
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:41,853
Hou.

291
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:42,652
Brother.

292
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:44,892
- Hou.
- Brother.

293
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:46,892
Hou.

294
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:48,733
Brother.

295
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:49,772
Hou.

296
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,853
I've missed you so much.

297
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:54,493
We followed the trail

298
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:55,453
and found

299
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:56,093
your brother.

300
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,493
The Commander

301
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:58,453
ordered us

302
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:00,453
to treat him well.

303
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:02,973
Don't think

304
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:04,013
this redeems your sins.

305
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:06,973
Those you drowned

306
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:10,013
will never return.

307
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:17,612
I never sought forgiveness.

308
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,413
The moment I ordered it,

309
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:21,213
I knew some crimes

310
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:23,733
would haunt me

311
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:26,332
forever.

312
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:34,612
He's just a Wutuo civilian

313
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:35,653
born in Que City.

314
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:37,973
He hid in barracks

315
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:39,453
and conspired with Rida Muzi.

316
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:41,372
He couldn't

317
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:42,213
do these things

318
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:42,733
on his own.

319
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,572
Are you just letting him go?

320
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:46,933
Let them leave.

321
00:18:02,973 --> 00:18:03,572
Brother.

322
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:05,453
Wait here for me.

323
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:34,173
(Encrypted text)

324
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,772
So that love poem from Hu Yuanzhong

325
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:37,173
is in your hands.

326
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:38,893
This is coded communication.

327
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:40,013
My vengeance

328
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,013
was for those who never returned.

329
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:45,013
We're even.

330
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:47,493
But you still owe many others.

331
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:36,812
What was

332
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:39,292
the Que City battle really like?

333
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:43,893
They're right.

334
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:47,612
I am indeed cold-blooded

335
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,733
and cruel.

336
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:53,933
The battlefield changes rapidly.

337
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:56,532
Others may fear

338
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:58,453
and hesitate.

339
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:01,693
But a general cannot.

340
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:04,893
A general must decide.

341
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:08,852
You have no choice.

342
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:12,413
If you don't want to tell me,

343
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:15,493
I won't press.

344
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:20,532
That night in Que City,

345
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,693
there was a torrential downpour

346
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:27,852
we'd never seen.

347
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,216
(Wei Camp in Que City)

348
00:20:58,812 --> 00:20:59,372
Commander.

349
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:02,213
The Wutuo Army

350
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,253
is resting in Que City,

351
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:04,453
not knowing our army

352
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:05,453
has reached the gates.

353
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,772
They have 30,000 men.

354
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,413
We only have 3,000 men.

355
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:13,493
Victory is unlikely
even with surprise tactics.

356
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:17,332
We all have

357
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:18,092
a resolve to die.

358
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:19,332
No turning back.

359
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:32,413
How far is Que City
from the nearby village?

360
00:21:33,332 --> 00:21:34,013
Ten li.

361
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:37,612
If we release the reservoir

362
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:39,653
during the rain,

363
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:43,453
we will wipe Wutuo Army out.

364
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:45,013
If the rain doesn't worsen,

365
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:46,493
the nearby village

366
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,572
will remain safe.

367
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,653
Ride fast and deliver news
to evacuate the villagers.

368
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:52,812
Also,

369
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:54,852
deploy rescuers

370
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:56,213
on standby.

371
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:48,893
Commander.

372
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:51,973
The rain intensified.

373
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,253
The water ran wild.

374
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:54,812
The village was destroyed.

375
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:57,413
Many people were swept away.

376
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:51,572
Release the water.

you only had 3,000 men.

393

No other choice existed.

394
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:54,372
It meant

395
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:56,453
sending you to die.

396
00:25:57,812 --> 00:25:58,733
You did your best.

397
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:02,653
I didn't kill them,

398
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:06,733
but they died because of me.

when I was upset,

404
00:26:24,612 --> 00:26:26,052
I wanted someone to hold

405
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:26,893
and comfort me.

406
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:30,893
But I had no one.

407
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:33,612
So I hope

408
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:37,372

aren't healed yet.

413
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:15,772
You made her stand

00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:16,973
in the snow all night.

415
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,213

417
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:24,173
have some compassion.

418
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:27,693
Don't blame him.

419
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:29,132
I'm recovering well.

420
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:31,372
Stop making excuses for him.

421
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:32,612
You two

422
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:34,092
take advantage of

423

my medical expertise.

424
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:38,132
Fine. I'll stop bothering you.

I'll boil the herbs.

426
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:52,653
Drink this.

427
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:07,852
Commander.

428
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:10,933
Come in.

429
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:17,092
Commander.

430
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,332
(Encrypted text)
Hu Yuanzhong's love poem

431
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,532
has chaotic content.

432
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:21,772
We analyzed it hard

433
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:23,173
but found nothing.

434
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:31,292
There's a bitter smell.

435
00:28:39,272 --> 00:28:40,392
- Ginger soup.
- Ginger soup.

436
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:44,232
Yes.

437
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,200
(Xiao)

438
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:03,253
You do it.

439
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:38,120
(Encrypted text)

440
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:52,104
(Hai hour on the 5th of the 8th
lunar month, same place, Cimu)

441
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:57,973
What's going on?

442
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:01,973
The front of this note
was written in ink,

443
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:03,372
and the back

444
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:04,453
with alum solution.

445
00:30:05,852 --> 00:30:06,572
Once dried,

446
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:07,933
the writing disappears.

447
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:09,852
But when soaked in ginger soup,

448
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:11,173
the vanished words

449
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:12,733
reappear.

450
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:14,253
This is an old letter.

451
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:16,733
Perhaps Hu Yuanzhong

452
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:17,973
didn't fully trust the sender.

453
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:19,413
That's why he kept it.

454
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,612
Writing with alum solution

455
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:22,653
to deliver messages

456
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:24,292
was a method devised

457
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,092
by my father.

458
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:27,532
He only shared it with close associates.

459
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,493
How did you know that?

460
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,532
(How can I tell you)

461
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:32,933
(General Xiao)

462
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:34,052
(personally taught me?)

463
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:37,413
I

464
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:39,213
read it in a book.

465
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:44,332
Commander, are you suggesting

466
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:45,973
this note comes from

467
00:30:45,973 --> 00:30:47,092
one of our own people?

468
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:48,653
A traitor in our army?

469
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:55,453
Where is

470
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:56,653
this "same place"?

471
00:30:57,052 --> 00:30:58,852
And what does "Cimu"

472
00:30:59,132 --> 00:30:59,852
mean?

473
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:03,332
"Cimu" refers to "Chai".

474
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:04,772
My father once had

475
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:06,532
a long-serving deputy general

476
00:31:07,052 --> 00:31:07,893
named Chai Anxi.

477
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:08,772
But he died

478
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:10,332
with my father

479
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:11,933
at the Mingshui Battlefield.

480
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:14,013
Unless

481
00:31:14,812 --> 00:31:15,693
he faked his death?

482
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,332
But he was part of your army.

483
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:19,413
Why did he betray us?

484
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:20,973
I'm not sure.

485
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:23,052
His deep knowledge

486
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:23,973
of our army,

487
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,253
combined with the encrypted text,

488
00:31:27,693 --> 00:31:29,052
makes him the prime suspect.

489
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:32,092
If this is true,

490
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,173
then his involvement might

491
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:36,213
explain our defeat at Mingshui.

492
00:31:38,092 --> 00:31:38,693
So we

493
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:40,413
must track down

494
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:41,453
Chai Anxi.

495
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,893
The agent you planted

496
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:00,253
was exposed rather quickly.

497
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,013
Lei Hou and the Liehe tribe

498
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:04,612
are so useless.

499
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:06,852
But the real agent

500
00:32:07,532 --> 00:32:08,372
is someone else.

501
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:13,893
I found him in Que City.

502
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:34,893
After the flood,

503
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:36,292
the city became desolate.

504
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:39,052
I expect

505
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,332
the Xiao Army will soon withdraw.

506
00:32:57,372 --> 00:32:58,092
Are you alright?

507
00:32:58,612 --> 00:32:59,453
He's wounded

508
00:33:00,173 --> 00:33:01,292
and weak.

509
00:33:01,532 --> 00:33:03,332
He's been shadowing
that troop for a while.

510
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:06,213
Save him first.

511
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:12,933
(Chai Anxi)
Thank you.

512
00:33:13,612 --> 00:33:14,493
You're not well.

513
00:33:15,213 --> 00:33:15,933
No formalities.

514
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:19,173
You...

515
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:20,893
You're a soldier?

516
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:22,653
I mean no offense.

517
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:24,173
But earlier,

518
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:25,453
when dressing your wounds,

519
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:27,413
I noticed a dagger

520
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,372
engraved with "Xiao".

521
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:40,493
You're from the Xiao Army?

522
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:44,213
Relax.

523
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:45,733
The Xiao Army

524
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:46,852
is stationed here.

525
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:48,213
I saw their banner.

526
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:50,213
I'm just puzzled

527
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:52,693
why you haven't joined them.

528
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:01,693
You're not young anymore.

529
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:03,413
Retiring from battle

530
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:04,933
is understandable.

531
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,213
I'm no deserter.

532
00:34:13,307 --> 00:34:17,032
