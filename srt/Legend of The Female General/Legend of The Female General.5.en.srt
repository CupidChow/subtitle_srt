=Legend of The Female General=

22
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:43,080
They're crossing the line,

23
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,000
putting loaches in my shoes.

24
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,880
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,808
It was an accident.

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,912
These candies got dirty.

27
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:02,239
Put them back.

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,199
Don't eat those.

29
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,176
Should I buy you new ones?

30
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:12,079
No need. Go to class.

31
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:23,048
=Episode 5=

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,400
You dug so much
into his past, but to no avail?

33
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,439
That's right.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,960
Everything matches his military records.

35
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:34,840
Maybe He Yan really has nothing to do
with He Rufei and Xu Jingfu.

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,520
This only proves

37
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,000
those covering for him
are remarkably capable.

38
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,992
Covering for him?

39
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:43,880
Commander, have you
discovered something?

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,560
An unexpected lead.

41
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,919
Have people keep looking.

42
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,759
Yes.

43
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,439
And what's going on
with the delay in provisions?

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
Yezhou Magistrate Sun Xiangfu

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,336
claims the harvest is poor,

46
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,000
the farmers are owed payments,

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,040
and the grain reserves
are critically low.

48
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,759
So he can't spare us any grain.

49
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,815
Absolute nonsense.

50
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:10,614
It's not like there were

51
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:12,255
any natural disasters.

52
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:18,815
There were none.

53
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:20,654
But man-made troubles exist.

54
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,214
I bet Xu Jingfu told him to oppose you.

55
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,975
Xu Jingfu got me transferred to Yezhou,

56
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:31,654
away from the capital,

57
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,295
without any chance to turn the tide.

58
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,815
He never imagined

59
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,734
that you had already chosen
to bide your time here.

60
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:39,944
But now that

61
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:41,416
you've trained these misfits

62
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,856
into capable soldiers,

63
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:43,815
he's rushing

64
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:45,734
to tamper with our provisions.

65
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,215
That's right.

66
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,295
The new recruits lack cohesion.

67
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:51,336
If provisions run short

68
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,128
in times of good harvests

69
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,894
and rumors of embezzlement surface,

70
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:57,375
the new recruits will

71
00:03:58,334 --> 00:03:59,734
lose their trust in me.

72
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:01,575
What should we do?

73
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:04,334
The remaining provisions
can last a bit longer.

74
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:09,576
After the contest of capturing flags,
I'll visit Sun Xiangfu in person

75
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:11,734
and find out

76
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:14,535
what kind of pawn

77
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,935
Xu Jingfu had planted in Yezhou.

78
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,614
(He Yan,)

79
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:36,854
(those closest to you)

80
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:38,614
(despised you,)

81
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:39,855
(abandoned you,)

82
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:41,054
(and killed you.)

83
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,695
(Since you've come back
with a new identity,)

84
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,575
(from now on,)

85
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,175
(your life)

86
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,854
(will be solely in your hands.)

87
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,174
Mr. He.

88
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:15,720
Your lanterns are hideous.

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,495
What matters is the sincerity.

90
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:24,335
Mr. Cheng.

91
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,495
Isn't your lantern

92
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:26,974
way too huge?

93
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:28,575
This lantern

94
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:30,894
is not just for my ancestors.

95
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:32,854
It's also for Huaijin.

96
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:35,055
So I made it bigger than usual.

97
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,935
With both families together,

98
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:38,054
it's livelier

99
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:39,134
and less lonely.

100
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,015
My grand-aunt

101
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:42,414
feared loneliness most.

102
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:44,894
Madam Xiao

103
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:46,894
also passed away?

104
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:48,535
Yeah.

105
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,934
She and my great-uncle
were a loving couple.

106
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:53,175
After my great-uncle died,

107
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:54,894
my great-aunt was devastated.

108
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:56,415
After Huaijin

109
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:58,575
escorted my great-uncle's coffin home,

110
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,135
she took her own life.

111
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:09,294
Huaijin is also quite lonely.

112
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,215
My family,

113
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:12,415
including my mother,

114
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:14,494
and friends acquainted
with the Xiao family

115
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:16,015
don't really like him.

116
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:18,975
They prefer my eldest uncle,

117
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,534
Huaijin's older brother,

118
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:21,614
Xiao Jing.

119
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:23,656
Why?

120
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:25,512
Aren't they both members
of The Xiao family?

121
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,375
The Xiao family comes from
a long military lineage.

122
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:30,495
One child must join the army.

123
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,815
Xiao Jing is more of a scholar

124
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:34,367
than a military man.

125
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:36,048
So Huaijin joined the army

126
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:37,608
for his elder brother

127
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:39,127
and the entire family.

128
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,888
He left at an early age
and rarely visited home.

129
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:46,088
So, he's become quite aloof.

130
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,567
He's distant even with his own family,

131
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:49,687
let alone relatives like us.

132
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:51,248
Even his mother

133
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,048
doesn't feel bonded with him.

134
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,047
Makes sense.

135
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:58,248
They're like strangers
after years apart.

136
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,367
It leads to prejudice.

137
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:08,680
Mr. He, it's late.

138
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,688
I should head back.

139
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:11,007
Rest early.

140
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:53,408
In times of hardship,

141
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:55,304
take a piece of candy.

142
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,247
Let its sweetness

143
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,127
comfort you.

144
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,048
Such little sweetness

145
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:01,928
can attenuate the bitterness of life.

146
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:34,376
Premium Osmanthus wine.

147
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:37,607
I hear noblewomen
in the capital adore this.

148
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:50,967
May the deceased

149
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:52,008
witness my devotion

150
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,408
in folding these lanterns

151
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,288
and bless my wishes.

152
00:08:58,807 --> 00:08:59,967
Disturbing the deceased

153
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,536
doesn't make you ashamed at all.

154
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:03,848
Leave mortal affairs

155
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:06,056
to be handled by the living.

156
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:11,967
How do you know

157
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,447
I'm not speaking

158
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:14,760
the wishes of the deceased?

159
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:16,767
The regrets of the dead

160
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,487
must be redeemed by the living.

161
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,807
This is my promise to them.

162
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:26,927
Want to fold some?

163
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,216
I'll share some with you

164
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,487
to repay you for saving me back then.

165
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,008
No need.

166
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,160
This one

167
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,687
carries blessings
to those heroes who died

168
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,408
defending our land and people,

169
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:50,687
and their loved ones.

170
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:53,967
Though I don't know your names,

171
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:55,727
these blessings

172
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,248
come from my heart.

173
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:00,167
Not bad.

174
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:02,648
Hideous.

175
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,967
This is called free-form one.

176
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,047
Perhaps

177
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:10,607
the heroes prefer it this way.

178
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:18,648
You mock my lanterns,

179
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:19,768
but you won't make one.

180
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:21,567
All talk, no action.

181
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,768
So picky.

182
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:44,807
What's the fuss?

183
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,128
I touched your hand, so what?

184

I wonder if the deceased

223
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:44,934
shares this moonlight

224
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:47,295
with us, the living?

225
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,174
Yes, they do.

226
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:25,854
New recruits, listen up!

227
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,495
Red flags are placed

228
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:29,672
throughout Mount Baiyue.

229
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,096
There are 15 in total.

230
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:32,760
This competition

231
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,816
lasts until sunset.

232
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:37,055
The team returning
with the most red flags

233
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,255
shall be the winner.

234
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:41,615
Remember. Don't cross the mountains.

235
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,255
Don't take lives.

236
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:44,534
Violators will face

237
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:45,655
military discipline.

238
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:46,814
- Yes.
- Yes.

239
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:49,295
After the competition,

240
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:51,175
the most outstanding recruit

241
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:53,574
will join the Nine Banners Battalion.

242
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:55,454
- Really?
- Really?

243
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:58,414
Soldiers!

244
00:14:59,015 --> 00:14:59,855
Set out.

245
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:01,694
- Yes.
- Yes.

246
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:11,854
This is the map of Mount Baiyue?

247
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:13,255
Where did you get it?

248
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:17,814
I memorized the paths while patrolling

249
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,624
and drew this map after I came back.

250
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:22,535
You memorized the paths

251
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:24,328
while being chased by wolves?

252
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:25,608
I checked the routes

253
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:26,655
while fleeing,

254
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,040
and then reviewed them later.

255
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,095
So I know this place well.

256
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:31,415
Trust your leader.

257
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,855
Those flags

258
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,375
are usually placed in visible areas

259
00:15:37,655 --> 00:15:39,015
near foothills and water sources.

260
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:41,574
So the nearest flag

261
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:43,400
should be

262
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,974
on this open mountainside.

263
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,080
Come on, let's go for it.

264
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,654
No.

265
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:49,934
We're not going there.

266
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:52,328
Those flags in the open

267
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,248
are easy targets.

268
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:55,895
Many teams will notice them.

269
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:57,672
If we go there,

270
00:15:58,094 --> 00:15:59,375
we'll be caught in chaos.

271
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,174
So,

272
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:04,614
we'll head

273
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:06,414
here.

274
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:08,303
It's among dense woods,

275
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:10,102
behind a cliff.

276
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:12,342
It will be a challenge.

277
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:14,783
Classic carrot-and-stick tactic.

278
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:17,503
They lure us with rewards
and then slap us down.

279
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,582
Of course, it's challenging.

280
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:21,023
Or they can just hold

281
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:22,543
a martial arts contest.

282
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:25,422
Let's go.

283
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,903
Cliffs on Mount Baiyue are dangerous.

284
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:30,222
I doubt anyone

285
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:32,783
can take this flag.

286
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:35,702
New recruits can't.

287
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:37,663
But veterans might

288
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:40,822
have realized the purpose of the patrol

289
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:44,183
and completed a thorough mapping.

290
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:47,302
Do we have

291
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:48,742
such a talent here?

292
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,383
Yeah.

293
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:55,223
He Yan.

294
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:35,783
It's in such a precarious position.

295
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:37,463
Only you could get that flag, He.

296
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:38,983
Piece of cake.

297
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,142
He, you're amazing.

298
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:57,943
With only one patrol,

299
00:17:58,422 --> 00:17:59,262
He Yan

300
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:01,263
has learned Mount Baiyue by heart.

301
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:03,103
Impressive new talent.

302
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:06,183
But I bet on Lei Hou's team.

303
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:07,702
Everyone

304
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:10,742
in that team is a top martial artist.

305
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:13,583
It takes teamwork to capture flags,

306
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,383
not individual heroism.

307
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:17,742
Therefore, deployment matters

308
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:19,742
more than muscle.

309
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:21,663
So I still bet on

310
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,023
He Yan.

311
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:27,502
H-Hand over your flags.

312
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:29,343
(The members of He Yan's team are)

313
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,462
(of mixed quality,)

314
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:32,392
(but each has talents.)

315
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:34,663
(If he can harness their talents)

316
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:35,823
(through deployment,)

317
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:36,983
(they should)

318
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:38,502
(make quite a team.)

319
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:39,743
Take action.

320
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:43,903
Do you surrender?

321
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:44,743
Y-Yeah.

322
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:47,262
W-Where are your flags?

323
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:01,622
Commander.

324
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:03,583
He Yan's team
set up ambushes and snatched

325
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,223
many flags from the other teams.

326
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:06,463
"Hold the ground,"

327
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:08,222
"stay fresh, and strike"

328
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:10,863
"when the enemy is weak."

329
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:13,903
Those new recruits

330
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:16,423
are being thoroughly outplayed.

331
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:32,142
What a surprise.

332
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,800
You also captured seven flags.

333
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,982
That's impressive.

334
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:37,863
You flatter me.

335
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,062
Now we each hold seven flags.

336
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,728
Whoever claims
the last one in the valley

337
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:43,943
becomes the winner.

338
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:45,982
That terrain is treacherous.

339
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:47,742
Why don't you retreat

340
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:49,863
with your team to secure second place?

341
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:52,983
That may be good,

342
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,823
but I crave first place.

343
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:59,062
Very well. We'll meet in the valley.

344
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,262
Mr. Lei, this isn't much fun.

345
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,502
Why don't we spice things up?

346
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:34,943
I'm listening.

347
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:36,142
What do you want?

348
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:37,663
A duel.

349
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:38,902
The loser

350
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:40,583
surrenders all his flags.

351
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:43,863
Those guys? Are they up to it?

352
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:44,823
No way, He.

353
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,022
We worked so hard for these.

354
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:50,382
It's okay, don't worry.

355
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:52,542
If we come to duels,

356
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:54,542
I won't hold back.

357
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,982
You may lose even second place.

358
00:20:58,903 --> 00:20:59,823
I don't like fighting.

359
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,663
But no one can take what I desire

360
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,343
from me.

361
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:06,102
Therefore,

362
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:07,462
I'll have to beat you.

363
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:52,663
He Yan trusts us with his back.

364
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,103
Naturally, we'll eliminate all threats.

365
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,502
You agreed to duel.

366
00:21:56,943 --> 00:21:58,222
But you resorted to tricks?

367
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,542
E-Even bandits...

368
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:02,183
Bandits keep their word better.

369
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:20,343
(Odd moves.)

370
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:43,048
- Nice!
- Well done!

371
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,782
Remarkable, Mr. He.

372
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:48,143
I concede.

373
00:22:49,823 --> 00:22:50,742
You honor me.

374
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:52,943
Commander.

375
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:55,623
He Yan has claimed all 15 flags.

376
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:57,262
His team has returned.

377
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:58,983
You've lost.

378
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,302
Commander,

379
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:02,982
you're a great chess player
and talent scout.

380
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:04,983
I humbly

381
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:06,423
admit defeat.

382
00:23:08,782 --> 00:23:10,982
(If she were truly a planted spy here,)

383
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,223
(she wouldn't eagerly draw my attention)

384
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:15,079
(by flaunting this conquest.)

385
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:17,895
(But she is no ordinary recruit.)

386
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:21,262
(He Yan, what's your intention?)

387
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:22,983
Commander.

388
00:23:23,183 --> 00:23:24,222
The contest concludes.

389
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,143
Shall we proceed with rewards?

390
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:29,983
No rush.

391
00:23:30,502 --> 00:23:34,383
The Mid-Autumn Festival is
in five days. Wait until then.

392
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:38,542
Have you decided the one to be

393
00:23:39,343 --> 00:23:41,222
enrolled in the Nine Banners Battalion?

394
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:09,982
We took first place.

395
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,592
But there's no celebration?

396
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:13,102
This is lame.

397
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,903
There will be a feast.

398
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:15,912
It's just postponed.

399
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:17,142
Rest assured.

400
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:18,383
You'll get your banquet.

401
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:20,943
Don't mock me.

402
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:22,696
Aren't you craving meat?

403
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:24,360
- Of course, we are.
- Of course, we are.

404
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:27,463
He,

405
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:28,743
after you join

406
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:30,583
the Nine Banners Battalion,

407
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:32,222
don't forget us.

408
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:35,183
Never would I.

409
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:42,863
(Let me ask Xiao Jue about this.)

410
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,423
Morning, Master.

411
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:55,423
Master.

412
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,062
I lived up to your expectations

413
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,368
and won first place in the competition.

414
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:00,742
Thanks to your guidance,

415
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:02,782
I can join the Nine Banners Battalion.

416
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:06,312
(Great Master and Talented Disciple)
This is a flower basket I made.

417
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,583
These 15 flags

418
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,143
represent my newly earned honors.

419
00:25:09,143 --> 00:25:10,183
Please accept it

420
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,143
as a token of gratitude.

421
00:25:15,462 --> 00:25:16,302
"Talented disciple"?

422
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,816
You really know
how to toot your own horn.

423
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:21,943
How am I tooting my own horn?

424
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:24,702
Look, it says "Great Master" right here.

425
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:26,382
With our bond,

426
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,104
once I join the battalion,

427
00:25:28,104 --> 00:25:29,102
I'll surely

428
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:30,152
stand by you

429
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:31,102
through thick and thin

430
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:32,143
forever.

431
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:35,302
So eloquent.

432
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:37,143
It's a pity you're not teaching literacy

433
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,623
to the troops.

434
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:39,463
Master,

435
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,062
how can you value my silver tongue

436
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:43,302
over my true capabilities?

437
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:44,776
With abilities like mine,

438
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,120
I'll become your right-hand man

439
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:48,663
once I join the Nine Banners Battalion.

440
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:04,582
Are you really

441
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,383
so eager to join the battalion?

442
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:08,743
Of course.

443
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,024
I'm a real talent.

444
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:12,040
It would be your loss if I didn't join

445
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,542
the Nine Banners Battalion.

446
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:16,022
I won't let you

447
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:17,103
suffer such a great loss

448
00:26:17,103 --> 00:26:18,423
in your life, Commander.

449
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:25,703
Commander.

450
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:27,663
All instructors are waiting for you

451
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:28,702
at the main tent.

452
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:34,183
Military affairs take priority.

453
00:26:34,183 --> 00:26:35,023
Go ahead.

454
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:36,623
We can talk anytime.

455
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:38,943
Wait.

456
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:43,142
Take the pastries from the table.

457
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:53,102
Thank you, Commander.

458
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:59,976
(General Feihong's Mansion)

459
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:01,382
General.

460
00:27:01,903 --> 00:27:02,743
There is

461
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:04,302
no conflict of interest

462
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:05,142
between us.

463
00:27:05,782 --> 00:27:07,912
Wouldn't it be nice if we both

464
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:08,903
served the Master?

465
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:12,982
He wasn't

466
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,742
avoiding you that day.

467
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:17,263
He's just been burdened with worries

468
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:19,183
and has become short-tempered.

469
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:20,903
I wonder what troubles

470
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:22,623
the Chancellor.

471
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:32,302
It's Xiao Jue.

472
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,543
He's causing trouble even in Yezhou.

473
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:36,903
He is drawing attention
with the training

474
00:27:36,903 --> 00:27:38,343
and making outrageous demands

475
00:27:38,343 --> 00:27:40,143
to Yezhou Magistrate Sun Xiangfu

476
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:41,183
for provisions and funds.

477
00:27:41,823 --> 00:27:43,742
Sun Xiangfu is running short on those,

478
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:45,183
but Xiao Jue refuses to back down.

479
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:47,343
They're at an impasse.

480
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:49,583
As the Chancellor's disciple,

481
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:52,102
I'm obligated to go to Yezhou Garrison

482
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:53,462
for mediation.

483
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:54,902
It's just that

484
00:27:55,262 --> 00:27:57,262
I've never been there.

485
00:27:57,903 --> 00:28:00,222
Besides, I'm merely a scholar.

486
00:28:00,742 --> 00:28:01,782
Unlike you,

487
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:04,103
who commands numerous talents,

488
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:07,423
I only have one maid working for me.

489
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:17,022
My guard here knows some martial arts.

490
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:19,302
Once you arrive in Yezhou,

491
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:20,742
you can ask him to run your errands

492
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,143
if you need anything.

493
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:27,623
That would be most helpful.

494
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:29,822
But

495
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:31,423
I can't travel fast.

496
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:33,183
Perhaps, I'll meet

497
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:34,622
your guard in Yezhou

498
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:37,608
so as not to make Magistrate Sun wait.

499
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:41,102
Alright.

500
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,128
Then I'll take my leave.

501
00:28:58,062 --> 00:28:59,222
Once you reach Yezhou,

502
00:28:59,222 --> 00:29:00,742
go straight to Sun Xiangfu

503
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:01,623
for cooperation.

504
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:11,432
General,

505
00:29:11,432 --> 00:29:12,382
won't you

506
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:14,062
be implicated?

507
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,342
What's the problem?

508
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:17,863
Yezhou is Sun Xiangfu's territory.

509
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:19,080
Even if things go south,

510
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,352
Sun Xiangfu is to blame
for his incompetence.

511
00:29:21,352 --> 00:29:23,583
What does it have to do with me?

512
00:29:25,782 --> 00:29:26,622
Chu Zhao wants

513
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:28,103
to claim credit from Chancellor.

514
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,982
We can't let him steal the spotlight.

515
00:29:31,982 --> 00:29:32,822
So, Ding Yi,

516
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:34,856
make sure you succeed.

517
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:36,143
No mistakes are allowed.

518
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:38,822
Yes.

519
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:48,040
(Chu Mansion)

520
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,542
(Late Mother, Chu Mingfang)

521
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:50,382
Mother,

522
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,022
I'm going to Yezhou.

523
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:55,624
I won't be able to speak

524
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:57,302
with you for a while.

525
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:12,463
Young Master.

526
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:14,663
He Rufei envies
that you're valued by Mr. Xu

527
00:30:15,302 --> 00:30:16,982
and is eager to impress Mr. Xu.

528
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,262
If his men reach Yezhou,

529
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:20,840
they might ruin everything.

530
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:22,423
You're mistaken.

531
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:23,902
They'll help us.

532
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,183
He Rufei's guard is

533
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:27,023
as skilled as you

534
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:28,623
in martial arts.

535
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:30,742
It'll save me much effort

536
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:32,702
if he takes on Xiao Jue first.

537
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,143
Besides, once he steps in,

538
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:36,703
whatever happens

539
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,183
won't trace back to Master.

540
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:41,183
And I can stay in the shadows,

541
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:44,183
watch them stir things up in Yezhou,

542
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:45,503
and find a chance

543
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,823
to obtain what Sun Xiangfu holds.

544
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:55,743
Alright. Thanks.

545
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:00,223
Try it.

546
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:01,583
Another veggie dish?

547
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:03,143
The meat dishes will come.

548
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:06,742
Here we go.

549
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,423
Let's all eat and drink heartily today.

550
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,423
Happy Mid-Autumn!

551
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:10,536
- Happy Mid-Autumn!
- Happy Mid-Autumn!

552
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:18,143
Come on, try this.

553
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:21,183
He Yan.

554
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:22,342
He Yan.

555
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,392
Why are you zoning out?

556
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:25,463
What's out there?

557
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:27,542
Isn't it the Mid-Autumn banquet?

558
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:28,742
Where is the Commander?

559
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,760
Huaijin won't come.

560
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:33,622
Why not?

561
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:36,343
Since when do you care
so much about him?

562
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,863
Wasn't he supposed to
announce the enrollment

563
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:41,743
into the Nine Banners Battalion?

564
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:43,183
If he came,

565
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:44,623
would you dare

566
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:46,222
to eat and drink so casually?

567
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:48,983
That's what I mean.

568
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:50,423
You're awkward around him.

569
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,382
He's uneasy in such lively places, too.

570
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:53,302
Why make everyone

571
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,183
uncomfortable?

572
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:56,782
Come on.

573
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:57,622
Top performer.

574
00:31:57,903 --> 00:31:58,743
You go first.

575
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,262
Pass them around, guys.

576
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:03,102
Alright.

577
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:06,302
(What's mine is mine.)

578
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,648
(I can wait a bit longer.)

579
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:10,982
(Joining the battalion)

580
00:32:11,903 --> 00:32:14,783
(brings me one step closer
to reclaiming my position.)

581
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:20,903
Mr. Shen.

582
00:32:21,423 --> 00:32:22,263
Go on.

583
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:23,183
Dig in.

584
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,183
Don't hold back.

585
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,703
- Sit down.
- Yes.

586
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:28,102
Come on, dig in.

587
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:29,223
This is

588
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,702
a Mid-Autumn feast

589
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:32,742
as well as your celebration banquet.

590
00:32:33,863 --> 00:32:35,583
We're usually not allowed to drink,

591
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,143
but you won first place.

592
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:39,622
So I

593
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,502
brought this reward for you.

594
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:44,382
Easy.

595
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:45,782
Don't be late

596
00:32:46,302 --> 00:32:47,542
for the morning training.

597
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:49,782
Or you'll face military discipline.

598
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:51,062
- Yes.
- Yes.

599
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:51,902
Yes.

600
00:32:52,063 --> 00:32:52,903
Get bowls.

601
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:53,823
Get bowls. Hurry.

602
00:32:57,022 --> 00:32:57,862
Come on.

603
00:32:58,302 --> 00:32:59,142
Look at you.

604
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:02,342
Mr. Shen.

605
00:33:03,423 --> 00:33:04,263
Need something?

606
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:07,582
Mr. Shen.

607
00:33:08,022 --> 00:33:10,143
Are you here to announce the enrollment?

608
00:33:13,182 --> 00:33:14,022
Mr. Shen,

609
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:15,423
do you have good news

610
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:16,823
for us?

611
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:18,582
Yeah, Mr. Shen.

612
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:20,342
Stop keeping us in suspense.

613
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,463
Yeah.

614
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,142
Yeah.

615
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,183
After I'm done here,

616
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:28,702
I'll offer Lei Hou

617
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:29,943
my congratulations.

618
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:33,502
Lei Hou?

619
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:34,342
Lei Hou?

620
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:36,023
Not He Yan?

621
00:33:36,343 --> 00:33:37,262
Wait, Mr. Shen.

622
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:38,502
But He took first place...

623
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:40,383
So what?

624
00:33:42,423 --> 00:33:43,263
Get back to it.

625
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:44,342
Don't make a scene.

626
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:46,823
Listen up.

627
00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:48,742
Commander selected soldiers

628
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:51,263
based on a comprehensive evaluation.

629
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:54,462
The contest was just one aspect.

630
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:57,663
He Yan.

631
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,423
Stay sharp.

632
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:00,863
You've got real potential.

633
00:34:01,183 --> 00:34:02,742
You'll have many more chances.
