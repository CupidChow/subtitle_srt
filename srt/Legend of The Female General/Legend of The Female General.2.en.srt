=Legend of The Female General=

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,856
(Xianchang Academy)

23
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:43,653
Today

24
00:01:44,532 --> 00:01:46,653
(Year 14 of Qingyuan, Wei, Xianchang Academy)
marks your first enrollment.

25
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:47,933
I know

26
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,133
you come from privileged families

27
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,732
and have lived in comfort till now.

28
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:56,013
But at Xianchang Academy,

29
00:01:56,732 --> 00:01:58,773
you must study diligently

30
00:01:58,972 --> 00:01:59,933
day and night

31
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:02,332
to refine your talents
through perseverance

32
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:04,293
and serve our nation well.

33
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:08,452
(Master Wei,
Scholar of Xianchang Academy)

34
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:09,293
Young man,

35
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:10,732
what's your name?

36
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:12,652
Why do you keep wearing a mask?

37
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:15,973
Constantly hiding your true appearance

38
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:17,892
is rather rude, don't you think?

39
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:23,413
Master,

40
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,013
I am He Rufei.

41
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,652
My visage is unsightly,

42
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:29,413
and I fear startling others.

43
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:31,452
So I cannot remove this mask.

44
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:40,212
He's the Xiaos' second son?

45
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:42,253
His exceptionalness lives up

46
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,293
to his reputation!

47
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:44,452
Indeed.

48
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:54,133
I, Xiao Jue, apologize for being late.

49
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:55,732
Please forgive me.

50
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:01,864
=Episode 2=

51
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,973
(Cheng Lisu,
Imperial Medical Bureau's Top Disciple)

52
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:30,052
The army doesn't tolerate

53
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,212
flashy things,

54
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:32,892
including you.

55
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:40,573
I traveled so far to join you.

56
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:41,768
You treat me like this?

57
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:44,013
You can go back
for your arranged marriage.

58
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:46,892
If I could beat you,

59
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:47,892
I'd have...

60
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:50,533
beaten you senseless.

61
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:54,373
Feinu, escort Mr. Cheng out.

62
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:56,552
Understood.

63
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,172
Would you really

64
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,052
abandon your friend

65
00:03:59,052 --> 00:03:59,853
in need?

66
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:01,332
Avoiding marriage

67
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:03,013
won't kill you.

68
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,448
At worst, they'll maim you.

69
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:06,373
Xiao Jue.

70
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:07,533
Commander.

71
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:10,332
Uncle.

72
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,293
We're about the same age.

73
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,212
But you're still my maternal uncle.

74
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:15,612
Please let me stay.

75
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:17,288
Okay?

76
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,092
Thank you.

77
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,493
(If you enlist as a woman,)

78
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,133
(it will remain a liability.)

79
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:48,813
(So I have prepared)

80
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:49,772
(for you)

81
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:50,972
(male identity papers)

82
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:52,332
(of He Yan.)

83
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:57,133
(He Yan's Household Register)

84
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,013
You're He Yan, right?

85
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:00,892
(Two names are different)

86
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,053
(in one character.)

87
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,373
(Master's foresight is thoughtful.)

88
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:06,813
To the left tent for screening.

89
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,652
Then to the right tent if you pass

90
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:09,332
to register

91
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:10,412
for uniforms and money.

92
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:11,848
Thank you.

93
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:12,573
Next.

94
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:16,173
Commander, what's screening?

95
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,092
Don't know what screening is?

96
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:19,133
It's simple.

97
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:20,972
Strip naked for the medic's exam.

98
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:22,212
If you're healthy,

99
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:22,852
you'll pass.

100
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:24,733
- Thanks.
- Next.

101
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:31,852
The Gaoxia horse struggles

102
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,332
with the climate.

103
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:34,892
It hasn't eaten.

104
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:36,332
Examine it.

105
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:37,573
See what ails it.

106
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:38,452
What?

107
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,693
I, a future imperial physician,

108
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,693
am treating a horse?

109
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:42,933
As a healer,

110
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:45,092
shouldn't you treat all lives equally?

111
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,373
Besides, Yezhou Garrison
keeps no idlers.

112
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:49,733
If you want to stay,

113
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,613
be useful.

114
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:02,693
Fortunately, this is a mare.

115
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:04,452
Helping it is acceptable.

116
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:05,693
I'd have declined

117
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:06,813
if it were a stallion.

118
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:09,493
Xiao Jue, watch closely.

119
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:10,852
I can both heal

120
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:11,933
and tame horses.

121
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:26,053
Look!

122
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:27,373
It's spooked!

123
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:28,373
It's coming!

124
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:42,408
Make way!

125
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:43,532
Move aside! Move!

126
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:46,772
Move aside!

127
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:32,452
That man's way of taming

128
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:35,013
is unique to the Fuyue Army.

129
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:36,772
He's He Rufei's man?

130
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:42,412
(No, I accidentally gave myself away.)

131
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:43,933
(Xiao Jue noticed it.)

132
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:45,332
Not bad.

133
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,292
He resembles my heroics in the past.

134
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:51,892
That move he just pulled

135
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,933
is way beyond your skills.

136
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:14,892
(Oh no.)

137
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:17,053
(Xiao Jue knows Fuyue Army's moves.)

138
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:19,092
(He definitely recognized it.)

139
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:20,452
(Yet he didn't react.)

140
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:22,532
(He took me)

141
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:23,532
(as He Rufei's man)

142
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,613
(and planned to act against me?)

143
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:29,532
Come on.

144
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:30,412
Let's continue.

145
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:32,172
Gather around!

146
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,532
Impressive.

147
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:38,572
You're small.

148
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:39,532
But you're quite good.

149
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:40,412
You flatter me.

150
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:41,853
My taming skills could

151
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:43,412
never match yours, Instructor.

152
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:45,608
Well...

153
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:48,013
The army needs

154
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:48,892
talents like you.

155
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:51,172
But

156
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:53,093
I haven't been screened yet.

157
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,093
Forget about it.

158
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:55,453
If you can tame such a horse,

159
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,733
your physique must be good.

160
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:57,800
I'll secure the horse.

161
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,368
Then let's handle the documents. Wait.

162
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,613
- Go.
- Thank you.

163
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:02,253
So naughty.

164
00:09:02,572 --> 00:09:03,613
Turn and slash!

165
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:05,812
Since you suspect him,

166
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,133
why not kill him directly

167
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:07,812
for good?

168
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,772
If he's truly a spy sent

169
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:10,733
by the ill-intended one,

170
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:12,013
killing one will

171
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:13,733
only bring replacements.

172
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:16,052
Rather than endless trouble,

173
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:17,333
it's better to keep him

174
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,613
to potentially lure out the mastermind.

175
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:21,373
I wonder

176
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:22,973
whether the mastermind is He Rufei

177
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:23,772
or Xu Jingfu.

178
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:25,133
You said

179
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:26,812
before your father's campaign,

180
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:28,652
he impeached the prime minister.

181
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:30,373
Within days,

182
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:31,532
he fell into an ambush

183
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:32,412
at Mingshui.

184
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:33,932
He Rufei's troops

185
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,213
were a hundred li away,

186
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:36,812
but arrived only

187
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:38,253
on day seven after your father

188
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:39,052
sent the letter.

189
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:40,692
It was intentional.

190
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:41,892
I think

191
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,613
they are birds of a feather.

192
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,532
But we lack concrete evidence.

193
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:48,253
We can't prove

194
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,292
the defeat at Mingshui

195
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:51,253
relates to Xu Jingfu and He Rufei.

196
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:52,733
Nor can we prove

197
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:55,013
their collusion.

198
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:58,133
Now the Xiao Army is weakened

199
00:09:58,812 --> 00:09:59,932
and disliked by His Majesty.

200
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:02,172
We can only investigate covertly.

201
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:04,333
With troop shortages here

202
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,172
and low funds,

203
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,772
building a competent new army

204
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:09,652
is highly challenging.

205
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:17,052
Investigate that man thoroughly.

206
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:18,613
I want to know

207
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:19,652
whose pawn he is.

208
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:21,652
Understood.

209
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:26,717
(Xu Mansion)

210
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:46,600
(Chu Zhao, Disciple of Xu Jingfu)

211
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,424
Master.

212
00:10:58,253 --> 00:10:59,532
Regarding the Que City mission,

213
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:01,532
you've worked hard.

214
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:03,692
As ordered,

215
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,692
I monitored Xiao Jue in Que City.

216
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:07,692
The battle was unwinnable,

217
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,292
yet no one anticipated

218
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:10,652
his ruthless tactic

219
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:11,932
of flooding Que City

220
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:13,493
to force a reversal.

221
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:15,172
Pity

222
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:18,532
those countless lost souls.

223
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:20,772
Zilan,

224
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,292
ensure that Xiao Jue's

225
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:23,932
flooding of Que City

226
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:27,052
and mass slaughter of tens of thousands

227
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,133
are publicly exposed

228
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:32,213
to expose his infamy to the world.

229
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,652
His Majesty's wariness

230
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:36,373
toward him will grow even deeper.

231
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:40,613
Though victorious,

232
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:43,052
he was promoted in name
but demoted in reality.

233
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,333
He was sent to Yezhou Garrison.

234
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:48,692
Even with his conscription rights
restored,

235
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:50,453
that desolate wasteland

236
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:52,652
could never yield decent soldiers.

237
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:54,213
Moreover,

238
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:56,172
I discovered in Que City

239
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:58,213
a fish that slipped through the net.

240
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:01,973
I've positioned him as a hidden pawn

241
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:02,973
in our strategy.

242
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,133
Given time,

243
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,892
he'll become an unstoppable vanguard.

244
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:09,853
Great.

245
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,373
Focus on recovering these coming days.

246
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:13,772
Soon,

247
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,892
you'll be entrusted

248
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:16,733
with greater tasks.

249
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:17,772
Understood.

250
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,133
Chu Zhao.

251
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,013
(Xu Pingting, Daughter of Xu Jingfu)
You're back! Did you bring me a gift?

252
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:31,853
Your impudence grows by the day.

253
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:33,384
Father.

254
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:35,493
I'd never forget.

255
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:42,692
What fragrance is this?

256
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:44,213
Try it to find out.

257
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,013
Try it with me.

258
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,093
Go ahead.

259
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:54,093
Then I'll graciously accept.

260
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:55,528
Let's go.

261
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:13,932
What's wrong with this tinderbox?

262
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:16,133
Let me try.

263
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:23,493
Stop it.

264
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,532
Light it with the candle.

265
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,253
Burn him! Burn him!

266
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,292
(Burn him!)

267
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:44,812
Let me see.

268
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:48,292
You're injured.

269
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:52,453
Are you okay?

270
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:53,932
It's nothing.

271
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:55,932
Just got burned.

272
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:57,572
My grip slipped.

273
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:19,172
Young Master,

274
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:20,652
your injury...

275
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:28,892
(Yingxiang, Chu Zhao's maid)
I know you wounded your left arm

276
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:29,812
intentionally.

277
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:30,692
But...

278
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:32,373
I've failed my duties.

279
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,772
And I was also injured by refugees.

280
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:37,892
I feel ashamed, Master.

281
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,973
You're being too harsh with yourself.

282
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,692
To earn Master's favor,

283
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,532
sacrifices must be made.

284
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:26,412
(A bandit?)

285
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:29,416
(Wang Ba, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

286
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:31,613
Move!

287
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,248
(Zheng Xuan, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

288
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:38,248
(Face-tattooing punishment?)

289
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:39,853
(He was a convict)

290
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,052
(and a rogue.)

291
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:41,812
Boss, your tea.

292
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:44,333
Well-mannered.

293
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:45,652
It's tiring.

294
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:53,160
(Jiang Jiao, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

295
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:55,432
(Escort Agency)

296
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:57,480
(Former escort agency member?)

297
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:58,572
(He must be skilled.)

298
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:00,133
Look away!

299
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:01,493
Pretty boy.

300
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:02,892
(Paler than me.)

301
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,333
(How dare he judge me?)

302
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:09,013
I used to think

303
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:10,373
(Mai, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
I was the shortest one here

304
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:11,493
in the camp.

305
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:12,493
But now

306
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:14,133
you're almost as short as me.

307
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:15,304
Alright.

308
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:16,652
We together eat more

309
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:17,572
to grow taller.

310
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,093
By the way, what's your name?

311
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:21,093
He Yan.

312
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:24,133
Then I'll call you He.

313
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:25,256
Agreed.

314
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:26,493
I'm Mai.

315
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:28,812
I was a farmer.

316
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:29,572
Sleep here.

317
00:16:30,683 --> 00:16:33,224
(Huang Xiong, Yezhou Garrison recruit)

318
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,013
(This one was a hunter.)

319
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:38,733
(A killer wearing prayer beads.)

320
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:39,853
(Interesting.)

321
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,253
Thanks.

322
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:44,692
He,

323
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:47,892
you'll sleep here tonight.

324
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,333
- Okay.
- Let me help.

325
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:50,493
No need.

326
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,132
You claim hostility with Xiao Jue,

327
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:24,132
yet you know

328
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:25,453
the Que City battle

329
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,132
left his reputation in ruins.

330
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:28,372
Aren't you afraid

331
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:30,733
to be implicated by him

332
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:31,893
or slandered?

333
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:33,372
Master,

334
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:34,973
I don't believe

335
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,292
Xiao Jue would flood Que City

336
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:38,852
just for an easy victory.

337
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:39,772
Nor would he

338
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:41,973
sacrifice all the people of Que City

339
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:43,132
as stepping stones

340
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,292
to pave his path to military glory.

341
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:47,332
Most importantly,

342
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,653
the Xiao Army urgently needs
new recruits right now.

343
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:54,572
This way I can stand out quicker

344
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:56,292
and prove myself.

345
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:08,413
(The snoring chorus is impressive.)

346
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:10,213
(I last heard this long ago.)

347
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:33,893
He,

348
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:35,612
you're up so early.

349
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:38,372
Nature called.

350
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:44,453
Mr. Shen.

351
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:46,852
- Mr. Shen.
- Mr. Shen.

352
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,184
(Shen Han,
Head Instructor of Yezhou Garrison)

353
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:00,052
What guy...

354
00:19:01,413 --> 00:19:02,092
Mr. Shen.

355
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:09,693
Good morning, Commander.

356
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:10,453
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

357
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:11,016
Good morning.

358
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:20,772
Up already?

359
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,772
He woke up
from nature's call, Commander.

360
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:33,893
Everyone!

361
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:35,693
Gather at the training field

362
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:38,213
and have ten weighted laps
around the barracks!

363
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:40,292
Not a single lap less.

364
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:41,653
Wait, ten...

365
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:42,933
Ten laps?

366
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:44,413
Why?

367
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,653
It was all because of you!

368
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,733
You had to be an early riser

369
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:59,413
with no team spirit!

370
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:01,372
- Selfish worm!
- Yes, selfish.

371
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:03,253
Go home if you want to sleep in.

372
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:04,653
We're in the army.

373
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:05,893
You...

374
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:07,572
Boss! Boss!

375
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,052
If you don't get out now,

376
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:10,173
you'll be punished harder.

377
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:11,893
Don't be mad.

378
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,173
Stay calm.

379
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:17,532
He,

380
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:18,852
I'm afraid I won't

381
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,092
keep up with the training.

382
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:20,840
Don't worry.

383
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:21,852
Recruit training

384
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:22,852
is always gradual.

385
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,013
Day One will be simple.

386
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:30,253
I can't go on.

387
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:32,132
I can't go on. I really can't.

388
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:37,933
On your feet!

389
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:40,052
Five more laps!

390
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:46,253
Come on, He.

391
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:47,572
I'll count to three.

392
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:48,812
Two, three!

393
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:50,532
Watch it.

394
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:51,572
One, two, three.

395
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:52,612
Let's go.

396
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:58,852
(I didn't know)

397
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,332
(how Xiao Jue trained his men.)

398
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:02,772
(I have finally seen it now.)

399
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:05,852
(It starts so intense right away.)

400
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:09,733
(Xiao Jue)

401
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,572
(has such a pretty face,)

402
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,253
(but he's truly vicious,)

403
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:14,612
(just like before.)

404
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:17,532
(I thought I could earn merits)

405
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:18,733
(and rise quickly.)

406
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:20,213
(But Xiao Jue)

407
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:21,173
(is hard on others)

408
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,572
(and harder on himself.)

409
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:28,013
(It seems serving under him won't)

410
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:29,292
(let me rise)

411
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:30,852
(as easily as I hoped.)

412
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:36,292
(Severely injured and then poisoned,)

413
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:37,893
(in bed for a month.)

414
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,772
(It nearly drained all my strength.)

415
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,733
(I can't go on like this.)

416
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:48,733
Commander, it's only the first day.

417
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:51,052
Aren't you pushing them too hard?

418
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:52,372
Mr. Shen,

419
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:53,893
these recruits

420
00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:55,292
are either country folk

421
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:56,532
or bandits and thugs.

422
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,253
Like with that horse,

423
00:21:58,812 --> 00:22:00,493
the Commander's harsh methods

424
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:01,413
aren't about

425
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:02,413
breaking their spirit.

426
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,612
He's testing their potential.

427
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:06,453
Mr. Cheng, you know

428
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:07,213
our Commander well.

429
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:11,493
Isn't he the horse-taming prodigy

430
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:12,413
from yesterday?

431
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:13,772
Why is everyone else

432
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:14,893
on their seventh lap

433
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:16,493
while he started his fourth?

434
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:18,132
In my opinion,

435
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:19,612
he's lacking in potential.

436
00:22:19,653 --> 00:22:20,173
Don't speak

437
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,053
of my savior that way.

438
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,013
So what if he is?

439
00:22:22,532 --> 00:22:23,332
He could still

440
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:24,852
make a good army cook.

441
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:26,812
Army cook?

442
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:28,893
You underestimate him.

443
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:31,733
I actually think

444
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:33,413
he's perfect

445
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:34,733
scout material.

446
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:47,733
Now we'll learn to use various weapons.

447
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:54,893
I can barely stand.

448
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:07,973
He,

449
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:09,893
why is your sword so short?

450
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:11,653
It's not even arm's length.

451
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:13,493
It's twin blades.

452
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:14,612
Not a sword,

453
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:15,852
but a pair.

454
00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:18,052
W-What twin blades?

455
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,173
Real men use this.

456
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:22,292
So flashy.

457
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:22,893
Exactly.

458
00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:24,572
Sounds like useless decoration.

459
00:23:53,213 --> 00:23:54,653
- Good.
- Not bad.

460
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,532
He's got skills.

461
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:02,653
That should be one technique.

462
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:04,173
That's sad.

463
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:05,733
He can't fight properly.

464
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:11,812
I'm exhausted. Need a break.

465
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:26,173
He's decent.

466
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:29,253
- Good!
- Good!

467
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:30,453
(Lei Hou, Yezhou Garrison recruit)
Impressive!

468
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:37,332
- Good!
- Good!

469
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,092
That's real skill.

470
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:49,013
A-Are you staring or fighting?

471
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:51,052
Move back. My turn first.

472
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:10,173
Impressive!

473
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:11,292
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

474
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:15,253
Your turn.

475
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:17,372
Hurry up.

476
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:25,493
We're on the clock here.

477
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:36,852
Draw it back.

478
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:37,852
Come on.

479
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:41,292
No need.

480
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:42,372
I can't pull

481
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:43,453
this bow.

482
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:49,292
His stance looked decent.

483
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:54,132
This bow requires real strength.

484
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:56,532
We can't blame He Yan.

485
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:02,812
He,

486
00:26:03,413 --> 00:26:04,413
he excels at everything.

487
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:05,812
We need to work harder.

488
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:18,024
Block!

489
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:23,464
Retract!

490
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:26,933
Again.

491
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:28,072
Strike!

492
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:30,856
Thrust!

493
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:34,696
Block!

494
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:38,216
Retract!

495
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:40,292
Again.

496
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:41,768
Strike!

497
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:44,072
Thrust!

498
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:46,184
Block!

499
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,013
What's funny?

500
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:13,893
Pick it up. Keep going.

501
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:19,612
A pretty face with nothing.

502
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:20,812
All show, no skill.

503
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:22,088
Retract!

504
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:27,092
Regardless,

505
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:28,453
he picked up the spear.

506
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:29,852
That's commendable.

507
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:34,772
What did you find about He Yan?

508
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,532
He's from a gatekeeper's family

509
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,132
in Jiazhou.

510
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:38,852
No prior military history.

511
00:27:39,653 --> 00:27:41,213
No suspicious family connections.

512
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:42,532
Currently,

513
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,092
his background checks out.

514
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,253
Yet he's skilled in horsemanship

515
00:27:48,852 --> 00:27:50,733
and knows military routines well.

516
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:52,733
He's clearly a seasoned

517
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:53,413
soldier.

518
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:54,852
But during drills,

519
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:56,812
he performs pathetically.

520
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,292
I'm quite curious.

521
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:01,572
Is he faking it

522
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:03,772
or truly useless?

523
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:08,453
The others?

524
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,640
Commander,

525
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:11,653
recruits have diverse backgrounds.

526
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:12,812
Some have

527
00:28:12,812 --> 00:28:13,372
dubious pasts.

528
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:15,016
But the only one who faked it

529
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:16,413
is this person.

530
00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:27,852
Send two teams from Mingshui.

531
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:29,292
One to Jiazhou

532
00:28:29,812 --> 00:28:31,213
and one to Que City.

533
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:34,092
Investigate this impostor thoroughly.

534
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:35,772
The rest

535
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,612
continue investigating in Mingshui.

536
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:40,328
As you command.

537
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,680
(Longevity of Cranes and Pines)

538
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:58,248
(Song Wan, Xiao Jue's Mother)

539
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:03,013
What's that smell?

540
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:06,933
It seems to be

541
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:08,173
from the mountain pass.

542
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:12,852
The smell of sulfur?

543
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:15,733
A hot spring?

544
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:47,332
(But, Sister,)

545
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,092
(the achievements you have today)

546
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:50,572
are entirely due to

547
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:53,332
your identity
as the He family's legitimate heir.

548
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,372
(Even with the name He Rufei,)

549
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:57,372
as a woman,

550
00:30:58,213 --> 00:30:58,973
how could you

551
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:01,332
(achieve such accomplishments
and reputation?)

552
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,213
(Those were all earned)

553
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:06,893
(through my pain, blood, and tears.)

554
00:31:08,772 --> 00:31:10,132
(The He family's heir)

555
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,413
(are just empty words.)

556
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:15,973
(What's mine)

557
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:18,213
(can't be taken away.)

558
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:34,852
Only months have passed.

559
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:37,453
But it feels like a lifetime ago.

560
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,493
In my past life, I hid in shadows.

561
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,693
Only the moon saw my true face.

562
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:48,052
In this life,

563
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:50,933
I can finally

564
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:54,092
fight with honor.

565
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,332
(With this hot spring)

566
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:03,013
(and proper training,)

567
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:05,213
(I should recover completely)

568
00:32:05,413 --> 00:32:06,213
(in a few days.)
