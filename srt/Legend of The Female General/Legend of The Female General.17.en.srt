Let's go.

24
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,041
Look at this.

25
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:33,840
So beautiful!

26
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,560
Truly lovely.

27
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:38,321
Where are

28
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,921
Mr. Cheng and Miss Song?

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,840
They must've seen something

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,000
delicious or entertaining.

31
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:44,120
Leave them alone.

32
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:48,000
- Great!
- Great!

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,840
What's this?

34
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,081
- Great!
- Great!

35
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:51,000
Well...

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,600
Impressive!

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,761
It's called Plucking Spring.

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Plucking Spring?

39
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,720
The Water God Festival

40
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,641
is a festival for lovers.

41
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:01,680
Besides worshiping the Water God,

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
we prepare programs

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,641
for couples.

44
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:04,761
The Plucking Spring

45
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,120
is one of the traditions.

46
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:07,361
Look, on that tall bridge

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,280
hangs a wooden ball

48
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:09,680
containing the first cluster

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,521
of winter jasmine

50
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:12,160
that bloomed in spring.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
Whoever retrieves it

52
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:14,720
the fastest

53
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,961
wins the Plucking Spring.

54
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:18,600
I see.

55
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,440
Good.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,241
The winner

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,921
gets a grand prize.

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,241
What kind of prizes

59
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:31,201
are there?

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,992
All sorts of treasures

61
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,144
you can imagine.

62
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,120
Looks like you are

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,880
interested.

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,160
Let's check it out.

65
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:44,720
Okay.

66
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:50,241
- Great!
- Great!

67
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:51,600
Good.

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,896
- Great!
- Great!

69
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,680
That's Mr. Qiao.

70
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,880
What kind of whip

71
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
is this?

72
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,241
You've got a good eye!

73
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,160
This is Ziyu Whip, the biggest prize

74
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:09,761
for the Plucking Spring.

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,120
Seems you

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
really like this whip.

77
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,521
It's quite a unique whip.

78
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:18,881
Since you like it,

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,400
I'll get it for you.

80
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,201
Let her husband

81
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:28,280
win it for his wife instead.

82
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,881
Honey.

83
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,201
Don't even think about it.

84
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,280
I'm already thinking.

85
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:40,600
If I don't have to pretend

86
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,112
to be elegant and delicate,

87
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,201
I'd compete to get it myself.

88
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,961
You really want that?

89
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:50,088
Hmm.

90
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,521
Fine weapons are rare.

91
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:53,681
Missing this chance

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,840
would be a pity.

93
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,081
I'll compete.

94
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:03,201
Are you sure?

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,800
Yes.

96
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:06,681
Anyway I can't

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,280
let my wife down.

98
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,561
- Great!
- Great!

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,681
Honey.

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,160
Be careful.

101
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,480
Don't worry, Honey.

102
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:38,881
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,081
Look out!

104
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,480
Amazing!

105
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,160
- Great!
- Great!

106
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:07,368
(Enjoy the beauty and harmony of spring)

107
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,001
That's my nephew.

108
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:30,961
This is the Ziyu Whip.

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,400
Here you go.

110
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:37,160
Thank you.

111
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:38,216
My pleasure.

112
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:39,400
As long as you're happy.

113
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:42,081
I'm genuinely happy.

114
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:14,201
How come

115
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Mr. Cui and the ladies

116
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,081
disappeared?

117
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,641
Probably they wanted us

118
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:19,001
to have privacy.

119
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,441
It's quite weird

120
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,840
to hear you

121
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,081
say something like that

122
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:25,960
in a cold tone.

123
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,081
Let's go.

124
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,448
Make one for her.

125
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:07,521
No need.

126
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,808
Make one.

127
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:09,800
Alright.

128
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
If we buy this,

129
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,761
we can't take it when we leave.

130
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:22,040
Why waste money?

131
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,201
Don't you like it?

132
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,081
If you do, then get one.

133
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:26,961
If you don't pursue something

134
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:27,840
you fear to lose,

135
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,521
that'd be rather dull.

136
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:33,480
Today,

137
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:34,760
you can

138
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,041
do everything you wish to do

139
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:37,760
without worries.

140
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,801
Just be your true self

141
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:42,401
as you've always been.

142
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:44,081
Whatever you like

143
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
and dislike,

144
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
just say it outright.

145
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,041
Don't hold it back.

146
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,000
Can I truly

147
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,120
do whatever I want?

148
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,201
Do as you please.

149
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:02,824
Alright.

150
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,201
Do as I please.

151
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,681
Miss, your dough figurine is ready.

152
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:11,480
Thank you.

153
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:12,480
My pleasure.

154
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,041
Have a look.

155
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,284
Does it look like me?

156
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,520
It's better than you.

157
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,480
Turns out I do

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,432
look like a woman.

159
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:36,561
You are a woman.

160
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:50,880
We followed the faintest clues

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,321
to trace Chai Anxi.

162
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,120
But when I reached his hideout,

163
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:55,081
I was still late.

164
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:57,681
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:58,760
Please punish me.

166
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:00,640
Keep looking.

167
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:02,056
Yes.

168
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
Perhaps we should go back.

169
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
We're Qiao Huanqing

170
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,600
and Wen Yuyan.

171
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,240
We must keep acting.

172
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:29,720
Is Chai Anxi a cockroach?

173
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,041
He's so good at hiding.

174
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:31,961
No worries.

175
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:33,321
He can't escape Jiyang.

176
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,000
I will search everywhere

177
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,041
for him.

178
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:37,544
Look!

179
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:38,201
A snake.

180
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,120
Throw it back!

181
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:40,041
I hate snakes!

182
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:40,880
Throw it away!

183
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:41,520
Come on.

184
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,161
Coward.

185
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:44,201
Taotao.

186
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,120
No more pranks.

187
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:47,161
You're so gullible.

188
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,401
You wear it all day.

189
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,720
Huanqing.

190
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,561
Yuyan.

191
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:08,961
Uncle.

192
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,640
What a coincidence!

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,961
Huanqing and Yuyan

194
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:16,801
stumbled onto Lovers' Bridge.

195
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,161
As a couple,

196
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:18,921
you should

197
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,000
cross this bridge.

198
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:21,520
During the Festival,

199
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,681
lovers crossing this bridge

200
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:26,041
will stay together forever.

201
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,424
Did you hear that?

202
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,161
Stay together forever.

203
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,561
What a dreadful curse.

204
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:34,760
True.

205
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,936
Look!

206
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
This is the Lovers' Bridge.

207
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:41,992
Only genuine lovers

208
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,281
can cross it together.

209
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,600
They can't match me.

210
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:53,760
I've crossed it four times.

211
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:01,480
You're quite romantic.

212
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,240
If I were him,

213
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:08,000
I'd cross just once in my life,

214
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:09,600
with one person only.

215
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:19,081
What a rare opportunity!

216
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,880
Huanqing.

217
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,520
Yuyan.

218
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,840
Go give it a try!

219
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,401
Exactly.

220
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,281
Go ahead.

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,681
Give it a try.

222
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:28,441
Crossing the bridge

223
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:30,321
is about the courage and love

224
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,880
to move forward together.

225
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,961
Love

226
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:34,281
brings you courage.

227
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,161
Courage born from love

228
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:37,480
makes you invincible.

229
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:38,161
Moreover,

230
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,441
the princess favors

231
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,041
lovers with unbreakable bonds.

232
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,880
If you two cross this bridge,

233
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:44,081
it'll make it easier

234
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,360
for you

235
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,921
to visit the princess.

236
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:47,688
Okay.

237
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:52,872
What?

238
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,921
Nothing.

239
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,441
You make great sacrifices

240
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,041
to meet Princess Mengji.

241
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:09,720
Be careful.

242
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,240
Hold onto me.

243
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,161
This bridge looks unstable.

244
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Crossing it together

245
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:19,401
might compromise your reputation, no?

246
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,081
If you can't handle it,

247
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:24,201
then...

248
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:24,872
Never mind.

249
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,640
To meet the princess earlier,

250
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,120
let's get it over with

251
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,041
quickly now.

252
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:32,000
Made it

253
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,720
sound like we're going to die.

254
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,281
You made it sound

255
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,161
like I'm going

256
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:38,520
to live and die with you.

257
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,000
We can live together,

258
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,640
not die together.

259
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:22,401
Commander.

260
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,041
Should we use Qinggong?

261
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:27,081
Or we pretend we're stuck,

262
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:27,760
falling down?

263
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,000
Someone will help us.

264
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:31,120
Grab my collar.

265
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:33,880
Quickly.

266
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,161
Hold tight.

267
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,640
It's so shaky.

268
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:50,321
Will they fall?

269
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,401
No.

270
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,096
They're not like us.

271
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:55,441
What do you mean?

272
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,720
Are you implying

273
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,401
we'd fall?

274
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:58,760
They know martial arts.

275
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,720
But we don't.

276
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,360
Let's watch.

277
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,520
How about making a bet?

278
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:07,281
Let's cross that bridge too.

279
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:08,801
I bet we won't fall.

280
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Should I then bet

281
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,161
that we'll fall?

282
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:11,961
That's madness!

283
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,081
Are you going or not?

284
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:16,520
Sure.

285
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:17,520
Go.

286
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:41,320
Sorry.

287
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,041
(This is worse than daily drills)

288
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,081
(at the training field.)

289
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,081
Almost there.

290
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:33,164
♪Before fate is confirmed♪

291
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:39,528
♪My love rests between your fingers♪

292
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:44,388
♪Farewell tears blurred my sight♪

293
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:47,128
♪Indescribable yearnings♪

294
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:50,760
♪Awaiting the spread of moonlight♪

295
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,840
Sir, keep moving!

296
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:03,400
Go.

297
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:05,457
Oh.

298
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,361
Well done,

299
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:25,681
my nephew indeed, Huanqing.

300
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:26,856
Did it on the first try.

301
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,760
I feared

302
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,000
that if you failed,

303
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,320
you might never try again.

304
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,841
Surprisingly,

305
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,720
you easily crossed the Lovers' Bridge.

306
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:35,961
That's good.

307
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:38,361
Since you crossed the Lovers' Bridge,

308
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:39,601
in this life,

309
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,201
the two of you

310
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:43,800
will never part.

311
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:45,040
Indeed.

312
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:46,401
They will never part.

313
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,456
Where are

314
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,441
Mr. Cheng and Miss Song?

315
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,201
They are

316
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,080
crossing the Lovers' Bridge now.

317
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,520
Careful!

318
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:05,441
As one

319
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:07,320
of the Capital's Four Young Masters,

320
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm reduced to doing this.

321
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,080
It's utterly undignified.

322
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,201
Maybe we should quit.

323
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,320
Cheng Lisu!

324
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:14,520
If you retreat now,

325
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,121
I'll beat you up.

326
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:29,760
Infuriating!

327
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,760
Crossing the bridge or not?

328
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,000
Let's do it!

329
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:40,601
What a surprise!

330
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,800
They bicker all the time.

331
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:43,961
They are actually a couple.

332
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,881
Exactly.

333
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:46,961
Right,

334
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:48,280
back then,

335
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:49,961
I used to tug the braids

336
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,441
of the girl next door.

337
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:52,720
That feeling...

338
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,401
Great!

339
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:05,080
We're already halfway done.

340
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,601
Victory is within reach.

341
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:08,808
We absolutely cannot give up.

342
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:09,441
Hmm.

343
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,601
- Good!
- Good!

344
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:17,133
- Good!
- One more!

345
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:18,601
Look at that one up ahead.

346
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,648
- It's beautiful.
- More!

347
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:22,448
- Great!
- Great!

348
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:31,841
- Great!
- Great!

349
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,000
- Great!
- Great!

350
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,280
Another one!

351
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,161
Mr. Cui.

352
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,841
What a coincidence!

353
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:45,641
Mr. Cui.

354
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,681
Miss Yan, Miss Ling.

355
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:48,441
Why haven't I seen

356
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,441
your parents around?

357
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:51,401
Our parents are on the boat.

358
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:52,480
Min'er and I

359
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,441
came out with servants

360
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,401
for a stroll.

361
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
We'll see the ceremony

362
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,320
and bring back some offerings.

363
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,841
- Great!
- Great!

364
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:05,760
Why are they

365
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,800
wearing masks?

366
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:07,720
Each mask

367
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,121
represents an identity.

368
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:10,841
These are related to legends

369
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:12,121
about the Water God.

370
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:13,240
During the ceremony,

371
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,000
everyone sings and dances together

372
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,681
to spread the legends

373
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,040
about the Water God.

374
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:19,841
It's fascinating.

375
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,024
If you're interested,

376
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,720
you can dance with them

377
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,480
and play a character.

378
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:26,961
After it concludes,

379
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,921
an elder will dip willow branches
in blessed water

380
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,000
and sprinkle the water on everyone.

381
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:33,800
The blessed water

382
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,601
will bring you good fortune.

383
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,841
Why let her join?

384
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,121
Min'er and I also
want to dance on stage.

385
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:43,161
If Mrs. Qiao

386
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,681
joins us,

387
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,961
it'll be better.

388
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,872
Alright!

389
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,401
But I don't usually dance.

390
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,841
You won't laugh at me, right?

391
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,601
Of course not.

392
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,921
We'll teach you.

393
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,320
What's this?

394
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,921
If she doesn't participate,

395
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,881
how can we make a fool of her?

396
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,961
We'll go get masks then.

397
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,280
Go ahead.

398
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,320
Good.

399
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:15,560
You know they have ill intentions.

400
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:17,040
Why not refuse?

401
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:20,361
I'll play it by ear.

402
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,361
Besides,

403
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:23,280
even if I decline, they will try again.

404
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:24,881
I want to see what tricks

405
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:25,841
they're going to play.

406
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,201
You really never stop thinking of

407
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240
becoming a general.

408
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:34,000
Absolutely.

409
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,040
Come on.

410
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
They're waving at me now.

411
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:41,961
I'll go over.

412
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:42,585
Hmm.

413
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:45,361
How interesting!

414
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:48,641
- Great!
- Great!

415
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:49,441
Look!

416
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:50,240
Mr. Cui.

417
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,480
Is something wrong?

418
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,441
A minor issue.

419
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:00,720
Enjoy yourselves

420
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:02,080
and have fun.

421
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:08,361
- Great!
- Great!

422
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:11,080
(Looks like something big happened.)

423
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:39,560
Mrs. Qiao.

424
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,560
There are many people

425
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:42,881
at today's ritual ceremony.

426
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,320
The ceremony master mentioned

427
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,401
that these masks

428
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:46,800
must be assigned by lottery.

429
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
Why don't you draw a lot too?

430
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,441
What's different about these masks?

431
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,480
Different masks

432
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,080
represent different roles.

433
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:56,480
In the myths

434
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,921
of the Water God,

435
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:00,080
there are villains and buffoons.

436
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:01,401
Who knows

437
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,320
which unlucky soul will draw them?

438
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:05,560
I believe you won't

439
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,401
draw any of them.

440
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,601
Alright!

441
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,760
(Liar Fox)

442
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
Liar Fox.

443
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:24,520
It's actually Liar Fox?

444
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,520
How unfortunate!

445
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:28,161
What's wrong with this role?

446
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,560
He's a vicious liar

447
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:33,841
who did evils near water sources.

448
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,040
He swindled people's fortunes,

449
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,480
even targeting elders and children.

450
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,000
The most shameless things

451
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,161
were all done by him.

452
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,320
The deities could

453
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:45,441
no longer tolerate this.

454
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,280
They sent a man of the Water God,

455
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:49,080
an immortal, to subdue him.

456
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:50,480
Then?

457
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,641
The deceiver

458
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,601
could tell countless lies to others,

459
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:57,800
but under the immortal's magic,

460
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,921
he could only speak truths.

461
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
He confessed ten secrets

462
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,961
about himself.

463
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:05,560
Finally, he was imprisoned
in an underwater dungeon,

464
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,520
never to set foot on land again.

465
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:09,740
Oh.

466
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,881
How tragic!

467
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,361
It is tragic indeed.

468
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:14,560
However,

469
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:16,441
since you've drawn that role,

470
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:18,000
you must play Liar Fox.

471
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:21,361
If you accept to join the ritual

472
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,000
but later withdraw,

473
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,441
you'll be punished

474
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,881
by the Water God.

475
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:32,040
Fine.

476
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,841
I can be a buffoon.

477
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,000
Someone

478
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:36,401
has to play it, right?

479
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:46,800
As you said,

480
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,121
Liar Fox must tell secrets

481
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:49,601
to the immortal, right?

482
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:50,881
Correct.

483
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,601
The secrets

484
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,240
must be genuine.

485
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,760
So, Mrs. Qiao,

486
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,681
you have to reveal ten secrets of yours.

487
00:24:58,881 --> 00:24:59,760
The so-called immortal

488
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:00,681
is just a madman

489
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,280
who snoops into others' secrets.

490
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,601
That's the immortal's mask.

491
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:14,560
Let me play the immortal.

492
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:16,161
Why?

493
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:18,881
We already have someone

494
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:19,881
play that role.

495
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,601
My wife's secrets

496
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,800
shouldn't be heard by others.

497
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,681
Put it on.

498
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:49,240
Let me help.

499
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,040
Haven't you worn masks before?

500
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,361
It's not that hard.

501
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,121
You've worn many?

502
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,320
Perhaps I wear masks in my dreams.

503
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:57,224
How should we dance?

504
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,121
I have no idea.

505
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,121
Miss Ling mentioned

506
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:03,592
that Liar Fox must tell the immortal

507
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:04,520
ten secrets.

508
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Now that we're here,

509
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,080
let me tell you

510
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:08,080
my ten secrets.

511
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,121
Go ahead.

512
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,312
I'm listening.

513
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,280
I will

514
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:13,121
start dancing.

515
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,240
I used to handle alcohol well,

516
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:20,280
but now I can't.

517
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,681
I've memorized Wuzi's Art of War.

518
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,568
I'm the number one in Yezhou Garrison.

519
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:28,921
My favorite dish

520
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,720
is mushroom and chicken stew.

521
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:34,681
I gave Lisu's jade pendant

522
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:36,401
to the courtesans

523
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,121
of Wanhua Pavilion.

524
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:40,280
How impressive!

525
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:43,681
In my eyes,

526
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,520
Commander is a good man.

527
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,121
I'm deeply grateful to him.

528
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:49,601
What a smooth talker.

529
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:52,720
Every time Commander misunderstands me,

530
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,921
it breaks my heart.

531
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,961
Go on.

532
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:00,800
Commander and I met

533
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,201
in a former life.

534
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:07,601
I was once a general.

535
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:09,040
I thought

536
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:10,480
you'd say "I will be."

537
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:12,641
The last secret.

538
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,121
I love the moon.

539
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:19,560
Yet the moon doesn't know.

540
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:22,536
That's all.

541
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,635
♪Crimson threads entwine like rings,
binding our first vow♪

542
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:38,076
♪Time lingers as you and I share
overlapping palm lines♪

543
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:42,103
♪Zither and harp
accompany our dancing dreams♪

544
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,552
♪The brocade moon writes our vow,
keeping this promise♪

545
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:19,720
Jiyang has many famous views.

546
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,480
But only the fireflies

547
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,760
at the Firefly Spring

548
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:24,441
are truly renowned.

549
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:25,881
It really is beautiful.

550
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:40,161
Commander.

551
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Why are you being so kind

552
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:43,161
to me today?

553
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,480
Isn't today your birthday?

554
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:49,841
How did you know?

555
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,280
You are

556
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:53,601
not a good liar.

557
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:54,881
Sometimes,

558
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:56,520
your lies are flawed.

559
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,560
Sometimes,

560
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,121
you speak truths or tell lies.

561
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:02,441
It's hard to tell.

562
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:03,841
Frankly,

563
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:06,121
we're the same sort.

564
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:15,848
On your birthday,

565
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,441
don't you make a wish?

566
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,681
Go ahead.

567
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,401
Finish your birthday.

568
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:27,601
I have no wishes.

569
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,280
Making a wish

570
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:33,441
is just self-deception.

571
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:35,201
Whatever I desire,

572
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,040
I'll get it myself.

573
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,520
That's it?

574
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,441
I thought you would

575
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:48,601
wish for promotions and honors

576
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,601
or military achievements.

577
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:56,921
Commander.

578
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,121
Haven't you noticed

579
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:01,361
that since we met,

580
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,800
I've always pretended
to be someone else?

581
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,320
For example, Cheng Lisu

582
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,201
and Wen Yuyan.

583
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:11,401
Who knows
