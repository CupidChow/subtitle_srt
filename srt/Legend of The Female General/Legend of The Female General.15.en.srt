23
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:57,896
Today

24
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,168
Is mother's birthday.

25
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:25,695
Commander.

26
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:27,015
Why are you here?

27
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,120
Chu Zhao has something to do.

28
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,175
He already left.

29
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:44,415
He wrote a letter

30
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:45,536
to you.

31
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:03,536
Osmanthus candy.

32
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:05,776
Eat one when you're sad.

33
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:07,415
You'll feel better.

34
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,175
Cheng Lisu told me.

35
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,135
Thank you.

36
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:31,656
Commander.

37
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:33,295
Do you

38
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:34,895
actually dislike osmanthus candy?

39
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,295
But back at Xianchang Academy,

40
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,056
you carried it with you every day.

41
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:40,816
How did you know

42
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:42,976
about that?

43
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:50,816
I heard it from others.

44
00:03:59,096 --> 00:03:59,936
It's true.

45
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:02,656
When I was young,

46
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,656
my mother gave me a pouch.

47
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:07,400
It was filled with osmanthus candies.

48
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,776
I carried that pouch everywhere.

49
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:11,455
Seeing this,

50
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:14,496
she often made me more candies.

51
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:17,656
Yet after growing up,

52
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,536
I stopped liking sweets.

53
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:21,495
But my mother

54
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,336
made those candies.

55
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,136
So, the candies

56
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,016
must have been delicious.

57
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:35,935
Sure.

58
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:39,175
Very delicious.

59
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:48,968
If you don't want to smile,

60
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:50,656
you don't have to.

61
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:52,536
People

62
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:54,615
have moments of vulnerability.

63
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:01,473
Okay.

64
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,096
It's truly sweet.

65
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:05,935
Commander.

66
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:07,336
Have you ever

67
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,175
given osmanthus candy to others before?

68
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:13,776
I did once.

69
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:15,696
It was the last candy

70
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:16,415
my mother made.

71
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:20,815
It wasn't my first time

72
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:22,175
receiving candy from someone.

73
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:24,536
I gave it to a blind girl

74
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,456
contemplating suicide at Yuhua Temple.

75
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:31,136
(This is osmanthus candy.)

76
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:33,375
The last one

77
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:35,048
remaining in this world.

78
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:37,615
Though it's inedible now,

79
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:39,415
its sweetness remains.

80
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,576
If it was the last one,

81
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:50,175
why did you give it away?

82
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:56,456
To me,

83
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,096
that candy

84
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,815
represented desire and hope.

85
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,576
It was better to give it away

86
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,896
and pacify someone else.

87
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:10,336
Is tonight's moon

88
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:11,696
beautiful?

89
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,576
The moon is bright.

90
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:30,696
The breeze is gentle.

91
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:34,536
It's quite a serene scene.

92
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:51,896
Commander.

93
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,576
Let me give you candy too.

94
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:55,935
Eat this,

95
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:57,864
and you'll feel better.

96
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,776
You're regifting my own candy

97
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:06,696
to me?

98
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,776
Commander,

99
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,576
your words completely

100
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:13,640
ruin the moment.

101
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:33,096
If you're going to Jiyang,

102
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,656
go as a new identity.

103
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:36,055
But last night you said

104
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:37,456
you didn't think of a good one.

105
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,375
Yet we must go

106
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,415
to Jiyang at once.

107
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,536
Commander, I know

108
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:47,080
Chai Anxi is in Jiyang.

109
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,576
We must go.

110
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:49,656
I have an idea.

111
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:50,456
I'll go

112
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,688
to Jiyang first as a scout.

113
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:52,735
You can go

114
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:54,136
once you get a suitable identity.

115
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:58,976
The identity is secured.

116
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:00,536
It's done?

117
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:03,216
I'll use that.

118
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:06,896
But how?

119
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,216
Do your arrangements.

120
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:09,415
I have my resources.

121
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:10,312
Yes.

122
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,656
Mr. Feinu

123
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,216
seems awkward.

124
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:18,096
Commander.

125
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:20,815
Are you planning

126
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:22,935
to use some dishonorable identity?

127
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:38,895
Do you like me?

128
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:54,375
No.

129
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:58,336
I don't.

130
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:08,936
Good then.

131
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:12,135
Good?

132
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:14,775
What's good about it?

133
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:18,416
For the trip to Jiyang,

134
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:19,416
I'll pretend

135
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:21,735
to be Qiao Huanqing,
nephew of Cui Yuezhi,

136
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:22,895
a loyal subordinate

137
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:24,375
under the princess.

138
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:26,696
Qiao Huanqing was lost as a child

139
00:09:26,895 --> 00:09:28,392
and was adopted by a kind merchant.

140
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:29,576
Cui Yuezhi

141
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:30,535
has known where he is.

142
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:32,176
So, he wrote to invite him

143
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:33,015
back to Jiyang.

144
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:35,255
However,

145
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:36,655
Qiao Huanqing

146
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,775
just got married.

147
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:43,688
So, I'll be impersonating...

148
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:44,615
Mrs. Qiao.

149
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,135
Qiao Huanqing's wife's name

150
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:54,088
is Wen Yuyan.

151
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,375
She's a renowned, talented woman.

152
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:59,056
Qiao Huanqing likes her very much,

153
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,424
often boasting about her.

154
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:02,735
Therefore, he'll undoubtedly

155
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:04,696
go to Jiyang with his wife.

156
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,002
Alright.

157
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:12,584
If we're acting,
we must make it look real.

158
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:14,176
But I have a question.

159
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:15,135
Look,

160
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:16,655
I don't

161
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:18,568
look like a talented lady

162
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,696
whatsoever.

163
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,296
Maybe I should go to Jiyang first

164
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,576
as your vanguard.

165
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:28,015
Feinu will

166
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:29,615
have someone else do that.

167
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,416
Your current mission

168
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:32,696
is to transform yourself

169
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:33,375
into a good lady.

170
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:34,816
Be an average lady

171
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:36,416
at least.

172
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,135
You should

173
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:40,015
at least know some talent.

174
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:42,135
Show your strongest skill

175
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:44,008
and practice it.

176
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:04,255
Done.

177
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,255
This is your strongest skill?

178
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:07,189
Sure.

179
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:09,535
This character's eight strokes

180
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,456
best showcase foundational skills.

181
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:17,696
(If I weren't afraid)

182
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:19,375
(you'd recognize my handwriting,)

183
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:21,535
(would I need to hide my ability?)

184
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:01,655
Commander.

185
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,936
I'm trying my best.

186
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:09,495
Let me draw maps instead.

187
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,735
That's where I excel.

188
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,535
No one could possibly surpass me.

189
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:17,296
You're supposed to play Mrs. Qiao,

190
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:18,816
not General Qiao.

191
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,168
Among these instruments,

192
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,672
is there any you're good at

193
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:41,696
or passable with?

194
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:45,000
The ones you know aren't here?

195
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:48,576
Complete amateur.

196
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:57,775
Then focus on guqin skills.

197
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,696
At least learn one piece

198
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:00,936
to bluff others.

199
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,614
Alright.

200
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,192

207
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:05,855
might make me think you fancy me.

208
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,416
I...

209
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:13,296
You are

210
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:15,464
good-looking.

211
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:17,615
Being so confident isn't surprising.

212
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:20,056
But don't get me wrong.

213
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:24,135
I'm just worried my bad playing

214
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,336
will embarrass me publicly.

215
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:29,096
Then practice harder.

216
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:30,501
Hmm.

217
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,816
Don't tense your hands.

218
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,696
Drooping naturally.

219
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:43,296
Just go with it.

Commander.

230
00:16:59,015 --> 00:16:59,895
Any improvement?

231
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,656
Your posture looks good now.

232
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:08,095
My playing?

233
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:09,976
The playing

234
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:12,176
is very loud.

235
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:06,216
Weird.

236
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:08,136
Why does the sound

237
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:10,056
differ so much from Commander's?

238
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:15,656
Commander Xiao wants you

239
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:16,295
to cross-dress,

240
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:17,856
disregards your injuries,

241
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:18,976
and forces you

242
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:19,936
to practice.

243
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:22,696
This is really too much!

244
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:24,776
Miss Song.

245
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:26,095
My injuries healed long ago.

246
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:26,656
I'm good now.

247
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:27,896
He.

248
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:29,896
Stop speaking for Commander Xiao.

249
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:31,432
The scent of blood on you

250
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:32,535
won't escape my notice.

251
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:33,696
I have a keen nose.

252
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:36,095
I prepared

253
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:36,976
a tonic for you.

254
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,376
Later,

255
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:39,535
I'll check your pulse.

256
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:41,936
The quack, Cheng Lisu, can't be trusted.

257
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:43,848
He actually said you fully recovered.

258
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:46,136
No need for that.

259
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,880
Mr. Cheng is a good physician.

260
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:48,680
I'm good.

261
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:50,184
His diagnosis must be accurate.

262
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:51,176
He.

263
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,616
My medical skills are good.

264
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:54,295
You're avoiding treatment.

265
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:55,936
Let me check your pulse.

266
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:56,815
No, you don't...

267
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:57,775
Let me do it.

268
00:18:57,775 --> 00:18:58,535
No need, Miss Song.

269
00:18:58,535 --> 00:18:59,144
Let me help.

270
00:18:59,144 --> 00:18:59,856
No need.

271
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:00,616
Let me do it.

272
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:01,376
No need.

273
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:01,976
Come on.

274
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,815
No, really.

275
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:03,856
I...

276
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:23,055
Miss Song.

277
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:24,896
Well, let me explain.

278
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:26,696
Well, Miss Song...

279
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:35,400
Huaijin.

280
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:36,264
Don't worry.

281
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:38,024
I spent a fortune hiring

282
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:38,775
a makeup artist.

283
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:39,896
She'll make Miss He

284
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,575
outshine everyone.

285
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:44,776
I don't care.

286
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:46,335
Look...

287
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:53,128
What happened?

288
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:56,416
Miss Song knows.

289
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:57,896
About what?

290
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,656
You. Come with me.

291
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,704
All of you

292
00:20:01,815 --> 00:20:02,416
go in and wait.

293
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:13,775
Utterly outrageous!

294
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:20,616
Miss Song.

295
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:23,176
Though I didn't mean to hide the fact

296
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,575
that I am a woman,

297
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:26,735
I did deceive you.

298
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:29,055
If you're angry,

299
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,176
vent your fury on me.

300
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:31,656
You may even hit me.

301
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:32,735
I won't fight back.

302
00:20:34,696 --> 00:20:35,376
Please.

303
00:20:35,696 --> 00:20:36,936
Are you asking for a beating?

304
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:38,095
After all,

305
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:40,295
it's my fault.

306
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:42,136
Do you think

307
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:43,255
I'm angry

308
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:44,216
about your deception?

309
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:46,815
Aren't you?

310
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:48,775
Of course not!

311
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:50,575
I understand your plight.

312
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:52,815
A woman in the military faces hardships.

313
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:54,616
Your caution is justified.

314
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:56,575
I'm only upset

315
00:20:56,575 --> 00:20:57,576
that you don't trust me

316
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,495
or tell me the truth sooner.

317
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:01,295
Had you told me earlier,

318
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:02,335
I could've started

319
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,335
to nurse you earlier.

320
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,376
He is skilled in women's health,

321
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:06,936
but I'm much better than he is.

322
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:10,095
Moreover,

323
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,495
I can smell the blood on you.

324
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,216
Did you just start your period?

325
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:16,295
Yeah.

326
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,928
How could you
touch cold water yesterday?

327
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:20,456
You're used to disguising yourself
as a man,

328
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:21,656
but don't forget

329
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,775
you're a woman.

330
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:24,295
That's self-responsibility.

331
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:26,976
Miss Song.

332
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:28,255
Thank you.

333
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,656
I know you're kind-hearted.

334
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:32,295
I trust you, actually.

335
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:34,015
But I've been hiding it

336
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:35,495
for years.

337
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,656
It's become an ingrained habit.

338
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,535
It's hard to say it out.

339
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:44,616
However,

340
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:45,735
one day,

341
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,335
I'll stand openly before all

342
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,656
as a woman,

343
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:52,255
telling the world

344
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:55,616
that I'm a woman,

345
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:57,456
but I'm no less capable than men,

346
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:59,255
and I'll become a great general.

347
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:01,064
Good point.

348
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,255
I will also prove to the world

349
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:04,456
that women

350
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,055
can practice medicine.

351
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:07,815
What right do they have

352
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:08,584
to criticize us?

353
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,176
If given the choice,

354
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:12,416
who would choose to be a domestic woman

355
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,976
being judged by a man?

356
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:15,896
You are

357
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:17,376
an extraordinary woman.

358
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:22,735
You're wise and brave.

359
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:32,136
Why haven't they come yet?

360
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:35,735
Huaijin.

361
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:36,896
Well,

362
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:37,775
since she knows

363
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:38,976
He Yan is actually a woman,

364
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:40,055
will she

365
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:41,535
poison her in a fit of rage?

366
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:43,400
She won't.

367
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:46,056
How can you be sure?

368
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:47,616
Didn't you see how mad she was?

369
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:48,904
- She even ordered you.
- Don't worry

370
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:49,832
- Be careful.
- I will.

371
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:50,416
Alright.

372
00:22:57,295 --> 00:22:59,856
Are you two okay?

373
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:01,936
We're perfectly good.

374
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:03,775
Are we good, Yan?

375
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:04,735
Sure.

376
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:05,936
We're good.

377
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:08,015
Are you alright?

378
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:09,416
Are you alright?

379
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,535
I...

380
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,735
Are you alright?

381
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,976
The expensive makeup artist

382
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:20,936
you hired

383
00:23:21,696 --> 00:23:22,575
can be dismissed.

384
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:24,520
I...

385
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,335
Any objections?

386
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:29,936
None.

387
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,696
Thank you, Miss Song.

388
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:33,267
Mmm.

389
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:53,616
Commander.

390
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:54,616
He Yan...

391
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:56,584
She's a woman?

392
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:57,856
Impressive.

393
00:24:58,055 --> 00:24:58,936
- You...
- Stop.

394
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:01,616
Do you deserve to stand beside Yan?

395
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:02,735
Yan?

396
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:04,456
I knew Miss He

397
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:05,575
much earlier than you.

398
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:08,335
Commander.

399
00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:11,456
Commander.

400
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:12,575
Well,

401
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:13,936
how do I look?

402
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:15,735
Will my beauty kill everyone?

403
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:17,032
Kill everyone?

404
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,255
How about

405
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:20,015
I give you a sword?

406
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:23,856
Board the carriage

407
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,775
to avoid being spotted.

408
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:27,080
Sure.

409
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:28,095
Nobody knows

410
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:28,976
you're leaving.

411
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:43,666
Mmm.

412
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:11,376
Sit properly.

413
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:13,216
You're now Wen Yuyan,

414
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:13,815
a noble lady,

415
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:15,535
not a soldier.

416
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:18,176
Don't fret, Yan.

417
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:19,735
We have days of travel ahead.

418
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:21,216
When we reach Jiyang,

419
00:26:21,216 --> 00:26:22,696
you'll already master the role.

420
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,216
Since we're impersonating others,

421
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:27,815
we must do it flawlessly.

422
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:28,856
No slip-ups allowed.

423
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:29,856
As for me,

424
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,535
I'll reluctantly act as the steward.

425
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:32,856
You

426
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:34,335
clearly look like a maid.

427
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:36,055
Cheng Lisu.

428
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:38,575
Now that you and Huaijin

429
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:39,936
are pretending to be a couple,

430
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:40,815
your forms of address

431
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:42,055
mustn't be neglected.

432
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:43,735
You should call Huaijin honey

433
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:44,376
as a wife.

434
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:45,216
Naturally,

435
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:46,376
Huaijin should call you honey

436
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:46,896
as a husband.

437
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:47,976
Why don't you practice

438
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:48,896
to get accustomed?

439
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:52,936
What a terrible idea!

440
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:53,896
What's wrong?

441
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,015
This is all

442
00:26:55,055 --> 00:26:56,055
for the task.

443
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:57,136
Don't be shy.

444
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:58,856
Come on. Give it a try.

445
00:26:59,136 --> 00:26:59,696
Try it.

446
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:05,255
- Ho...
- No need.

447
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:09,376
I believe

448
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:11,376
you'll do well.

449
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:14,936
Boring. Not fun at all.

450
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:26,024
(Jiyang City)

451
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:46,815
Look there.

452
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:21,976
Where's Feinu?

453
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,535
He has other matters to attend to.

454
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,416
Then let's go to the Cui Mansion first.

455
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:29,495
Once we're settled,

456
00:28:29,495 --> 00:28:30,632
it'll be easy to do things.

457
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:37,456
What do you say,

458
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,432
Honey?

459
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:45,456
It made sense.

460
00:28:55,495 --> 00:28:56,840
Still no trace of Chai Anxi?

461
00:28:57,575 --> 00:28:58,095
Not yet.

462
00:28:58,535 --> 00:28:59,976
Xiao Jue's men keep watching us.

463
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:01,616
It restricts our movements.

464
00:29:02,216 --> 00:29:03,176
Chancellor Xu gave us

465
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:03,896
sufficient men.

466
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:05,416
When they entered the city,
I already told them

467
00:29:05,456 --> 00:29:06,760
to monitor all city gates.

468
00:29:07,095 --> 00:29:08,775
Chai Anxi must still be in the city.

469
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:10,760
Sufficient men?

470
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:12,416
It seems Chancellor Xu

471
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:14,176
sees Chai Anxi as a big threat.

472
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:16,216
Xiao Jue has arrived.

473
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:17,976
You investigate his motives.

474
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:19,912
His position in Jiyang

475
00:29:19,912 --> 00:29:20,696
restricts him.

476
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:21,616
He might come

477
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,495
as a new identity.

478
00:29:24,856 --> 00:29:26,376
This time, we'll monitor Xiao Jue.

479
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:27,896
Given his familiarity

480
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:28,575
with Chai Anxi,

481
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,616
he'll locate our target before us.

482
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,936
We'll use him to get what we want.

483
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:33,896
Understood.

484
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,959
(Cui Mansion)

485
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:49,896
Escort Mr. Cheng and Taotao

486
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:51,208
to put luggage in the backyard.

487
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,775
Huanqing, Yuyan,

488
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:54,136
follow me, please.

489
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:06,896
Master, they've arrived.

490
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:12,495
Uncle.

491
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:16,456
Come, Yuyan.

492
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:18,216
You're truly blessed.

493
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:18,936
Indeed.

494
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:20,616
Huanqing and you make a perfect match.

495
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:21,176
Thanks.

496
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:21,856
Exactly.

497
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:24,255
(Cui Yuezhi, General of Jiyang)
Wonderful.

498
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:24,976
Right.

499
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:26,976
Your arrival

500
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:28,255
is a blessing to our family.

501
00:30:28,255 --> 00:30:29,815
What an outstanding man!

502
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:33,095
Look at his face

503
00:30:33,575 --> 00:30:34,344
and his stature.

504
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:35,376
He looks like me,

505
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,176
right?

506
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:37,064
Absolutely.

507
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:39,015
Obviously, we're a family.

508
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:40,815
You're right.

509
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:42,376
I also think

510
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:43,784
I look a little like you.

511
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:45,832
You are uncle and nephew, after all.

512
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,176
You two are related.

513
00:30:48,072 --> 00:30:48,936
Look,

514
00:30:49,535 --> 00:30:50,728
this is Yuyan.

515
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:54,472
Uncle.

516
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:55,976
Yuyan

517
00:30:56,216 --> 00:30:57,456
is a beautiful lady.

518
00:30:57,775 --> 00:30:59,432
Her future children with Huanqing

519
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:01,352
will surely be stunning.

520
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:02,295
True.

521
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:02,815
Am I right?

522
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:03,456
Yes.

523
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:04,896
By the way,

524
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:06,176
tomorrow at the mansion,

525
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:07,144
I'll host a banquet

526
00:31:07,144 --> 00:31:08,095
to welcome you both.

527
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:10,495
Colleagues and their families

528
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:11,295
will come.

529
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:12,872
It helps you make connections.

530
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:14,216
I have no children,

531
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:16,136
but I'll tell everyone

532
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,408
that my family already has a successor.

533
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:19,575
Thank you, Uncle.

534
00:31:21,095 --> 00:31:21,616
Master.

535
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:23,735
Huanqing and Yuyan

536
00:31:24,055 --> 00:31:25,416
had an exhausting journey.

537
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:27,775
Let me take them to rest first.

538
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,535
We have plenty of time
for small talk later.

539
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:32,495
Alright.

540
00:31:32,936 --> 00:31:33,495
Come.

541
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:35,976
This way.

542
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:38,015
This

543
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:39,624
is the most beautiful courtyard

544
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:41,335
in the mansion.

545
00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:42,055
Look.

546
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:43,656
There are hills and rivers.

547
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:45,616
Well,

548
00:31:46,055 --> 00:31:47,535
this is actually the best chamber

549
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:49,176
in this courtyard.

550
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,336
When I heard you were coming,

551
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:52,656
I had people

552
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:54,456
prepare everything well.

553
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,936
Moreover,

554
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:58,616
I specifically

555
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:01,216
prepared a surprise for you.

556
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:03,335
Please come in.

557
00:32:31,335 --> 00:32:32,360
You are

558
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:33,456
a newlywed couple.

559
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:35,416
I had craftsmen

560
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:36,775
decorate it as a bridal chamber.

561
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:37,832
Take a look.

562
00:32:37,976 --> 00:32:38,815
Do you like it?

563
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:42,136
Thank you, Ms. Wei.

564
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:43,376
I like it very much.

565
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:51,848
My husband will certainly love it too.

566
00:32:57,456 --> 00:32:58,344
If you're pleased,

567
00:32:59,456 --> 00:33:00,216
so will I.

568
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:03,295
I will

569
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:04,735
leave you two alone.

570
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:06,376
Your steward Mr. Cheng

571
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:07,336
and Taotao

572
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,216
have been properly accommodated.

573
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,216
Thanks.

574
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:11,775
- I'll take my leave now.
- Hmm.

575
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:16,255
Surprise!

576
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:33,575
Commander, look.

577
00:33:41,055 --> 00:33:41,575
Don't look.

578
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:44,136
Don't look.

579
00:33:45,295 --> 00:33:45,896
Why not?

580
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,255
Don't ask.

581
00:33:51,055 --> 00:33:52,255
But I want to see it.

582
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:00,712
It's just an erotic art picture.

583
00:34:00,936 --> 00:34:02,176
It's nothing special.

584
00:34:02,176 --> 00:34:02,936
Come on.

585
00:34:02,936 --> 00:34:04,008
No big deal.

586
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:07,416
You

587
00:34:08,055 --> 00:34:08,736
never feel shy.

588
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,135
It's drawn

589
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,336
for people, isn't it?

590
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:13,495
There's no shame in it.

591
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:14,695
Only hypocrites

592
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:15,695
pretend to be a prude.

593
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:20,200
Well,

594
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:23,976
those who follow sages' teachings

595
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:25,416
are true gentlemen,

596
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:26,575
for example,

597
00:34:27,055 --> 00:34:28,616
someone like you.

598
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:35,880
Oh really?

599
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:39,016
Do you think

600
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:42,575
a true gentleman

601
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,376
behaves like me?

602
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:47,976
Commander.

603
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:50,135
Commander.

604
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:04,695
Well,

605
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,416
I haven't closely watched

606
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:09,495
this yet.

607
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:10,296
It's destroyed.

608
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,575
What a pity!

609
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:18,856
Shall I find an artisan

610
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:20,535
to restore it for you?

611
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:23,776
No need.

612
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:25,776
Forget it.

613
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:27,695
This drawing

614
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:28,535
is not that good.

615
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:30,256
I've seen superior ones.

616
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:31,456
If I acquire some,

617
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:32,808
I'll share them with you.

618
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:36,360
Come back.

619
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:37,695
Did you

620
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,456
get any news?

621
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,392
Commander.

622
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:41,736
I contacted our men

623
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:42,535
who arrived earlier.

624
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:44,648
Chu Zhao hasn't located Chai Anxi.

625
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:45,816
Our men also failed

626
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:46,615
to find Chai Anxi.

627
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:49,535
If Xu Jingfu is behind this,

628
00:36:49,896 --> 00:36:51,176
he will try to kill Chai Anxi.

629
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:52,655
We must find Chai Anxi

630
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:53,856
before he does.

631
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:56,776
Chai Anxi campaigned with his father.

632
00:36:57,655 --> 00:36:58,792
His left leg was injured.

633
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:00,575
Though he was treated,

634
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:01,832
in the end,

635
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:03,176
he suffered from rheumatism.

636
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:05,064
Jiyang's warm, humid weather

637
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:06,888
may aggravate his old injury.

638
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:09,544
Monitor all apothecaries.

639
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:11,095
Understood.

640
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:14,896
Commander, let me help Feinu.

641
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:17,640
Focus on perfecting your role

642
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:19,135
as Mrs. Qiao.

643
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,288
Don't expose us at tomorrow's banquet,

644
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:22,976
or they'll drive us out of Jiyang.

645
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:24,376
Don't...

646
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:28,215
Don't worry.

647
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:30,535
I'll do it flawlessly.

648
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:01,575
Honey.

649
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:04,495
I heard

650
00:38:04,776 --> 00:38:06,856
about what a lovely couple looks like.

651
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:08,495
The husband

652
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:10,575
helps his wife fill in her eyebrows.

653
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:12,095
Could you

654
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:14,776
do it for me?

655
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:26,135
You said we mustn't expose ourselves.

656
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:27,856
So, we need

657
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,976
to act perfectly.

658
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:43,095
Are you

659
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:44,968
really doing my eyebrows?

660
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:46,024
Are you scared?

661
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:48,256
Scared? Why would I be?

662
00:38:49,135 --> 00:38:50,376
I just fear you'll fail.

663
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:23,695
Don't move.

664
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:47,575
W-What's wrong?

665
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,535
Why

666
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:51,416
is your face so red?

667
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:52,776
Red?

668
00:39:54,856 --> 00:39:55,368
Is it?

669
00:39:58,175 --> 00:40:00,456
Maybe the weather here is too hot.

670
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:02,495
I haven't adjusted yet.

671
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,029
- Hmm.
- Oh.

672
00:40:04,575 --> 00:40:05,192
Is that so?

673
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:07,135
Of course!

674
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:11,296
I thought

675
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:12,575
you...

676
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:15,656
Well,

677
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:17,575
what?

678
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:28,776
Nothing.

679
00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:30,936
Nothing.

680
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:35,095
Let's go.

681
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,376
Wait, that's not right.

682
00:40:51,936 --> 00:40:54,575
The banquet doesn't start
until the afternoon.

683
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:08,015
Enjoy it.

684
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:23,615
Here, My lord.

685
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:28,840
Jiyang,
surrounded by mountains and rivers,

686
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:30,920
is easy to defend but hard to attack.

687
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:32,488
To achieve a quick victory,

688
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:35,655
we must storm the southern gate.

689
00:41:36,055 --> 00:41:36,816
Thank you

690
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:39,256
for sharing the secret tunnel

691
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:40,135
leading into the city.

692
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:42,976
Though long abandoned,

693
00:41:43,215 --> 00:41:44,776
this tunnel could be useful

694
00:41:45,215 --> 00:41:47,936
to Wutuo.

695
00:41:48,736 --> 00:41:50,936
Mr. Maningbu

696
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:52,776
and I are old friends.

697
00:41:53,495 --> 00:41:55,880
Naturally, I should help him.

698
00:41:56,336 --> 00:41:57,416
You're absolutely right.

699
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:58,575
Mr. Maningbu

700
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:00,575
sent me word the other day.

701
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,256
He cannot visit Wei himself,

702
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:05,296
but asked me to convey his gratitude.

703
00:42:07,296 --> 00:42:08,296
He also said

704
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:11,720
if you ever need assistance,

705
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,135
Wutuo will help without reservation.

706
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,296
Actually,

707
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:21,215
there is something

708
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:23,376
I need your help with.

709
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,336
I'm glad to help.

710
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:27,112
Just say the word.

711
00:42:34,976 --> 00:42:37,175
A man named Chai Anxi

712
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:39,256
currently resides in Jiyang.

713
00:42:39,655 --> 00:42:40,736
Could you

714
00:42:41,376 --> 00:42:43,575
get rid of him discreetly?
