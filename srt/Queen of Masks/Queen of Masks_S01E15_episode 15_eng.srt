1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,800
 Assemblyman Gi apparently fell off the rooftop of Kangbo Hotel.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,120
 Sounds like it was suicide.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,990
 How could that happen?

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,900
 How could that be?

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,780
I must cut him off.

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,440

7
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,740
Yes, Jae Yi.

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,920
Hey, Kang Hoo.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,550
Can you really not come tonight?

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,320
Sure, I'll come.

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,010
Thank you.

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,900
- Jae Yi.
  - Yeah?

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,230
I love you.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,010
I love you, Jae Yi.

15
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,380
Please wait for me for a little while.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,020

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,350
Yes.

18
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,840
Send him up.

19
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,400

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,100
We might need to use tonight the tracker that Choi Kang Hoo put on your car.

21
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,020
Don't you feel uncomfortable being in this room?

22
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,290
It's a bit familiar.

23
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,900
It's my hotel.

24
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,250
Why wouldn't it feel familiar?

25
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,920
There isn't a single room I haven't looked at.

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,870
Haven't you thought I might tell Jae Yi?

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,560
If you were, you wouldn't have come to see me.

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,580
You're way more shameless than I expected.

29
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,660
But you're still Jae Yi's father. So I'm here to give you a chance.

30
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,100
How about you turn yourself in?

31
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,610
Turn myself in? For what?

32
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,020
Do I have to bring evidence to make you admit?

33
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,820
There is evidence?

34
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,410
Should I remind you

35
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,520
how you brutally killed that "clingy bastard"?

36
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,970
 You came.

37
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,860
 Dad...

38
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,350
 Clingy bastard.

39
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Do you finally feel like turning yourself in?

40
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,390
I'll be honest with you, since you supposedly know everything.

41
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,520
Was it wrong to kill Gi Do Shik?

42
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,410
He deserved to die, didn't he?

43
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,420
Then you should've killed Song Je Hyeok with that knife!

44
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,690
Don't you know what he did to Jae Yi?

45
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,010
That's why I got him killed for her.

46
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,160
Didn't I do my job as a father?

47
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,200
If you really killed Song Je Hyeok, it probably wasn't for Jae Yi.

48
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,700
You're the one who killed Gi Yoon Chul, too,

49
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,500
because the Angel's Club you created was exposed!

50
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,920
As you said,

51
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,610
I'm a ruthless father who even sacrificed his daughter for his ambition.

52
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,010
But as time went by,

53
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,750
I realized how important sharing blood with someone is.

54
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,840
That's why I saved her when Song Je Hyeok tried to kill her at the hospital.

55
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,800
And you saw it, too.

56
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,910
Jae Yi is very loving toward me.

57
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,210
As long as you keep quiet,

58
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,940
Jae Yi could be loved by her father.

59
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,750
It's something she has been wanting her whole life.

60
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,730
What Jae Yi wants has always been the truth!

61
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,800
Both 10 years ago and now!

62
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,770
You should've known that much as her father.

63
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,090
So you have to punish me?

64
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,440
I understand.

65
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,800
I'll go to the police station on my own tomorrow morning.

66
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,590
You can give me that much time, right?

67
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,770
It's my last request... as Jae Yi's father.

68
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,640
You'd better keep that promise.

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,090
Otherwise,

70
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,090
the ugly side of you will be broadcasted live everywhere in the country.

71
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,670

72
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,350
He's on his way. Finish him off.

73
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,690

74
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,550
 See you soon.

75
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,900
 We'll be having dinner, just the two of us.

76
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,530

77
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,720
Yes, Mr. Myung.

78
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,740
Didn't you say you were leaving tonight?

79
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,170
I'm at the Port of Incheon right now.

80
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,970
I don't even see a captain to board me. Something's kind of off.

81
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,380
 Could they have noticed something, by chance?

82
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,400
Hold on a second.

83
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,910
You're right.

84
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,190
 Looks like

85
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,850
Secretary Choi noticed something. He's on his way there.

86
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,900
 Sir! I'll die, then! Help me! Help me!

87
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,030
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

88
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,380

89
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,180

90
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,890

91
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,220

92
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,830

93
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,980
She has been playing ignorant all this time?

94
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,690
Na Na, you came!

95
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,200
You're from next door, right?

96
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,440
Thank you for bringing her here.

97
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,750
Would you like to come in for a second?

98
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,390
I don't have to come in.

99
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,450
Where's Na Na's mother?

100
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,640
She went out for a moment.

101
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm Na Na's babysitter.

102
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,860
Then I'll just tell you instead.

103
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,140
I don't want Na Na to hang out with my son from now on.

104
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,050
What do you mean?

105
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,520
You know what kind of man her father was.

106
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,960
It's scary to even think about having someone like that as a neighbor.

107
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,560
Looks like you don't know what's really scary yet.

108
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,140
Pardon?

109
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,000
Let me introduce myself formally.

110
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,280
I'll be living with Na Na in this house from now on.

111
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,170
Also,

112
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,450
is he your son?

113
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,830
Wow, he's so handsome.

114
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,290
I hope we become good friends.

115
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,930
Let's go. Let's go now!

116
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,810
Hold on.

117
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,190
You should apologize to Na Na first.

118
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,220
Adults have to apologize to children too if they were rude to them.

119
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,320
Na Na, I said the wrong thing. I'm sorry.

120
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,040
Let's go.

121
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,010
Na Na, you must've been upset.

122
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:17,310
Make sure to tell me if someone is rude to you from now on, okay?

123
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,810
Noona, I got medicine for you! Take some!

124
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,370
 Yu Jeong called me. I'll go meet her for a moment.

125
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,730

126
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,530
I'm about to be thrown out on the street.

127
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,410
I can't believe she's partying.

128
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,480
She even lied that she was sick?

129
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,490

130
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,240
Yes, Leo.

131
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,860
 Noona, did you meet with Hae Mi by chance?

132
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,880
I don't know if you could say that.

133
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,000
But I did see her in front of a club.

134
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,540
 We need to stop her! Hurry!

135
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,860
What's the problem? She already went inside.

136
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,600
There's no special party tonight. What brings you here?

137
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,110
I'm not here for the party.

138
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,240
I want to purchase directly. How can I do that?

139
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,580
We just let the customers bring stuff because it's a party,

140
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,540
but we don't deal officially.

141
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,300
I didn't ask you to sell officially.

142
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,370
I want you to sell to me unofficially.

143
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,600
I want the really nice stuff. I'll pay you handsomely.

144
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,350
You know the Angel's Club, right?

145
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,390
There's this one drug the principal gave me through the back door before they got caught.

146
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,110
It's a five-star product.

147
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,080
What's this?

148
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,540
Leo, how did you know I was here─

149
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,530
- Let's get out.
 - Leo!

150
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,880
Who are you?

151
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,170
How dare you take my customer away?

152
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,230
- I'm her husband.
 - Husband?

153
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,730
Husband, my foot. Is he your pimp?

154
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,050
How dare you! He's really my husband!

155
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,060
You crazy bitch. How dare you bring your husband here?

156
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,600
How dare you! Hey!

157
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,190
Leo!

158
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,590
Leo!

159
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,940
Stop!

160
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,320
Don't hit my husband!

161
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,870
Don't! Don't!

162
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,300
Stop!

163
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,630
No!

164
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,690
Geez, what annoying assholes.

165
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,380
Are you okay?

166
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,480

167
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,840

168
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,190
Just the two of us?

169
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,960
Did you make a delicious dinner?

170
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,260
I'm hungry.

171
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,580
Are you waiting for Choi Kang Hoo?

172
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:28,860
A man who makes a woman wait isn't trustworthy.

173
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,640
I need to tell you something.

174
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,690
I... will marry Kang Hoo.

175
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,710
So, I hope you don't say rude things about him.

176
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay. When is that fellow coming, anyway?

177
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,830
When are you coming?

178
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,950
I'm scared to death.

179
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,660
 I'm looking for you right now.

180
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,800
Please wait a bit.

181
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,360
 Hurry, hurry!

182
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,380
This is strange.

183
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,260
Secretary Choi's car suddenly disappeared.

184
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,510
Then, am I safe?

185
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,420
We don't know yet.

186
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,400
Oh, I see you over there!

187
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,820
Are you okay?

188
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,580
Looks like you haven't heard yet.

189
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,540
Your boss is done now,

190
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,570
and so are you.

191
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,970
Mr Choi...

192
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,370
Where's the video?

193
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,440
The video you found 10 years ago.

194
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,630
Aren't you going to tell me?

195
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,940
You should leave first and wait for her.

196
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,780
Do Jae Yi will be there soon, too.

197
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Hey! What are you doing over there?

198
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,460
Damn, what's this?

199
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,720
Move that right now!

200
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,180
Excuse me.

201
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,930
Please open the door!

202
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:00,790
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

203
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,190
I don't think Kang Hoo is coming tonight.

204
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,470
Is he interested in marrying you, too?

205
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,530
 I lost him. I'll look for him again.

206
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,250
Could you serve me some food?

207
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,230
I want more because it's so good.

208
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,280
 Here, wipe your head with this.

209
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,460
- Thank you.
 - Should we go to the hospital?

210
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,340
Could I borrow your phone first?

211
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,810
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

212
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,170
I think you should go to the hospital. You're bleeding.

213
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,630
I'm sorry, but could you take me to this place?

214
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,090
I beg you.

215
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,520
I enjoyed the meal very much.

216
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,220
I'm glad you liked it.

217
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,820
Could I ask you something if you're done eating?

218
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,320
What did you talk about with Assemblyman Gi yesterday?

219
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,520
I told you.

220
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,400
He came to argue with me because I reported him to the Prosecutors' Office.

221
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,700
He looked a bit out of it when he was leaving.

222
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,930
He looked a bit shocked, too.

223
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,370
I didn't tell you because I thought you might worry.

224
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,490
To be honest, he asked me for a favor yesterday,

225
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,290
and I said no.

226
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,990
What did he ask you?

227
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,770
As you assumed,

228
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,720
he appears to have killed Song Je Hyeok.

229
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,140
He said someone he trusted found something out and was threatening him.

230
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,810
So he asked me for my help.

231
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,050
But I said no.

232
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,240
He was about to get caught for murder in addition to the Angel's Club.

233
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,580
So he committed suicide.

234
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,900
Who's the person he was talking about?

235
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,880
- Could it be Secretary Choi?
 - That's all I know.

236
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,340
Anyway, he died. It's all over.

237
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,100
Well, then, I should get going now.

238
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,800
Let me see you off.

239
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,540
Didn't you bring your car?

240
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,300
I don't have to let everyone know about my schedule.

241
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,020
I'll get you a taxi then.

242
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,660
Until when will you be staying at the hotel?

243
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,090
I'm not sure.

244
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,350
My wife doesn't want me to come home.

245
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:13,540
Anyway, I asked you to call me father.

246
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,740
Are you not interested in doing that?

247
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,900
I told you.

248
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:29,140
I... don't have many days left to live.

249
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,130
Just once.

250
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,750
Can't you call me that just once?

251
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,490
Jae Yi!

252
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,380
Kang Hoo.

253
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,050
Kang Hoo!

254
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,150
Kang Hoo!

255
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,980
Kang Hoo!

256
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,650
Kang Hoo, wake up!

257
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,470
Please open your eyes! Please!

258
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,140
Please! Somebody help him!

259
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,320
Kang Hoo!

260
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,600
Please!

261
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,380
Please help him!

262
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,190
Well, Yu Jeong...

263
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,030
You must be very tired.

264
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,830
Go home and rest, Hae Mi.

265
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,910
Thank you.

266
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,050
Thank you, Noona. Get home safely.

267
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,690
You've done so much, Leo.

268
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,320
 We need to stop her! Hurry!

269
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,770
 What's the problem?

270
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,030
 She went there to get drugs.

271
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,570
 Drugs?

272
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,370
 Like actual drugs?

273
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,540
 I thought she quit!

274
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,550
 She fell into relapse.

275
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,120
 Song Je Hyeok sent her to a drug party

276
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,020
 and she lost control because of Mother-in-law.

277
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,850
 Because of her mother?

278
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,380
 Hae Mi knows that she took money from Song Je Hyeok.

279
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,540
 I think she got disappointed in her because of that.

280
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,650
 What can you do with a video like that?

281
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:44,220
 What if I demand that money from Hae Mi like you said?

282
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,370
 Go ahead.

283
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,410
Yes, this is Ju Yu Jeong.

284
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,000
Pardon?

285
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,780
It's sore! It hurts!

286
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,210
Don't exaggerate.

287
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,600
I'm not exaggerating!

288
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,370
Aigoo, I could've killed them both, if only I didn't get hit from behind!

289
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,970
How could they hit from behind? Should I fight them again properly?

290
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,580
I'm so angry. That asshole pushed you against the wall.

291
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,360
What?

292
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,350
Leo.

293
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,770
I'm sorry.

294
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,940
Noona.

295
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,580
There's actually something I need to tell you.

296
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,130
It's about Mother-in-law.

297
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,350
Mom worked with Angel's Club?

298
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,630
No way.

299
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,950
How could she?

300
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,910
But that's just wrong!

301
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,270
I didn't tell you to make you angry.

302
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,340
Why don't you try to understand her?

303
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,480
Understand what?

304
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,790
I'll go meet her.

305
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,620
Noona.

306
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,310
Yes, Jo Yong Pil.

307
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,600
Pardon?

308
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,860
 I'll be living with Na Na in this house from now on.

309
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,730
 Also,

310
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,490
 I'm a convicted murderer.

311
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,510
 Na Na, I said the wrong thing. I'm sorry.

312
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,070
 The first day I heard your heartbeat.

313
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,440
 Your nickname is Miracle from now on,

314
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,130
 because you came to me like a miracle.

315
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,290
 You already have arms and legs?

316
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:23,410
 I'm so proud of you, Miracle.

317
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,440

318
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:40,230
 My Miracle. You're growing so well,

319
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,910
 but I'm still not so sure.

320
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:50,810
 Is it a good idea to have you when you have Song Je Hyeok's blood?

321
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:59,280
 What if I get an abortion quickly and donate my liver to Na Na?

322
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,820
 Forgive me for having these thoughts.

323
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:08,570
 I feel so tormented whenever I think about this.

324
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,340
 So much.

325
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,360
You must've been suffering a lot, too.

326
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,360
Yes.

327
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,480
Pardon?

328
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,040
Kang Hoo?

329
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,310
This is Choi Kang Hoo's phone.

330
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:04,370
I collected the video from 10 years ago and his car's dash cam memory card.

331
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,660
Is the original file important in this day and age?

332
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,330
He must've made a copy somewhere.

333
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,400
If Do Jae Yi finds that...

334
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,180
I'll have to create a shield, so she can't do anything, even if she finds it.

335
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,440
 I should let Jae Yi know

336
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,240
 that there's no one you can trust in this world.

337
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,230
 Friends?

338
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,490
 What a joke.

339
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,440
 People are always driven by their desires.

340
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,670
 I need to make sure she can't trust anyone.

341
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:16,360
 Betrayal and trust are on two sides of the same coin.

342
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:22,000
The things Jae Yi has been trusting the most need to be destroyed completely.

343
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,530
Kang Hoo!

344
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:45,010
And then... I'll make her my daughter entirely.

345
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,920
Kang Hoo.

346
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,070

347
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,150
♫  Without anything holding me  ♫

348
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:43,440
♫  A memory slipping through the gap between my fingers  ♫

349
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:51,100
♫  Suddenly hurts me again  ♫

350
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,840
♫  Even alone, I, the person  ♫

351
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,700
♫  Who said I was fine  ♫

352
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,760
♫  Am looking for you more  ♫

353
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,700
♫  As the days go by  ♫

354
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,170
♫  Before I knew it  ♫

355
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,660
♫  I couldn't casually ignore  ♫

356
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,460
♫  The flaming feeling I unconsciously ignited  ♫

357
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,230
♫  In some gap  ♫

358
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,620
♫  You are still flaming  ♫

359
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,970
Has it already been three days?

360
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:06,970
I heard Jae Yi is sitting like a zombie at home.

361
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,210
I feel so tormented, too.

362
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,340
I can't even imagine how she feels.

363
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:19,510
Shouldn't we... visit her?

364
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,320
Leave her alone.

365
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,510
She must need time to herself.

366
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,030
Let's just be patient for her.

367
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,900
More importantly, won't there be a funeral for Kang Hoo?

368
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,050
According to Yong Pil, they're doing an autopsy on Kang Hoo's body.

369
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,660
His parents want to delay it until the result comes out.

370
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,850
The gambler who supposedly killed him.

371
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,420
According to the news, he fled to China.

372
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,000
Doesn't that mean we'll never find out why that happened to Kang Hoo?

373
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,550
Are you okay?

374
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,750
What do you mean?

375
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,580
You're in bad condition, too.

376
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,560
Are you sick?

377
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,290
I'll get better soon.

378
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,480
I have to.

379
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,070
Otherwise, Leo would suffer too much.

380
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,740
How about you? Is the foundation okay?

381
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,250
Yoo Na Noona. When is Na Na's surgery?

382
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,110
 Mom, are you crazy?

383
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,960
Why did you get involved with a disgusting place like Angel's Club?

384
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,270
I wanted to build you a proper hotel! So what!

385
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,350
So, what will you do now?

386
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,230
The members are getting arrested one by one!

387
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,420
What if someone says something about you?

388
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,690
I didn't do anything that bad!

389
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:14,030
I just connected the members together!

390
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:18,120
Connecting people in a criminal organization is a crime, too!

391
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,180
Mom. You know what?

392
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,600
The ledgers showing the management of laundered money and slush funds of political and business figures.

393
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,010
Let's use that.

394
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,190
Let's just give them to those people,

395
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,660
so you can save yourself and pay Yu Jeong back, too.

396
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,300
I can't do that.

397
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,240
- Why not?
 - That's the lifeline that maintains Daesungak!

398
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,980
I can't give up for something small like this!

399
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,200
I would rather go to jail.

400
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,680
Just go to jail, then.

401
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,840
Instead, pay Yu Jeong back!

402
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,730
Are you serious right now?

403
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,360
I don't have to pay her back, okay?

404
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,110
Mom.

405
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,380
You're killing me by continuing to do this!

406
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:08,580
You keep making me do bad things!

407
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,000
Hae Mi.

408
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,030
I hate to see you being harmed, too,

409
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:29,830
but you should try to understand me, too.

410
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:35,430
I've been living for you and Daesungak my whole life.

411
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:40,870
If I gave them the ledgers, both you and Daesungak would be finished!

412
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,570
Finished!

413
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
Hello?

414
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,650
Chairman Kang Il Gu?

415
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,420
 Getting involved with Yeongun is a bad move these days.

416
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,860
 Who would try to invest in Yeongun at a time like this?

417
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:37,340
 It will be difficult to attract investors or sponsors until the situation calms down a bit.

418
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,030
Yes, this is Ju Yu Jeong.

419
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,550
Pardon?

420
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,710
You're Jae Yi's father?

421
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,600
Are you the one who called?

422
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,640
Yes. It's regarding a liver.

423
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,930
A liver for a four-year-old girl, right?

424
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,090
How much did our employee tell you it was?

425
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,440
He said it's 100 million won (~$72.000).

426
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,430
Huh? No, no, no.

427
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:41,320
It's this much.

428
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,530
300 million won?

429
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,630
Why is it suddenly three times more?

430
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,420
You said your daughter is type O negative.

431
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,360
I have to find someone and get to work for something so rare.

432
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,390
Get to work?

433
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,610
- You mean you would kill someone?
 - What should I do, then?

434
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:07,010
We don't have anything like that in the inventory.

435
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,640
Yes.

436
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,020
Chairman Kang Il Gu?

437
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:21,430
 Attorney Do!

438
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,340
 Attorney Do, are you in there?

439
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,580
 Attorney Do!

440
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,960
I told you to just leave me alone.

441
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,760
There's something I must tell you.

442
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:51,540
Mr. Choi actually came to see me before he passed.

443
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,630
 I've been observing you for a long time.

444
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:01,810
 I'm grateful that you've been working for her sincerely all this time.

445
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,490
 That's why I wanted to ask you for a favor.

446
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:11,550
 But you must not tell Jae Yi what I'm about to tell you.

447
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,690
 You don't want me to tell Attorney Do?

448
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,390
 That will be kind of difficult.

449
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,690
 I'm on Attorney Do's side.

450
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,560
 Exactly.

451
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,470
 Since you're someone who will be on her side no matter what,

452
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,820
 I'm asking you this right now.

453
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,840
 You could do me a favor, right?

454
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,010
 Yes, tell me.

455
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,770
 By chance,

456
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:46,620
 if something happens to me, make sure to tell Jae Yi to check my cloud storage.

457
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,380
 It says the password is "the date you can't go beyond." When is that?

458
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,410
 Only Jae Yi knows that.

459
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:10,610
 It's something Jae Yi needs to check first.

460
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:19,670
 By the way, what could happen to you?

461
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:21,520
 Well...

462
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,750
 I'm not sure yet.

463
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:28,040
 This is for an emergency situation.

464
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:34,850
 I'm still not sure what's going on, but I'll do that.

465
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,790
 Thank you.

466
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,410
Kang Hoo gave you this?

467
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,670
Yes, I guess he couldn't trust me, either. He didn't tell me the password.

468
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,150
Do you know what that might be?

469
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,880

470
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,000
"The date you can't go beyond."

471
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:04,210
I'm not sure. I don't know, either.

472
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,980
Also...

473
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:14,840
this is the 500 million won (~$360.000) that was found in his car.

474
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:19,970
The police seem to think his death was related to this.

475
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,360
Why did Kang Hoo have that much money?

476
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,120
I have no idea what's going on.

477
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:35,580
Could that money be related to Mr. Choi's cloud storage,

478
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,780
not the man named Myung Eun Soo?

479
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:51,980
Attorney Do, Mr. Choi said you must see what's in it.

480
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,880
Please make sure to check.

481
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,710

482
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,560

483
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,260

484
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,410

485
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,140

486
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,820

487
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,900
 What were you going to make, by the way?

488
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,770
 The chicken stock I put in your ramyeon.

489
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,690
 Why does it take so many ingredients?

490
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,870
 Don't you know how much effort it takes?

491
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,560
 Instead, you have to finish quickly since it's homemade.

492
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,670
 Let's make a lot of tasty things using this later.

493
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,390
 I want to learn, too. Teach me.

494
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,380
 It's okay. I'd be doing this for the rest of my life.

495
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,100
 - I want to try.
 - Come on!

496
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,980
 Don't! Let me do it.

497
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,690
 No, I just want to try for a bit.

498
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,840
 It's okay! You will hurt yourself!

499
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,210
 - Why would I hurt myself?
 - Just have a seat!

500
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,820
 Sit.

501
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,340
 There.

502
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,600
 I'll do it for the rest of my life.

503
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:27,410
"The date you can't go beyond."

504
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,890

505
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,600

506
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,580

507
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,100
 Jae Yi.

508
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:31,020
 If you're listening to this, something must've happened to me.

509
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,550
 But I'll be careful so nothing happens.

510
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:38,380
 I'm recording this just in case.

511
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,890
 I'm on my way now to meet someone named Myung Eun Soo.

512
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:50,360
 To explain who he is, we have to go back to 10 years ago. To that day.

513
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,870
 I'll tell you the truth of that day now.

514
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,430

515
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,660
Welcome.

516
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,760
You guys.

517
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,130
You should have a seat there, too.

518
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:05,780
I'm sorry for making you come to a place that holds bad memories for you so late at night.

519
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,590
Why did you make us come here if you're sorry?

520
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,580
By chance, did you call us because you're worried about Jae Yi?

521
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,480
No.

522
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,280
It's because I wanted to say something to the three of you.

523
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:34,920
I learned that you're all in a difficult situation right now.

524
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:40,200
I couldn't just pretend I didn't know about it.

525
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,000
So I'm thinking of giving you a hand.

526
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:48,890
First of all, Ms. Go Yoo Na.

527
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:55,770
Could I find a liver for Na Na by chance?

528
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:06,000
You will find a liver... for Na Na?

529
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,820
I'll find it for you by searching all over the world.

530
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:19,670
Chairwoman Ju Yu Jeong.

531
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:24,480
Did you know that I sponsored Yeongun Foundation

532
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,070
since it was run by your late parents?

533
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,380
Yes, I did.

534
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,980
I heard you were a major sponsor.

535
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,450
Thank you.

536
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:42,630
I don't want Yeongun Foundation to fail like this, either.

537
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:48,130
I'll protect the foundation for you.

538
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,370
Really?

539
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:57,750
Your mother has been having a hard time lately, right?

540
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,780
Do you know... my mother?

541
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:07,000
I'll do my best, so nothing bad happens to her.

542
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,060
Really?

543
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:16,210
I'm so thankful, but why are you doing this for us suddenly?

544
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:19,890
Under one condition.

545
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,100
I want you to... cut ties with Jae Yi.

546
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,300
 Is this the best you can do?

547
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,190
 Dad...

548
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,440
 Clingy bastard.

549
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:04,970
So he wants us to cut ties with Jae Yi in exchange for helping us?

550
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:07,110
Why do we have to do that?

551
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:12,370
He said her life ended up this way because of us.

552
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:21,500
But why do I feel like he didn't say that for Jae Yi,

553
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,630
but because he has an ulterior motive?

554
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:27,000
I did get the chills as well.

555
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,160
Kang Hoo ended up that way, too.

556
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,810
Shouldn't he ask us to be there for her?

557
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,300
That's true, but...

558
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:42,430
So, will you not get help from him?

559
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:50,630
He said he would help us only if we cut her off.

560
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,760
You've got to be kidding me.

561
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,860
I'm kind of desperate right now.

562
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:59,580
- Me, too.
 - I'm the same way.

563
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,370
What do you think we should do?

564
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:41,590
 No matter what you decide to do with Kang Il Gu, the decision is up to you.

565
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:45,930
 And I'll respect your decision.

566
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,040
 I love you.

567
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:59,190
It won't take long.

568
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:04,890
Just wait, Kang Hoo.

569
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:15,610
I analyzed Secretary Choi's movement pattern up until the point he found out

570
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,910
about Mr. Choi Kang Hoo's tracker.

571
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:21,450
Other than his house, Gi Yoon Chul and Kang Il Gu's houses,

572
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:24,430
he frequented an apartment in Daegok-dong.

573
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,960
It turns out he rented out the place himself.

574
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,830
What do you think it was for?

575
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,390
An apartment...

576
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:38,310

577
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,320
 I don't know.

578
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,690
 The treasures we're looking for might be there.

579
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,770
Let's invade that apartment first.

580
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:12,870
Yes, but is this really necessary?

581
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,450
We even have conclusive evidence.

582
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,440
Kang Il Gu has connections everywhere, including the government,

583
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,200
Prosecutors' Office, and the police.

584
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,050
I'll take everything he has and destroy him completely,

585
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:31,630
so it's impossible to escape, no matter what forces he uses.

586
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,310
You should be in charge of Secretary Choi.

587
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:37,450
I'll be in charge of his family.

588
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,840
- His family?
 - Yes.

589
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,320
He killed Kang Hoo, who was like family to me.

590
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,560
I should cut his family off for him, too.

591
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:53,330
Because his family means money to him.

592
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,490
Do you have a reservation?

593
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:10,490
No, I'll use the special room that doesn't require reservations.

594
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:12,920
You can't use the special room.

595
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,090
I know. It's exclusive to the Kangbo Group's family.

596
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:21,290
But I'm a part of that family, too.

597
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:26,480
Kangbo Group's Chairman, Kang Il Gu, is my father.

598
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:43,550
So he was the owner of the secret club called Angel's Club?

599
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:47,200
You're lying. Do you have evidence?

600
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,600
The money he hid at the paper company in Hong Kong that's under my name.

601
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,080
All of that came from the Angel's Club.

602
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,730
It'll be revealed if you report to the National Tax Service and follow the money trail.

603
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:02,610
They can even find out who used my name illegally.

604
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,750
What is it that you want? Kangbo Group's shares?

605
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,630
Or... do you want your name in the family registry or something?

606
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,510
Divorce him.

607
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:14,400
If so, the Angel's Club will no longer be the group's problem.

608
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,560
It would only affect Kang Il Gu individually.

609
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:24,940
Divorce?

610
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,450
You've been treating me like a servant all this time.

611
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:33,630
Now you want to get rid of me? Do you think I'd just let it happen?

612
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:37,670
The reason why I came here myself instead of sending a lawyer is

613
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:41,360
because there's something too shameful to tell even the lawyer about.

614
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:45,030
You probably know what I'm talking about.

615
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,980
Let's take care of this quietly.

616
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,800
Look over the paper thoroughly and contact me through my lawyer.

617
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,540
Well, then.

618
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:07,880
What brought her here suddenly?

619
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,740
Is Jae Yi on the move, by chance?

620
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,710
We should get moving, too.

621
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,390
How about her friends?

622
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:16,650
 Chairwoman!

623
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:20,690
 Kangbo Group sent an agreement to donate 10 billion won to the foundation.

624
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:24,950
 I think we could put out the fire with this for now.

625
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,420

626
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:38,570
 Na Na's relative from the US registered at the donation center.

627
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:41,230
 We'll start the examination soon.

628
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:49,050
I got calls from the members of the Angel's Club.

629
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:53,360
They promised they won't mention my name.

630
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,880
Where... are we right now?

631
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,180
Come this way.

632
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,570
Have a seat.

633
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,300
It's still empty because the construction hasn't started yet.

634
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,630
I hope you understand.

635
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:59,460
I would like to say thank you.

636
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,580
I got a call from the donation center.

637
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:10,060
The members of the Angel's Club promised they won't get Mom involved as well.

638
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:14,510
We received the donation agreement.

639
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:16,100
Thank you.

640
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,690
Thank you for deciding to accept my gifts.

641
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:27,130
You'll have to keep your promise to cut Jae Yi off, too.

642
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:37,690
Since we're on the same team now, I prepared more gifts.

643
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,940
Open them.

644
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:13,400
What... is this?

645
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,870
They're the new masks for the new secret club that will be built here.

646
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:31,660
By chance, are you...

647
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:34,700
- Angel's Clubs─ 
 - I...

648
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,770
am the one who created the Angle's Club.

649
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:43,030
I'm not ashamed of creating a secret club like that.

650
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:46,240
The top 1% that controls the world

651
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,720
are tormented with extreme stress and pressure.

652
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:55,680
But they can take a breather by putting on those masks. Is that so wrong?

653
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:01,430
So you're telling us to join the new club?

654
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,160
No.

655
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:08,490
I want you to become

656
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:12,810
the queens of the new club.

657
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:19,310
Ms. Go, you have a natural charm that attracts people.

658
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:23,610
Please recruit members using your charm.

659
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,820
Chairwoman Ju.

660
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:32,840
Please launder money by keeping the club's profit at the foundation.

661
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:40,800
Ms. Yoon, please run the club using the skills you acquired by running the hotel.

662
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:47,850
I can create the best secret club in Korea with the three of you.

663
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:54,340
You would have all the money and power in the country.

664
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:56,990
What do you think of my proposal?

665
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:04,300
What if we decline your proposal?

666
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:09,920
Unfortunately, I'll have to take back the gifts I sent you.

667
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:14,230
You would no longer be on my side, either.

668
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,940
What would you like to do?

669
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:22,560
Will you accept my gift?

670
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,760
 Shouldn't we meet up sometime?

671
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:13,020
♫  Who are you, Mister?  ♫

672
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:23,060
♫  And why I can't find you?  ♫

673
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,930
♫  I pray, I wish  ♫

674
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:33,300
♫  I wake up from a long dream  ♫

675
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,390
You came.

676
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,800
♫  Truth end has come  ♫

677
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,780
♫  Show me you are genuine  ♫

678
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:49,760
What are you guys doing here?

679
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:54,570
From now on, they're no longer your friends.

680
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,490
They're my clients.

681
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:02,370
♫  I can't find you  ♫

682
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:10,890
♫  Don't tell, don't lie. Don't care about you  ♫

683
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:15,900
What did he mean just now?

684
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:21,710
♫  Who are you, Mister?  ♫

685
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:26,750
I just asked you what he meant!

686
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:39,960

687
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:47,920
Do you think... we could pull it off?

688
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,910
We have no choice. It's for our survival.

689
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:53,910
Let's consider this as putting on a mask.

690
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:56,050
A mask of betrayal.

691
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:04,030

692
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:08,860
♫  Who are you, Mister?  ♫

693
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:18,740
♫  And why I can't find you?  ♫

694
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:26,240
♫  Don't tell, don't lie. Don't care about you  ♫

695
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,970
 ~ Preview ~ 
This is the mask for the new secret club I'm starting.

696
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,950
 You as well should grow powerful using that mask.

697
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,960
 I'll never back off.

698
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,290
 Looks like Do Jae Yi is trying to win her friends over.

699
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:42,770
 - Is she?
 - That means they're plotting together.

700
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:45,530
 I'll give you Jae Yi's money laundering ledger.

701
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:48,080
 That's enough for us to earn your trust, right?

702
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,060
 You have to trust the most powerful person to gain power.

703
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:55,200
 I'll try putting on that mask.

704
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,690
 Do you mean it?

705
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:59,880
 Please welcome me to the new club.

706
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,510
 Let's try working together, Father.

707
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,980
 Yes, let's do it.

708
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,580
 Thank you for trusting me, Jae Yi.

709
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,700
 This is the place.

710
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,280
 What would you like me to do?

711
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,920
 You killed Kang Hoo.

712
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,760
 I'll never forgive you.

713
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:20,910
 You will suffer much more terrible pain

714
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:24,420
 than what you inflicted on Kang Hoo..

715
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,560
 Goodbye.
