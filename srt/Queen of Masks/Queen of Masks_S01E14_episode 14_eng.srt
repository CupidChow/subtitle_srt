1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,730

2
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,990

3
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,210
Crazy bastard.

4
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,620

5
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,160
It wasn't Song Je Hyeok who killed Gi Do Shik?

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,350
Who could it have been, then?

7
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,200
 You came.

8
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,810
 You didn't respond.

9
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,290
 I thought something happened.

10
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,620
 By the way, is this the best you can do?

11
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,820
- This voice is...
  - Dad.

12
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,050
 What a clingy bastard.

13
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,200
T-That's...

14
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,450
 I'm thinking to start to feel hopeful.

15
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,310
 My days are not so sunny yet,

16
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,400
 but I want to try to live, too.

17
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,700
 At least once...

18
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,580
 I don't want to live in hell,

19
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,400
 but rather in happiness.

20
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,690
 I'm finally allowed to be happy, right?

21
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,470
 As me, and Do Jae Yi.

22
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,770

23
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,380
 I'm leaving because something urgent came up.

24
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,430
 I made porridge. Heat it up before you eat it.

25
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,060
 Could you stop by for a second? I need to talk to you.

26
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,990
It was you, wasn't it?

27
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,830
You tipped the district attorney off about me.

28
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,840
You're not the visitor I was hoping to see.

29
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,220
You shameless bastard!

30
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,750
It was your idea to start a club like that inside the orphanage to find weaknesses

31
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,510
of the authoritative figures!

32
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,990
Since my son's video came out and the club got exposed,

33
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,160
you think of me as a toothless tiger or something.

34
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,630
But you made a misstep.

35
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:49,410
Neither the members nor Do Jae Yi have evidence that I'm the mastermind of the club.

36
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,030
The only evidence is Song Je Hyeok.

37
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,160
But the dead don't speak, probably?

38
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,170
Evidence?

39
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:14,570
 Minister, may I introduce you to a nice members-only club?

40
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,610
 You can enjoy your hobby in Korea now, too.

41
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,810
 What do you mean by hobby?

42
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,250
 They're listening to dance music on their headphones.

43
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,830
 I'm sure they can't hear it, even if you scream.

44
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,020
 What kind of club is it?

45
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,900
 It's called the Angel's Club.

46
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,100
 You can think of it as a small casino.

47
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,900
 You don't have to leave the country with a large amount of money.

48
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,410
 You won't have to worry about the foreign exchange control law.

49
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,780
Since when... did you plant an informant around me?

50
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,060
Do you think that was the only informant I planted?

51
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,420
You dirty rat!

52
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,740
Chairman Kang.

53
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Sir! Please don't do this.

54
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,070
Things have been good between us for 10 years.

55
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,040
We were friends!

56
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,140
I admit that my approval rating has declined recently.

57
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,710
But the survey numbers easily get revived with some social issue!

58
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,030
You know, the people of this country are as smart as dogs and pigs.

59
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,110
Please be generous just once.

60
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,430
Then... then I'll never forget that I owe you.

61
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,290
Please let me live! Please let me live, I beg you!

62
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,690
Like father, like son.

63
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,160
Pardon?

64
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Your punk-ass son was like this, too.

65
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,210
He was so despicable and small when he cried, "Dad, Dad, help me!"

66
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,310
 Do you know what he said as he died?

67
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,300
 "Dad! Dad!"

68
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,490
 He kept calling for you like a child.

69
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,780
I-I-It can't be...

70
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,490
Were you there when my son was dying?

71
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,150
Alongside Song Je Hyeok?

72
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,540
Tell me!

73
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,940
Did you kill him with Song Je Hyeok?

74
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,050
Did you?

75
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,260
You should ask Song Je Hyeok instead.

76
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,620
Oh, but the dead don't speak, right?

77
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,570
You murderer bastard!

78
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,590
Why are you revealing the truth now?

79
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,100
I wouldn't have known if you kept it a secret!

80
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,130
I make sure to cut ties with the ones I don't want.

81
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:37,420
If you just leave them, they keep clinging like you are right now.

82
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,150
I deserve to die!

83
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,350
Your father is a really bad man.

84
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,520
You should be careful, too.

85
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,820
Let's go, sir.

86
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,610
Come on in.

87
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,420
Answer, Hyun Bin.

88
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,530
Oh, Hyun Bin?

89
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,980
I wanted to ask you something.

90
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,870
Did you hear if there will be an Ice Party somewhere?

91
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,540
It's not that my noona is doing drugs...

92
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,870
Forget it. Just hang up, bastard.

93
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,740
Geez! Gosh.

94
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,520
This is driving me crazy.

95
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,950
You ended up doing it.

96
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,540
I'm hungry!

97
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,440
Noona.

98
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,650
Noona!

99
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,060
Do you want some, too?

100
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,880
Noona.

101
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,360
Do you remember 10 years ago?

102
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,160
The notoriously difficult drug to quit.

103
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,720
You quit it back then.

104
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,530
It was all thanks to you.

105
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:18,880
When I took a year off to quit, you were with me 24-7.

106
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,830
And when you went back, you became the first and youngest employee to become the vice president!

107
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,710
You were totally amazing.

108
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,370
I was pretty cool back then. Even I admit it.

109
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,810
Let's try it again this time.

110
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,780
You can do it, Noona.

111
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,710
I can help you this time, too, okay?

112
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,950
No, I don't want to!

113
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,650
I'll keep doing drugs.

114
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,270
What?

115
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,850
Back then, I had a reason to quit.

116
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,020
The two people I loved the most.

117
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,580
I really wanted to protect you and my mom.

118
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,180
If I became successful, who would dare to look down on my family?

119
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,700
They're my people.

120
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,100
That's why I put up with it.

121
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,610
I endured the horrible pain where it felt like bugs were crawling all over my body!

122
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,140
But it's all over now.

123
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,410
I don't want to protect anyone anymore.

124
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,930
I guess this is because of Mother-in-law.

125
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,500
I'm sure she has her reason, too.

126
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,540
- So why don't we talk to her in personâ”€
 - No!

127
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,890
I'm so scared!

128
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:13,670
I no longer want to be hurt by the people I love.

129
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:22,010
My mom is already so cruel to me.

130
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,890
I'm hungry.

131
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,280

132
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,370
 I can't donate my liver to Na Na?

133
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,880
Why not?

134
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,350
Your blood type matches hers, and everything is great, but you have Hepatitis C.

135
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,300
That will make it difficult for you to be a donor.

136
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,240
Do I need to get her registered at the center and just wait for her turn, then?

137
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,360
Type Os can only receive from Type Os.

138
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,400
So, they're disadvantaged compared to other blood types.

139
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,080
But Na Na's Rh negative on top of that.

140
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,890
It won't be easy to find a brain-dead patient who meets that condition.

141
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,820

142
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,840
That's the last of his belongings, right?

143
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,650
The Prosecutors' Office took most of it.

144
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:34,380
This is the suit he had in the office as a spare one.

145
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,260
Okay, you can leave now.

146
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,050
Well, Ma'am.

147
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,820
An upsetting rumor is circulating among the employees.

148
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,600
They say the foundation will close soon since there's a lot of debt.

149
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,330
No, I'm back now.

150
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,810
I'll protect the foundation from now on.

151
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,200
 I, Gil Man Ok of Daesungak, will hold onto Chairman Song Je Hyeok's slush fund of

152
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,210
 9 billion and 700 million won temporarily until his mayoral campaign ends.

153
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,260
 If I don't return this money, I am willing to accept any consequences,

154
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,500
 and I acknowledge that he can claim it from my daughter, Yoon Hae Mi, instead.

155
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,950
 April 10th, 2023. Gil Man Ok.

156
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,880
Why did Assemblyman Gi come here?

157
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,500
He must've come to argue.

158
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,680
I tipped the Prosecutors' Office off about him.

159
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,220
Do you have any evidence?

160
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,980
I'm capable of getting that much.

161
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,890
He won't be able to escape this time.

162
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,120
Weren't you two pretty close?

163
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,430
You revealed the truth.

164
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,570
You ended up finding Song Je Hyeok,

165
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,590
and it turned out Gi Yoon Chul was behind him.

166
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,620
If only I trusted you back then,

167
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,380
you wouldn't have lived in hell for 10 years.

168
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,730
Assemblyman Gi. He used to love his son so much.

169
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,430
How could he team up with Song Je Hyeok when he killed his son?

170
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,590
I'm not sure.

171
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,340
I guess there are people whose ambition is greater than their love for their children.

172
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,980
I don't understand it.

173
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,650
Could that be...

174
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,370
why he killed Song Je Hyeok.

175
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,090
Song Je Hyeok killed himself.

176
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,860
The CCTV was turned off that night.

177
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,340
He knew we would be there that night and took pictures of us, too.

178
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,640
And he tried to frame everything on us.

179
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,090
It was exactly like 10 years ago.

180
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,290
Assemblyman Gi is the only one who could've done all this.

181
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:53,390
And he needed Song Je Hyeok gone to be free from the Angel's Club, too.

182
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,950
Are you curious about the truth this time, too?

183
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,690
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

184
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,340
You seem a bit unfamiliar.

185
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:20,010
You always said the truth doesn't matter.

186
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,880
I don't have that many days left.

187
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,800
I committed a grave sin.

188
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,560
Before I die, I'm thinking of helping you reveal everything

189
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,150
about the secret club as a way to repent.

190
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,780
I'm sorry, Jae Yi.

191
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:52,740
I know it's shameless, but could I ask you a favor?

192
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,270
Could you call me father now?

193
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,950

194
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:14,870

195
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,980

196
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,290
 If I don't return this money,

197
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,100
 I am  willing to accept any consequences,

198
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,440
 and I acknowledge that he can claim it from my daughter, Yoon Hae Mi, instead.

199
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,510
 April 10th, 2023. Gil Man Ok.

200
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,800
I won't take too much of your time.

201
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,380
I want you to return the money he gave you temporarily.

202
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,730
What can you do with a video like that?

203
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,380
Also, that's dirty money.

204
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,130
You know what he has been doing.

205
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,880
I'm probably not required to return money like that by law.

206
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,710
That's not true, Ma'am.

207
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,520
That's the investment money Mariela Hotel gave to our foundation.

208
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,540
But I have to give it back to them.

209
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,620
Otherwise, our foundation will be in huge trouble.

210
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,450
Do you think you're in huge trouble because of that money?

211
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,570
The moment you married that bastard, it was already game over for Yeongun.

212
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,030
Why did you have to pick someone like him, anyway?

213
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,380
Ma'am, what if I demand that money from Hae Mi like you said?

214
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,410
Go ahead.

215
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,240
Pardon?

216
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,710
Your life isn't the only one that got ruined.

217
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,470
My life got ruined because I got involved with your husband, too!

218
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,940
I don't care if you visit your husband at the grave or Hae Mi.

219
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,650
But don't ever come to me, understood?

220
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,180
 Could you call me father now?

221
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,070
 Your father is a really bad man.

222
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,920
 You should be careful, too.

223
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,140

224
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,620

225
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,730
Good thing we confiscated his phone.

226
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:51,850
Do Jae Yi called him as expected.

227
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,210
Jae Yi thinks Gi Yoon Chul killed Song Je Hyeok.

228
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,120
I think things would be cleaner to go with that.

229
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,430
So you mean...

230
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,480
Gi Yoon Chul. Once he starts getting investigated by the Prosecutors' Office,

231
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,310
he won't be able to handle the humiliation.

232
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,510
Tell him I will protect the rest of his family if he dies honorably.

233
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,580
Yes, got it.

234
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,790
But why are you keeping Do Jae Yi close suddenly?

235
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,860
My wife found out about the slush fund from the paper company

236
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,000
and told Jae Yi about it, too.

237
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,580
Would she just do nothing if she found out the money was from Angel's Club?

238
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,420
I might as well keep her on my side rather than make her an enemy.

239
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,180
Do you think she'd come to trust you?

240
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,330
She has to feel sympathetic to a dying old man.

241
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,630
Even more so if that old man is

242
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,320
her father, whom she's been missing her whole life.

243
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,450
Kang Hoo.

244
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,470
You came.

245
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,550
Go ahead and change.

246
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,200
Okay.

247
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,450
You said something urgent came up in the morning. Did you go grocery shopping?

248
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,340
I did, but I also wanted to see someone suddenly.

249
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,960
Who?

250
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,740
It's someone who always smiles when she sees me.

251
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,310
 What brought you here? You didn't even call.

252
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,470
 There's something I wanted to discuss with you.

253
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:59,520
 I thought I could talk to you about it.

254
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,110
 Is there something going on with Jae Yi?

255
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,500
 - Ma'am.
 - Yes.

256
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,590
 What do you think of Chairman Kang Il Gu?

257
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,320
 What do you mean, what do I think of him?

258
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,060
 He abandoned my daughter and granddaughter.

259
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,240
 He's someone I want to kill by feeding him a bowl of pesticides.

260
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,700
 But you sometimes invite him and feed him, too.

261
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,740
 Don't you still feel affectionate toward him?

262
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:33,730
 That's because I want to use him if something happens to Jae Yi.

263
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,060
 He shares blood with Jae Yi, after all.

264
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,810
 What if he's not a good person?

265
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,710
 I mean, what if he's a dangerous person?

266
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,680
 Did you find out something about him?

267
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:01,630
 If he's dangerous to my Jae Yi,

268
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,350
 I'll definitely cut him off.

269
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:10,120
 But instead, I won't let Jae Yi know.

270
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,490
 That means you don't want me to say anything to Jae Yi.

271
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,250
 She might not show it,

272
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,010
 but she craves fatherly affection.

273
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:32,160
 How could I let her get hurt because of him again?

274
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,110
 She's finally escaping from hell.

275
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,380
 There's no reason to push her back in!

276
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,140
You should've told me if you were seeing Grandma.

277
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,500
I miss her, too.

278
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,520
Then we can go tomorrow, too.

279
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,350
Okay. What were you going to make, by the way?

280
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,030
The chicken stock I put in your ramyeon.

281
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,590
Why does it take so many ingredients?

282
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,870
Don't you know how much effort it takes?

283
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,510
Instead, you have to finish quickly since it's homemade.

284
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,930
Let's make a lot of tasty things using this later.

285
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,800
I want to learn, too. Teach me.

286
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,660
It's okay. I'd be doing this for the rest of my life.

287
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,590
- I want to try.
 - Come on!

288
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,320
Don't! Let me do it.

289
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,870
No, I just want to try for a bit.

290
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,650
It's okay! You will hurt yourself!

291
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:39,140
- Why would I hurt myself?
 - Just have a seat!

292
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,160
There.

293
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,940
You will feel better if you get a good sleep while taking this.

294
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,050
Mr. IV.

295
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,120
You know this is an illegal medical practice, right?

296
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,590
I can't bring the former vice president of Mariela Hotel to the hospital.

297
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,870
Also, I'm sure I'm better than most nurses.

298
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,790
10 years ago, I used to give you IV treatment all the time.

299
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,320
Leo.

300
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,540
I don't look so great right now, do I?

301
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,820
No! This is kind of an issue.

302
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,790
You look so pretty even when you're like this.

303
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,350
I'm sleepy.

304
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,560
- I'll get some sleep.
 - Okay.

305
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:40,390
 I no longer want to be hurt by the people I love.

306
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:48,600
 My mom is already so cruel to me.

307
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,530
Thanks for sending me the money.

308
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,180
You're the only one who cares for me.

309
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,900
You heard that he died, right?

310
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,190
Oh, Song Je Hyeok?

311
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,940
I watch the news in here, too.

312
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,930
Since the man you're afraid of is gone now,

313
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,350
you can answer any question I ask you, right?

314
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,310
Do you still have questions left?

315
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,780
Gil Man Ok. My mother-in-law.

316
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,560
What kind of relationship did they have?

317
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,960
What do you mean, relationship?

318
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,010
All the people in the industry have similar relationships.

319
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,420
Hyung. Don't you need the money?

320
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,590
Geez, what a cheap bastard.

321
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:15,210
Gil Man Ok and Song Je Hyeok were basically on the same boat.

322
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,800
They had a business together.

323
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,540
Business?

324
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,430
Did she have a share of Ace Bar?

325
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,380
Not that one!

326
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,410
That secret club, you know.

327
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,220
Secret?

328
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,330
You know it, the Angel's Club.

329
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,640
 I don't care if you visit your husband at the grave or Hae Mi.

330
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,340
 But don't ever come to me, understood?

331
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,560
What kind of mother is she?

332
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,930
 Type Os can only receive from Type Os.

333
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,170
 So, they're disadvantaged compared to other blood types.

334
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,670
 But Na Na's Rh negative on top of that.

335
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:33,520
 It won't be easy to find a brain-dead patient who meets that condition.

336
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,590

337
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:38,290
I wish I didn't have to... let you have Na Na.

338
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,630
But she only wants you. You're her only mother!

339
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,250
There's nothing I can do for her! Nothing!

340
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,750
What's going on?

341
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,990
Did something happen?

342
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,120
I...

343
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,120
apparently can't donate my liver to Na Na.

344
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,730
There's something wrong with my body.

345
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:15,720
Na Na's blood type is O negative, as you know.

346
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,030
It's so rare that it will be hard to find a donor.

347
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,980
What if something bad happens to her?

348
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,610
What am I going to do?

349
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,070
Do you know what I brought here because of that?

350
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,990

(Code word for organ trading)

351
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,540
What does this mean?

352
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,500
It's an ad for organ trading.

353
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,360
What? Are you crazy?

354
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,750
I don't care.

355
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,550
I won't just sit and wait for a miracle.

356
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:03,300
I'll make sure to find an organ donor for Na Na.

357
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,110
Wow, so you can make everything with this?

358
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,420
What a mighty ingredient.

359
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,290
With this, you can invite people over, too.

360
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,940
No way! I can barely make ramyeon.

361
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,200
 Jae Yi, I just got discharged from the hospital.

362
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,250
 Let's have a meal if you aren't busy.

363
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,470
 My lungs are solidifying?

364
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,170
 Am I in danger?

365
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,800
 Don't worry.

366
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,940
 Your hospital has the best medical team.

367
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,660
 You will be in great shape if you take good care of yourself.

368
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,070
Chairman, where should I take you to?

369
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,690
Let's go to the hotel.

370
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,990
Would that be okay?

371
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,680
Why would it not be okay?

372
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,260
Whose text was that?

373
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,020
Well.

374
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,770
He got discharged from the hospital.

375
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,600
Who's he?

376
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,730
Chairman Kang Il Gu?

377
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,140
Yes.

378
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,610
Does he brazenly contact you now?

379
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:47,520
I also find this situation so awkward and strange.

380
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:56,990
Jae Yi, he abandoned you and your mother.

381
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,190
He ignored you when that happened to you,

382
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,270
and you never thought of him as your father.

383
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,750
He apologized to me today.

384
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,970
How do you know whether he was sincere or not?

385
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,170
I guess he's very sick.

386
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:19,620
People who are facing death try to repent, right?

387
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,330
I guess he's like that, too.

388
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:29,440
He tipped the Prosecutors' Office about Gi Yoon Chul.

389
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,380
He probably did that sincerely.

390
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,300
Did you confirm that he's terminally ill?

391
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,470
Do you think he would lie about something like that?

392
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,280
You never know. He might've lied about something even more serious.

393
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,020
By chance, do you know something, Kang Hoo?

394
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,120
 She's finally escaping from hell.

395
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,490
 There's no reason to push her back in!

396
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,560
No, it's nothing.

397
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:08,530
Kang Hoo, for the first time,

398
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,420
I'm thinking of believing him.

399
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:19,860
No, I would like to believe him for the first time.

400
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,000
My whole life,

401
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,710
I've been suspicious of everyone around me except for you.

402
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,990
But I don't want to live like that anymore.

403
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,740
Hey, Leo.

404
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,930
Hyung! Where are you?

405
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,410
I need to talk to you about something.

406
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,040
Okay.

407
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,080
Wait right there. I'll be there soon.

408
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,240
Leo wants to see me.

409
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,590
I'll step out for a second.

410
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,690
You know my mother-in-law, right?

411
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,590
Gil Man Ok, the owner of Daesungak.

412
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,500
Something really serious happened to her.

413
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,320
I think she's keeping a low profile because of that.

414
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,050
What do you mean, something serious?

415
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,810
I met with Mr. Jung of Ace Bar today.

416
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:56,690
 Tell me. My mother-in-law is the mastermind of that club?

417
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,270
 What do you mean, the mastermind?

418
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,290
 Ms. Gil's job was to recruit people.

419
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:08,030
 The real masterminds were Gi Yoon Chul and Song Jae Hyeok.

420
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:12,360
 But there's a secret Gi Yoon Chul doesn't know about.

421
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,800
 There's the real mastermind.

422
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,000
 He's the tycoon Song Je Hyeok worked for.

423
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,040
 The tycoon Song Je Hyeok worked for?

424
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,590
 Who's that?

425
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,040
 I wouldn't know, either.

426
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,340
 But there's someone called Secretary Choi.

427
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:33,220
 He's the one who's playing both sides between Gi Yoon Chul and that tycoon.

428
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,740
 He used to visit Song Je Hyeok often,

429
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,180
 to run errands for that tycoon.

430
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,130
 The one who got Go Yoo Na out of prison

431
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,670
 and sent her to the US was that tycoon, too.

432
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,180
 I wonder why he did that.

433
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,140
 Hyung, you knew all this, but why didn't you tell the police?

434
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,270
 Do you think I'm crazy?

435
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,910
 I didn't want to get involved with that club in addition to Ace Bar.

436
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,420
 It's better to pretend not to know.

437
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,120
My mother-in-law...

438
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,800
If they find out she's related to that club, she might go to jail, apparently.

439
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,630
Hyung, do I have to tell Hae Mi about this?

440
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,270
Hold on.

441
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:26,080
So, the tycoon Secretary Choi works for was the actual mastermind of the Angel's Club?

442
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,540
Yes, that's what I heard. Why?

443
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,160
Chairman, wouldn't a different room be better?

444
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,780
This room has a lot of history.

445
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,920
I should rather protect it myself.

446
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,680
I feel like drinking.

447
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,150
Should we have a glass?

448
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,150
Yes, sir.

449
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,780
It was indeed Choi Kang Hoo.

450
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,960
The one you saw in the parking lot that day.

451
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,070
He followed me by putting this on my car.

452
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:49,070
That means he found out that you work for me.

453
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:53,910
I'm sorry. I should've been more careful.

454
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:57,550
Why do you think he followed you?

455
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,270
He was looking into the incident from 10 years ago.

456
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,130
In the process, he found Myung Eun Soo.

457
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,400
He must know that I told him to turn the CCTV off.

458
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,570
He might've connected me to Gi Do Shik's death, too.

459
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,600
Even if he did, there's no evidence.

460
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,360
I took care of the memory card for the video camera Song Je Hyeok had.

461
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,210
There were two cameras in that room.

462
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,770
The hidden camera Gi Do Shik installed.

463
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,300
You said its memory card disappeared.

464
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,680
If he found out something, he would make a move.

465
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,740
I'll get rid of the tracker.

466
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,810
Leave it.

467
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,900
It might come in handy.

468
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,570
It definitely feels different.

469
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,160
I sense warmth.

470
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,130
Kang Hoo was here, wasn't he?

471
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,650
What's wrong? You should be overjoyed right now.

472
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,790
I think that person's sick.

473
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,250
He can't live long, apparently.

474
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,020
Chairman Kang Il Gu?

475
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:35,270
You must feel kind of bad.

476
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,030
I've hated him my whole life,

477
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:42,520
but hearing that did make me feel kind of bad.

478
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,600
You might as well marry Kang Hoo.

479
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,290
- Marry him?
 - It'd be nice to show how happy you are

480
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,550
after getting married before he dies.

481
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,540
I thought you were here to tell me something.

482
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,420
Not really.

483
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,770
I feel frustrated, but I have no one to talk to.

484
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:13,300
Yu Jeong is busy with the foundation.

485
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,580
What is it about?

486
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,970
Na Na's liver transplant.

487
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,820
Apparently, I can't be the donor because of a health issue.

488
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,380
I guess I've committed a lot of sins.

489
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,040
So, I feel like I'm being punished for them.

490
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,800
What's Na Na's blood type?

491
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,150
I'm not related to her, but you never know.

492
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,400
She's an O, Rh negative.

493
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,170
Apparently, that's the rarest type.

494
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:42,230
Type O and Rh negative, did you say?

495
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,290
Wasn't that... Yu Jeong's blood type?

496
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,590
Yu Jeong?

497
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,430
Yes, I think I heard that once.

498
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:58,000
Although, I'm not sure about it.

499
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,930
Yes, Noona Yu Jeong.

500
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,130
Hae Mi's sick, and she's sleeping right now.

501
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,780
I'll tell her to call you when she wakes up.

502
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,530
Okay.

503
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,660
Is she very sick?

504
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,440
I'm seeing you often lately.

505
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,030
Whenever you come alone, all you do is complain.

506
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,240
Aigoo, my gosh.

507
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:20,520

508
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,810
- Let's eat.
 - Yes, let's.

509
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,880
Grandma might've told you,

510
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,010
but I first had blood sausage soup when I was 20.

511
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:55,600
Back then, your grandma used to run a boarding house in addition to the blood sausage restaurant.

512
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,990
I was her boarder then.

513
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:00,240
I've heard about it.

514
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,100
And that's how you met Mom, too.

515
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,100
Maybe it's because it's the food that nourished me when I was struggling.

516
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,650
There's nothing more delicious than this to me.

517
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:16,310
But you abandoned Jae Yi's grandmother and mother, who helped you when you struggled.

518
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,620
You abandoned Jae Yi with them, too.

519
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,070
- Kang Hoo.
 - It's okay.

520
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,180
It's all true.

521
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:31,120
You're right. I betrayed Jae Yi's mother.

522
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,870
I was hungry then, but I was also hungry for success.

523
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:41,130
That's why I'm trying to pay for my sin from now on.

524
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:46,520
I'll devote my last days only to Jae Yi.

525
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:54,290
She's been doing fine without a father.

526
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,240
Do you really think she needs one now?

527
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,620
That's just how a family is.

528
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:05,490
Your heart melts with their kind words, even if you've been ignoring each other.

529
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:11,550
That's the difference between family and strangers.

530
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,480
I thought that's what family was like, too.

531
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,360
But it turns out it's not true.

532
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:25,670
I learned that some people care more about their ambition than their family.

533
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:40,040
Yes, Chief.

534
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,500
Got it.

535
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:55,610
Assemblyman Gi apparently fell off the rooftop of Kangbo Hotel.

536
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,180
Sounds like it was suicide.

537
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,480
How could that happen?

538
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,780
How could that be?

539
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:17,120
It's all my fault. I'm the one who drove him to do it.

540
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,910
No, I'm sure you didn't.

541
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,260
Wait.

542
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:44,470
Would you... like to come to my house this evening?

543
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,440
Your house?

544
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:51,630
It's hard staying at a hotel alone.

545
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,100
You should come and eat.

546
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,960
I would like to ask you something, too.

547
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:00,420
Okay, thank you.

548
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:17,150
Why are you inviting him to your house?

549
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:22,340
He's a sick person... who's about to die.

550
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,610
What did you want to ask him about?

551
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:33,430
Gi Yoon Chul died right before the investigation.

552
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,720
An important figure like him made such a decision without trying anything?

553
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:46,310
I want to ask him what kind of conversation they had at the ward yesterday.

554
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,410
Did he meet with Gi Yoon Chul yesterday?

555
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:57,600
Yes, at the ward.

556
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,020
I feel strange, too.

557
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,900
I saw him yesterday, and he's dead now.

558
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,150
Kang Hoo, you'll join us later, right?

559
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:27,780
Yes, sir.

560
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,830
 Everything went smoothly, right?

561
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:34,450
Yes, he accepted it more willingly than I thought.

562
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:39,260
 Make sure he keeps his promise to protect my family.

563
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,410
 He told you not to worry about it.

564
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:47,860
 Have you been on my side at least once?

565
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,720
 I'm sorry.

566
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,890
 Farewell, then.

567
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:23,830
I think the Angel's Club case will quiet down, thanks to his suicide.

568
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,790
How about his cell phone?

569
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:27,920
 I took care of it.

570
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,740
But there's an issue.

571
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:38,610
I think that Choi Kang Hoo bastard knows something.

572
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:44,110
Yes, I'll prepare for it.

573
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:36,240

574
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,110
Attorney Do isn't here today.

575
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,870
I'm not here to see her,

576
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:39,340
I'm here to see you.

577
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,120
I've been observing you for a long time.

578
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:50,220
I'm grateful that you've been working for her sincerely all this time.

579
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,730
That's why I wanted to ask you for a favor.

580
00:54:53,730 --> 00:55:00,460
But you must not tell Jae Yi what I'm about to tell you.

581
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,350
You don't want me to tell Attorney Do?

582
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:07,600
That will be kind of difficult.

583
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,490
I'm on Attorney Do's side.

584
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:12,410
Exactly.

585
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,860
Since you're someone who will be on her side no matter what,

586
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,720
I'm asking you this right now.

587
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,180
You could do me a favor, right?

588
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,690
Yes, tell me.

589
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:48,790
I'm still not sure what's going on, but I'll do that.

590
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,740
Thank you.

591
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:04,880

592
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,040
You said you were leaving. Are you still here?

593
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,790
Yes, I'm taking a boat in Incheon tonight.

594
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:16,050
But I think someone keeps following me.

595
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,250
Could it be that Secretary Choi?

596
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,150
Where are you right now?

597
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:24,770
 I'm at that same fishing site.

598
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:26,690
Hold on a second.

599
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,980
His car is at Kangbo Hospital right now.

600
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,780
 He's somewhere far away from you.

601
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,110
Is it a debt collector, then?

602
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,720
You're leaving today, right?

603
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,990
I'll check his location periodically. Don't worry.

604
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,840
Yes, thank you.

605
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,300
Also, I'll never forget that I owe you.

606
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:15,410
Welcome.

607
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:16,810
Hello.

608
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:19,590
Are you looking for a certain kind of flowers?

609
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:21,280
Do you have hydrangeas, by chance?

610
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,840
Yes, which color would you like?

611
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,560
I would like to have a mix of pink and purple.

612
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,400
You came.

613
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,970
Na Na's at a neighbor's house.

614
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:03,470
I'll pick her up later.

615
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,980
Where are you going?

616
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,840
Hae Mi's sick, apparently.

617
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,240
I made some porridge. I'll bring it to her.

618
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,090
Then get going.

619
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,780
Okay.

620
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:05,400

621
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,630

622
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,900
She has been playing ignorant all this time?

623
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:44,850

624
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,150
Huh?

625
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,580
 The call is not going through. You'll be...

626
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,830
What?

627
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:03,140
I thought she was sick. Where's she going at this hour?

628
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,660

629
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:37,600

630
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,140
I'm about to be thrown out on the street.

631
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,020
I can't believe she's partying.

632
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:04,030
She even lied that she was sick?

633
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,990
I've never done any of this before.

634
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:00,490
 - Hey, Jae Yi.  
 - Hey, Kang Hoo.

635
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:04,300
Can you really not come tonight?

636
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,770
Sure, I'll come.

637
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,200
Thank you.

638
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,260
 Jae Yi.

639
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,240
Yeah?

640
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,190
 I love you.

641
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,080
I love you, Jae Yi.

642
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,400
Please wait for me for a little while.

643
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:51,130
What's this all of a sudden?

644
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,580
Yes.

645
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,180
Send him up.

646
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:35,760
Don't you feel uncomfortable being in this room?

647
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,980
It's a bit familiar.

648
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:43,460
It's my hotel. Why wouldn't it feel familiar?

649
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,310
There isn't a single room I haven't looked at.

650
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:53,440
Haven't you thought I might tell Jae Yi?

651
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,050
If you were, you wouldn't have come to see me.

652
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:04,380
You're way more shameless than I expected.

653
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,710
But you're still Jae Yi's father. So I'm here to give you a chance.

654
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:11,180
How about you turn yourself in?

655
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,640
Turn myself in? For what?

656
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:18,550
Do I have to bring evidence to make you admit?

657
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,440
There is evidence?

658
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:38,190
Should I remind you how you brutally  killed that "clingy bastard"?

659
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,650
 You came.

660
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,750
 Dad...

661
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,070
 Clingy bastard.

662
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,350
Do you finally feel like turning yourself in?

663
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,130
 See you soon.

664
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,920
 We'll be having dinner, just the two of us.

665
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,410

666
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:43,560

667
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:54,500
Just the two of us?

668
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,380
Did you make a delicious dinner?

669
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,640
I'm hungry.

670
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:04,980

671
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:08,620
Are you looking for anything specific?

672
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:13,550
Well, what kind of ring do people use when they propose?

673
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:17,160
Did you want to pick one out for your fiancÃ©?

674
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:24,810
No, I'm the one who'll be proposing.

675
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:33,060

676
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:37,540
â™«  Who are you, Mister?  â™«

677
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:47,570
â™«  And why I can't find you?  â™«

678
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:55,600
â™«  Don't tell, don't lie, don't care about you  â™«

679
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,370
 ~ Preview ~ 
As long as you keep quiet, Jae Yi could be loved by her father.

680
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:03,380
 It's something she has been wanting her whole life.

681
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,250
 What Jae Yi wants has always been the truth!

682
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,290
 Both 10 years ago and now!

683
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:12,620
 I collected the video from 10 years ago and his car's dash cam memory card.

684
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:18,280
 I should let Jae Yi know that there's no one you can trust in this world.

685
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,740
 I don't have to pay her back, okay?

686
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,550
 But that's just wrong!

687
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:27,690
 Friends? What a joke.

688
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:30,140
 Chairman Kang Il Gu?

689
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:34,270
 People are always driven by their desires.

690
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:39,440
 Betrayal and trust are on two sides of the same coin.

691
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,270
 Thank you.

692
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:47,020
 The things Jae Yi has been trusting the most need to be destroyed completely.

693
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:49,300
 Jae Yi!

694
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,250
 I'll tell you the truth of that day now.

695
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,870
 Kang Il Gu. I'll take everything he has,

696
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:01,470
 so it's impossible to escape, no matter what forces he uses.

697
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,530
 What's this? Move it right now!

698
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:07,600
 I'll destroy him completely.
