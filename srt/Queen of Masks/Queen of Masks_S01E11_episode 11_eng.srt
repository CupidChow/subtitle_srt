1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,600
- Congratulations, Yu Jeong.
 - Thank you, guys!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,770
Thank you.

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,270
 We will keep you entertained!

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,690
This is Do Jae Yi.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,540
She's an attorney.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,340
Congratulations, Yu Jeong.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,610
Do Shik, thank you for preparing such a cool event for Yu Jeong.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,860
This is Yoon Hae Mi.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,910
You know Hotel Mariela, right?

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,760
She's a team leader there.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,560
My position is the team leader,

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,350
but when it comes to beauty, I deserve to be the chairwoman, right?

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,370
Next, this is Go Yoo Na.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,060
Did you say you're a fashion designer?

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,940

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,680
And she's the star of the night.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,500
The person I love the most in the world, our Yu Jeong.

18
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,830
Hello.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,980
They're the queens.

20
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,690
The queens of the mask party tonight.

21
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,680
Queens of masks?

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,520
They're so pretty but apparently super successful, too.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,690
If you were to pick one out of them, which one would it be?

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,080
Why do I have to pick just one?

25
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,110
I can try having all of them.

26
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,730
Pardon?

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,350
Why don't you try this on?

28
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,390
She's not the one.

29
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,590
What a coward.

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,520
You son of a bitch!

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,240
By chance, do you know the Ace Bar in Korea?

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,590
Should we get married?

33
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,920

34
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,140
Welcome to Korea.

35
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,250
You haven't been to Korea since that incident, right?

36
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,390
It's because the old man finally called me.

37
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,520
Your new name is Song Je Hyeok.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,250
You studied economics at a college in New York, had a trading business,

39
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,450
and you just returned to Korea.

40
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,040
Song Je Hyeok?

41
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,830
 [Personal Information[

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,510
Song Je Hyeok?

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,360
You studied in the US, and you had a big business, too.

44
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:23,680
So, why does someone with such an impressive résumé want to work at our orphanage?

45
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,690
I grew up in an orphanage since my parents died when I was little.

46
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:37,340
That's why I've always wanted to help children to

47
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,990
achieve their dreams in my home country.

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,150
How come the coffee isn't here yet?

49
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,460

50
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,610
Long time no see, Queens.

51
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,220

52
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,420
Attorney Do, we haven't seen you since the video scandal from 10 years ago.

53
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,720
What have you been doing all this time instead of campaigning?

54
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,070
I've actually been quite busy.

55
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,730
I'm sorry for making you worry.

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,110
Did you perhaps want to have a press conference today because of the video?

57
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,210
No, the reason I asked you to come here

58
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:10,830
is to let you know that I'm no longer a mayoral candidate for Tongju.

59
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,390
I'll step down.

60
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,130
 I'll give up on everything first.

61
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,100
 I need to be free from the press and the public eye.

62
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,860
 You'll give up on everything. And then?

63
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,180
 And then, I'll set a trap.

64
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,810
 So he'd come to where we are.

65
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,690
 What if he comes? Will we just kill him?

66
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,790
 We can't just kill him!

67
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,890
 We need to confirm that he's in charge of the Ace Bar, not Leo. Then kill him!

68
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,540
 I need paperwork that says Emily Go is the biological mother.

69
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,760
 That way, I can donate my liver to Na Na.

70
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,440
 I'm planning to prevent him from doing anything until we get what we want.

71
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,380
 Is trapping him for a few days a sufficient punishment?

72
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,640
 I want to kill the bastard,

73
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,980
 so he won't be the father of my kids forever.

74
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,900
 We'll kill him.

75
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:18,150
 But we can't have the dirty blood directly on our hands.

76
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,490
What's the reason?

77
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,610
Is it due to your polling numbers dropping because of the video?

78
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,700
No. I have something else to do now.

79
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,360
Where the hell is she?

80
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,580
I told you to find her by searching the whole country, didn't I?

81
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,320
We need to find her to decide whether to kill her or not, you asshole!

82
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,490
 I did find her, but...

83
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,460
Really? Where is she?

84
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,340
 Breaking news came up just now.

85
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,210
- What?
  - Do Jae Yi's doing a live press conference.

86
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,530
Press conference?

87
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,420
 Let me ask you one last question.

88
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,470
 If you step down,

89
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,990
 Mr. Song Je Hyeok of Hanguk Party would be dominating the mayoral election for Tongju.

90
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,730
 Please say something to him briefly.

91
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:20,180
 I think Candidate Song should never become mayor of Tongju.

92
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:27,400
 Such an unfortunate event in which he becomes the mayor of Tongju will not happen.

93
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,840
Do Jae Yi. What are you trying to do, exactly?

94
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,360
What do you mean he can't become the mayor?

95
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,730
Does your stepping down have something to do with him?

96
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,830
- Ms. Do!
 - Ms. Do! Please tell us a little more!

97
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,960
That will be the end of the press conference.

98
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,580
- Ms. Do!
 - Ms. Do!

99
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,600
 Please tell us a little more!

100
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,940
 Please tell us!

101
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,410
 Ms. Do! Please tell us!

102
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,750
- Yes, Assemblyman.
 - What are you doing right now?

103
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,670
You're stepping down? Do you want him to become the mayor of Tongju?

104
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,880
I didn't step down to make him the mayor.

105
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,610
I'm trying to put an end to him.

106
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:28,820
If you want to do the same, you would have to give up on something like I did.

107
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,030
 Could you do that?

108
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,530
 Do you know what he said as he died?

109
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,370
 "Dad! Dad!"

110
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,630
 He kept calling for you like a child.

111
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,620
Just tell me what I need to give up on.

112
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,400
I'll even give up on my life if I could put an end to him!

113
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,530
 Would it be okay?

114
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,990
You basically declared war on him.

115
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:11,700
Before you attack him, I'm sure he would attack you first.

116
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,890
That's exactly what I'm aiming for.

117
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,430
I'm sure he'll rush, trying to attack me first.

118
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,770
No matter how thorough he is, he has to make a mistake.

119
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,610
So don't worry too much and do what I asked you to do.

120
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,610
What if things go wrong?

121
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,180
If so, you'd be in great danger.

122
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,950
In any case, this fight ends only when one of us dies.

123
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,630
But still... I won't be lonely this time.

124
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,020
Since I won't be alone.

125
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:06,340

126
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,270
Wow, I get someone new today!

127
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,980
I'm not the lady you requested.

128
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,440
Who are you, then?

129
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I'm your dad's mistress, Emily Go.

130
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,190
Your father died, and your mother is in prison.

131
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,970
Your parents can no longer protect you. Why are you still doing this?

132
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,150
Why did you come here? Shit.

133
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:53,050
Why does my dead father's mistress need to see me? How annoying.

134
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:59,160
You requested the return of the statutory minimum inheritance for the land your dad gave me.

135
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,450
- Cancel that.
 - Why would I?

136
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,650
Do Jae Yi told me that I could at least get a portion of it through the lawsuit.

137
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:11,430
I'll give you the entire parcel of land if you cancel it.

138
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,170
Really?

139
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,800
Why?

140
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,370
I wanted to request something else as payment from you.

141
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,980
What is it?

142
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,620
 Are you suggesting creating a culprit?

143
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,870
 Just like how I was framed 10 years ago?

144
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,000
 We can't frame someone innocent.

145
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,380
 That's why we need to find a way.

146
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,090
 I heard this while digging for info on Song Je Hyeok.

147
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,550
 He apparently supplied drugs to the adult entertainment district in Tongju 10 years ago.

148
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,750
 A gang was involved in it, too,

149
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,430
 but I guess he ran to the US after getting paid in advance.

150
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,770
 He took gang money and ran?

151
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,240
 He's got some balls.

152
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,630
Why don't you be my speaker?

153
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,560
Speaker?

154
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,510
I'll connect you with an organization that sells drugs.

155
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,060
Go to them and show them this photo.

156
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,830
Who's this?

157
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,670
The current chairman of the Yeongun Cultural Foundation and the mayoral candidate for Tongju.

158
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,480
It's Song Je Hyeok.

159
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,570
But he sold drugs at Ace Bar 10 years ago.

160
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,610
He took money from a gang and ran away.

161
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,460
This is really Song Je Hyeok?

162
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,120
Geez, no way. Who would believe that?

163
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,960
I guess you aren't hungry enough yet.

164
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,570
You just need to show this photo to the boss of the organization.

165
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,220
Tell him that bastard from 10 years ago is back.

166
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,760
You would hit the jackpot right away then!

167
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,620
Really?

168
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,700
But that's kind of risky.

169
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,360
Would they just let him live after he took their money?

170
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,800
They would try to kill him no matter what.

171
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,060
That would be even better.

172
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,560

173
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,050
Your guardian isn't here. Would you be okay leaving by yourself?

174
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,810
I thought my husband would be busy.

175
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,670
By the way, Ma'am,

176
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:39,460
don't tell anyone that I broke the rule and went out last night, okay?

177
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,760
 Why don't you move out of the house?

178
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,890
 I want you to get away from someone so dangerous immediately.

179
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,820
 No, I'll just play ignorant.

180
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,570
 If I move out of the house, he might find out about our plan.

181
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,940
 Would you be okay?

182
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,060
 Are you treating me like a powerless child?

183
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:10,110
 To be honest, I'm the only one who could approach him right now.

184
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,560
 I'm sure there's something I can do next to him.

185
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,210
 Let me do it.

186
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,220
Oh, excuse me.

187
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,080
Patient Song Na Na on the 7th floor of the pediatric ward.

188
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,290
Could you please give this to her?

189
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,560
It's her favorite blanket. She needs this to sleep well.

190
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,940
Why don't you give it to her directly? She's your daughter.

191
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:49,610
My husband didn't even tell me she was hospitalized because I would get stressed.

192
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,690
I'd like to play ignorant.

193
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,780
You must be so happy. Your husband cares about you so much.

194
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,650
Yes. I'm happy

195
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,580
that I have a great husband like Je Hyeok.

196
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,650

197
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,590
You can't keep calling me here like this.

198
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,240
Have you thought about how you'd kill that bastard?

199
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,110
Looks like you haven't eaten yet. Why don't you eat first─

200
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,520
This isn't for me!

201
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,420
It'll get cold. Eat.

202
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,540
Since when did you care about me eating?

203
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,220
I can't bring myself to eat,

204
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,010
because I've never had a meal with my father in my life.

205
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,970
What are you trying to tell me?

206
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,650
I know that you came to the hospital.

207
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,940
 All of this for some mask.

208
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,290
 Live. Please.

209
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,480
But I don't feel grateful at all.

210
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,230
You said... "Some mask?"

211
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,240
How could you say something like that?

212
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,820
That was so incredibly humiliating for me.

213
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,390
Because of that, I even considered death.

214
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,510
Punishing isn't the only way to take revenge on someone.

215
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,010
Sometimes, forgetting about it could be revenge, too.

216
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,900
I was hoping you would do that.

217
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:26,410
If you did, our relationship could've been better than it is now.

218
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,390
I'm sorry if you wanted silence.

219
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,550
You told me to live, didn't you?

220
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:39,490
Since I came to life, I'll make sure to punish him.

221
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,370
Do you perhaps want me to kill him?

222
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,630
What I want from you is...

223
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,340
What is it?

224
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,590

225
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,870
Geez! I'm sorry about Leo, okay?

226
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,170
But I didn't make him the CEO nor report him!

227
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,260
I'm serious!

228
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,850
I'm not here to blame you about Leo.

229
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,210
He's just in jail. I'll pretend he joined the army!

230
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,710
Why did you come to see me then?

231
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,630
Do you need drugs, by chance?

232
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,990
No, I don't need that.

233
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,550
Give me some documents.

234
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,800
Ace Bar's documents that show who your real boss is.

235
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,990
Come on! Do you think I'm stupid?

236
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,940
So, you can get Leo out of jail using that?

237
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,390
Then, my boss would just kill me─

238
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,280
The scary boss of yours will be finished in two days!

239
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,500
What's the point of being loyal to some mayfly?

240
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,510
He'll be finished in two days?

241
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,530
What do you mean by that?

242
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,270
Do Jae Yi told me

243
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,710
that everything he has will be gone in two days.

244
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,540
You know that she even got the records of the Angel's Club, right?

245
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,130
She's so impressive.

246
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:39,080
Do you think there's something she couldn't do?

247
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,430
 You mean we have to hint at it, right?

248
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,540
 The date we'll be attacking him.

249
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,460
 If so, he'll try to attack me first.

250
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,360
 That's when we'll set our trap.

251
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,000
 I think I know whom to drop a hint to.

252
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,390
 Let me take care of that.

253
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,510
 In two days?

254
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,620
I will be finished in two days? What do you mean?

255
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,360
Yoon Hae Mi came over and said earlier

256
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,410
that Do Jae Yi will finish you after two days.

257
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,960
She's definitely plotting something.

258
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,390
I overheard Do Jae Yi and Assemblyman Gi's phone conversation.

259
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,650
Do Jae Yi ordered him to do something.

260
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,850
Could she be exposing the Angel's Club's records?

261
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,110
She knows better than anyone that it won't affect me at all.

262
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,210
If she was going to, she would've done it during the press conference.

263
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,530
Geez! How is she attacking, then?

264
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,860
I'm so nervous!

265
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,280
After two days, right?

266
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,380
I can get rid of her before that.

267
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,060
Get rid of her?

268
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,450
It would be tomorrow, then. Aren't you rushing it too much?

269
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,720
 I'm ready to give you the land in Tongju.

270
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,530
 Bring me a document verifying that Emily Go is Na Na's mother to my hotel room tomorrow night.

271
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,260
I don't see why not.

272
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,100
We already have the culprit, too.

273
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,990

274
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,530
 Okay, I'll be there by 9 tomorrow.

275
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,420
 Song Je Hyeok is coming to the hotel by 9 tomorrow.

276
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:49,580
If he's coming to you by 9, I'm sure he'd try to kill me around then.

277
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,210
 He'll use you for his alibi.

278
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,820
Did Hae Mi say she'll get the drugs?

279
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,620
Remember to take the customer's secret to your grave.

280
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,440
Come out!

281
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,840
You'd better do it right. Don't get nervous.

282
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,000
I'll text you now.

283
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,310
 I'm meeting Jae Yi at Kang Hoo's restaurant at 8 tomorrow.

284
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,610
 We'll discuss how to get Leo out.

285
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,140
 You should come, too, because your husband did it.

286
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,950
I figured out Do Jae Yi's schedule.

287
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,010
She's going to Choi Kang Hoo's restaurant tomorrow.

288
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:35,390
Would you wait at the restaurant, lure her, and kill her?

289
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,820
No.

290
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,700
I suddenly have an idea.

291
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,830
Why do I have to only kill Do Jae Yi?

292
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,560
Yoon Hae Mi and Choi Kang Hoo will be at the restaurant, too.

293
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,780

294
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,970

295
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,040

296
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,710
- You already heard about it from the company, right? 
 - Yes.

297
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,440
I heard you wanted us to attend the party tomorrow.

298
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,780
You must keep it a secret that you're attending this party.

299
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,160
Here's the agreement. Please sign it.

300
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,810

301
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,560
There's one more thing. You won't just be dressed in black.

302
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,600
You have to style your hair and dress the way I tell you to.

303
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:58,810

304
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,870
 Song Je Hyeok.

305
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,670
 Either you die or I die.

306
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,920
Yu Jeong?

307
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,120
You're up.

308
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,810
Have a seat.

309
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,970
Drink some.

310
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,570
I made it with the fruits I chose myself at the market this morning.

311
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,940
When did you leave the hospital?

312
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,400
I haven't heard from the hospital.

313
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,670
I told them not to tell you.

314
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:05,690
I didn't want you to worry since you're busy campaigning.

315
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,490
You must be curious about where Na Na is, right?

316
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,740
- Right now, she's─
 - I'm not curious.

317
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,820
I'm sure she's doing well with the nanny.

318
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,720
I only want to focus on this baby right now.

319
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,010
Go ahead and drink it.

320
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,740
You have to drink it right away because it's made with fresh fruit.

321
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,360
It's tasty and fresh.

322
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,180
It's quince tea that's good for bronchial tubes.

323
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,640
I thought you might be exhausted from meeting so many people these days.

324
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,540
Why are you so nice to me today?

325
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,630
I'll be even nicer from now on.

326
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:35,020
Like you said, you're someone I should be thankful for.

327
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,090
You gave me the baby, the greatest gift.

328
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,150
Do you love having a baby that much?

329
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,710
When I first heard the baby's heartbeat at the hospital,

330
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,560
I felt like I had the whole world.

331
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:02,180
I could do anything for this baby.

332
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,060
Anything.

333
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,440
I'll get going.

334
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,070
Okay.

335
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,790
Are you going out tonight?

336
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,090
I sent it.

337
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,610

338
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,850
 I got it.

339
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,840
 He'll check the message on the phone he cloned now.

340
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,430
No, I'll stay home for the baby.

341
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:50,110
I told you. I'll only focus on my baby from now on.

342
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:06,150
You know that you're the only woman I trust, right?

343
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,160
Yes.

344
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,090
I'll get going.

345
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,200

346
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,340
 Success.

347
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,450
 Let's prepare for the party starting now.

348
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,830
♫  Do you want me to stop?  ♫

349
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,070
♫  But you know I'm gon' move on  ♫

350
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,870

00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,710
♫  So watch out  ♫

353
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,810
♫   watch out, you won't know

354
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,940
♫  Look at my eyes now  ♫

355
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,770
♫  You got it

356
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,590
♫  So get out  ♫

357
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,760

♫  It's not a joke  ♫

359
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,880
♫  It's not a joke, babe  ♫

360
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:51,450
♫  Even if it’s crazy, it's okay  ♫

361
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,720
♫  Showtime  ♫

362
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,480
♫  Alright, don't hesitate  ♫

363
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,430
♫  Alright.  Ain't no joking  ♫

364
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,400
♫  Could do everything or nothing  ♫

365
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:10,880

366
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,680
 The women are here.

367
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,340
They arrived?

368
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,110
Tell them to get started.

369
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,020
 Yes, sir.

370
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,340
Make sure to wear them around here,

371
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,930
so they confuse you with the actors.

372
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,950
How about them?

373
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,410
Once you leave, they'll be walking around pretending to be you.

374
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,930
It'd be hard to find someone with a body like mine.

375
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,360
What if we get caught?

376
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,090
I was just joking!

377
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,890
Let's loosen up a little!

378
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,280
How about the CCTV?

379
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,670
I kept the CCTV in the front on.

380
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,830
And I broke the one in the back.

381
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,670
No one would know when you leave through the back.

382
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,410
Listen carefully. The reason why we're here now

383
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:23,540
is to create an alibi for us if something happens to Song Je Hyeok.

384
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,040
Excuse me, I'll go to the bathroom real quick.

385
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,600
Go ahead. I heard you need to go often when you're pregnant.

386
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,840
 I'm on my way. You got the documents for the land, right?

387
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,820
 Just arrive on time.

388
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,760
Get going. We'll be right there, too.

389
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,060
Yoo Na, don't worry so much.

390
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,550
You'll never meet him alone.

391
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,960
I'll take you to the back door.

392
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,970

393
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,120
Oh, I'm sorry!

394
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,910
So sorry.

395
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,060
 I poured the paint thinner into each stall.

396
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,050
 Should I start now?

397
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,770
I noticed a strange smell from the water bottle.

398
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,040
I told Kang Hoo because I had a bad feeling.

399
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,320
My hunch was correct.

400
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,100
Your nose saved us!

401
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,180
We could've turned into barbecues if it weren't for you!

402
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,770
Tell me. Why did you try to do such a thing?

403
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,320
I don't know anything. I only did what I was told to!

404
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,340
It's obvious. It's because of me.

405
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,820
Everyone here could've died because of me.

406
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,090
What a cruel bastard.

407
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,500
I should get going.

408
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,000
That way, everyone here could be safe.

409
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,380
Jae Yi.

410
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:55,310
Don't worry, Kang Hoo. We can join her soon.

411
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,770
Yes, Do Jae Yi is leaving on her own, as you predicted.

412
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,090
Take care of her without a mistake.

413
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,670
I'll be out to take care of Go Yoo Na, too.

414
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,650
Yes, got it.

415
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,020
That Do Jae Yi.

416
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,500
Your petty concept of righteous indignation is the problem.

417
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,700
Why would I start a fire for no reason?

418
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,970
Everything would be over if I just killed you.

419
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,200

420
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,510
Easy.

421
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,640
Don't chase too aggressively!

422
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:35,450
Could Jae Yi arrive at the hotel safely?

423
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,610
We should have faith.

424
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,740
We should get going now, too.

425
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,350
Okay.

426
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,210
There she is!

427
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,760
Get closer, closer, closer!

428
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,360
What's she doing?

429
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,040
Why did she stop?

430
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,120
Catch her right now.

431
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,860
Who are you?

432
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,620
Where's Do Jae Yi?

433
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,370
Fine. You won't tell us, right? Get him.

434
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,020
You look like you saw a ghost.

435
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,420
Why?

436
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,180
Did you think I'd be dead by now?

437
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,980
What kind of trick did you play?

438
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,850
Not too bad.

439
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:43,040
Why did you come to see me after dodging all of my guys?

440
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,260
Right.

441
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,400
Is this what you meant by betraying me?

442
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,720
What is it? What...

443
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,310
Did you bring a gun or something?

444
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,240
I'll give you one last chance, Song Je Hyeok.

445
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,880
Admit to all the crimes you committed and turn yourself in.

446
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,620
Wouldn't being in prison be safer than being out in the world?

447
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,040
I don't think I would get killed by you even if I die, though.

448
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,780
That would be too embarrassing.

449
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,610
Okay.

450
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:41,380
This will be our last time to face each other like this anyway.

451
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,470
Should we drink together one last time?

452
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,990
Okay, that's great. I was thirsty.

453
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,520
Did you think I would drink that?

454
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,090
I don't know what kind of things you did to it.

455
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,480
So don't even try to drug me.

456
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,490
The moment you try something, you'd get killed by my hands.

457
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,860
Just admit that you miss that night from 10 years ago.

458
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,450
Say it was actually amazing.

459
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:59,130
You never know. I might let you live.

460
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,620
Yes.

461
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,490
I'll think of this as a cute tantrum.

462
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,420
But...

463
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,430
if you do that one more time...

464
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,670
 I'll get going.

465
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,310
Are you awake now?

466
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,730
Did you come here to sleep?

467
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,410
Why did you sleep so much?

468
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,170
I found this in your pocket.

469
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,700
Did you try to frame me for Jae Yi's murder

470
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,810
while I was out like you did 10 years ago?

471
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,000
I didn't think you would do this, Yu Jeong.

472
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,390
What will you do with the baby?

473
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,290
It's for the baby.

474
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:45,180
I can't let the baby have someone like you as the father.

475
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,060
Okay, fine. I admit it.

476
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,750
You guys totally got me.

477
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:01,390
But if you kill me, what would you do afterwards?

478
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,520
Do you think we'd kill you?

479
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,890
You just need to be in a deep sleep until we get what we want.

480
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,700
What will you do after I wake up?

481
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:19,060
You know that anything you acquire illegally is useless since you're a lawyer.

482
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,660
Where's the evidence that we imprisoned you illegally?

483
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:33,380
 Do you... want me to kill him by chance?

484
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,230
 What I want from you is...

485
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,620
 What is it?

486
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,120
 Please pause the CCTV

487
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,780
 at Grand Kangbo Hotel on the date and time of my request.

488
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,670
 What day would that be?

489
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:56,660
We didn't meet you here right now.

490
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,570
You came here to cheat on your wife.

491
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,430
With me. Your wife's friend.

492
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:09,050
I gave you the key, but suddenly came to a realization.

493
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,100
So I went to the party to avoid you.

494
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,770
You took drugs out of anger because you got rejected by Yoo Na.

495
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,440
Along with the sleeping pill.

496
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,400
You probably won't wake up for two days.

497
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,260
When you wake up from your sleep,

498
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,360
you'll be removed from your family, the foundation,

499
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,490
and the mayoral candidacy for Tongju, too.

500
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,680
You'll be broke.

501
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,240
You'll go back to your old self.

502
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,630
What a tight scenario.

503
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:44,050
That's not the end of the scenario.

504
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:48,000
The moment you wake up and leave this hotel,

505
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,210
the real hell will be waiting for you.

506
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,890
Give me.

507
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,020
That's the bastard.

508
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,330
Where is he right now?

509
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:10,170
- He's in Korea right now, apparently.
 - This punk!

510
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,990
The gang from 10 years ago won't let you live.

511
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:20,290
Then, it wouldn't be strange if you died whenever, wherever, and however, right?

512
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,700
That would be the end of you. Do you like it?

513
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,010
Let's make a deal properly.

514
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,970
Yu Jeong. Yeongun Foundation is about to go bankrupt.

515
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,390
You can save it with my slush fund.

516
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:43,580
Don't talk about my foundation with your dirty mouth.

517
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:50,110
Yoon Hae Mi, what will you and your mom do with Daesungak if I die?

518
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,810
We've been working together for 10 years.

519
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,610
How dare you try to take us down with you?

520
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:57,480
Why are you bringing up my mom right now?

521
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,470
How about you, Yoo Na?

522
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:05,160
What would you do if Na Na were gone?

523
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,830
If Na Na were gone?

524
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,010
What do you mean?

525
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,780
She left the hospital today.

526
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,400
If I die, you won't know where she is.

527
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,900
She might not even be in this country.

528
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,210
You!

529
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,680
Tell me! Where did you send Na Na?

530
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,120
Where did you send her?

531
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,500
I know where she is.

532
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
How do you know?

533
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,900
Jae Yi gave me a tracker.

534
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,050
I put that on the blanket and gave it to her.

535
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:45,810
 Could you please give this to her?

536
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,220
 It's her favorite blanket.

537
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:53,020
Why are you telling me that now? I got scared!

538
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,190
You jumped at him first!

539
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,560
I thought you were a bullet!

540
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,310
Are you done acting out now?

541
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,500
There's one person left.

542
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,730
You, Do Jae Yi.

543
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:24,070
Aren't you curious about what happened that day?

544
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,730
The truth of the incident from 10 years ago.

545
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,490
If you let me go, I'll tell you what the truth is.

546
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,270
The truth has already been revealed.

547
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:45,340
You're the one who raped me that day,

548
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,140
and you're the one who killed Gi Do Shik.

549
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,570
How pitiful. You're pitiful, Do Jae Yi.

550
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:51,870
I pity you.

551
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,980
You're the pitiful one!

552
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,100
You used us for your disgusting desires,

553
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,210
but you ended up this way because of us.

554
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:02,140
You messed with the wrong people.

555
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,590
You'll find out what I meant by "pitiful" soon.

556
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:15,010
I hate talkative men.

557
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,120
You're done talking now, right?

558
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,080
Good night, then.

559
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,500
You erased all of our traces, right?

560
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,480
It doesn't matter, even if there are.

561
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,930
This is my room, anyway.

562
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,940
That crazy bastard. He can't be immune to the drug, right?

563
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,910
You definitely took care of the CCTV, right?

564
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,490
It'll be off until tomorrow morning.

565
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,110
But it would be better to leave quickly.

566
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:19,330

567
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:25,440
We've been at the party until now, and we're going home now.

568
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:32,370
I'll expose the Angel's Club while he's asleep.

569
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,920
I should go to Na Na.

570
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,530
I'll finally be her mom proudly.

571
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:44,010
I'll remove him from the foundation and the candidacy.

572
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,610
So he becomes an empty shell again.

573
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:50,660
I should get Leo out of jail.

574
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,650
Hang in there just for one more night, Leo!

575
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:58,900
Yes. Let's each do our tasks and regroup here tomorrow night.

576
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,540
You should come to my house. You can't be at the hotel.

577
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,050
By the way, I'm curious about something.

578
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,860
Who turned off the CCTV at the hotel?

579
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,270
That was the most important role.

580
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,370
I feel grateful for it.

581
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:21,990
Well...

582
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,620
We just got lucky.

583
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,670
Okay.

584
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,070
Are we going our separate ways now?

585
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,570
- Well─
 - Well─

586
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:49,000
You guys did so much. Thank you.

587
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,600
It was possible because of you guys.

588
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,300
 There was a shocking incident at Chunsarang Orphanage in Tongju City.

589
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,250
 The police are investigating Principal Jung

590
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,120
 for child abuse and false imprisonment.

591
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,820
 And they're conducting a search and seizure of the orphanage.

592
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,470
 They're also planning to investigate the illegal structure

593
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:25,200
 inside the orphanage, where the children were imprisoned.

594
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,010
 There's another thing you need to let go of.

595
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:32,980
 In addition to Song Je Hyeok?

596
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,150
 Angel's Club.

597
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,000
 You need to let go of that, too.

598
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,770
 That was already exposed because of you!

599
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:46,730
 I'm sure they'll keep it running using someone else instead of Song Je Hyeok.

600
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:49,410
 By finding the flaws in powerful people and

601
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:55,200
 to achieve your ambition of becoming the most powerful person in the country.

602
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,950
 I won't just let you be.

603
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:05,470
 I already have an informant who saw you at the club.

604
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:13,170
 So you might as well help me destroy the Angel's Club.

605
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:19,140
 If so, I'll remove your name from the list of members.

606
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:24,420
 Can you really get me out of it?

607
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:32,270
 Conduct a search and seizure of the orphanage.

608
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:38,630
 Block off Song Je Hyeok's spies at the Prosecutors' Office and the police, too.

609
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:47,970
 Since the orphanage belongs to the Yeongun Cultural Foundation,

610
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:52,410
 they planned to investigate its chairman, Song Je Hyeok, a mayoral candidate of the Hanguk Party,

611
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:55,010
 but due to his disappearance...

612
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,920
I decided to conduct the investigation myself, since it's an important case.

613
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:11,780
Shall we start since Ms. Lee Yeon Ah's lawyer arrived, too?

614
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:18,220
Yeon Ah, you don't have to talk about anything you don't want to.

615
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:22,010
You can deny answering the questions that are difficult, too.

616
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,890
No, I can do it,

617
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,960
because you're here with me.

618
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:42,260
Once a week, in the basement storage room I was trapped in,

619
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:46,560
a party was held by a group called "The Angel's Club."

620
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:52,410
Guests came wearing masks there.

621
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,680
You can't recognize them because of the masks, but...

622
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,330
For the reservation...

623
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,960
- What's this about?
 - We're here for an investigation.

624
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,920
- Go in!
 - Wait.

625
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,930
Investigation?

626
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,400

627
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,130
Keep calling and see if he answers.

628
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:25,590
What was it that happened overnight?

629
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,540
Do you know anything, by chance?

630
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,980
Don't you get it?

631
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:37,280
He ran off because he didn't know what to do after failing to kill Jae Yi.

632
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,710
And you got screwed over.

633
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,740
Just help with the investigation and request a favorable arrangement.

634
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,940
That could lessen your sentence even by a day.

635
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,340
Then, what am I supposed to do?

636
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,720
The document that says he's the real CEO of the Ace Bar.

637
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,100
Give it to me.

638
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,780

639
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,560
Noona!

640
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,740
I missed you, Noona.

641
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,600
You must've had a hard time!

642
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,240
What did I tell you? I told you to trust me, didn't I?

643
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,190
Of course, I trusted you. I always have.

644
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:33,600
Let's get out of here.

645
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,230
Let's go get tasty food.

646
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:38,790
But shouldn't you have brought me tofu?

647
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,410
Tofu, my foot!

648
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:42,450
Let's just go home!

649
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:48,160
When we get home, I'll give you something pale, softer, and sweeter than tofu.

650
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,260
What's that? By chance...

651
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,910
What are you thinking?

652
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,960
Cake with whipped cream! Whipped cream!

653
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,990
Whipped cream? Where will you put it?

654
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,960
The place I'm thinking of? Wow!

655
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,260
You're still so out of it even after getting out of jail!

656
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,100
Follow me!

657
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,400

658
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,900
 Patient Song Na Na's guardian. Please come in.

659
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:17,000
 I heard you want to donate your liver to Patient Song Na Na.

660
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,850
I'm Na Na's biological mother.

661
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,340
You can check if she's my biological daughter.

662
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,960
However, her legal guardian is Song Je Hyeok.

663
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,550
So without his approval─

664
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,550
Here's a power of attorney letter that says

665
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:39,900
he'll give me all the power regarding the surgery.

666
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,050
Have a look.

667
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:47,350

668
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,090
Let's get some coffee.

669
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,770
Sounds good.

670
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,440
 Hello, I'm Song Je Hyeok, the chairman of the Yeongun Cultural Foundation

671
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,690
 and Hanguk Party's mayoral candidate of Tongju City.

672
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:07,890
Hey, I got an email from Song Je Hyeok.

673
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,550
I got one, too!

674
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:18,090
 In order to be responsible for the child abuse, illegal imprisonment,

675
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:22,280
 and the illegal structure inside the Chunsarang Orphanage...

676
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,300
Let's go!

677
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,850
 As of now, I'll step down from the chairman position of

678
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:32,070
 Yeongun Cultural Foundation and the mayoral candidacy for Tongju.

679
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:36,620
I apologize on behalf of my husband for the disturbance.

680
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:40,370
According to the email from Song Je Hyeok, he said he'd step down from all positions.

681
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:45,610
Does that mean he admits his involvement with what was going on at the orphanage?

682
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,370
What happened inside the illegal structure of the orphanage?

683
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:50,570
Did you get an email, too, Chairwoman Ju?

684
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,330
Did he say anything else?

685
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,410
- Please tell us!
 - Just one moment, please.

686
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,030
As you know, as soon as I got married,

687
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:04,620
I removed myself from the foundation and the orphanage.

688
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:11,070
I still don't really understand what's going on.

689
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,940
Where is Mr. Song right now?

690
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:17,960
According to the police, he's been missing since the incident went public.

691
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,580
I'm not sure where my husband,

692
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:27,910
Song Je Hyeok is, either.

693
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:35,220
What I would like to say is that no matter where he is,

694
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,680
he's probably hanging in there right now.

695
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,730
That's all.

696
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,980
Well done.

697
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,270
Good job, everyone!

698
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:40,540
Today's plan was a success, too, right?

699
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:45,120
I sat on the chairman's seat for the first time in a while.

700
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,600
It feels like I'm back where I belong to.

701
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,690
I'll never leave again.

702
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:55,190
Today, I proudly went to the hospital as Na Na's mom.

703
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,010
I won't ever let go of her hand again.

704
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,570
Aren't you glad, Jae Yi?

705
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:10,780
You saved the children at the orphanage and exposed the Angel's Club, too.

706
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:13,750
Of course, I'm glad.

707
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,400
She never expresses how happy she is!

708
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:22,550
By the way, shouldn't he be awake by now?

709
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:25,080
Did anyone hear from him?

710
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,980
To leave evidence that I was looking for my husband,

711
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:34,690
I kept trying to call him, but it's been off since we left.

712
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,620
He hasn't turned it back on.

713
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,720
Could he still be asleep?

714
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,590
I guess the drug really worked.

715
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,840
Should we go have a look, then?

716
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,990
To see what he's up to?

717
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,820

718
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,860
Yes.

719
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:12,550
 Attorney Do, we have a problem.

720
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:16,790
I went inside to clean the room,

721
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:19,820
and there was that thing covered with a bedsheet!

722
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:22,890
I called the police because I instinctively thought it was a body.

723
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:24,990
I didn't think it would actually be a body!

724
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,680
It was so scary!

725
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:53,560
Song Je Hyeok... is dead.

726
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,390
Dead?

727
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,700
How?

728
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,450
Why?

729
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:03,340
I don't know the details.

730
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,110
Why all of a sudden?

731
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:11,360
How could he suddenly...

732
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:15,890
Are you okay?

733
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:18,420
I'll go get some water.

734
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:30,140
By chance... after we left the hotel,

735
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:33,380
did anyone go back inside?

736
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,750
Oh, my God!

737
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:06,610

738
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,020

739
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,660

740
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:44,190

741
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:01,010
Mom.

742
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:03,600
I just arrived at the hotel.

743
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,210
I'll go in right now.

744
01:07:53,950 --> 01:08:00,930

745
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:06,180

746

 ~ Preview ~ 
Autopsy?

754
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,140
 What do you mean, murdered?

755
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:33,780
 Hey, we all said we would kill him. Remember?

756
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,200
 It doesn't matter who did it as long as he's dead!

757
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,340
 I was at the restaurant all night that night.

758
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,930
 I was with my friends.

759
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:42,910
 I told you!

760
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,590
 I was at a party with friends that night!

761
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:48,900
 Just ask them yourself!

762
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,780
 I can't leave any trace.

763
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:54,280
 Why did you leave the hotel gagging?

764
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,460
 Was there a CCTV?

765
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,310
 Answer me! Did anyone go back to the hotel?

766
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:03,720
 Actually killing someone and being framed for it are not the same!

767
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,410
 It wasn't me.

768
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:09,280
 I did go inside the hotel, but I didn't kill him.

769
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,030
 The truth isn't important.

770
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:14,720
 What's important is for you not to get involved.

771
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,990
 We should survive on our own.

772
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,880
 - Are you guys serious?
 - Yoo Na!

773
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,770
 Go Yoo Na, you're under arrest for the murder of Song Je Hyeok.

774
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:26,820
 I told you that it's going to be exactly like 10 years ago!
