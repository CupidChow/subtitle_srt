1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,260

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:17,020

3
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,470
So, this is the symbol of the secret club.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,320
Try it on.

5
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,810
- You look cool.
 - Why don't you wear it, too, then?

6
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,970
I don't need stuff like that. I have this.

7
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,140
By the way, Jake, why is Yoo Na being sacrificed tonight?

8
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,540
She's still my finacée's friend.

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,330
I'm trying to make you a king.

10
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,010
- A king?
 - If you have a group of women,

11
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,120
you become their king.

12
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,870
You're such a devil, Jake.

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,930
 Kill me! Kill me, you idiot!

14
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,670

15
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,750

16
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,590
Excuse me, excuse me! Why are you here in the middle of the night?

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,850
You're the devil who harasses children!

18
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,140
I will punish you in the name of justice!

19
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,870
What brings you here?

20
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,470
What brings you all the way here in the middle of the night?

21
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:20,560
Well, it was reported that an illegal secret club was being run here.

22
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,200
This is an orphanage where children live.

23
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,900
It's a blessed place. What do you mean, an illegal secret club?

24
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,260
As you can see, we were putting on a masque performance for the children.

25
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,430
It's called "The Angel's Arrow."

26
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:44,360
Since the volunteers have day jobs, we had to do it late at night.

27
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,950
Isn't life still worth living since we have kind people like them?

28
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,180
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,970
Why don't you all join us?

30
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,450
I can give you these masks since you came.

31
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,100
Attorney Do.

32
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,630
You were wrong about both places?

33
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,160
Let's forget about the orphanage,

34
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,350
but what about the Ace Bar that we even got a warrant for?

35
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,090
What will I tell the prosecutor and the judge who believed me and got us the warrant?

36
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,270
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,940
I didn't think this would happen.

38
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,540
So what if you're sorry?

39
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,500
I'm about to get fired!

40
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,280
Thank goodness, they agreed not to make an issue out of this.

41
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,980
Otherwise, I really...

42
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,860
Chief, I'm certain that there's a suspicious

43
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,380
organization in the Gunggok district.

44
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,520
I will catch them no matter what.

45
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,590
Also, you will receive all the glory from it.

46
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,170
- We'll get going.
 - Thank you!

47
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,150
Bye!

48
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,690
 I got a call from the informant I planted at the Gunggok Police Station.

49
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,970
 They'll apparently raid us on the 18th at night.

50
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,210
 Stay open as usual.

51
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,560
 Remove everything that might look bad.

52
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,130
 Yes.

53
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,690
 Principal, let's put on a masque performance at the orphanage on the night of the 18th.

54
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,410
Yeah.

55
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,040
Everything's okay there, right?

56
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,380
We're in big trouble.

57
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,970
We might be awarded for following the law too well.

58
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,830
Don't let your guard down, and do a good job until the end.

59
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,570

60
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,460
Attorney Do.

61
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,080
Isn't it strange?

62
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,100
Ace Bar. We couldn't even find any expired food, let alone any drug dealing going on.

63
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,630
Could it be that Go Yoo Na lied?

64
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,680
 Ace Bar was the Angel's Club?

65
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,970
 How did you find that out?

66
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,900
 Did you meet with Song Je Hyeok by chance?

67
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,730
 I got the information by selling out my daughter.

68
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,100
 You... really have to catch him.

69
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,940
No way.

70
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,880
She even said she got the information by selling out her daughter.

71
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,170
Song Je Hyeok might be blackmailing her by using her daughter.

72
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,350
She doesn't care about anything other than her daughter.

73
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,300
I'm not sure if this is okay.

74
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,440
Look quickly before anyone sees us.

75
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,270
Na Na.

76
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,440
You remember me, right?

77
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,470
We met with your dad.

78
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,060
Yes!

79
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,100
Do you want me to play with you?

80
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,550
Yes!

81
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay.

82
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,450
All right. Should we go for it?

83
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,320
What's this?

84
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,370
Wow, it's flashing!

85
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,980
Okay.

86
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,380
Ma'am! It's all done. Bring Na Na over.

87
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,800
Ma'am!

88
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,140

89
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,940
Why go to the playground in the evening?

90
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,700
Be careful!

91
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,560
Ta-da!

92
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,960
Let me show you something.

93
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,140
What is it?

94
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,330
Do you know who this is?

95
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,510
It's you!

96
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,110
Then... who do you think this pretty baby is?

97
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,120

98
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,920
 Blood. Here.

99
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,580
 Kang Hoo.

100
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,960
Are you awake now?

101
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,420
It's okay. We're at the hospital.

102
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,050
Do you remember, by chance?

103
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,950
You almost got hit by my car.

104
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,280
The doctor said you're okay except for the bruise on your knee.

105
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,850
Do you want to go home now?

106
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,350
- Yes.
 - Let's call your family first.

107
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,530
I think I can just walk because I live nearby.

108
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,560
Where do you live?

109
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,670
 Do you know who this is?

110
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,750
 It's you!

111
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,340
 Then... who do you think this pretty baby is?

112
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,750
 I don't know.

113
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,910
 Who is it?

114
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,030

115
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,870
 Thank you, Yoo Na.

116
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,280
Thanks to you, I was able to strike a blow at Do Jae Yi.

117
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,990
What are you talking about? Strike a blow at Jae Yi?

118
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,410
 You said you wanted to meet, so you can see Na Na.

119
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,560
But were you ultimately trying to take my club?

120
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,640
 By business, do you mean that club or whatever?

121
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,220
 Just don't frequent the Ace Bar.

122
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,800
 I don't want you to get hurt, either.

123
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,060
You're totally mistaken about something.

124
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,990
Do you think Do Jae Yi would even care about Na Na?

125
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,910
Her only interest is me and taking the club.

126
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,940
You're being used!

127
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,070
I don't care about Do Jae Yi, either!

128
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,940
I only care about taking Na Na back. Because I'm her real mother!

129
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,910
I think it will be tricky to take Na Na back.

130
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,510
 She already has a very good mother.

131
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,770
What?

132
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,900
Don't try to see Na Na again.

133
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,880
You and I are over now.

134
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,340
Song Je Hyeok. Song Je Hyeok!

135
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,320
Yeon Ah, wait for me inside.

136
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,280
Take care!

137
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,810
Thank you for taking care of our child.

138
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,090
What brings you all the way here?

139
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,440
I wanted to look into someone.

140
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,490
It's someone who volunteered here 10 years ago.

141
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,560
His name is Gi Do Shik.

142
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,110
Do you remember him?

143
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:09,290
By Gi Do Shik, do you mean Gi Yoon Chul's late son?

144
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,840
Well, I started working here just a year ago.

145
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,500
I've never met him in person.

146
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,840
Makes sense.

147
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,210
I suppose it was a wasted trip.

148
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,270
Why did you want to look into Gi Do Shik?

149
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,310
A friend of mine is interested in politics.

150
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,780
He said he would like to become friendly with Assemblyman Gi.

151
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:42,300
He thought learning stories about his son Gi Do Shik might help to win Assemblyman Gi over.

152
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,300
So he asked me to find out for him.

153
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,910
I'll ask my employees, too.

154
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,060
You must be busy. Thank you for your time.

155
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,360
I'll get going then.

156
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,700
 This is my number.

157
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,320
 As I told you earlier,

158
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,370
 make sure to contact me if something happens, okay?

159
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,070
What an annoying bastard.

160
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,240
 Do you know who this is?

161
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,530
 It's you!

162
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,050
 Then... who do you think this pretty baby is?

163
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,470
Mom!

164
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,010
I took a bath!

165
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,770
Yes. Well done, my girl.

166
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,540
Ma'am.

167
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,600
I'll go home now, then.

168
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,130
Talk to me for a moment before you go.

169
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,760
Why did you drink so much last night?

170
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,570
You were totally drunk when you came home. Seriously!

171
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,990
 I saw your husband at the hotel.

172
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,050
 He was going up to a room.

173
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:22,160
 It was even the most luxurious presidential floor.

174
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,100
 Your husband was a host before you got married, right?

175
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,390
 Maybe the mutt hasn't gotten over his old habit.

176
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,630
You said you're taking cooking classes, right?

177
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,550
But your cooking is not improving.

178
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,880
It's the same as usual.

179
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,980
It's because you always want kimchi beansprout soup for a hangover.

180
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,810
I'll make a traditional meal for the king next time.

181
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,800
For now, here.

182
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,770
Leo.

183
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,020
- Are you anxious, by chance?
 - What?

184
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,780
Anxious? About what?

185
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,420
My position at work weakened since the hanok hotel is no longer happening.

186
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,510
Are you anxious that I won't be able to support you?

187
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,640
Don't be like that, Noona!

188
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,250
You're making it sound like I love you for money.

189
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,030
You know that I love you because you're pretty.

190
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,390
Pretty? There are pretty girls everywhere.

191
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,360
What are you talking about?

192
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,320
Ever since I was born, I've never seen anyone prettier than you.

193
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,410
Noona, do you know why I text you whenever I get a chance?

194
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,290
I worry someone else might steal you away because you're so pretty.

195
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,010
Cha Leo.

196
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,780
I can make a living and feed you, no matter what!

197
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,410
So you should just trust me, understood?

198
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,880
Don't do anything silly.

199
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,390
Yes, ma'am! Got it!

200
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,910
Can I have some water?

201
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,380
Yes!

202
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,640
Water!

203
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,110
 Mr. Jung, let's meet up.

204
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,370
Here you go.

205
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,140
Thank you.

206
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,780
You know you have to wash thoroughly, right?

207
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,970
So pretty!

208
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,200
Where's the nanny? Is she off today?

209
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,790
She won't come anymore. I dismissed her.

210
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,390
Why?

211
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,450
Since you're in charge of the foundation

212
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,950
and the arts and culture village is no longer happening,

213
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,050
the only thing I have is this family now.

214
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,540
I'll do everything from now on,

215
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,130
with my own hands. Without any mistakes.

216
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,010
Don't overdo it, okay?

217
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,810
Your ex-wife...

218
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,000
Do you know where she is, by chance?

219
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,950
I said she was in prison in the US.

220
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,730
She might have gotten out of prison.

221
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,590
She might've come to Korea, too.

222
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,590
Why are you curious about that?

223
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,710
You're running for mayor.

224
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,170
Your personal life will get revealed, too.

225
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:28,980
It would be a problem if she suddenly showed up and said weird things.

226
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,380
I don't think that will happen.

227
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,950
How are you so certain?

228
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,810
Do you know what she's up to, by chance?

229
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,340
No, not at all.

230
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,870
I have no idea!

231
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,860
 Nice to meet you.

232
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,670
 I didn't know Yu Jeong had a friend like you.

233
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,890
 I'm disappointed that you didn't know me.

234
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,440
 We used to be pretty close.

235
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,890
 I guess you still don't know each other very well.

236
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,360
If so... can I...

237
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,100
not worry about her?

238
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,450
Yes. You shouldn't worry about her, Honey.

239
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,590
My husband is so cool.

240
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,130
Do you want to go somewhere with your cool husband?

241
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,910

242
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,090
Vice Chairman.

243
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,110
You must be busy. Thank you so much for accepting my invitation.

244
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,920
I thought it was a quiet event.

245
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,010
But it's quite noisy.

246
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:18,620
Wouldn't it be meaningful to let the world know whose side you're on, using this chance?

247
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,820
Whose side am I supposed to be on?

248
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,510
They're coming just in time.

249
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,760
They definitely need you on their side, Vice Chairman Kang.

250
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,720
Why did you bring me to an event like this?

251
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,200
Do you feel uncomfortable with anyone here?

252
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,100
No, it's not that.

253
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,620
I'm kind of shy. That's why.

254
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,590
Then let's say hello.

255
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,560
They're very generous people who support me.

256
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,350
Welcome, Candidate Song Je Hyeok.

257
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,090
Congratulations on the new foundation.

258
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,820
Hello, Assemblyman.

259
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,870
Aigoo, Director Ju Yu Jeong.

260
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,430
Thank you for coming.

261
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,520
You must have a nice married life.

262
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,970
Your face completely lit up!

263
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,540
Hello, sir.

264
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,710
You should've come to the hotel. Why a restaurant?

265
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,780
I wanted to have brunch with you.

266
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,060
Shouldn't friends have brunch together?

267
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,190
I heard things didn't go well at Ace Bar.

268
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,370
Did Song Je Hyeok tell you that he gave me a good punch?

269
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,010
I didn't think he would fool me, too.

270
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,800
I'm still the mother of his child.

271
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,100
Can't we set the secret club aside and take care of Song Je Hyeok first?

272
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,650
I'm desperate to take Na Na back.

273
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,840
I wish I could kill Song Je Hyeok right now, too.

274
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,650
But there's no evidence of the sexual assault.

275
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,860
Even the statute of limitations expired.

276
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,550
I think the secret club is the only way to get him.

277
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,790
I need to go somewhere after the meal.

278
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,730
Do you want to come with me?

279
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,980

280
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,790
Since all the important people are here, I'll start the press conference now.

281
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:28,970
You have to put this all over the front page, okay?

282
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,840
Assemblyman, please tell us why you started a foundation under your son's name.

283
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,960
Well, 10 years ago,

284
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,660
my son was tragically killed.

285
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,170
He was very smart and had a strong sense of justice.

286
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,720
I don't know why such a horrible thing happened to someone like him...

287
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:02,390
They say when your child dies, you bury them in your heart.

288
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,740
But I wanted the world to see his name instead.

289
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:14,770
That's why I started a scholarship foundation under his name.

290
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,270
Did you choose to have the press conference at this orphanage

291
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:23,990
to show support to Candidate Song Je Hyeok, who's running for mayor of Tongju?

292
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,280
I guess that's part of the reason.

293
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,670
Since Mr. Song is new to politics,

294
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,770
he needs a lot of help from me, too.

295
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,130
May I... say something?

296
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,340
Why don't you talk later instead?

297
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,710
A word, please, Mr. Song!

298
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,060
- Please, Mr. Song!
 - Please!

299
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,040
The reason I allowed him to use the orphanage for the press conference is

300
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,490
for the children and nothing else.

301
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,280
The more attention we get from the public figures of Tongju,

302
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:16,220
the more donation we'd get, and it'd allow our children to grow more prosperous.

303
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:23,990
So, what I need right now is for the people of Tongju to support my dream.

304
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,590
Everyone, please support my dream,

305
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,020
not Song Je Hyeok.

306
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,300
Thank you.

307
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:49,790
Let me ask Ms. Ju, Mr. Song's wife, this time.

308
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:55,200
Ms. Do Jae Yi announced her candidacy at this very place recently.

309
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,660
You said you supported her then.

310
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,800
But... you support someone else now.

311
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,900
In all honesty, would you still support Mr. Song

312
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,460
even if he wasn't your husband?

313
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,660
Answer him.

314
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,670
I'm curious what you think, too.

315
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:35,430
I sincerely cheer for Ms. Do as her longtime friend.

316
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:40,270
But... as you just heard,

317
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:46,570
Mr. Song gets happiness from making other people happy

318
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,790
rather than satisfying his desires.

319
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:55,460
For that reason, I still would've supported Mr. Song

320
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:02,390
for the people of Tongju, even if he were not my husband.

321
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,430
I'm so lucky to have a wife like her.

322
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,790
Why did you bring me here?

323
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,590
Because this is the Angel's Club.

324
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,230
This is the Angel's Club?

325
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,150
- You said you failed.
 - Just wait and see.

326
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:28,610
I'll prove that this is the Angel's Club.

327
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,110
It's Do Jae Yi!

328
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Ms. Do, what brings you here?

329
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,360
Assemblyman Gi generously came to my candidacy announcement event.

330
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,080
So I shouldn't miss out on your event, Assemblyman Gi.

331
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,530
Ms. Do is certainly a very polite person.

332
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,280
Hello, Mr. Song.

333
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,020
I'm not bothering you by coming here, right?

334
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,710
Not at all. Welcome, Ms. Do.

335
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,550
Don't worry about me, and carry on.

336
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,180
I'll look around this orphanage in the meantime.

337
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,630
I'd like to know why both Assemblyman Gi and Mr. Song

338
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:36,380
are so attached to this place.

339
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,480
Will you just let her?

340
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,930
Shouldn't we follow her, at least?

341
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,870
Are you giving me an order right now?

342
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,490
I can't follow her.

343
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,520
 Ms. Do, please let us take your picture!

344
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,390
 Ms. Do, look over here!

345
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,890
 Look over here!

346
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,310

347
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,360
Hurry up!

348
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,360
Give me everything you got.

349
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,320
I don't want to. Why should I give you what I got?

350
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,830
You got a lot because you're still young.

351
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,740
They won't give it to me because I'm grown up now.

352
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,060
Hey, Ye Ji gets way more than her.

353
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,850
The Angels give her more because she's sick.

354
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,270
You must be happy that your leg hurts.

355
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,420
The Angels will give me more of it if I'm sick, too.

356
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,970
- Give me some! Come on.
 - Ye Ji!

357
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,670
I'm sorry, guys. I must've scared you.

358
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,910
What do you want her to give you?

359
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,400
And who are the Angels?

360
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,700
Well.

361
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,700
Wait.

362
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,300
- Hold on!
 - Run!

363
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,870
Ye Ji!

364
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,750
Hold on.

365
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,890
Wait a second.

366
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,420
It's okay.

367
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,890
I'm a friend of the chairman here. You can tell me.

368
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:33,420
Who are the Angels, and what did they give you so much of?

369
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,910
The thing is...

370
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,100
- Yeah.
 - Jae Yi.

371
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,870
Why did you call me?

372
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,290
What if someone saw us?

373
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,660
I thought I should at least say hello.

374
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,760
Not because you were worried?

375
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:13,050
You're afraid that I'll tell everyone that my father is Vice Chairman Kang Il Gu of Kangbo Group?

376
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:18,880
All right, then. Saying hello was enough.

377
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,300
How could you be on Song Je Hyeok's side?

378
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,400
You don't even know what kind of man he is.

379
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,150
You're working hard.

380
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:03,600
You even have to greet your ex-fiancé's father to make your husband the mayor.

381
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,990
You have it tough, too.

382
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,630
You can't even see your own daughter confidently

383
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,340
Do you... even know anything and are acting up?

384
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,710
No, I don't know anything.

385
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,630
All I know is that the past is just the past.

386
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:40,300
So, I won't be destroying my precious family because of that worthless past.

387
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,020
No matter what happens.

388
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,770
Looks like you might know something since you're reacting so strongly.

389
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,570
But did you know this?

390
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,280
That your husband didn't approach you innocently.

391
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,360
- What?
 - Gi Do Shik was like that, too.

392
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,970
He wanted what you had more than you wanted it.

393
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,910
Let me give you a piece of advice.

394
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:08,300
You should just protect what you have and abandon the man.

395
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,400
He's just a guy.

396
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,250
What I want to protect is not just some guy.

397
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,520
It's my perfect family with my husband and my child.

398
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,580
I will protect them, no matter what it takes.

399
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:32,450
My husband and my child, too.

400
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,840
Jae Yi? I'll leave now.

401
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,970
I have a plan.

402
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:07,170
Aigoo! It's been a while, Ms. Go Yoo Na.

403
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,440
I don't think we're that happy to see each other.

404
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,580
Looks like you misunderstood something.

405
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,370
I don't have Song Je Hyeok's back.

406
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,330
He's someone I use like a dog.

407
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,750
But is it because I didn't put a leash on him?

408
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,010
Looks like he's acting up a bit.

409
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,340
Now that we're on the topic,

410
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:40,640
could you find me a leash to put on him?

411
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:51,880

412
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,990
What's up? I can't believe you called me.

413
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,030
I thought you removed my name from the family registry.

414
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,950
I have a favor to ask.

415
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,710
A favor? Do we ask each other a favor now?

416
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:13,560
We're brothers who share blood, but we're worse than strangers.

417
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,890
Okay, let's just hear what you want to ask me.

418
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:25,230
February 18th, 2013. At Grand Kangbo Hotel,

419
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,430
Gi Do Shik, Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul's son, got murdered.

420
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,650
I want to look into that case, but a lot of the articles were removed.

421
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,070
There's no way to look into it at all.

422
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,810
So, you want me to find the case records for you?

423
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,750
Why would you want that?

424
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,860
Just get them for me, Hyung.

425
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,920
You don't even care what I do.

426
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,210
Arrogant bastard.

427
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,970
If I do, what would you do for me?

428
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,650
I'll give up on the inheritance.

429
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,010
I know that's what you want to hear.

430
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,750

431
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,840
 You mean that Ye Ji.

432
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,110
I know her well!

433
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:46,330
She's the only one with a weak leg at Chunsarang Orphanage.

434
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,810
If she comes here to buy something,

435
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,750
could you give this to her and say it's a free gift?

436
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,150
Oh, Ye Ji is a child I support.

437
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:05,800
I would feel bad for other kids to only give it to her.

438
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:11,120
I know. It would be difficult to care for all of them.

439
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,730
I'll only give it to her secretly.

440
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,190
I'll pretend like it's a free gift.

441
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,240
Thank you.

442
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,260
You ate blood sausage soup every day as a child.

443
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,770
Aren't you sick of it?

444
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:35,210
No, I think it's so delicious!

445
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,760
That's why they say blood is thicker than water.

446
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,100
Your dad loves blood sausage soup, too.

447
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,750
- You scared me.
 - Does that man still come here?

448
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,570
I told you not to let him!

449
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,290
Why don't you listen to me, Grandma?

450
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,260
What do you mean, "that man"?

451
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,380
You can't be like that. He's still your dad.

452
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,960
Grandma, I saw him today.

453
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,590
But do you know where I saw him?

454
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,600
At my rival candidate's event.

455
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:12,540
He was standing by the one I wanted to kill, not me.

456
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,550
What's this?

457
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,710
Your campaign fund.

458
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,740
Your dad, Kang Il Gu, sent it.

459
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,590
He is funding my campaign?

460
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,610
I don't know the situation,

461
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:57,210
but if your dad was standing by someone you want to kill,

462
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,570
he must've had a reason.

463
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,470
- Hello!
 - Hello, Ma'am.

464
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,500
Say goodbye, Na Na.

465
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,140
Goodbye.

466
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,350
See you tomorrow, Na Na!

467
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:30,390
Take care, Ma'am. Thank you!

468
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,690
Did you have fun at the kindergarten today, too?

469
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,020
- Yes.
 - Huh?

470
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,630
You don't look so happy, though.

471
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,160
Did something happen at the kindergarten?

472
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,220
It's not that. I'm jealous of Hyun Ji.

473
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,290
Why are you jealous of her?

474
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:55,600
Her mom plays with her at the playground every day.

475
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,370
They ride swings and they play tag, too.

476
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,390
I see.

477
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,840
Na Na!

478
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,480
Where are you, Na Na?

479
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,420
Mom, catch me!

480
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:23,350
I'm coming for you! I'm coming for you!

481
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,540
 Wow, Na Na, that's so fast!

482
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,680
- Hurry up, Mom!
 - Yeah.

483
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:55,970
- Hurry up!
 - Yes, Na Na! Coming!

484
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,500
- You want me to push you?
 - Faster, Mom!

485
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,090
- Faster?
 - Higher!

486
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,150
Higher?

487
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:12,630

488
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,700
Geez, something I ate earlier doesn't agree with me.

489
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,560
I don't feel so well.

490
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,320
Is there a soda? A soda?

491
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,960
A soda. Is there a soda?

492
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,290
You shouldn't be looking for a soda.

493
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,560
You should stop eating sweet potatoes.

494
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,530
Sweet potatoes? I didn't eat sweet potatoes.

495
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,740
You feel stuffy because you feel guilty about something toward me!

496
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,380
Tell me. You're making Leo work here, aren't you?

497
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,200
Geez! Yes, yes!

498
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,960
Leo is back to his job.

499
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,330
But didn't you start taking drugs again yourself?

500
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:08,370
Well, each one of the couple has a secret. Just call it even.

501
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,930
I won't take drugs ever again,

502
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,380
so don't let Leo work again.

503
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:19,790
If you contact him again and make him work here, I won't forgive you.

504
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:28,580
Do you think I'm still a pimp who manages my hosts?

505
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,310
What's so great about being the vice president of a hotel?

506
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,990
Why do I have to bow down to you?

507
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,340
I'm not talking to you as the VP of that piddly Mariela Hotel.

508
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,050
I'm talking to you as the daughter of Gil Man Ok, the owner of Daesungak.

509
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,690
What brings you here?

510
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,770
If you just came for a drink─

511
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,390
I don't need a drink.

512
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:04,570
I'm just here to see you, Noonim.

513
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:09,270
Noonim?

514
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:14,190
You must have a favor to ask me, since you're playing your old trick.

515
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,990
What is it?

516
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:21,060
I'm actually here because of Assemblyman Gi.

517
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,300
Assemblyman Gi? Why?

518
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,490
I thought you and he were in the same boat.

519
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,630
Of course, we already are,

520
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,180
but he still thinks he's the captain.

521
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,890
If he decided to support me, he should make me the captain instead.

522
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:43,960
So you want me to support you?

523
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:50,890
But no matter who the captain is, you both share the same destination.

524
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,930
Becoming the mayor of Tongju.

525
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,600
If so, you should be sinking the enemy.

526
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,250
You can't fight each other in the same boat.

527
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:07,680
By the enemy, do you mean Do Jae Yi?

528
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:14,330
A way to sink Do Jae Yi.

529
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,940
Do you know how to?

530
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:26,230
If you become the mayor of Tongju, build Hae Mi a hotel in Tongju.

531
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,210
So, it will shine the most in the very center!

532
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,590
Your love for your daughter is as strong as ever.

533
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,760
I promise you.

534
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,050
Give me... the card to beat Do Jae Yi.

535
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,870
I'm not sure.

536
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:56,190
I still don't have the assurance that you'll become the Tongju mayor yet.

537
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,890
It could be Jae Yi.

538
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,100
You might be on Do Jae Yi's side instead?

539
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,130
Na Na!

540
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,240
Na Na!

541
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,050
Why did you come?

542
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,410
I told you not to come anymore.

543
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,650
I told her to come.

544
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,770
Why did you do that?

545
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,020
I told you that I fired her.

546
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,250
I didn't think you'd do well without her.

547
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:31,110
You're suffering so much after playing with Na Na for one day.

548
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,710
Do you know what she did?

549
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,340
She handed Na Na over to some woman behind my back.

550
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,460
How could I let her take care of Na Na?

551
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,190
What if something bad happens?

552
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,130
Some woman?

553
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,070
Yes, some woman.

554
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,660
My goodness.

555
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,020
If she really handed Na Na over to a stranger, that would be a serious problem.

556
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:02,640
But do you know what would be worse than that?

557
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,180
Me losing to Do Jae Yi because of you.

558
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,440
What do you mean, lose to Jae Yi because of me?

559
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,310
Do you know why the Yeongun Foundation is struggling?

560
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:17,640
It's because Jae Yi excluded you from the arts and culture village project.

561
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:23,350
But you have no rage in your eyes when you look at her.

562
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,380
Are you a fool?

563
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,660
What am I supposed to do, then?

564
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,460
Am I supposed to fight with Jae Yi or so?

565
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,560
If you can't, you should beg her instead.

566
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,840
- Beg?
 - What?

567
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,100
You don't want to?

568
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,740
Are you afraid it would damage your precious ego?

569
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:51,980
By chance, your ego can't be more important than our family, right?

570
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,510
Remember.

571
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:03,850
The best way to protect our family is for me to become the mayor.

572
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:09,390
But if that doesn't happen, you never know.

573
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:14,250
That woman might actually take Na Na away.

574
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,640
I'm sorry. It's my fault that you two...

575
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,880
I'll never, ever respond to her again! Never.

576
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,570
You don't have to worry about her anymore.

577
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:45,140
Instead, please keep an eye on my wife.

578
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,530
Watch what she does and what she's thinking.

579
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:53,570
And even whom she meets with. Watch closely.

580
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,590
 Remember.

581
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:06,000
 The best way to protect our family is for me to become the mayor.

582
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,020
 But if that doesn't happen, you never know.

583
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,790
 That woman might actually take Na Na away.

584
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:29,160

585
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,330
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to voicemail.

586
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,600

587
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,600
 Things are over between us now.

588
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:33,000

589
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:41,190

590
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:46,750
You must've been surprised.

591
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:52,360
Not at all. I told you to call me if anything happens.

592
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,000
What is it? Is something going on?

593
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:03,550
Jae Yi, are you upset with me by chance?

594
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:13,830
Or is there another reason why you chose Yoo Na over me?

595
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,880
Yu Jeong, I never abandoned you.

596
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,120
The situation just turned out that way.

597
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,560
What exactly is the situation?

598
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,720
Do you really want to know?

599
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,320
Everything I know about?

600
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,460
No, don't tell me.

601
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,790
Okay, then.

602
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,780
I won't tell you.

603
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:51,740
Instead, promise me just one thing.

604
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:57,920
That you won't do anything that would destroy our family,

605
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,490
Je Hyeok, me, and Na Na.

606
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,400
That...

607
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,370
I can't promise that.

608
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,070
Why not?

609
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,070
Leave.

610
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:24,800
If I spend more time with you, I don't know what I'd say.

611
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,780
Just leave.

612
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,650
What are you doing right now?

613
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,620
Get up! Get up!

614
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,040
I'm in so much pain.

615
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,690
I can't move.

616
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,720
Why?

617
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,660
I ran at the playground with Na Na earlier today.

618
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,520
Why did you run?

619
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,090
Your leg is injured.

620
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:53,010
Get up right now. Get up.

621
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:05,220
Because that's how precious... Na Na and my family are.

622
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,180
Jae Yi.

623
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,830
I beg you.

624
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:16,050
Please be on my side. Please!

625
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:24,770
Yu Jeong, I was never not on your side.

626
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:48,720
 Could you find me a leash to put on him?

627
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,850
 Song Je Hyeok's bloody mask that you gave to Do Jae Yi.

628
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,430
 Bring it to me.

629
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,500
 What if I did?

630
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,720
 Since you got out on parole,

631
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,210
 you're wanted for running away overseas, as I understand.

632
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,760
 I'll give you freedom.

633
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,930
 So you can take your daughter back freely.

634
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,150
Assemblyman Gi?

635
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,100
I'll get you the leash for Song Je Hyeok.

636
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:42,150
I'll trust you and leave, then.

637
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:49,510
I'm sure we'll see each other with a smile someday.

638
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,360

639
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,420
I'm sorry, Yu Jeong.

640
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:26,900
But... I can't forgive your husband.

641
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,400

642
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,100
Okay.

643
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:07,170

644
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,950
Hey.

645
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,110
I got Gi Do Shik's case file for you.

646
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:28,310
 Keep your promise about giving up on the inheritance.

647
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,060
Okay.

648
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:41,610
 What are you up to? Should we meet later?

649
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,460
Who is it? Kang Hoo?

650
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:57,660
They say you can't hide a financial struggle, a cough, and love.

651
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,700
It's obvious.

652
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,750
By the way, why did you want to see me here?

653
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,790
You said friends are supposed to have brunch together.

654
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:13,450
Aren't we friends?

655
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:17,230
Yes, let's eat.

656
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,130
The mask I gave you.

657
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:28,890
Where are you keeping it?

658
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:32,260
Why do you want to know that?

659
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:35,890
I gave you that mask.

660
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:38,510
I have the right to know that much.

661
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,910
It's in the whiskey storage at Kang Hoo's restaurant,

662
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:52,060
because my house or the office would be dangerous.

663
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,830
Yes,

664
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:59,200
that sounds pretty safe.

665
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,350
Go Yoo Na.

666
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:10,300
I think I can find out the truth about the orphanage soon.

667
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,670
If so, Song Je Hyeok would be over, too.

668
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,510
Could you wait a little longer?

669
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,730
Okay, I'll wait.

670
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,970
Because you're the only friend I trust.

671
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,470
Shouldn't you be open for lunch?

672
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,120
It's okay.

673
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,030
It would be warmer if you hugged me.

674
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,570
I missed you.

675
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,430
Hold on.

676
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:07,800
 I'll go to the restaurant in the evening.

677
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,790
 I can see you, right?

678
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:16,590
 I agreed to meet you, too. Don't say no.

679
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:20,050
What? Who is it?

680
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,620
It's nothing.

681
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,270
You made it.

682
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,660
I came hungry. All I get is coffee?

683
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:06,360
We ran out of ingredients. What should we do?

684
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:09,900
It's okay.

685
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,200
Could you pick up medicine for me instead?

686
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,600
I've had a headache all day.

687
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,380
The pharmacies must be closed because it's late.

688
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,380
Okay, just wait a moment.

689
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,030

690
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,210
 Why do you need the mask?

691
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:27,790
You definitely gave the brooch to Ye Ji, right?

692
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:30,450
Yes, she came to buy crayons today.

693
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:33,530
She happily took it when I gave it to her.

694
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:35,990
Thank you, Ma'am.

695
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,600
Move anywhere.

696
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,340
I'll run to you immediately.

697
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,190
 I'll tell you why I need the mask.

698
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,390
 Come to my hotel room.

699
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:05,390

700
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,630
Were you drinking?

701
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:16,070
I feel like I'm dying.

702
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,070
Please take me to the hotel room.

703
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,440
Hold on a moment.

704
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,790
I'll clean up a bit.

705
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,540

706
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:53,770
Hold on, Kang Hoo.

707
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,660
I want to sit here for a second.

708
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:22,430

709
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,010
Why don't you go upstairs and rest there?

710
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,140
I can go up now.

711
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:53,910

712
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,620
Dad.

713
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,520
Dad...

714
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,210

715
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:47,630
♫  The dark desire hiding behind a mask  ♫

716
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:50,160
♫  They're liars  ♫

717
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:55,500
♫  The truth is completely hidden behind a curtain  ♫

718
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,950
♫  My glamorous image is a scenario covering your eyes  ♫

719
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:02,150
 ~ Preview ~ 
Do Jae Yi.

720
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:09,100
 Go Yoo Na. Ju Yu Jeong, and... you're the only one who's left, Hae Mi.

721
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,100
 Apparently, there's a phrase they use in gambling.

722
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:16,840
 The one who wonders who the pushover in the game is, is actually the pushover.

723
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,780
 - What are you talking about?
 - You're that pushover!

724
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:21,950
 Noona, what's wrong?

725
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,200
 - Please leave!
 - Noona!

726
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,440
 Song Je Hyeok, that bastard is playing all four of us.

727
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:33,490
 There's only one way for us to survive.

728
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:39,440
 Finding his weakness.
