1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,990
You erased all of our traces, right?

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,040
It doesn't matter, even if there are.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,840
This is my room, anyway.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,960
That crazy bastard. He can't be immune to the drug, right?

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,120
You definitely took care of the CCTV, right?

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,350
It'll be off until tomorrow morning.

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,950
But it would be better to leave quickly.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,960

9
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:05,380

10
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,590
We've been at the party until now, and we're going home now.

11
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,330
Okay.

12
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,500
I'll expose the Angel's Club while he's asleep.

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,120
I should go to Na Na.

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,700
I'll finally be her mom proudly.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,160
I'll remove him from the foundation and the candidacy.

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,770
So he becomes an empty shell again.

17
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,840
I should get Leo out of jail.

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Hang in there just for one more night, Leo!

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,160
Yes. Let's each do our tasks and regroup here tomorrow night.

20
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,720
You should come to my house. You can't be at the hotel.

21
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,280
By the way, I'm curious about something.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,950
Who turned off the CCTV at the hotel?

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,360
That was the most important role.

24
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,580
I feel grateful for it.

25
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,820
We just got lucky.

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,860
Okay.

27
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,300
Are we going our separate ways now?

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,670
- Well─
 - Well─

29
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,170
You guys did so much. Thank you.

30
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,660
It was possible because of you guys.

31
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:57,000

32
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,880
I went inside to clean the room,

33
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,570
and there was that thing covered with a bedsheet!

34
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,880
I called the police because I instinctively thought it was a body.

35
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,940
I didn't think it would actually be a body!

36
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,470
It was so scary!

37
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,340
 Song Je Hyeok... is dead.

38
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,860
Dead?

39
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,920
How?

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,710
Why?

41
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,510
I don't know the details.

42
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,170
How could he suddenly...

43
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,640
Are you okay?

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,050
I'll go get some water.

45
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:03,900
By chance... after we left the hotel,

46
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,080
did anyone go back inside?

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,570
Oh, my God!

48
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,980

49
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,160

50
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,310

51
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,160
Answer me.

52
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,390
Did anyone go back into the hotel?

53
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,570
I gave all of you the key to my room.

54
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,890
Should I ask you one more time, then?

55
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,780
I actually went back to the hotel last night.

56
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,570
But someone took a picture of it.

57
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:33,070
By chance... did you all get the same thing as me just now?

58
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,770
I'm asking you! Did you get the same thing?

59
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,820
Why don't you tell us first?

60
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,670
Why did you go back to the hotel?

61
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,710
I followed Jae Yi.

62
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,130
You left at dawn after getting a text.

63
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,360

64
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,730
Why did you go back to the hotel?

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,110
What did you receive yesterday?

66
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,110
By chance,

67
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,140
does it have to do with the one who turned the CCTV off?

68
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,770
Who in the world was it, and why are you protecting him?

69
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,620
I can't help it if you refuse to tell us.

70
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,750
How about you, Hae Mi? Did you go back to the hotel or not?

71
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,890
 Look at yourself.

72
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,490
 How dare you mess with the Daesungak owner's daughter?

73
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,040

74
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,080
 Speak of the devil!

75
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,300
 - I was just thinking about you─
 - Hae Mi!

76
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,660
 What am I supposed to do?

77
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,430
 Mom, what's wrong? What's going on?

78
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,340
 I just saw Song Je Hyeok at the hotel.

79
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,020
 But he's not waking up.

80
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,280
 What? Song Je Hyeok?

81
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,220
 I just came here to talk.

82
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,280
 But he suddenly did this to my face─

83
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,070
 How did you know he was there?

84
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,550
 I didn't do anything.

85
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,880
 But Song Je Hyeok─

86
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,390
 Calm down. Just calm down first.

87
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,340
 What should I do?

88
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,420
 I heard you! Just calm down!

89
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,070
 Hang up for now.

90
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,720
 Let me think about what to do.

91
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,200
 Did you definitely take care of the CCTV?

92
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,970
 It'll be off until tomorrow morning.

93
00:08:52,990 --> 00:09:00,160

94
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,610
Go Yoo Na, you're funny.

95
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,630
What are you? A cop or a prosecutor?

96
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,900
Why are you interrogating us?

97
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,660
Because this could end up just like 10 years ago!

98
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,640
 How could this happen? How?

99
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,970
 But we're still friends.

100
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,860
 You know I didn't do it! You guys know that!

101
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,360
 It's not me!

102
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,100
You lied and said you didn't go to Gi Do Shik's room 10 years ago, too!

103
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,690
And I ended up becoming the culprit!

104
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,650
That was...

105
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,930
Hey, we all said we would kill him. Remember?

106
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,080
It doesn't matter who did it as long as he's dead!

107
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,470
Actually killing someone and being framed for it are not the same!

108
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,020
You should tell me, too.

109
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,280
Did you go back to the hotel last night or not?

110
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,280

111
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,820

112
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,000
 Sir, this is Ju Yu Jeong.

113
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Excuse me for calling you so late.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,850
 I received the certified demand from Mariela Hotel.

115
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,640
 It says they would sue unless we repay the 10 billion won (~$7.4 million) they paid for the investment within a month.

116
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,080
 How much of that money do we have left?

117
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,360
 What do you mean left? Chairman Song took out all of that money.

118
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,780
 - To where?
 - How am I supposed to know that?

119
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,490
 He took out all of it in cash.

120
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,600
 There's no cash left for the Yeongun Foundation. None at all.

121
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,560
Sir, Sir!

122
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,310
 Yu Jeong. The Yeongun Foundation is about to go bankrupt.

123
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,710
 You can save it using my slush fund.

124
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,700
 Slush fund.

125
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,880
 What could be in here, anyway?

126
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,190
 Does Je Hyeok have the key?

127
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,760
 Did you definitely take care of the CCTV?

128
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,460
 It'll be off until tomorrow morning.

129
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,760

130
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,160
I was there.

131
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,790
I was there, but...

132
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,680
I didn't do anything! I'm being honest!

133
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,980
- Are you guys serious? 
- Yoo Na.

134
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,180
Calm down. Nothing happened to us yet.

135
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,740
The problem is that someone knows that we went to the hotel last night.

136
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,380
But I think I know who that is.

137
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,220
Pardon?

138
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,660
I understand.

139
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,430
What? What's going on?

140
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,070
Song Je Hyeok apparently died this morning.

141
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,630
What?

142
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,550
Really?

143
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Wow!

144
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,160
Who should I share this good news with first?

145
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,980
Aigoo! You called me just in time!

146
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,560
You heard that Song Je Hyeok croaked, right?

147
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,760
 I was just about to call you because of that!

148
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,570
Why?

149
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,000
Because of the photo?

150
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,470
 Photo?

151
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,220
 What photo?

152
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,840
 You could've just messed with me.

153
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,760
Why did you do that to my friends, too?

154
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,610
If I did that, there has to be a reason for it.

155
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:31,270
You promised to remove my name from the Angel's Club's members list.

156
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,790
 I need insurance to make sure you keep that promise.

157
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,780
Do as you wish.

158
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,610
 You can't threaten me with some photo like that.

159
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,740
Did Assemblyman Gi do it? Why?

160
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,050
Did he threaten to call the police?

161
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:05,140
It's for insurance. Just in case, should I reveal his connection with the Angel's Club.

162
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,890
That's right.

163
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,840
He wouldn't have sent them to us if he were going to report.

164
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,090
The police would've...

165
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,020

166
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,620
You're Song Je Hyeok's wife. Answer it.

167
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,990
Yes, this is Ju Yu Jeong.

168
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,990
Act surprised! Act shocked!

169
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,910
Je Hyeok is?

170
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,510
Okay, I'll head to the hospital right away.

171
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,690
They want me to come and identify the body.

172
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,760
What should I do now?

173
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,270
They always make the family identify the body.

174
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,810
Also, they might ask you where you were that night.

175
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,760
If so,

176
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,860
tell them you were at the party here, okay?

177
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,190
I can't believe he died in my room.

178
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,860
The police will be looking for me soon, too.

179
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,160
What are you worried about?

180
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,720
We all have an alibi. It's on the CCTV here.

181
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,260
Who could it be?

182
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,840
Who threatened Do Jae Yi?

183
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,920
Also, what did they capture?

184
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,740
Hey, Mr. Choi.

185
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,290
Yes.

186
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,030
Do you know something

187
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,560
about the photos Do Jae Yi and her friends received?

188
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,120
I'm not sure.

189
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,460
I guess you wouldn't know.

190
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,670
Hold on a second.

191
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,960
Should I actually go with it since I'm already in this situation?

192
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,430
Hey, Reporter Han Sang Gook?

193
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,580
This is Gi Yoon Chul.

194
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,730
There's a scoop I'd like to give you.

195
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,010
It didn't?

196
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,720
H-How does that make sense?

197
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,010
What do you mean it didn't record?

198
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,270
Can't you check one more time? That was the only thing we had.

199
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,820
The only thing we had!

200
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,750
I checked multiple times. It didn't work.

201
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,490
I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

202
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,420
Mistake?

203
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,400
Mistake?

204
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,710
Without that, we might...

205
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,180
We might become murderers!

206
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,860
You know Song Je Hyeok is dead!

207
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,070
Kang Hoo, as I remember...

208
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:49,910
 I think it did record us entering and being inside.

209
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,440
We have that, at least, right?

210
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,640
Yes, there's evidence that we came in!

211
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,810
It didn't record that, either.

212
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,890
To be clear, the whole party wasn't recorded.

213
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,460
Kang Hoo!

214
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,170
We're from the violent crime division of Gunggok Police Station.

215
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,350
What's this about?

216
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,650
Go Yoo Na, you're under arrest for the murder of Song Je Hyeok.

217
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,650
You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.

218
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,230
I told you

219
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,060
that it's going to be exactly like 10 years ago!

220
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,800
No. There's no way.

221
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,550
I'll accompany her as her lawyer.

222
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,130
- Yu Jeong, you should go to the hospital.
 - Okay.

223
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,850
Hae Mi, you should go with her.

224
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,370
Jae Yi.

225
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,600
Later. Let's talk later.

226
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,660
 Hey, you asshole!

227
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,380
 So, you'll send the photo of Hae Mi doing drugs to the press?

228
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,480
 Getting fired from Mariela Hotel because of you wasn't enough?

229
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,900
 What else can I do?

230
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,460
 Your daughter burnt Do Jae Yi's ledger and screwed me over.

231
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:06,150
 Hey, brother, fight me instead of my daughter.

232
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,350
 Where are you right now? I'll be there.

233
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,720
 I'm kind of busy. But if you really want to,

234
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,870
 I'm heading to the place your daughter loved 10 years ago.

235
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,720
 Meet me there if you like.

236
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,110
 Brother, brother! Hey, hey! Song Je Hyeok!

237
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,970
 Hold on, Hae Mi...

238
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,030
 The place Hae Mi liked is...

239
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,410

240
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,970
 Song Je Hyeok.

241
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,300
 Is he even alive?

242
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,330
I'm sorry. It's necessary to confirm.

243
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,780
Yes.

244
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,560
It is him.

245
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,580

246
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,090
 Mom, he died. Did you know?

247
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,210
Yu Jeong.

248
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,330
Are you okay?

249
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,800
We're still investigating the scene,

250
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,000
but it won't take long, since there isn't much there.

251
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:46,150
How did Je Hyeok end up this way?

252
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:51,530
The medical examiner said the wound on the hand was the only notable one.

253
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,490
But there was a needle mark on the left arm.

254
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,900
The medical examiner says we can't rule out the possibility of murder.

255
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,370
We're planning to do an autopsy after getting a warrant tomorrow.

256
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,340
Autopsy?

257
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,960
What do you mean, murdered?

258
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,910
Who would kill that bast─ I mean, who could've killed him?

259
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,600
We'll find out through the investigation.

260
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,740
Would you be able to come to the police station tomorrow?

261
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,220
We'll have to ask some questions.

262
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,090
Excuse me, can't you see what condition she's in?

263
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,300
She's about to pass out. How could she be questioned at the police station?

264
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,840
Actually, I'd like you to come as well.

265
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,000
There are some questions we want to ask you, too.

266
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,890
- What about me? 
- I can't say much since we're still investigating,

267
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,960
but neither of you is free from this case.

268
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,220

269
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,730
I see you often, Attorney Do.

270
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,120
You're fine with me sitting in front of you, right?

271
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,020
Please tell me what evidence led to Ms. Go's arrest.

272
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:16,860
Firstly, you're staying at Suite 2401 at Kangbo Hotel. Is that correct?

273
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,300
- That's correct.
 - Okay.

274
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,970
Since Mr. Song used an app that deletes texts after a certain period of time,

275
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,900
there aren't that many records.

276
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,390
But before he died, he texted Ms. Go,

277
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,270
"I'm on my way. You have the land document ready, right?"

278
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,680
And there's a record of you saying, "Just arrive on time" in response.

279
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,140
Yes, we exchanged texts,

280
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,040
but we didn't get to meet.

281
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,430
I went to a party because I was angry.

282
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,510
It was a mask party at a place called Restaurant S.

283
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,580
Why did you get angry?

284
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,070
You don't have to explain everything.

285
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,560
What's important is that Ms. Go never met Mr. Song.

286
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,370
And she told the truth. She was at the party with me.

287
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,100
The attorney is proving the client's alibi.

288
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,710
You can check the CCTV at the hotel.

289
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,390
Ms. Go left the hotel before 7 p.m., and she hasn't returned afterward.

290
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,480
The hotel's CCTV was coincidentally turned off exactly at 8 p.m.

291
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,090
Oh, no.

292
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,260
What a shame.

293
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:31,920
How did Mr. Song enter your room when you weren't even there?

294
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,950
I'm sure you found it in his possession.

295
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,050
I gave him the room key a while ago.

296
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,900
You're supposed to be Ms. Ju's friend.

297
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,910
Why did you give her husband your room key?

298
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,600
Why are you so naive?

299
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,160
You must see all kinds of stuff at the police station.

300
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
Oh, okay.

301
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,690

302
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,140
I'm going nuts here.

303
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,610
Saying we're not free from this case means they find us suspicious.

304
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,540
But why exactly? For what reason?

305
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,880
Hae Mi.

306
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,570
Why? Do you have any idea?

307
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Why did you go back to the hotel that night?

308
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,340
I went because─

309
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,300
No, don't tell me! If you do, I have to tell you, too.

310
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,560
Why can't you tell me?

311
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,460
We will be investigated tomorrow!

312
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,030
Our stories will get mixed up if we talk now for no reason.

313
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,420
So you're saying...

314
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,010
Yes.

315
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,400
We should survive on our own. Okay?

316
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,090
I'll get going.

317
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,230
Where have you been? You didn't answer your phone, either.

318
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,570
Why did you look for me?

319
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,040
She has just been drinking since earlier without saying a word.

320
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,530
Did something happen to her?

321
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,020
Step out for a second.

322
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,230
What? In the middle of the night?

323
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,240
I need to talk to Mom about something.

324
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,580
Well, okay. Call me if something comes up.

325
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,330
You shouldn't be drinking when you're injured!

326
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,500
Tell me now.

327
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,970
I didn't get to hear the details yesterday.

328
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,610
How did you know he was there?

329
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,080
How did you find that room?

330
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,010
I'm Gil Man Ok of Daesungak.

331
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,680
I could easily find out about stuff like that─

332
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,990
Don't be so proud.

333
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,000
What did you do inside?

334
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,900
The bastard was passed out on the couch.

335
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,510
I looked closely, wondering if he were dead.

336
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,800
He suddenly swung something at me...

337
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,770
So, why did you have to go there? What business did you have with him?

338
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,690
Because of you! He said he would release the photo of you doing drugs!

339
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,950
How was I supposed to do nothing?

340
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,510
But you shouldn't have gone there! That's Yoo Na's room─

341
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,650
That's why I thought it was a good opportunity!

342
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,650
I could've ambushed them together and threatened them!

343
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,570
So he can't release the photo of you!

344
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,550
You took care of things well afterward, right?

345
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,260
 Hey, Mom.

346
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,830
 I just arrived at the hotel.

347
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,550
 I'm going in right now.

348
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,240
Don't worry.

349
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,060
I removed any trace of you.

350
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,410
By the way, Mom.

351
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,620
What was your relationship with Song Je Hyeok?

352
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,900
W-What do you mean by that?

353
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,600
He threatened you instead of me.

354
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,820
And you went there yourself instead of making someone do it.

355
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,590
Did you know each other well?

356
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,360
Well...

357
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,900
Ace Bar is his!

358
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,180
We helped each other since we were both in the industry. That's all!

359
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,900
But this time, he crossed the line!

360
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,400
How dare he messes with my daughter?

361
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,340
That's why I wanted to warn him.

362
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,890
That I'll rip him apart if he messes with you again!

363
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,530
Honestly, I've been blaming you a lot.

364
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,810
My whole life I've been called a daughter of a hostess because of you!

365
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,540
But Mom... you did something so dangerous for me.

366
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,600
I'm sorry.

367
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,050
I'm sorry, Mom.

368
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,070
Don't worry about what happened.

369
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,010
Since you protected me my whole life,

370
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,360
I'll protect you this time.

371
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,590
Doesn't it hurt?

372
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,330
- It does.
 - Why did you have to go there?

373
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:44,750
Let's wrap it up here for today and resume tomorrow.

374
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,590
Let her go if there isn't anything suspicious.

375
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,440
That will be difficult. You know we have 48 hours left, right?

376
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,310
Just let them.

377
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,590
It's because I was convicted of murder before.

378
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,350
Keep looking for evidence, then.

379
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,750
I'll come back tomorrow.

380
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,290
Don't say anything while I'm gone.

381
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,820
Attorney Do.

382
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,560
I'm telling you this because we have a history.

383
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,850
You shouldn't be worrying about your friend right now.

384
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,840
You will be investigated tomorrow, too.

385
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,230
You're also a very important person in this case.

386
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,320
What's going on?

387
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,370
You don't normally drink at the restaurant.

388
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,600
What's this about?

389
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,460
You know how the memory card for the mask party went missing?

390
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,590
Shouldn't we call the police about it?

391
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:04,160
It's not valuable, but it's uneasy to think that someone might've taken it.

392
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,760
Don't call the police.

393
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,380
Like you said, it's not valuable, either.

394
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,330
Having the police coming and going will interfere with the business.

395
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,810
Okay.

396
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,300
I'm sorry.

397
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,580
I should've watched more closely while you were gone.

398
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,680
You must've been busy because of the customers, too.

399
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:22,780
Also, I don't want you to tell anyone that I stepped out during the party.

400
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,530
Okay, I won't tell anyone.

401
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,000
Excuse me.

402
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,030
How can I help you?

403
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,430
He's here to see me.

404
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,920
If there were slush funds,

405
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,650
there must be a trace of them somewhere.

406
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:01,630
If the police find it first, it will all be gone.

407
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,110
I need to find it first.

408
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,460
Hyung!

409
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,030
What?

410
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,450
Did he leave? Without even locking the door?

411
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:25,180
Hyung! Hyung, are you here?

412
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,710
When will you pay me?

413
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,160
I'll leave the country before I get caught.

414
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,630
I'll call you when it's ready.

415
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,380
Leave through the back door. It's safer that way.

416
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,170
Hey.

417
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,550
What are you doing here, Leo?

418
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,750
Hae Mi kicked me out again.

419
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,150
I can stay here just for a bit, right?

420
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,810
Sure.

421
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,320
By the way, how long were you there for?

422
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,620
I came just now. Why?

423
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,590
It's nothing.

424
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,980
Have a seat and wait.

425
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,410
I needed a drinking buddy anyway. This is great.

426
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,970
- I'll bring it right over.
 - Okay.

427
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,080
Could it have been... Jae Yi?

428
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,330

429
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,680

430
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,350
 Where are you right now?

431
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,110
I can't leave any trace.

432
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,820

433
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:02,370
Grandma, let me see him tomorrow.

434
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:07,180
No, I just want you to do it.

450
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:28,640
 Breaking news. Yeongun Foundation's chairman and Hanguk Party's

451
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,450
 mayoral candidate for Tongju, Song Je Hyeok, who went missing

452
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:37,470
 was found dead in a hotel room in Tongju, according to the police.

453
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:44,540
 Before he died, he announced that he'll step down as the chairman and the mayoral candidate.

454
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:49,040
 The police are suspecting suicide due to feeling pessimistic about his circumstances,

455
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,230
 but they aren't ruling out the possibility of foul play.

456
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,310
 Therefore, they requested that the National Forensic Service perform an autopsy.

457
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:59,490
 They're also investigating whether his death is related to the Angel's Club,

458
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:04,010
 the illegal business within Chunsarang Orphanage.

459
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:10,510

460
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,730
Take care. Thank you!

461
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:23,400
Song Je Hyeok is dead.

462
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,530
It wasn't me.

463
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,770
I did go inside the hotel, but I didn't kill him.

464
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:42,100
I said this 10 years ago, too, but the truth isn't important.

465
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,540
What's important is for you to not get involved.

466
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,740
I think it was Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul.

467
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,740
I wanted to see you to warn you about him.

468
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,940
Are you sure it was him?

469
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:12,190
Even my friends don't know about our relationship.

470
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:16,930
He's the only one who could find out about a secret like this.

471
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,530
There's one more person who knows.

472
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,400
By chance... do you mean Kang Hoo?

473
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,370
No.

474
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:38,450
Kang Hoo...

475
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,680
He's the only person I trust in this world.

476
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,170
Anyway, I'll make sure you don't get involved.

477
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,750
I'll make sure you don't become involved.

478
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,150
There's something I would like to ask you.

479
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,040
Do you still care about the truth?

480
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,480
Pardon?

481
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,570
Sometimes, the truth could hurt you.

482
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:13,070
And your search for the truth could hurt someone who's precious to you, too.

483
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,060
I don't know why you're asking me that suddenly,

484
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,240
but if you're talking about what happened in the past,

485
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:30,210
I don't regret learning the truth by finding him.

486
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:36,340
Even if I had gone back in time, I would've made sure to find him.

487
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,090
All right, then.

488
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:13,520
Who could've killed Song Je Hyeok?

489
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,970
Why are the police considering you as a suspect?

490
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:24,740
There isn't even CCTV footage. What's their reason?

491
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,680
Well.

492
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,570
I'll find out once I get there.

493
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,060
I need to get going.

494
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,450
I'm supposed to meet my friends outside.

495
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,780
Well...

496
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,630
There's something I need to tell you about Choi Kang Hoo.

497
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:48,790
After hearing there was no CCTV recording at the restaurant,

498
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,640
I went to the restaurant.

499
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,890

500
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,250
 Let me ask you something.

501
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,910
 Why did the CCTV not record during the mask party last night?

502
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:07,100
 Who are you, and why are you asking me that?

503
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,520

504
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,480
It's not that it didn't record. Someone stole the memory card.

505
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,040
It apparently happened while Mr. Choi stepped out.

506
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,970
Manager Jo.

507
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,050
You crossed the line.

508
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:32,610
Don't trick people with a fake ID like that from now on.

509
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,050

510
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:54,690
I feel like I'm back to 10 years ago.

511
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:58,700
Don't jinx yourself, and just relax.

512
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,300
Just tell them what a victim's wife would say, and I'll...

513
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:08,360
Jae Yi, do you have any idea?

514
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,990
I don't know.

515
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:17,440
Let's just make sure Yoo Na doesn't get jeopardized like 10 years ago.

516
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,270
Let's go, then.

517
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,920
As I told you,

518
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,130
I was at the restaurant all night with my friends.

519
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:49,180
That's what you did before.

520
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,690
Why did you go to Grand Kangbo Hotel,

521
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:56,410
where Mr. Song was at 2:38 a.m. the day after?

522
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,440
What do you mean...

523
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,850
What were you looking for in the car?

524
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:39,430
I knew he frequented that hotel.

525
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,730
It was obvious.

526
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,650
He had a woman.

527
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:49,130
I was trying to find a clue.

528
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:54,210
Then, you could've gone to the room to catch him red-handed.

529
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,170
No,

530
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,580
I couldn't do anything so risky.

531
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,260
I'm actually... pregnant right now.

532
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,600
I see.

533
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,340
Well,

534
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:19,420
how much do you know about his relationship with women?

535
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,630
- If you're talking about Yoo Na─
 - Hold on.

536
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,210
I'm not talking about her.

537
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:30,230
Did you know about his relationship with Yoon Hae Mi by chance?

538
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:35,050
My husband and Hae Mi?

539
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:37,830
I told you!

540
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,520
I was at a party with my friends that night!

541
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,210
Just ask them yourself!

542
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:49,490
I didn't say you went to the hotel that night.

543
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,330
What I'm curious about is your relationship with Mr. Song.

544
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,810
You can't be serious right now.

545
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:04,400
Relationship? What kind of relationship could I have with my friend's husband?

546
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,050
Why did you accept money from him? It was almost 10 billion won.

547
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:13,150
10 billion? Me?

548
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,960
There was a note on his phone.

549
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,020
It's a transaction between you and him.

550
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,530
The date, the amount, and it says it was paid in cash.

551
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,780
It has all the details.

552
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,930
You must've had a special relationship since you received that much money.

553
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:30,720
This is like an economic union.

554
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,790
 Ace Bar is his!

555
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:37,260
 We helped each other since we were both in the industry. That's all!

556
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,050
 Yoon Hae Mi.

557
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:43,190
 What will you and your mom do with Daesungak if I die?

558
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,150
 We've been working together for 10 years.

559
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:57,120
Attorney Do told me not to say anything until she came.

560
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,600
Attorney Do won't be able to join you today.

561
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,750
I have something to ask you about her.

562
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:07,860
About Jae Yi?

563
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:12,330
You followed her to the hotel around 4:12 in the morning, right?

564
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,550
Why did you follow her?

565
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,670
Was there anything suspicious about her?

566
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,140
It's all on the CCTV.

567
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,930
Is there a CCTV recording of that?

568
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:45,060
Why did you go to the hotel where Mr. Song was yesterday at 4:11 in the morning?

569
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:49,580
And why did you come out about 20 minutes later, gagging?

570
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:59,620
I couldn't tell you yesterday because we were still analyzing the footage.

571
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:03,060
According to the forensic analysis,

572
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:07,260
it's true that the CCTV was turned off at 8 p.m. the day before,

573
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:12,230
but the CCTV at the entrance turned back on at 4 a.m. the next day.

574
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:16,890
Did the security guard turn it back on too soon?

575
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,750
He disappeared right after the incident.

576
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,250
You told him to turn the CCTV off, didn't you?

577
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,080
And you went to the hotel that morning and killed Mr. Song, didn't you?

578
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,780
Didn't you come out gagging because you were disgusted, too?

579
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,800
You're a suspect and no longer a witness starting now.

580
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,830
You're an attorney, but you can get your own.

581
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,770
And you have the right to remain silent if you like.

582
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:54,380
Attorney Do has an alibi, apparently.

583
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,310
Someone who can prove it is on his way right now.

584
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:14,940

585
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,250
Who told you that?

586
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,580
The chief said so.

587
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,550
Who is the person who is on his way right now?

588
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:33,880
I heard you have something to say regarding Attorney Do.

589
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,710
First of all,

590
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:41,830
I was the one who told them to turn the CCTV off at the hotel.

591
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,930
Why did you tell them to do that?

592
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:55,930
This is embarrassing to say, but I have a child out of wedlock.

593
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,960
I invited her to the hotel,

594
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,820
but I didn't want a record of it.

595
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:08,440
But the employee turned it back on too quickly. Like a fool.

596
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,120
Hold on.

597
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,390
Who's that child out of wedlock?

598
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,700
Could it be...

599
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,460
Yes.

600
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,500
It's Attorney Do Jae Yi right here.

601
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:31,470
You were at the hotel with me that night in my office.

602
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,380
Jae Yi, let's not hide it anymore.

603
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:41,460
But you know,

604
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,940
I think I saw something that night.

605
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,370
I can tell them, right, Jae Yi?

606
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,100
 Do you still care about the truth?

607
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,650
 Sometimes, the truth could hurt you.

608
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:05,230
 And your search for the truth could hurt someone who's precious to you, too.

609
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,980
What did you see? Did you see anyone suspicious?

610
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:14,790
I should better tell them, right?

611
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,520
We need to tell them anything that could be clues,

612
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,890
so they could find out the truth quickly.

613
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,390
Tell us what you saw that night.

614
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:34,380
I went to the hotel past 10 p.m. that night.

615
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,310

616
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:52,500
 When I just got on the elevator, I saw a man

617
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:58,630
 in black clothes and a black cap behind a pillar.

618
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:05,440
Did it say the letter "N" on the cap?

619
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,950
I remember it because I found it suspicious that he was hiding.

620
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,700
Did you see his face?

621
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:38,810
♫  Who are you, Mister?  ♫

622
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:48,930
♫  And why I can't find you?  ♫

623
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:54,900

624
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:04,980

625
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:15,850
♫  I pray, I wish  ♫

626
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:17,730
 ~ Preview ~ 
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

627
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:20,260
 Why are you causing chaos out of the blue?

628
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:25,530
 I just hope you don't get involved in anything dangerous like 10 years ago.

629
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:27,660
 Kang Hoo Hyung seems a bit strange.

630
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,660
 He was having a strange conversation with a stranger.

631
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:33,440
 He seemed very different from his usual self.

632
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,540
 I'll give you money for your escape.

633
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,660
 This person gave me money and told me to leave Korea.

634
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:46,530
 I was so scared. I could never forget it. Never!

635
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:50,570
 I'll tell you the result of the autopsy.

636
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:54,270
 I didn't see this coming at all.

637
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:57,820
 Do you still care about the truth?

638
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:02,210
 Does Song Je Hyeok's death have anything to do with you?

639
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:05,120
 You weren't here at that time in that night.

640
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:09,390
 Why did you come to the hotel? Why did you have to hide that?
