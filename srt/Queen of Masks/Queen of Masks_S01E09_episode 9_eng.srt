1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,150

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,350

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,810
You don't have to go.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,750
Hae Mi was just joking.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,490
I have to leave so you can have fun.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,790
I'll stay put and wait for your call at home.

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,980
So have fun tonight.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,950

9
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,440
 Don't overdo it and join me in Suite 2401 at this hotel.

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,450
 The door is opening.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,580
 The door is closing.

12
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,200

13
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,660
This is a secured area.

14
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,920
You can't just come in here.

15
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,070

16
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,270
Geez, look at all this money.

17
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,180
Thank you very much!

18
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,670

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,310

20
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,210

21
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,290
You came late.

22
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,940
We locked the door, thinking everyone was here.

23
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,710
Excuse me.

24
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:15,930

25
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,350
 Why is this area being filmed by the security camera?

26
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:52,600

27
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,780

28
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,340

29
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,360

30
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,830
Hey. There isn't much happening today, right?

31
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,540
What's going on?

32
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,810
 How will you get out?

33
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,540
 There's no guarantee that you can get out without getting caught.

34
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,670
 I'll create an emergency.

35
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,210
 There's a method criminals use to subdue people.

36
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,970
 It's venom from blowfish called "zombie power."

37
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,530
 When you take it, you become paralyzed, lose the ability to speak,

38
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,750
 and lose consciousness eventually.

39
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,780
 Too much of it could be fatal,

40
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,390
 but it's okay if you use a moderate amount.

41
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,710
 Song Je Hyeok, why aren't you contacting me?

42
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,310
 Do I really have to bring this to the media?

43
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,580
Be careful.

44
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,510
Be careful, be careful!

45
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,280
Na Na.

46
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,980
Na Na!

47
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,880
Na Na!

48
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,310
Na Na! Na Na!

49
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,630
Driver, please follow that ambulance.

50
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,740
Hurry! Hurry!

51
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,370
- What's going on?
 - I'm not sure.

52
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,160
- What happened?
 - He just had a drink.

53
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,670
- 9235038. Give me my phone.
 - No, I can't.

54
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,710
No one can leave until the higher-ups allow it.

55
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,220
Give me my coat!

56
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,960
Someone passed out!

57
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,440
Don't just stand there. Give me my coat right now!

58
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,420
Run! Run! Run!

59
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,930
Do Jae Yi?

60
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,850
Block the entrance. So, no one can leave!

61
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,910
Got it!

62
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,610
Get in, Attorney Do!

63
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,910
Her temperature rose to 40°C, and she kept crying from a stomach ache since yesterday.

64
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,430
But today, she fainted.

65
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,580
I see.

66
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,180
There's a surgical mark on her stomach. By chance, did she─

67
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,690
She got Kasai portoenterostomy surgery.

68
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,350
She was diagnosed with congenital biliary atresia when she was 53 days old,

69
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,020
and she got the surgery when she was 65 days old.

70
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,590
She's only been receiving checkups regularly since she recovered well.

71
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,560
Did something go wrong by chance?

72
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,760
She has a bit of jaundice and hydrops. It must be cholangitis.

73
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,680
Are you the mother, by chance?

74
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,260
How did you know she was here?

75
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,410
I made it clear that I will report you if you show up again!

76
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,630
Report?

77
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,420
Please get her hospitalized first.

78
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,940
We can't leave her in the ER all night!

79
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,310
I have to discuss that with her guardian.

80
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,940
Please leave now if you have nothing to do with her─

81
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,230
I'm her mother!

82
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,420
Her biological mother,

83
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,270
so get her hospitalized now! Hurry!

84
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,020
Are you okay, Attorney Do?

85
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,990
Yes, I'm okay.

86
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,560
Kang Hoo.

87
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,520
Jae Yi, are you okay?

88
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,570
Kang Hoo, I found out what Song Je Hyeok does at the Angel's Club.

89
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,050
 He was using children

90
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,270
to find the members' weaknesses, selling drugs, and engaging in prostitution, too.

91
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,200
I knew it.

92
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,420
So, should we report him right now?

93
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,020
It's no use since everyone has been evacuated now.

94
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,720
Instead, I'll send you the evidence I collected. Please check that for now.

95
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,240
Okay, come back safely.

96
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,560
Yeah, I will.

97
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,290
What the hell happened?

98
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,200
How did Do Jae Yi come in here?

99
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,040
I checked the list of names as usual, but...

100
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,960
I'm not sure.

101
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,420
Shut the place down.

102
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,430
The club will be closed for now.

103
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,630
We can't leave any trace, either.

104
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,930
Yes, sir.

105
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,110

106
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,030
 The customer is not answering the phone.

107
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,200
 Please try again later.

108
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,840
Is he ignoring me now?

109
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,310
By the way, where did Yu Jeong go?

110
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,890
While this is happening to her.

111
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,050
Don't ask me anything.

112
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,650
I don't know anything.

113
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,710
I'll find out myself, then.

114
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,580

115
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,110
 Yu Jeong, Yoo Na is right.

116
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,910
 The one who raped me and killed Gi Do Shik

117
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,600
 is your husband, Song Je Hyeok.

118
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,660
Why? Is your stomach hurting again?

119
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,890
I told you not to think about anything and rest up.

120
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,590
You must relax no matter what.

121
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,010
Have you seen my phone, by chance?

122
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,810
It wasn't in my bag.

123
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm not sure. Maybe someone took it when you fainted.

124
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,070
You shouldn't look at your phone, either.

125
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:26,810
Your guardian made me promise not to give you anything that could cause stress.

126
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,620
Take a rest.

127
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,010

128
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,530
 I took a look at it.

129
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,870
It has everything, including the names of the members and transaction history.

130
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,780
But there's one thing I'm worried about.

131
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,240

132
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,510
It says the person in charge is Yu Jeong.

133
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,630
There isn't Song Je Hyeok's name anywhere.

134
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:11,630
That means even if I report them, he'll slip out, and only Yu Jeong would get hurt, right?

135
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:18,160
So I checked everything again, and all the transactions were made under her name, too.

136
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,820

137
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,580
Could she know about this club, too?

138
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,450
No, she would never do such a thing.

139
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,020
He disguised the club as an orphanage.

140
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,560
The members turned into sponsors, and the membership fees into donations.

141
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,960
While thoroughly using the children at the orphanage.

142
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,630
Then, why don't you meet with Yu Jeong?

143
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,720
She'd change her mind once she found out the truth, right?

144
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,330
 No matter what you guys say, I believe in Je Hyeok.

145
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:54,380
 Because that'd be what's best for my child.

146
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,740
It won't do anything.

147
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,720
Do you have pictures or videos of the club, by chance?

148
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,220
I didn't get to take any.

149
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:10,370
I had to hand in my phone upon entry, and there weren't even security cameras inside.

150
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:16,230
It looked like they were filming with a hidden camera attached to the kids,

151
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,180
but I couldn't acquire the footage.

152
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,100
How about we try to find an eyewitness?

153
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,450
They might testify who the real person in charge is, too.

154
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,590
Who would come to our side?

155
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,820
They're all under his thumb.

156
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,860
Well,

157
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,130
I know a child at the orphanage. Her name is Yeon Ah.

158
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:47,200
She's... traumatized by masks like you.

159
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,050
Traumatized by masks?

160
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,610
I'm not sure, but she might've experienced something similar to you.

161
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,750
So, Kang Hoo, please let me meet her.

162
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,840
I have to meet her.

163
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,990
 The document is useless?

164
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,140
There's still a problem.

165
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,920
Do Jae Yi saw the club with her own eyes.

166
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,780
If the members find out, they won't forgive you.

167
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,800
Do you think I'm a fool?

168
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,360
Did you think I wouldn't know that?

169
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,390
Don't worry.

170
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:36,310
I'll completely destroy Do Jae Yi before the members find out.

171
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,820
 Why aren't you contacting me, Hae Mi?

172
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,820
 Are you testing my patience?

173
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,480
 Hae Mi isn't like that.

174
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,560
That's how she became the vice president of that huge hotel.

175
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,220
I'm receiving another call.

176
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,020
You should come by sometime then.

177
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,300
You'll be treated generously.

178
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,150
Yes.

179
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,440
Yes, Minister Goo.

180
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,420
That's not true.

181
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,570
Yes, thank you for your concern.

182
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,430
Yes.

183
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,750
You're supposed to be the vice president of the best hotel in Korea. Why do you look like this?

184
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,480
Should we go shopping together?

185
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,320
Should we go sweep it all up?

186
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,100
Mom, I'm sorry.

187
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,120
What do you mean you're sorry?

188
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,370
Who hasn't made a mistake in the past?

189
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,410
A video like that will easily get buried by celebrity gossip!

190
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,990
Mom, that's not it.

191
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,330
Mom! Please help me!

192
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,570
Help me, Mom!

193
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,640
Is something else going on?

194
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,020
That bastard is strangling me using these pictures.

195
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,930
Mom, what should I do?

196
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,230
What am I supposed to do?

197
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,810
What do you mean, what should you do?

198
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,980
If he wants the ledger, we should give it to him.

199
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,160

200
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,420
It's that pretty Ahjumma!

201
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,250
Ahjumma, when did you come?

202
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,660
Na Na.

203
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,610
Are you okay?

204
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,210
Where's Mom, by the way?

205
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,470
Is she still sick?

206
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,680
Is your mom sick?

207
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,950
- It's Dad.
 - Yes, Na Na.

208
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,680
Nanny told me everything.

209
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,710
Thank you for caring for Na Na.

210
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,450
Did it hurt a lot, Na Na?

211
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,650
It hurt just as much as last time.

212
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,850
My head and my stomach.

213
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,330
Last time? This wasn't the first time?

214
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,620
Let's talk outside.

215
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,630
You show up now when she's in that condition?

216
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,870
Do you call yourself a human?

217
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,520
Thanks to that, you got to spend all night with her.

218
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,830
Shouldn't you be thanking me instead?

219
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,530
Tell me.

220
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,390
How many times did this happen while I was gone?

221
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,430
A few times.

222
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,400
But she recovers quickly at the hospital. Don't worry.

223
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,730
How is that okay?

224
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,990
The doctor said the condition can't be cured completely!

225
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,190
She needs a liver transplant if it keeps causing problems!

226
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,220
I'm her legal guardian.

227
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,990
I decide whether she gets a liver transplant or not!

228
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,400
I can't take it anymore.

229
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,580
I'll take care of Na Na from now on.

230
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,880
Don't overreact.

231
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,030
If you keep bothering me, I'll send her overseas so you can never find her.

232
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,350
Thanks for everything.

233
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,250
Since the nanny's here, you can go home now.

234
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,690
I heard Yu Jeong is pregnant.

235
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,310
You don't need Na Na, then.

236
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:18,250
Na Na, needs care for the rest of her life.

237
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,910
I'll do everything. Please let me, yeah?

238
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,960
How many times did I tell you? Na Na has to be a part of the campaign!

239
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,420
Wait until the election ends!

240
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,840

241
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,030
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone!

242
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:54,540
 I apologize for making you worry regarding the controversial video of my wife.

243
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:01,330
 But no matter what happened in the past, my wife is the love of my life.

244
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:08,390
 So please blame me for everything and respect her dignity.

245
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,310
 Thank you.

246
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,550
Gosh, I told you not to watch stuff like this.

247
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,610
I think you're too stubborn.

248
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,180
Can I get out of here now?

249
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:34,270
I'm worried if Na Na's okay and if she's going to kindergarten okay.

250
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:39,090
I can't reach the nanny, and you're too busy.

251
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,910
She hasn't been going to kindergarten.

252
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,370
I sent her on a trip with the nanny.

253
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,370
- Why?
 - The reporters keep coming to her kindergarten,

254
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,540
and your video left quite an impact.

255
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,370
Stay here until things quiet down.

256
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,040
Being exposed to the media right now won't help you at all.

257
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:18,360
Do you know where my phone is, by chance?

258
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,570
Your phone?

259
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,910
I kept it safe.

260
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,820
Thank you.

261
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,370
I'll get going.

262
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,120
Are you leaving already?

263
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,410
Why? Do you need to tell me something?

264
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,410
Just because...

265
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,840
I'm not really sure what kind of person you are.

266
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,980
Are you suspicious of me about something?

267
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:11,250
I need to have faith, too.

268
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,280
Faith in you.

269
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,540
You're my wife, and I love you.

270
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,990
You're also my baby's mother.

271
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,110
Why didn't you tell me you're pregnant?

272
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,320
I missed the timing to mention it.

273
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,370
Just like how I gave you the baby as a gift,

274
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,750
I want you to give me a gift, too.

275
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,340
An absolute faith.

276
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,380
That way, I can protect you and our baby, too.

277
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,970
Take a rest.

278
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,240
I'll be back soon.

279
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,130
 This is Yoo Na.

280
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,960
 I know you're sick, but how could you leave Na Na alone like this?

281
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,410
 Do you only care about your own baby?

282
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,790
 I won't forgive you if something goes wrong with Na Na.

283
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,750
 Understand?

284
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,610
 She's pregnant.

285
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,930
 - Pregnant?
 - Yes.

286
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,380
 But there's a chance she might miscarry.

287
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,280
 She absolutely needs to relax for two weeks.

288
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,590
 Yes, got it.

289
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,290
Now completely...

290
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:34,020
you became mine, Yu Jeong.

291
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,390
 I can't congratulate you on your pregnancy,

292
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,350
 but you should take care of yourself.

293
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,720
 We need to meet up.

294
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,750
 I still need to tell you about your husband.

295
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,130
Mr. Jung.

296
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,590
Clone a phone for me.

297
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,200
 Yeon Ah, I'm the Ahjussi who almost got into an accident with you.

298
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,130
 Could I talk to you for a moment?

299
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,610
Unni, could you come to the stationery store with me?

300
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,950
Okay, let's go together.

301
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,630
Let's go.

302
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,030

303
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,200
 If he wants the ledger, we should give it to him.

304
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,120
 We can't!

305
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,270
 How could I hand over Jae Yi to a rapist and a murderer?

306
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,890
 Then you shouldn't have fallen into his trap in the first place!

307
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,390
 I think I'm going to go crazy!

308
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,360
 We have no choice.

309
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,890
 Give him the ledger.

310
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,850
 Instead...

311
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:50,650

312
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,340
 Where should I send the ledger?

313
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,320
Yeon Ah!

314
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,320
I came because I didn't get a reply from you.

315
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,430
Why did you reach out to me?

316
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,110
You must be Yeon Ah.

317
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,660
I asked him to because I wanted to see you.

318
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,170
I should introduce myself.

319
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,570
I'm Do Jae Yi.

320
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,180
I know.

321
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,370
Attorney Do Jae Yi.

322
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,350
You help the sexual assault victims.

323
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,600
Unni, what's sexual assault?

324
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:00,400
Well, I'm so honored that you recognize me.

325
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,410
So, I was wondering, could we talk somewhere for a second?

326
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,540
Is she your sister?

327
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,100
I noticed how much you care for her.

328
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,710
She's not my sister,

329
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,970
but the lengths of her legs didn't match since birth.

330
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:31,000
I felt bad that a small and precious child has difficulty walking.

331
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,940
So I basically raised her.

332
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,830
You must be like a mom to her.

333
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,920
I don't know how a mom would feel,

334
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,700
but I could do anything for her.

335
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,870
Anything.

336
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:52,760
You could do anything?

337
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,150
By chance, do you mean the kind of stuff they make you do at the orphanage?

338
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:09,510
Please leave if you expect me to testify or file a report.

339
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,800
I'll never do such a thing.

340
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,770
That's not what I expect from you.

341
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,670
I'm here to comfort you.

342
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:25,450
I... experienced the same thing as you.

343
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,740
Of course, you hesitate to testify.

344
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:38,300
Victims of sexual assault, like us, are different from other victims.

345
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:47,000
We're afraid that the shameful thing that happened to us would be revealed if we report.

346
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,250
 We're trying to protect you.

347
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,710
 There are many people who are way worse out there.

348
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:59,790
 If I stay here, could you get leg surgery for Ye Ji?

349
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,840
 Of course, we're a family.

350
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,820
Our sense of judgment weakens because of the anxiety

351
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,750
and we get to rely on bad people.

352
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,970
 You just need to listen to me.

353
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:15,270
And the bad people take advantage of such victims' mental state.

354
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:22,880
So you can't report them and be on their side instead.

355
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,780
But they don't get punished even if you report them,

356
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,750
because they have so much power.

357
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:36,580
That's true. They say power is above the law.

358
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:44,490
But that power doesn't always mean having money and authority.

359
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:49,450
Being brave and not giving up.

360
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,880
Stuff like that can be power, too.

361
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,610
No matter how much you try, I can't report.

362
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,290
I'm not like you.

363
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,360
I have no courage, and I give up easily, too.

364
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,190
This is a secret.

365
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,700
I'm a coward, too.

366
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:23,230
It's been already 10 years, but whenever I think of that day,

367
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:28,410
I feel so scared and horrible. It even gives me chills.

368
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,920
But the reason why I don't give up on catching him is

369
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,760
because bad men don't do bad things just once.

370
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,380
And they don't just do it to one person, either.

371
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:53,190
If we stay silent, someone else might get hurt.

372
00:40:53,890 --> 00:41:00,360
And it could be someone we love, too.

373
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,700
Yeon Ah, you don't have to do anything if it's too hard.

374
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,660
But you shouldn't give up on yourself.

375
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:33,180
That's what I want to tell you.

376
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,660
Make sure to contact me if anything happens.

377
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,510
Ye Ji, didn't they give you a pretty brooch at the stationery store?

378
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,150
The owner of the store said she gave you one.

379
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,630
Yes, she did.

380
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,800
Oh, yeah? You should keep that safe, okay?

381
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,850
If something happens to you, I'll run to you at once.

382
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,940
Do Jae Yi met with Yeon Ah.

383
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,160
Do Jae Yi met with Yeon Ah?

384
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,220
 Ye Ji, too.

385
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:27,300
How could you manage the children so poorly?

386
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,470
What should I do? Should I trap them?

387
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,630
Will you trap them forever?

388
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:37,310
They start investigating if they miss just one day of school.

389
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,290
Do Jae Yi might've planted something with them.

390
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:52,110
Search their belongings. Everything, including the trash cans.

391
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,690
Yes.

392
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,960
You received a package.

393
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,180
Yes, give it to me.

394
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,640
This isn't Do Jae Yi's ledger.

395
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,780
 This is Ace Bar's money laundering ledger.

396
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,800
 I guess you really were an ace of the Ace Bar.

397
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,680
 You made quite a bit of money.

398
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,640
 How do you like this for a deal?

399
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:24,080
Hello, good day. This is the police station, right?

400
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,730
I wanted to make a report.

401
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,610
It's a bar called Ace Bar in the Gongguk district of Tongju City.

402
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,310

403
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,870
 Ms. Do! You did this, didn't you?

404
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,310
 - You stabbed him like this!
 - I...

405
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,150
She looked very confused, but she denied killing Gi Do Shik.

406
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,330
 I was sexually assaulted.

407
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,890
But she insisted that there was another man in that room

408
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,860
and she was sexually assaulted by him.

409
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,670
 I searched the scene thoroughly,

410
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,380
 but there was no trace of

411
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,700
 a man other than Gi Do Shik in that hotel room that night.

412
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,730
But there wasn't enough evidence.

413
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:14,120
 I heard they found a ton of ecstasy and condoms in the bathroom there.

414
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,880
 Weren't you confused because you were high?

415
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,440
It was concluded that she was confused because she was drunk.

416
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:24,070
No one believed what Jae Yi had to say.

417
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,680
 - Where have you been, anyway?
 - Well, the thing is...

418
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,910
The employee at the security room happened to be gone during the incident

419
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:41,520
and he said the security cameras didn't work properly at the time.

420
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,650
It does seem like something's going on.

421
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,940
What's this?

422
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,400
Was there a camera?

423
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,120
 There was a small camera and a charger in the room at the time,

424
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,350
 but no memory card was found.

425
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,620
But this camera...

426
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:27,290

427
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,550
Hyung, it's been a while. How are things at the studio?

428
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:43,840
Could you have a look at the photos I sent?

429
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,980
Is that the correct charger for the camera in the photo?

430
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,300
 This charger isn't compatible with that camera.

431
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,570
 It's for a different model.

432
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,720
Thank you, Hyung.

433
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,800
Come to my restaurant soon. I'd like to see you.

434
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,380
Yes.

435
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,430
It means there were two cameras in that room.

436
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,330
Song Je Hyeok must've taken one.

437
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,440
But how about the other one?

438
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:34,160
How can you eat right now after making my son a rapist?

439
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,410
Well,

440
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:42,880
strictly speaking, I didn't turn your son into a rapist.

441
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,310
Song Je Hyeok is the rapist.

442
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,560
Tell me why you wanted to see me.

443
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:02,410
I heard the Angel's Club closed.

444
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:06,380
I don't know. I don't know anything about it.

445
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,910
You're playing ignorant, huh?

446
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,830
Then let me tell you what it is.

447
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,820
It's all on here.

448
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:27,420
What that club is, who goes there,

449
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,320
and what they do in there.

450
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:40,140
I'm curious if you're just a member or its body.

451
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:44,190
Or whether you're on Song Je Hyeok's side or not.

452
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,650
But it doesn't matter anyway.

453
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:52,550
What's certain is that Song Je Hyeok is already done.

454
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:58,320
If the members find out the file was leaked, they won't leave him alone.

455
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,590
You'd probably want to kill him first.

456
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,010
You know about cutting off the tail, right?

457
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:12,920
Make the members ditch Song Je Hyeok.

458
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,950
If so, you might be able to survive.

459
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,390
What do you mean the secret was leaked, sir?

460
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,520
That never happened.

461
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,610
You know how tight our security is.

462
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:34,490
There's no way you would get exposed─

463
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:38,010
Hello─ sir, sir─

464
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:45,820
How did the word get out anyway?

465
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,610

466
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,800
 Tell me. What's the issue?

467
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,920
The VIP members of the club.

468
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,570
Some of them came here and made a fuss. They said they'd leave the club.

469
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,390
What was the reason?

470
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,440
Is it true

471
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,000
that the club's records were leaked?

472
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,620
What do we have to do for them if they leave?

473
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,100
Well...

474
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,320
"If the club's secret is exposed, we compensate double the amount of the membership fee."

475
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:22,670
Money is an issue, but wouldn't that put you in a bad position?

476
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:25,820
- If they flip the script out of anger─ 
- Hey.

477
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,470
Would that only hurt me?

478
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:32,600
Who's got the video of them partying with women while being high?

479
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,360
Tell the members to stay quiet.

480
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:52,380
I'll bury the leaked records, so it can't be exposed to the world.

481
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,340

482
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,680
Ms. Ju.

483
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,440
It's time to go to the ultrasound room.

484
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,440
Ultrasound?

485
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,800
It was difficult to see the baby in the earlier stage,

486
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,020
but you probably could see it today.

487
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,490

488
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:46,040

489
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,610
Hello? Yes, Ma'am.

490
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:52,440
 Could you please come to the hospital?

491
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,320
How come you're eating meat all of a sudden?

492
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,130
I'm trying to get more energy.

493
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,480
I need to spurt at the last moment.

494
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,220
The last moment?

495
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,400
I suppose things are going well.

496
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:19,690
The members of the Angel's Club started berating Song Je Hyeok.

497
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:25,170
If they oust Song Je Hyeok, they will start fighting with each other.

498
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:28,060
When people are bound by a secret,

499
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,460
they become enemies the moment the secret gets revealed.

500
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,310
You think Song Je Hyeok would just sit and watch?

501
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,210
I'm sure he'd freak out.

502
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:42,990
But he can't do much when everyone turns their back on him.

503
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,600
But still, be careful.

504
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,750
He is capable of anything when he loses his temper.

505
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:00,620
Do you know how rashly your daughter has been behaving?

506
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,350
Answer me! I'm asking you a question!

507
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,960
Too much of anything brings about trouble.

508
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,270
- Pardon?
 - You're trying to have too many things,

509
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:17,350
and you made too many enemies in the process.

510
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,790
I wanted you to become the mayor.

511
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,850
I wanted nothing more nor less.

512
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:26,910
Are you doing this now, too?

513
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:32,770
I'm so desperate right now because I'm trying to become mayor.

514
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,280
Do you know how I came all the way here?

515
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,650
I had to do all sorts of things.

516
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,350
Just wait and see.

517
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:47,090
I'll make sure to become mayor. And...

518
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,630
I'll create my kingdom in Tongju.

519
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:56,580
But if someone gets in my way, I won't just sit and watch.

520
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,700
Even if that might be your daughter.

521
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,440

522
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,760
What happened?

523
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,020
Why was Na Na sent to the ICU?

524
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,550
Her temperature won't drop, and some level went up.

525
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,770
Bilirubin level?

526
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:30,430
Yes, that thing! It went up, so they had to move her in a hurry.

527
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:35,330
She could go back to the general ward tomorrow since she is stabilized now, but...

528
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,010
But what?

529
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,310
Hurry up and tell me!

530
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:45,370
I think she needs a liver transplant.

531
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:52,190
Ask her dad about the details. He talked to the doctor on the phone.

532
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,140

533
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,370
Why do you keep calling me?

534
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,560
 Song Je Hyeok, it's me.

535
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:12,260
Go Yoo Na?

536
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:17,580
Did you hear that Na Na needs a liver transplant?

537
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,030
Yes, I talked to the doctor over the phone.

538
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:25,840
But you're not doing anything? You're supposed to be her dad!

539
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,620
Do you want to hang up?

540
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:32,960
 If you keep this up, I won't answer the nanny's phone, either.

541
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,020
I'll donate my liver.

542
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,430
Let's get the surgery done, okay?

543
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:43,140
How many times do I have to tell you? You don't qualify.

544
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,680
 To donate your liver,

545
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,570
 you must reveal the donor and beneficiary and the relationship.

546
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:51,240
But I don't want the world to know that you're my ex-wife!

547
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,830
Why don't you do it, then? You're her dad!

548
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,410
 The election is less than a month away.

549
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,070
How could I have the time for it?

550
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:04,660
Also, if people find out I'm campaigning while my daughter is sick,

551
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,150
what would happen to my image?

552
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:09,650
Is that stupid election that important?

553
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,460
She's about to die!

554
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,090
Stupid election?

555
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:17,030
Hey, if I lose the election, I'm dead!

556
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,480
How could I care about anything else right now?

557
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,330
You...

558
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,920
You're really crazy.

559
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,870
Don't you care about Na Na because you have another baby now?

560
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,650
Whether it's a liver transplant or whatever,

561
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:44,130
everything comes after I win the election.

562
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,050
Now that it's come to this

563
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:53,960
all of this must be part of Na Na's fate.

564
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,180
Hey! Hey! Song Je Hyeok!

565
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,540
 I asked you if that satisfies the deal.

566
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,050
 Why won't you answer?

567
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:16,240
What? Are you happy about something?

568
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,820
No.

569
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,540
I'll explain it to you if things get cleared.

570
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,370
Okay, then.

571
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,210
Hold on.

572
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:35,510
I said a wide-mouthed glass is better for a full-bodied wine.

573
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:38,560
That way, the flavor comes out more.

574
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,450
Right.

575
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,890
I'll bring you a different glass, then.

576
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,960
You reached Cha Leo's phone.

577
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,580
 I'm calling from Gongguk police station's narcotics division.

578
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,640
Why is the narcotics division calling him?

579
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,700
 It's regarding Ace Bar.

580
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,800
 Ah, is this not Cha Leo?

581
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,720
He's not here right now.

582
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,430
Could you please call later?

583
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,970
Excuse me for a second.

584
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:07,810
It was you, right?

585
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,420
The one who made the police go after Leo.

586
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,360
The police in Korea are so good at their job.

587
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,140
- Did they already contact him?
 - Hey!

588
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,170
Do you want to die?

589
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,910
What are you trying to do right now?

590
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:26,230
You shouldn't be worrying about him right now.

591
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:30,570
I'm on my way to Mariela Hotel to see the chairman.

592
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,830
Why would you meet with the chairman?

593
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:37,180
You didn't give me Do Jae Yi's ledger.

594
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,560
So our deal must be over, right?

595
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,480
Stay right there.

596
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,520
I'll be right there.

597
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,730
Noona, where are you going?

598
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:01,280
Oh. There's an emergency situation at the hotel.

599
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,590
I'll be right back.

600
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:16,180
What are you doing here? Why would you meet with the chairman?

601
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,000
I told you earlier.

602
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,130
Our deal is over because you didn't give me Do Jae Yi's ledger.

603
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,590
What am I supposed to do?

604
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:28,050
The vice president started using drugs 10 years ago, but she hasn't quit yet.

605
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,300
I should tell him that.

606
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,680
You must've seen the ledger of Ace Bar I sent.

607
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,160
Do you think you'd be safe if I sent that to the police?

608
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,890
Ace Bar has nothing to do with me.

609
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:44,300
You said it yourself, the police were looking for Leo.

610
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,770
What does Leo have to do with Ace Bar?

611
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,000
I suppose you didn't know.

612
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,340
Leo is the person in charge at Ace Bar.

613
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:04,040
How do you feel about sending over the illegal activities of your husbands' business?

614
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,700
You bastard.

615
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,970
Leo went back there to save me from drugs.

616
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:15,020
But you blamed everything on innocent Leo?

617
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,110
Pick it up.

618
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,880
- You need that right now.
 - Who do you think I am?

619
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,380
Should I take it back, then?

620
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,850
You bastard.

621
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,660
You're mocking me right now, aren't you?

622
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:58,780
I'm not the one who's mocking you.

623
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,930
Do you know who ruined your life using drugs?

624
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,020
Your lovely husband Cha Leo.

625
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:11,050
He says he loves you and he'll protect you.

626
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,520
Isn't that the greatest insult?

627
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,620
What are you talking about?

628
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:19,040
Leo is the one who introduced you to drugs.

629
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,580
Didn't you know?

630
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,580
Quit talking nonsense!

631
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:26,680
I started taking drugs because of Yoo Na, not Leo!

632
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:35,030
 If that's what you really want.

633
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:37,450
 Does your wife know, too?

634
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:40,260
 About the kind of things you did?

635
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,870
 You mean you'd tell her I'm the one who gave her drugs first secretly?

636
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:50,560
 That's entirely up to you.

637
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,800
 Then, when do you want me to start working?

638
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:12,380
So ditch Leo quickly and bring me Do Jae Yi's ledger.

639
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:16,870
If so, I'll postpone my meeting with the chairman for now.

640
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,970
This is your last chance.

641
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,560
This is the womb.

642
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,190
This is the ovum.

643
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:09,950
The size and the location of the baby are great.

644
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,550
The heartbeat is very stable, too.

645
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,140
Heartbeat?

646
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,570
I'll raise the volume for you.

647
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:33,990
That's... the baby's heartbeat, right?

648
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:37,780
It's very loud. The baby must be very healthy.

649
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,960
That should be enough, right?

650
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,130
Hold on a moment.

651
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,960
I want to hear it longer, Doctor.

652
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,560
Why is Ye Ji going there at night?

653
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,860
 Jae Yi, it's me. It's been a while.

654
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:26,920
 I found out what my husband was doing at the orphanage.

655
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,340
 And I met with the children, too.

656
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:32,620
 My husband is such a terrible person.

657
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:37,580
 We should meet, Jae Yi. Please hear what I have to say.

658
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,530

659
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:50,490
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

660
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:53,680
 I got the brooch from Ye Ji.

661
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,120
 Come to the location you're seeing right now.

662
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,690
 I came here to confirm with my own eyes, too.

663
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:04,110
 But I'd like you to come alone without telling anyone.

664
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:08,680
 I don't feel confident about seeing anyone yet.

665
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:14,770

666
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,140
 Okay, I'll meet you there.

667
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:56,790

668
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:58,150

669
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:20,410

670
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:18,920

671
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,410

672
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:37,840
♫  The dark desire hidden behind a mask  ♫

673
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,410
♫  They're liars  ♫

674
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:45,890
♫  The truth is completely hidden behind a curtain  ♫

675
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,120
♫  My glamorous image  ♫

676
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,200
 ~ Preview ~ 
Should I feel guilty for falling in love?

677
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,230
 We loved each other.

678
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:54,120
 I was scared.

679
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,230
 I know it's too late to go back.

680
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:01,740
 But I'll kill him, even though it might be late.

681
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:04,060
 How could you do this? It was you, wasn't it?

682
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,010
 So forget about that puppy and protect yourself.

683
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:12,180
 A smart bitch can't beat a tough bitch, and a tough bitch can't beat a crazy bitch.

684
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,240
 Oops?

685
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:17,460
 I think I'll actually become a murderer this time.

686
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,790
 I'll kill Song Je Hyeok.

687
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,570
 What are you doing?

688
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:23,780
 You're here, aren't you?

689
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,980
 I'll complete the revenge.

690
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:35,030
 You really are fearless, aren't you?

691
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,680
 Song Je Hyeok, that bastard.

692
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:45,890
♫  On top of the tightrope show, everything is blood stained  ♫

693
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,820
♫  Ey yeah-yeah  ♫
