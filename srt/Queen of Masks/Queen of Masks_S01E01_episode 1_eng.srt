1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,620

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,350

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,970

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,990
 Here they come!

5
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,850
My gosh!

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,850

7
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,480

8
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,720

9
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,340
 ♫ Will you marry me? ♫

10
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,060
 ♫ Will you marry me? ♫

11
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,500
 ♫ Will you marry me? Marry me ♫

12
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,280
 ♫ Will you marry me? ♫

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
 ♫ Will you marry me?  ♫

14
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,410
 ♫  Will you marry me? Marry me ♫

15
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,230
 ♫ Put your hands up ♫

16
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,750
Will you marry me?

17
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,750
- Congratulations!
 - Congrats.

18
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,070
Thank you, guys.

19
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,540
 We will keep you entertained!

20
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,050
Let me introduce you to the stars of the night.

21
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,840
This is Attorney Do Jae Yi.

22
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,780
 My name is Do Jae Yi.

23
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,040
 I've been a public defender for three years.

24
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,640

25
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,810
 Dad abandoned my mom,

26
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,990
 who had me out of wedlock and became a single mom.

27
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,680
 Although she also died, and I was raised by Grandma,

28
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,400
 I realized my dream to prove myself.

29
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,560
This is Yoon Hae Mi.

30
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,010
You know Mariela Hotel, right?

31
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,130
My position is the team leader.

32
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,750
But when it comes to beauty, I deserve to be the chairman.

33
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,450
 Yoon Hae Mi.

34
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,670
 Hae Mi is the Marketing Team Leader at Hotel Mariela.

35
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,860
 - Do you want some?
 - Hae Mi's mom

36
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,890
 is the owner of a hostess bar, Daesungak,

37
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,330
 which is frequented by political and business influencers.

38
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,670
 You bought this purse?

39
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,150
 Daebak! I was going to get this, too!

40
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,730
 Hae Mi is the most jealous one

41
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,320
 and greediest one among us, but she's the most honest.

42
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,170
 So she's a trustworthy friend.

43
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,350
This is Go Yoo Na.

44
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,440
Did you say you're a fashion designer?

45
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,770
 Go Yoo Na.

46
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,930
 She studied fashion design.

47
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,460
 So she has great taste.

48
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,690
 I made these.

49
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,080
 Daebak!

50
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,910
 You can put it on your neck, and you can tie it on a purse handle, too.

51
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,960
 Yoo Na looks chic, but she cares for us more than anyone.

52
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,040
 - Let's go eat pasta. It's on me.
 - She joined the group last,

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,170
 but she's passionate and loyal.

54
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,740
And she's the star of the night.

55
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,620
The person I love the most in the world, our Yu Jeong.

56
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,140
 The star of this bridal shower, Ju Yu Jeong.

57
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,700
 Yu Jeong is the only daughter of the Yeongun Cultural Foundation chairman.

58
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,750
 She's the most considerate one in the group.

59
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,150
 Let's take a picture of the four of us.

60
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,490
 As a consequence of polio, her legs are a bit weak.

61
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,260
 Thank you.

62
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,490
 Congratulations!

63
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,540
 We were unstoppable.

64
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,410
 We're like a precious and special four-leaf clover when four of us are together.

65
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,400
 So we thought luck would always be on our side.

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,290
 Our friendship was perfect.

67
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:26,240
 Before... that incident happened that day.

68
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,350

69
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,080
You guys need to do a good job, so these ladies can have a blast.

70
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,170
 - We will.  
- Never mind that.

71
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,710
A blast, my foot.

72
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,330
We'd have to watch what we say and do.

73
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,810
You're watching us like a security camera. How could we have fun, Do Shik?

74
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,650
That's why...

75
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,930
You don't have to go.

76
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,130
Hae Mi was just joking.

77
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,080
I have to leave so you can have fun.

78
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,220
I'll stay put and wait for your call at home.

79
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,400
So have fun tonight.

80
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,950
- Is this okay?
 - Yes.

81
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,710
- Would you like some?
 - No, I'm okay.

82
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,960
- Let me pour you some.
 - No, it's okay.

83
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,880
- You must have a trial tomorrow.
 - Yeah.

84
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,890
Public defenders never get a day off.

85
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,740
They have at least 70 trials a month.

86
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,460
All of the 70 cases are very important to me.

87
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,870
Yes, fight for justice today, too.

88
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll behave badly today.

89
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,440
A lot of people are watching.

90
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,730
Should we get out of here?

91
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,950
Hae Mi!

92
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,980
Hae Mi!

93
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,970
Let me get it.

94
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,720
Okay.

95
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,600

96
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,430
Did you say you'll go to Switzerland for your honeymoon?

97
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,310
Yes, we'll stop by France, too.

98
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,080
You're going overboard.

99
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,060
Give it to me.

100
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,960
Give you what?

101
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,030
Will you still deny it?

102
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,930
I didn't bring it today.

103
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,620
We were told that you're all innocent.

104
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,410
Are you cheeky because you do drugs?

105
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,540
Get out if you don't have it!

106
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,570
Watch your mouth.

107
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,600
Who should I call?

108
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,030
What's wrong?

109
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,820
I saw it.

110
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,190
The text from Do Shik.

111
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,810
Were you... talking to Do Shik behind Yu Jeong's back?

112
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,950
Or why would Do Shik invite you to a hotel room?

113
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,530
How am I supposed to know?

114
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,840
He must've gone crazy doing drugs.

115
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,510
What?

116
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Does Do Shik do drugs?

117
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,760
What I meant is...

118
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,620
Yes! It's true.

119
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,940
That asshole is an addict.

120
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,450
H-How did you find out?

121
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,110
It must be a secret Yu Jeong doesn't even know about.

122
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,420
How did you find out? Won't you tell me?

123
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,480
Fine. I'll go ask him myself.

124
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,000
It's Suite 2401, right?

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,890
Do Jae Yi! Earlier you saw how happy Yu Jeong was.

126
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,040
Do you want to ruin it?

127
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,290
That's right, Yu Jeong.

128
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,750
I should talk to her before I talk to Do Shik.

129
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,350
She should at least know what her fiancé goes around doing.

130
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,630
Isn't that right?

131
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,760
Jae Yi!

132
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,800
 Jae Yi!

133
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,430
Do Shik... does drugs?

134
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,560
Hey!

135
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,800
Where did you go leaving me alone here?

136
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,530
I'm sorry, but could you give us some space?

137
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,170
We have something to talk about.

138
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,450
Yu Jeong.

139
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,020
Do Shik...

140
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,350
Do Jae Yi, will you really...

141
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,390
Hold on.

142
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,970
It moved!

143
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,060
It moved for the first time!

144
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,840
Are you...

145
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,360
Yes.

146
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,620
I'm pregnant.

147
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,990
It's been four months.

148
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,820
They said I have to be careful until it stabilizes.

149
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,180
So I didn't tell you.

150
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,680
The baby must've been happy today, too.

151
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,710
It moved just now.

152
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,980
You can't believe it, right?

153
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,530
I can't believe it, either.

154
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,350
I'm becoming a mom.

155
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,850
Congratulate me, Jae Yi!

156
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,170
Congratulate me, guys!

157
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,510
I'm so happy.

158
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,350
I think I'd die from happiness.

159
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,070
Yes!

160
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,810
Congratulations, Yu Jeong!

161
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,270
What did I tell you? You're just pretending to be innocent!

162
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,420
You were acting innocent, but you got pregnant first.

163
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
Hey, come on.

164
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,630
Let's have a toast.

165
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,340
Ju Yu Jeong is becoming a mom!

166
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,340
Congratulations, Yu Jeong.

167
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,230
Thank you.

168
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,760
Congratulate her, too.

169
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,790
It's a happy occasion.

170
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,690
Yes.

171
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,940
Congratulations, Yu Jeong.

172
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,430
Thank you, Jae Yi.

173
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,520
Congratulations!

174
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,060
- Congrats.
 - Thank you.

175
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,380
Thank you so much for today, girls!

176
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,060
I'll get going now. Get home safely.

177
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,490
Bye! See you.

178
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,380
Bye.

179
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,640
Well...

180
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,790
I'll get going, too.

181
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,410
My driver arrived at the parking lot.

182
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,000
- I'll get going.
 - Okay, bye.

183
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,980
You came?

184
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,650

185
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,860

186
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,970
 Last night, a man was killed at Grand Kangbo Hotel.

187
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,300
 The victim is Assembly Gi Yoon Chul's son, Gi Do Shik.

188
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
 The security camera at Grand Kangbo Hotel went missing

189
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,660
 and no evidence regarding the murder weapon was found.

190
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,460
 The police are having a hard time finding a suspect.

191
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,790
 While investigating the murder of Gi Do Shik, Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul's son,

192
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,000
 the police arrested four women as the prime suspects.

193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,010
 They're close friends with each other

194
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,560
 and had a party at a members-only bar in the hotel basement on the day of the incident.

195
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,110
Ms. Ju Yu Jeong.

196
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,150
I heard you're the first one who found Mr. Gi's body.

197
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,220
Did it happen while you two were fighting, by chance?

198
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,020
 I want to kill you.

199
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,450
 Go ahead, you idiot!

200
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,600
I... am pregnant with his child.

201
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,220
Ms. Yoon Hae Mi.

202
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,930
- You went to that room! The evidence is right here!
  - Shut up, bitch!

203
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,410
Ms. Do Jae Yi.

204
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,110
Did you drink with Mr. Gi?

205
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,340
Did you get into a fight?

206
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,610
Ms. Do!

207
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,960
You did this, didn't you?

208
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,400
You stabbed him like this!

209
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,350
What is it?

210
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,570
You found the real culprit?

211
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,750
 The suspect in the murder of Gi Do Shik, Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul's son, was found.

212
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,410
 The suspect is Go, a 32-year-old woman who works in the entertainment business.

213
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,660
 She resented the fact that Mr. Gi is marrying someone else...

214
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,370

215
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,050
Hey, Go Yoo Na!

216
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,880
Excuse me, could we talk to her for a moment?

217
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,540
Go ahead.

218
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,880
Did you...

219
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,470
Did you really kill him?

220
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,700
Did you really kill Gi Do Shik?

221
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,200
I heard you were a fake college student.

222
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,720
And you weren't a fashion designer, but a hostess at a bar.

223
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,090
How many years have you been lying to us?

224
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,390
Forget it. Just tell us.

225
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:49,310
Is it also true that... you sold us to Gi Do Shik?

226
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,670
Can you call yourself a human?

227
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,110
If you are, how could you─

228
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,230
Hae Mi. Let's just go.

229
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,730
This is too much for me.

230
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,620
Is that why...

231
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,670
Is that why this happened?

232
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,320
Is that why I ended up like this?

233
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,070
How could...

234
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,060
How could this happen? How?

235
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,120
But we're still friends.

236
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,750
We used to be friends!

237
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,000
Yu Jeong!

238
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
Come this way.

239
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,180
Take her away.

240
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,600
Let go of me! Let go!

241
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,110
Yu Jeong!

242
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,610
Yu Jeong!

243
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,530
I didn't do it!

244
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,280
Hey! Yu Jeong!

245
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,200
Yu Jeong!

246
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,900
You know I didn't do it!

247
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,950
You guys know that!

248
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,980
I didn't do it!

249
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,390
It's not me!

250
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,120

251
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,980
Did he wear a mask?

252
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,160
Yes. He wore...

253
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,180
a mask... when my boss raped me.

254
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,280
What kind of mask?

255
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,060
What color was it?

256
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,150
Did it have something written in English, by chance?

257
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,720
You're Attorney Do Jae Yi, right?

258
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,780
You're so famous.

259
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,540
I'm grateful that you're representing me,

260
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,550
but I won't make an appeal.

261
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,260
There's no reason to talk about it.

262
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,770
You're brave enough to die, but you're not brave enough to fight?

263
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,780
What am I supposed to do?

264
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,160
No one would listen to me.

265
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,850
No one would believe me!

266
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,160
It's better to just die.

267
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,250
 How foolish.

268
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,550
 Dying doesn't reveal the truth.

269
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,600
If...

270
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,580
I believed you, would you be able to talk about it?

271
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,430
Why do you believe me?

272
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,730
Because I can see

273
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,840
the injustice you faced in your eyes.

274
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,890
Will you let him live a normal life after what he did to you?

275
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,130
I can do it.

276
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:57,380
I'll tell the whole world about how disgusting of a man he is!

277
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,420
I can do it.

278
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:31,080
 I... was the secretary of CEO Kim Man Bok of Daesoon Apparel.

279
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,630
 He gave me a coffee that day.

280
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,830
I realized as soon as I drank it

281
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,630
 that something was wrong.

282
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:04,350
I lost consciousness and when I opened my eyes again,

283
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,940
 Mr. Kim was wearing a hideous mask

284
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,100
and was on top of me.

285
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,390
And... he ended up...

286
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,850
By chance,

287
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,320
do you remember what color the mask was?

288
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,860
I think it was white.

289
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,900
Did it have the letter "A" written on it, by chance?

290
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,020
I'm not sure.

291
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
I was so scared,

292
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,970
so I kept my eyes closed.

293
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,490
Attorney Do.

294
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,160
I remember other things too vividly.

295
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,790
That grotesque moaning, and the gross sound of his breathing.

296
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,740
And the creepy touches.

297
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,270
I'm so scared.

298
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,370
I still feel like I'd die from fear.

299
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,860
But Mr. Kim said he did that because I liked him.

300
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,910
He said that I was a gold digger, and he even sued me for blackmailing.

301
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,390
How could something like this happen?

302
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,280
How could...

303
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,100
Where did he get that mask?

304
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,680
It's his wife's.

305
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,260
His wife's?

306
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,050
It's from a members-only bar his wife used to frequent.

307
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,270
Kim Man Bok said that to the police.

308
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,380
We need to go to that members-only bar.

309
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,740
Also, Manager.

310
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,660
I want you to look into Kim Man Bok's wife.

311
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,160
Find out as much as possible.

312
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:44,600

313
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,550

314
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,050

315
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,070
Excuse me, Team Leader Song Je Hyeok!

316
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,740
This isn't a charity organization. It's a cultural foundation!

317
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,440
You spend more money on the orphanage than the amount

318
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,720
we spend on cultural events. We can't be doing that!

319
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,050
Letting the children who are devoid of culture find their artistic potential

320
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,470
- could help the foundation's future─
 - Stop.

321
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,190
Foundation's future, my foot.

322
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,980
Do only orphans have artistic potential?

323
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,790
- You're pouring water into a cracked jar─
 - That's enough!

324
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,880
I completely understand your point.

325
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,970
We'll make a decision soon.

326
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,990
Let's end the meeting here today.

327
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,880
Team Leader Song, stay back for a moment.

328
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,000
Team Leader.

329
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,350
I think the Director has a point.

330
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,690
Since you joined the foundation,

331
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,700
too much of our budget has been going to the orphanage─

332
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,550
I can't always be a shield for you.

333
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,290
So please tell the director—

334
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,830
Team Leader, please leave.

335
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,150
Team Leader.

336
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,730
You don't need stuff like this when you're with me.

337
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,380
Don't be nervous. Relax.

338
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,950
Team Leader.

339
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,520
We agreed... not to do this before the wedding.

340
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,840
Yeah, Hae Mi!

341
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,260
Yes, the wedding dress fitting?

342
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,770
We should ask about Jae Yi's schedule, too.

343
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,720
Yes, she's the busiest. We should let her decide.

344
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,810
It has to be after her trial on the 13th.

345
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,020
How do I know when her trial is?

346
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,060
She broadcasts everything live on her social media.

347
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,940
She's a total celebrity.

348
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,490
 Noona! The food is ready. Come cure your hangover.

349
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,480
Yes, I'm still home.

350
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,660
I did a tasting for the new whiskeys we got at the hotel lounge.

351
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,860
So I drank all night.

352
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,020
Let's talk in person. Okay!

353
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,080
Looks so good!

354
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,100
This smell.

355
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,650
It's probably spicier than usual.

356
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,680
I put two chilies in it.

357
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,190
Is Noona Yu Jeon's wedding two months away now?

358
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,610
Yes. That spinster is making such a fuss about it.

359
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,790
Even I have to get a dress as a bridesmaid.

360
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,690
Wow, is the groom that impressive?

361
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,640
She's so shy, but she's making such a fuss about it.

362
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,340
I saw him once. Jae Yi didn't.

363
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:55,020
He's a teacher at an orphanage. Don't you get the picture?

364
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,710
I'd better make sure I look amazing in the suit.

365
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,480
I won't embarrass you as Mariela Hotel's vice president and Yoon Hae Mi's husband.

366
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,380
This is why I married you.

367
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,710
Your head is filled with positive thoughts.

368
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,910
It's like a flower field.

369
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,620
My head is filled with poison.

370
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,020
Noona, by chance...

371
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,100
Don't worry. I promised you when we got married that I won't do it.

372
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,070
Noona.

373
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,550
You can't do drugs. You know that, right?

374
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,980
You should get me addicted, then.

375
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,180
Don't do it.

376
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,800
Give me something stronger.

377
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,330
Like what?

378
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,020
Something like this.

379
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,100
Right now?

380
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,730
Hey! My phone!

381
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,390
I need to answer it!

382
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,460
Whoa! I can't believe Jae Yi is calling me.

383
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,080
Stop!

384
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,170
Hey, Jae Yi! How did you find the time to call?

385
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,100
Leo?

386
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,750
He's next to me. Hold On.

387
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,920
Aigoo, super celebrity attorney, Do Jae Yi. What's up?

388
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,810
Yes.

389
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,680
Of course, there's no address online.

390
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,880
It's such an exclusive club.

391
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,450
Why?

392
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,370
Did you want to have fun tonight?

393
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,920
♫  Dark desires hiding behind a mask  ♫

394
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,400
♫  They're liars  ♫

395
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,850
♫  The truth is completely hidden behind a curtain  ♫

396
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:23,980
♫  My glamorous image is a scenario covering your eyes  ♫

397
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:30,260
♫  Behind tears drawn red, there is just cold forgotten scar  ♫

398
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,790
♫  Oh, now, oh, now  ♫

399
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,680
♫  The curtain rises  ♫

400
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,360
♫  and will reveal everything  ♫

401
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,020
♫  Spotlight  ♫

402
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,400
♫  Spotlight the truth beneath the door of closely guarded secrets  ♫

403
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,070
Congratulations on sending that gold digger to jail.

404
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,570
Congratulations, my foot.

405
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,820
You should be punished if you commit a crime.

406
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,590
You're seriously a saint.

407
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,100
If my husband does something like that,

408
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,350
I'll definitely divorce him, no matter how wealthy he is.

409
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,060
Look. Isn't that her?

410
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,760
It's her, right? Attorney Do Jae Yi.

411
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,820
Welcome. What would you like?

412
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,320
Actually, could I have a look at your mask?

413
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,040
Yes, ma'am.

414
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
This isn't it.

415
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,400
What is it?

416
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,910
Nothing.

417
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:38,390
Anyway, why do you wear a mask like this?

418
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,850
It's a concept.

419
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,900
Could you give this to me?

420
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,200
- It would be an honor.
 - Thank you.

421
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,830
I'll have a blue.

422
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,320
What kind of lawyer is that pretty?

423
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,760
Do you know who her dermatologist is?

424
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,450
What an impressive watch. I wonder what brand it is.

425
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,340
I don't know the brand,

426
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,510
but I bet my wrist that it's as expensive as a house.

427
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,830
I bet my ankle.

428
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,580
- You don't have any ankles.
 - Hey!

429
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,800
Excuse me, could you watch my purse?

430
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,410
Sure.

431
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,110

432
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,610

433
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,810

434
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,000

435
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,470
Defense.

436
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,350
The reason for appeal says you found the key evidence

437
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,210
that the plaintiff sexually assaulted the defendant.

438
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,580
Yes.

439
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,850
As you know, there was no security camera nor any eyewitnesses.

440
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,140
For a crime that took place in an enclosed space with only the defendant and the plaintiff,

441
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,600
the testimonies from the parties involved are the most crucial.

442
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,990
I acquired an audio file of the plaintiff Kim Man Bok confessing to

443
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,800
raping Defendant Kim Eun Ok.

444
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,620
I confessed?

445
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,880
Objection.

446
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,910
The defendant is mocking the court by using evidence that doesn't exist.

447
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,670
Let's hear it first and decide.

448
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,940
Let's hear it.

449
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,130
 You must've been embarrassed to do that while showing your face, huh?

450
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,460
 Since you stole my mask and wore it.

451
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,500
 I didn't wear the mask out of embarrassment.

452
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,280
 I wore it for fun.

453
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,050
 Kim Eun Ok must have trembled in fear

454
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,550
 seeing me in the mask.

455
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,410
 I felt so sorry for her that I almost let her go!

456
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,790
 You son of a bitch!

457
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,690
 Why do you have to force yourself on someone?

458
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,280
 Is it an illness?

459
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,510
 I only have fun when it's forced.

460
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,930
 I subdue them when they try to fight me like this!

461
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,310
As you heard, the plaintiff clearly admitted

462
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,940
that the defendant didn't consent to the intercourse

463
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,500
and the fact that he forced her to do it.

464
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,620
Objection!

465
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,510
I don't know how she recorded this,

466
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,310
but it was done illegally without the plaintiff's consent.

467
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,400
- It has no power in court.
 - That's not true.

468
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,330
The plaintiff's wife, Choi Bo Mi, who participated in this conversation,

469
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,690
recorded it herself and gave it to me.

470
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,610
It is a legally acquired file.

471
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,880
I recorded that and gave it to you?

472
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,020
Don't you remember? It was at the bar in Cheongdam-dong.

473
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,310
You said even your husband must be punished if he commits a crime.

474
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,910
And you borrowed my watch that records audio.

475
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,310
 - Kleptomania?
 - Yes.

476
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,630
 Choi Bo Mi has Kleptomania caused by stress.

477
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,120
 She's particularly obsessed with watches.

478
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,300
 Could I have a glass of water?

479
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,980
If you didn't borrow it, why do you have my watch?

480
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,320
Did you... steal it, by chance?

481
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,390
N-N-No!

482
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:48,330
Steal? Who do you think I am?

483
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,550
Ms. Choi Bo Mi.

484
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,200
Your answer will decide if the recording qualifies as evidence or not.

485
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,120
Please be clear.

486
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,760
Did you record your conversation with the plaintiff yourself?

487
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,040
Hey.

488
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,440
Say that you stole it and go to jail.

489
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,340
Otherwise, I'll end up going, you thieving bitch.

490
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,970
T-Thieving bitch?

491
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,770
How do you think I ended up in this mess?

492
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,050
Your Honor!

493
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:27,200
It is true that I recorded the conversation by borrowing the watch from the defense attorney.

494
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,150
Rapist bastard. F*** you!

495
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:43,230
You're on a winning streak by winning this case today.

496
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,280
Is there a secret to your unbreakable winning streak?

497
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,250
How could there be a secret like that?

498
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,840
I just listen to the truth told by the powerless people who faced injustice.

499
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,920
On social media, people are saying you should work for the National Assembly.

500
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,900
Are you possibly interested in politics?

501
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,210

502
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,950
It smells amazing!

503
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,190
There are 13 sets of ribs in a cow.

504
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:16,520
You are looking at ribs No. 6, 7, and 8.

505
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,810
And the covering part is called short ribs.

506
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,980
The reason why people say these ribs are the tastiest

507
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,860
is because these parts never move unless you make the cow stretch.

508
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,960
So, they're very tender.

509
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,090
I think people are the same.

510
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,950
Rather than being too tense and living a busy life,

511
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:38,760
just like beef ribs No. 6, 7, and 8,

512
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:44,620
living idly sometimes could bring flavor to our lives.

513
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,980
Go inside. Your friends are here.

514
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,740
Okay.

515
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,100
To Assemblywoman Do Jae Yi!

516
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,220
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

517
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,120
We didn't have to get champagne.

518
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,980
It hasn't been decided yet.

519
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,030
It's not just any other assemblyman.

520
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:16,680
If the nomination committee chairman wanted to see you, it's for sure!

521
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,020
Did you say Tongju? Where you live?

522
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,260
You always looked forward to general elections.

523
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,370
You finally realized your dream, Jae Yi.

524
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,260
You're so impressive.

525
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,080
The reason I invited you here wasn't to celebrate with me.

526
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,090
I wanted to ask you to help me if I do get nominated.

527
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:40,190
I really need to seize this opportunity.

528
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,590
Of course! What matters to you matters to us, too.

529
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,150
Hey! Don't ignore us after you become an assemblywoman.

530
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,270
We contributed to your success, too.

531
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,690
Of course, you did.

532
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,200
Do you need anything else?

533
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,690
Everything is great, Kang Hoo.

534
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,970
We won't charge you for the drinks, so order a lot of food.

535
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,290
I have a business to run.

536
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,960
He's so transparent.

537
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,430
You think I wouldn't know what you're thinking?

538
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,800
What is he thinking?

539
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,510
If it's business, he should charge us for drinks.

540
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,650
Do you know how much this is?

541
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,910
He's telling Jae Yi to eat,

542
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,810
because he's concerned about her health.

543
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,030
Aigoo, come on!

544
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,610
Enough is enough!

545
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:31,130
If you just flirt too long, it gets tiring!

546
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,150
Hey! What do you mean, flirt?

547
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,990
Kang Hoo is Yoo Na's ex-boyfriend!

548
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:38,020
How could he and Jae Yi─

549
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,350
Who cares? That was forever ago.

550
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,230
But Yoo Na is an exception. It's no good.

551
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,540
Yoo Na is... Not Go Yoo Na!

552
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,430
I found it while cleaning the house.

553
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,030
Hey!

554
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,640
Throw it away! It's disgusting!

555
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,510
Why? If I cut out Yoo Na, it's still a nice memory for us!

556
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:08,400
Since that day, have we laughed comfortably like this in the last decade?

557
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:13,430
Yu Jeong went to work even on the day her parents passed away.

558
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:16,140
And I couldn't rest a single day until I became

559
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,630
the VP of that hotel filled with elite families.

560
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,520
Especially you, Jae Yi...

561
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,560
Being an attorney sounds nice, but you've been working like a dog.

562
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,780
Why did we live like that? Hm?

563
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:36,810
We needed to be successful to forget that horrible memory!

564
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,090
I finally was able to heal since I met Leo.

565
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,100
Yu Jeong got better since she met Je Hyeok, too.

566
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:53,290
If Kang Hoo helps you heal, you should hang onto him!

567
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,550
Forget about who his ex-girlfriend was.

568
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:06,750
I can smile brightly like this, too...

569
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,290
if I become an assemblywoman.

570
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:15,440
So, please put up with me until then.

571
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,990
I'm almost there.

572
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,590
Almost.

573
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:28,060

574
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,510
Come in.

575
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,650
Attorney Do, say hello.

576
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:55,580
Assemblyman Kim Joong Ho, the nomination committee chair of the Junghan Party.

577
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,310
Hello, I'm Do Jae Yi.

578
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,610
Welcome! Nice to meet you.

579
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,770
My gosh! Seriously.

580
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,740
Sit there, Attorney Do.

581
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,110
Sit next to the Chairman.

582
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:38,320
I like salty foods.

583
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,020
I heard you wanted to see me.

584
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,470
From what I heard from Sunbae, the mayor of Tongju is

585
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:47,600
benefitting from the nomination committee of this general election.

586
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,390
Attorney Do, you're so impatient.

587
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,650
Why bring up work as soon as you sit down?

588
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:53,030
Sir.

589
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:56,550
She has always been snooty since she was in college.

590
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:00,890
What are you doing? Pour him a drink first.

591
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:06,790
May I ask you to pour me a drink, snooty Attorney Do?

592
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,490
What are you doing right now?

593
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,850
I'm suggesting flipping the script.

594
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,450
I was trying to tolerate you. Are you crazy?

595
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:30,290
You become a hero if you cut the enemy's leader's throat with the sword you've been given,

596
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:34,110
but you become a butcher if you cut the pig's throat.

597
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:38,510
You shouldn't use your power so cheaply.

598
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,960
What? Cheaply?

599
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,390
You two should enjoy your drinks.

600
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:46,170
I'll see myself out.

601
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,600
What? She's a nutcase!

602
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,030
What are you doing?

603
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:00,600
Do you know how difficult it was to arrange this?

604
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,280
I already heard everything!

605
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,860
I heard I was already excluded as a nominee in the internal review

606
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,930
because my base within the party is weak.

607
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,370
You were never interested in nominating me,

608
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,820
but you wanted to get the snooty and arrogant Attorney Do

609
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,980
to pour you a drink using the nomination as an excuse, weren't you?

610
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,590
Jae Yi, this is how you get into politics!

611
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,570
You meet people, build connections, show up,

612
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,640
and pour drinks, too!

613
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,580
Is this the only election? How about four years later?

614
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,560
Four years later?

615
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,550
Do you think I'll get a chance four years later?

616
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:41,350
I can't afford to wait that long...

617
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,820
Aigoo! Hello!

618
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,430
Assemblyman Kim Chul!

619
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,750
- Aigoo!
 - Hello.

620
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,950
Long time no see.

621
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,200
What brings you here, sir?

622
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,970
I'm here to eat. What else?

623
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:23,670

624
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,000
 Is it you, Honey?

625
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,390
Hey, hey! Wait! Shit.

626
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,160
Did you do it again?

627
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,430
Did Dad send you again?

628
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,430
I didn't do it, okay?

629
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,190
Why are you going in there now?

630
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,740
- Are you crazy right now?
 - Hey!

631
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,250
I told you!

632
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,510
You'll go to jail if you get caught one more time.

633
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:19,290
Why would I go to jail?

634
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,470
I have you.

635
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:25,470
Don't you think, Attorney Do Jae Yi?

636
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,640
Shut up.

637
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,830
Follow me without saying a word.

638
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,820
Right now?

639
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,530
Just like that?

640
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,540
Since you ate, you should cut yourself again.

641
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,080
I found your son and brought him back home.

642
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,400
I understand you're upset, but why do you let it out like this?

643
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,880
You eat like crazy, and cut yourself.

644
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,030
You eat like crazy, and you cut yourself again.

645
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,740
It's none of your business.

646
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,290
If you cut your wrist again, I can't stop the press from revealing it.

647
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,130
You're still the wife of a mayor of a city.

648
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:36,260
If they find out about your self-harm, reporters will show up.

649
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,980
Stop eating now.

650
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,900
Don't throw up all night like last time.

651
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,940
Acting high and mighty.

652
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:00,960
Should I reveal your true side in front of people?

653
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,290
Should I tell them what the righteous Attorney Do does secretly?

654
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:13,170
You do dirty work for this dysfunctional family

655
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,960
and collect money for doing it, you trash.

656
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,100
If it gets out, would I be the only one f***ed?

657
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:28,080
Your beloved son will go to jail.

658
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,010
I have all the evidence that he's an addict.

659
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:35,220
Should I give you a piece of advice while we're at it?

660
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,600
If I hated my husband for cheating on me, I wouldn't cut my own wrist.

661
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,420
I would cut him using that knife.

662
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,570
You have no self-respect.

663
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,890
Hey!

664
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,750
Thank you.

665
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,310
This is so good.

666
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:07,570
I'm full.

667
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,570
I should get going.

668
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,400
Why...

669
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,200
I have a lot of things to do.

670
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,980
Take it. It's cold outside.

671
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:25,160
Take this, too.

672
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,400
What is this?

673
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,880
Use it when you make ramen at home.

674
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,030
It'll make it tastier.

675
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,690
I don't want it.

676
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,580
I'll eat my ramen here.

677
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,490
I'm off.

678
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,000
Thank you for the meal.

679
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,400

680
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:32,770

681
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,350
Yes, Manager.

682
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:45,810
I'm sorry to wake you up.

683
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,250
I thought you needed to hear this.

684
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,130
It's okay.

685
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,160
Talk to me.

686
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,740
 It's about Mayor Jung Goo Tae.

687
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,340
Answer me, Mayor.

688
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:09,490
Why did you reject the minister position?

689
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:18,400
The opposition party is digging up dirt on me to screw me over!

690
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,130
Including my love life, the fact that my wife is crazy,

691
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:25,130
and the fact that my son is an addict, too!

692
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:30,000
If something goes wrong, I will get humiliated during the confirmation hearing.

693
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,490
Forget the minister position. I'd end up kicked out of this lowly mayor position!

694
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,180
You're lying.

695
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:41,820
I managed all of your shameful flaws and there haven't been any problems all this time.

696
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,780
Not even once!

697
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,980
By chance,

698
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,130
are you having a different issue?

699
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,560
A reason you can't give up on Tongju?

700
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,300
Come on, there's no such thing!

701
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,720
Accept the minister position, then!

702
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:05,350
Otherwise, I'll tell the opposition party all about your secrets.

703
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:09,990
So you get kicked out of this lowly mayor position.

704
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:23,290
Attorney Do.

705
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:26,920
Why do you keep trying to make me a minister?

706
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,990
What could you get out of it if I became a minister?

707
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,590
If you become a minister,

708
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:40,120
I'll become... the mayor of Tongju.

709
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,780
What?

710
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,520
Mayor of Tongju?

711
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,720
So you mean, for making Mayor Jung Goo Tae a minister,

712
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,060
you asked him to give you the mayor position in return?

713
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:01,460
Wow! You charged a lot for your service!

714
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,490
But will Mayor Jung

715
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,360
pass the confirmation hearing?

716
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:12,200
You took care of his personal life,

717
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,540
but that he has so much land in Tongju might be a problem.

718
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:22,590
Excuse me, could you please leave us alone?

719
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:29,760
Jung Goo Tae has been buying land in the military district of Tongju

720
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,620
 little by little since five years ago.

721
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:35,230
 Just as you said, it's a bit of a problem.

722
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:38,600
He bought it with a slush fund from sponsorships and whatnot.

723
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:44,000
But he'll donate this land to your foundation before the confirmation hearing.

724
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,010
All of his properties are gone.

725
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:47,820
How could that be controversial?

726
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:53,840
 This is like an answer sheet for the possible questions from the opposition party.

727
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,170
 I made sure you could dodge anything legally.

728
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:59,230
 So just answer as written here.

729
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:02,010
 Thank you for making me a minister.

730
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,760
 Also, keep that promise.

731
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,090
 You'll take care of the land while I'm gone, okay?

732
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:10,080
If so, using that land─

733
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,250
You can make an arts and culture village.

734
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,760
If I become the mayor,

735
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,930
I'll turn that village into a metropolis.

736
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,380
Jae Yi!

737
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,610
That's so amazing!

738
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,270
Hold on.

739
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:27,700
Jae Yi, you'd become the mayor, and Yu Jeong will create an art village.

740
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:31,120
What about me? Am I an outcast?

741
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,370
For Tongju to become a city for arts and culture,

742
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,060
what would be needed?

743
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,240
Accommodation?

744
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,930
What if we create a cool hanok* hotel?
  (Korean traditional house)

745
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:41,970
Hanok hotel!

746
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:47,790

747
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,750
 Today, Chairman Ju Yu Jeong of Yeongun Cultural Foundation

748
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:56,290
 started a promotion committee for building the arts and culture village in Tongju City

749
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:58,760
 and signed the donation agreement.

750
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,420
 For the ceremony, Jung Goo Tae, Mayor of Tongju,

751
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,630
 and Yoon Hae Mi, the VP of Mariela Hotel, were there.

752
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:09,290
 Mayor Yoon agreed to donate 50,000 pyung of land he personally owned in Gongbok-dong

753
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:14,990
 and VP Yoon Hae Mi agreed to donate 10 billion won (~$7.4 million).

754
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:19,260

755
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:22,260
There's no glass ceiling in our future, right?

756
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,060
Let's break it together!

757
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,030
For that to happen,

758
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,650
you should be prepared to sacrifice a bit.

759
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,840
You must've had a good time with your friends while dress-fitting.

760
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,260
Right.

761
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,730
What was it, a bridal shower?

762
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,270
I heard people do that a lot these days.

763
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:08,200
- If you want to do that─
 - No.

764
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,460
I don't want to do that.

765
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:19,100
I'm getting married late. There's no need to do that.

766
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,710
By the way, I need to tell you something.

767
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:30,530
What is it?

768
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,240
Our orphanage in Tongju.

769
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,760
I think we need to close it down.

770
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:49,340
The arts and culture village I'll be building with Jae Yi and Hae Mi

771
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:53,160
will be in the military district where the orphanage is in.

772
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:59,090
Mayor Jung Goo Tae donated that land to our foundation.

773
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:02,030
How could I just do nothing?

774
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:13,800
Get rid of the orphanage to build the arts and culture village?

775
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,830
I know

776
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:21,370
how much you love that orphanage.

777
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,690
But...

778
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:27,640
I really need to take on that project.

779
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,810
So our foundation will be in a better financial situation.

780
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,180
Let's do that, then.

781
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,530
You own the orphanage anyway.

782
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:48,260
Once our financial situation improves,

783
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:52,360
I'll make sure to build you a better orphanage somewhere else.

784
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,000
I promise, okay?

785
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:07,870
Harder?

786
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:10,050
That's still too weak?

787
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:14,960
You want me to go harder?

788
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,800
Whoa!

789
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,850

790
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:26,770
 How much money do you need?

791
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,420
 I think I need about 10 billion won.

792
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:32,550
 I'm giving up on the hanok hotel you planned to build in Gyeongju

793
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,740
 and am investing in this instead.

794
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:38,200
 You know what will happen if this fails, right?

795
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:46,310
You scared me!

796
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:47,920
You should've said it was too strong!

797
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,170
I kept going harder because you didn't answer me.

798
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:54,460
Sorry. I was thinking a bit.

799
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,250
About what? Did the Chairman pressure you?

800
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,970
Did he tell you to take responsibility if the new project fails?

801
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:05,430
Is my brain in my foot?

802
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:08,430
Can you read my mind when you rub my feet?

803
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:09,850
Noona.

804
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,750
You used to come to me whenever you were stressed at work.

805
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:16,970
I can tell immediately just by seeing your face now.

806
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:20,350
Yes, you were my only sanctuary.

807
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:25,040
Being comforted by you won't take care of it this time.

808
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,760
I might get fired if this goes wrong.

809
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,170
What should I do with you if I become poor?

810
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,320
What are you talking about?

811
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:44,210
They say when poverty comes in through the door, love goes out the window.

812
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:48,130
It's obvious what would happen to us if I got fired.

813
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,930
Why are you suddenly getting serious?

814
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:59,700
Don't worry! I'll take care of it.

815
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,810
You trust me, right?

816
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:06,120
Won't you answer me?

817
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,310
I trust you, Noona!

818
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,400
Just go easy a bit!

819
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,470
- It hurt.
 - Okay, I'll go easy.

820
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:17,570
- Be gentle.
 - Yes, I'll go easy.

821
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,030
That's it.

822
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:27,080
- Long time no see!
 - Oh, hello!

823
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,180
- It looks good.
 - It really does.

824
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:32,060
- I'll see you later.
 - See you.

825
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,660
Aigoo, hello.

826
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:38,460
Nice to meet you.

827
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,120
Attorney Do! Hello.

828
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,070
Nice to meet you.

829
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:51,660
Congratulations, Jae Yi.

830
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:54,140
Congratulations, the future mayor of Tongju.

831
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:57,540
This event is for Mayor Jung Goo Tae.

832
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,980
Let's focus.

833
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,090
Everyone,

834
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:11,390

835
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,810
tomorrow,

836
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:16,130
I finally...

837
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,010
I finally will become a minister!

838
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:32,630
I'm from a small town and all I had was a pair of you-know-what.

839
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:35,840
If I didn't have my supporters who are

840
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,460
here right now, it would've been impossible for me

841
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,840
to become the minister.

842
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,290
Everyone.

843
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:50,330
Thank you, thank you so much!

844
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,700
Also, since I became the minister,

845
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:01,420
the new mayor of Tongju will be elected.

846
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,990
As my successor,

847
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:10,000
I'd like to recommend my fellow soldier in my battle-like political career.

848
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,820
I'm...

849
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:18,360
proposing Attorney Do Jae Yi sitting over there.

850
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,160
Attorney Do,

851
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,480
please come up here.

852
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,580
Come up here!

853
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,130
A round of applause!

854
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,750
Everyone!

855
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:45,870
Please support and help

856
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,910
Attorney Do Jae Yi, so she can become

857
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:53,650
the new mayor of Tongju City!

858
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:58,120
I earnestly ask for your support.

859
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:10,080
Do Jae Yi for the mayor of Tongju!

860
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,420
 Mayor of Tongju!

861
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,990
Do Jae Yi for the mayor of Tongju!

862
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,530
 Mayor of Tongju!

863
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:21,510
Do Jae Yi for the mayor of Tongju!

864
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,590
Jae Yi!

865
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,700
Jae Yi!

866
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,360
What if...

867
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:43,110
What would happen to us if Jung Goo Tae died?

868
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:46,990
He hasn't donated that land, using the confirmation hearing as an excuse.

869
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:49,590
Hey. He's dying right now.

870
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:52,680
- We can't talk about that─
 - Without that land...

871
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,490
I'll die, too.

872
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:59,740
Do you think I'd be fine?

873
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:04,100
I have already used so much investment money for that village.

874
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,360
Do you not care if he dies or not?

875
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,720
Whether he becomes the minister or dies, he'd be leaving anyway.

876
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:23,090
 My term ends after a year, anyway.

877
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:28,600
 Why not take over, then? Why rush to become the mayor just for a year?

878
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:34,350
 Even going through the trouble of making me a minister.

879
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:41,520
The reason I wanted to become the mayor of Tongju was because of that land.

880
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,680
You have a plan, right?

881
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,790
The way to get that land even if he dies.

882
01:15:58,050 --> 01:15:59,980
If...

883
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,540
If Mayor Jung really dies...

884
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,400
Patient Jung Goo Tae died during the surgery.

885
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,120
- My gosh!
 - How could this happen?

886
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:27,890
Regarding inheritance,

887
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:30,620
- your son and I─ 
 - Inheritance?

888
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,780
Inheritance, my ass.

889
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:36,200
Get the hell out of here!

890
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,130
I don't want to see you. Get out.

891
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,560
I'll take good care of his funeral.

892
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:51,190
Take care of yourself.

893
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,480
Emily Go.

894
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:58,940
Do you know someone named Emily Go?

895
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,810
You should watch out for that bitch, too.

896
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:05,320
All of this happened because of that bitch.

897
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:36,440
All lives are like plants, and their glories are like flowers.

898
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,010
We are aware that we'd wilt and dry eventually,

899
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:45,610
but after they leave us, we can't help but feel sad.

900
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:50,420
But we should reflect on the things the plant and the flowers left,

901
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:54,210
and the fact that God led the soul of the deceased,

902
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:59,800
and on ourselves and think about those things.

903
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,510
How disappointing.

904
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:52,960
I wanted to see the end.

905
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:57,980
Who are you?

906
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,810
I'm Emily Go.

907
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:11,050
Are you guys more familiar with the other name?

908
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,560
Hello,

909
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,360
guys.

910
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,180
It's Yoo Na.

911
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,170
Go Yoo Na.

912
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,390
Have you been well?

913
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:39,410
Do Jae Yi.

914
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:18,580

915
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:27,550

916
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:30,370
 ~ Preview ~ 
Why do you think Yoo Na came?

917
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,120
 You... Why did you really come here?

918
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,700
 You don't like that I came, right?

919
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,500
 You're scared of me, aren't you?

920
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,950
 Go Yoo Na, that total psychopath!

921
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:41,790
 I'm just so scared!

922
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:45,110
 What if Yoo Na pokes around that case again─

923
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:46,360
 Then it's over.

924
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,480
 Are you out of your mind?

925
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:54,480
 Are you curious to hear about Yoo Na?

926
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,220
 Let them in.

927
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,820
 How dare you come here?

928
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,010
 No way!

929
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:03,500
 How does Yoo Na own that land? How?

930
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,490
 How will you get the land from Yoo Na, Emily Go, or whatever?

931
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:08,920
 - Does your wife know what you did? 
 - What business is it of yours?

932
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:13,680
 How much do you know about Song Je Hyeok, your future husband?

933
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,090
 I want you to kill someone.

934
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:19,900
 Just like how you killed Gi Do Shik at this very place.

935
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,510
♫  Here's my life  ♫

936
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,340
♫  Take a good look  ♫

937
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:28,030
♫  The truth you foresaw  ♫
