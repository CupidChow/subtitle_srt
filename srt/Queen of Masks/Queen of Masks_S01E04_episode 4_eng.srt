1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,200
Thank you so much for today, girls!

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,240
See you.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,570
I'll get going now. Get home safely.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,530

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,220
 I called your house, and they said you're not home.

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,950
 You're not picking up. Where are you?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,990

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,870
 Are you doing this again?

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,490
 You promised not to do this!

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,520
 I know where your secret hangout is. Just wait there.

11
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,980
Please go back to the Kangbo Hotel. Hurry!

12
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,010
 I couldn't tell her because Yu Jeong is apparently pregnant,

13
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,990
 but I think this is wrong.

14
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,500
 Where are you? Let's talk.

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,870
 Did you go to the hotel, by chance?

16
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,070
 Where are you? Let's meet.

17
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,540
 I'll tell you everything.

18
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,130
How did you know I was here?

19
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,620
Why? Am I not supposed to come here?

20
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,540
I'm your fiancée.

21
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,930
Do you think I don't know that you lied about going home,

22
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,400
and instead hanging out with women here all the time?

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,430
You had fun with those men today, too.

24
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,810
Let's just call it even!

25
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,320
I thought you would stop if I waited.

26
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,860
How could you do this even on a day like this?

27
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,360
Should we cancel the wedding?

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,550
I can easily marry someone else, if not you.

29
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,960
Someone normal.

30
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,600
I'll tell my parents everything.

31
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,150
That you're an addict and a thug.

32
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,530
Then, not just you but your dad would be finished, too!

33
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,500
How about you, who got pregnant by an addict, and a thug like me?

34
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,310
People think you're a proper lady, but...

35
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,560
Do you know what's in there?

36
00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:00,080
The proof that you're... very experienced in bed.

37
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,060
Did you film that?

38
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,020
Unless you want to humiliate your family, you should go home and get a good prenatal education.

39
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,690
Let's hope you don't give birth to an idiot like you.

40
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,730
I want to kill you!

41
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,960
Go ahead, then.

42
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,600
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me, you idiot!

43
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,950

44
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,450
Je Hyeok has a daughter.

45
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,760
Her name is Na Na.

46
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,290
She's turning four now.

47
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,150
Did you just find out?

48
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,720
It's true. That jerk is my child's father.

49
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,290
 I want you to kill someone.

50
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,340
 My ex-husband. I want you to kill him.

51
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,410
You knew your ex-husband was Yu Jeong's fiancé.

52
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,820
Why didn't you say anything?

53
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,250
I told you that my mouth is itching.

54
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,990
But as you know, I'm wanted in Korea.

55
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,640
If I act rashly, I might never see my daughter again.

56
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,750
Why did you come here, then?

57
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,720
By chance, are you here to see Je Hyeok?

58
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,600
I was invited by Yu Jeong and Hae Mi.

59
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,410
- What?
 - I warned you not to trust anyone, didn't I?

60
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,590
They care more about the land than you.

61
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,030
Just go home today. Don't cause unnecessary conflict.

62
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,130
I also wasn't planning to do anything today, anyway.

63
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm just here to show you how shameless that Song Je Hyeok bastard is.

64
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,850
Go Yoo Na, will you really be like this?

65
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,250
- If Yu Jeong finds out about this─ 
 - You... you said you would help me!

66
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,490
You told me to trust you!

67
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,910
Make a decision after today.

68
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,710
Decide whose side you should be on.

69
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,950
Why are you so shocked? You're embarrassing us.

70
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,320
Where did that daughter come from?

71
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,860
How did you end up having her?

72
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,130
I met a woman when I was in the US,

73
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,550
and we ended up having a child.

74
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,610
But we broke up.

75
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,410
I think she was kind of a bad apple.

76
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,440
She's apparently in prison.

77
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:37,770
I didn't want to stay in the US because I felt betrayed by her.

78
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,300
So I came to Korea with our child.

79
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,040
And...

80
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,460
I met Yu Jeong.

81
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,940
As if it was destiny.

82
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,730
Okay. It's fine.

83
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,930
It's all good, but...

84
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,280
why did you keep it a secret even from us?

85
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,740
It was my idea.

86
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,920
I thought people might look at us differently if we told them before.

87
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,620
Actually, I know what you thought of Je Hyeok, Hae Mi.

88
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,010
What do you mean? When?

89
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,880
Originally, I naturally wanted to tell people after the wedding,

90
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,600
but I suggested that we tell you today.

91
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,980
We'll proudly show her at the wedding by making her the flower girl.

92
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,770
When does your phoniness end, anyway?

93
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,080
How could you always set a new record?

94
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,740
Please be happy for us, Hae Mi.

95
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,210
You know how much I wanted to become a mother.

96
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,050
Yes, well...

97
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,540
it's nice to have a pretty daughter without going through labor.

98
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,360
You have my blessing.

99
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,520
Congratulations!

100
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,980
You, too, Je Hyeok.

101
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,450
Thank you.

102
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,410
By the way, is the mother still in prison?

103
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,040
Who's in prison?

104
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,790
 I closed the restaurant early. I'll head over to Yu Jeong's place right now.

105
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,840
Yoo Na, you never met him, right?

106
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,530
This person is Song Je Hyeok, who will be Yu Jeong's husband in four days.

107
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,440
And this is my husband, Cha Leo.

108
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,660
You all look somehow familiar. As if I already knew you.

109
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,940
Let me introduce myself. I'm Emily Go.

110
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,450
 Let me hear why, at least.

111
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,430
 What did I do to deserve to get beaten?

112
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,830
 Go Yoo Na came back from the US.

113
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,520
 What?

114
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,670
 She already got out of prison?

115
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,600
 I used her account for all the traceable transactions.

116
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,780
 It must have been tough for her to get out.

117
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,590
 Also, she's wanted, isn't she?

118
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,810
 She entered the country by changing her identity.

119
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,410
 However, she probably won't act rashly

120
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,800
 because she knows she's wanted in Korea,

121
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,720
 but still, be careful.

122
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,580
 I'm curious to find out what she would do.

123
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,410
 Don't worry.

124
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:53,230
 I know it's her, but she won't do anything stupid unless she wants to go to prison.

125
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,350
 I apologize for punching you.

126
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,520
 The elder said you should at least be warned for

127
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,620
 causing the situation.

128
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,000
 Just wait and see how I get back at her.

129
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,910
Nice to meet you.

130
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,090
I didn't know Yu Jeong had a friend like you.

131
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,220
I'm disappointed that you didn't know me.

132
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,990
We used to be pretty close.

133
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,710
I guess you still don't know each other very well.

134
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,560
You must be happy to have an innocent wife like Yu Jeong.

135
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,610
What do you mean by that?

136
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,520
You get fooled easily.

137
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,970
That's why you believed me when I lied about going to the same college as you guys.

138
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,100
Men like women who get fooled easily.

139
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,000
Right?

140
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,780
Was your name...

141
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,420
Je Hyeok?

142
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,430
Let's call it a day.

143
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,540
I'm kind of tired.

144
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,680
Shall we hang out again some other time?

145
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,970
Why don't you just leave, Jae Yi?

146
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,910
I'm just about to have some fun now.

147
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,500
Nice to meet you, too, Leo.

148
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,120
How did the two of you end up getting married?

149
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,000
You already know. What are you trying to say?

150
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,470
 Do you want to try taking this? It's a restorative medicine.

151
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,520
 I'll take it.

152
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,420
 What is it?

153
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,160
 Well, forget about this.

154
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,640
 Let's relieve stress instead.

155
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,050
 Hello!

156
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,850
 - I'm Woo Bin.
 - I'm Hyun Bin.

157
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,780
 I'm Won Bin.

158
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,760
 I'm Leo.

159
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,700
 I want him.

160
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,230
 I think I like Leo.

161
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,780
 Hey, Newbie!

162
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,770
 Okay.

163
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,850
 Hello.

164
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,390
 You newbies should have fun today.

165
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,670
 I'll kill you if you do anything stupid to her.

166
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,250
 Yes.

167
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,780
 Do you want to drink some?

168
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,350
 That Noona inside is pretty wealthy.

169
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,780
 You know how to get her to come often, right?

170
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,560
 You've got to be kidding me.

171
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,780
 You gave Hae Mi drugs?

172
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,340
 Just keep this in mind.

173
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:11,850
 Do you know who addicts blame most when they hit rock bottom?

174
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,460
 The one who sold the drug to them.

175
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,220
 If her life goes wrong, she'll hate you the most.

176
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,440
I have a lot to say, but don't worry.

177
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,460
Yu Jeong and Je Hyeok are the stars of the day.

178
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,120
When was your wedding again? Can I come?

179
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,940
That's enough now.

180
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,640
Why? I haven't even eaten yet.

181
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,280
My gosh, it's a roasted chicken.

182
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,010
It's my favorite.

183
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,940
Are there chorizos and sun-dried tomatoes in it, by chance?

184
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,450
Daebak.

185
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,270
How did you know without even cutting it open?

186
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,920
Do you have to cut it to know?

187
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,790
Can't you just smell it?

188
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:36,600
Je Hyeok made all this for you guys.

189
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,960
He sometimes surprises me with impressive dishes like this.

190
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,050
I don't think that'll be the only thing that'll surprise you.

191
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,860
Go Yoo Na.

192
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,090
Isn't it how it always is?

193
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,720
I learned this when I got married, too.

194
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,400
Your man you thought was an angel before getting married turns out to be the devil.

195
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,940
Enough to surprise you. Totally shocking.

196
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,610
Why don't you brace yourself before you get married?

197
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,320
I'm sorry that happened to your marriage,

198
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,300
but don't assume everyone will turn out the same.

199
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,550
Hae Mi has a great relationship with Leo, too.

200
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,940
There's only one way for married couples to get along.

201
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,490
Never getting caught with their secrets.

202
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,600
Don't you agree, Hae Mi?

203
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,950
Don't you agree, Leo?

204
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,500
Oh, right!

205
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,030
A surprising secret!

206
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,880
Jae Yi, you missed it because you were on the phone.

207
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,310
Je Hyeok has a daughter, apparently.

208
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,820
She's four years old. Even her name is pretty.

209
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,630
Na Na. It's Na Na, right?

210
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,280
Yes.

211
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,880
Na...

212
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,040
Na?

213
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,350
Your daughter's name... is Na Na?

214
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,630
Please be happy for us, Jae Yi.

215
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,220
I think I'm really marrying a great person.

216
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,530
I'll have a lovely daughter at the same time, too.

217
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,880
Thank you, Je Hyeok, for letting me have such a lovely daughter.

218
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,600
I should be thanking you

219
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,620
for becoming Na Na's mom.

220
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,210
Let's go. That's enough.

221
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,300
How about the mother?

222
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,060
Did you work it out with her?

223
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,350
About you becoming her mom.

224
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,870
- Go Yoo Na.
 - You need an agreement for stuff like that.

225
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,240
The mother is like the sun to kids.

226
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,420
There can't be two suns in the sky. One person needs to give up.

227
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,120
Even if you have to see the end.

228
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,120
I don't think one becomes a mom automatically because you give birth.

229
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,750
If the mother isn't motherly, she could lose her position.

230
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,100
Did you see her... not being motherly?

231
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,060
Or did you ask her if she'd abandon her daughter?

232
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,390
- Get up now. Get up!
 - Why?

233
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,590
What did I do wrong?

234
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,570
Her mother is...

235
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,100
in prison.

236
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,580
She committed a crime.

237
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,710
She might spend the rest of her life there,

238
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:56,730
without being able to see her daughter forever.

239
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:11,030
Anyway, I don't think that woman would do anything rash.

240
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,880
She was bad, but she wasn't dumb.

241
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:38,050
If she's really not dumb, you should prepare yourself.

242
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,350
Or she might take your daughter for good.

243
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,550
Yu Jeong, I'm giving you sincere advice since you're my friend.

244
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,070
Also...

245
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:04,930
Congratulations... on your wedding, Mr. Song Je Hyeok.

246
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,390
- Yoo Na. 
- Yu Jeong!

247
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,310
Yoo Na?

248
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,950
You're Noo Na, aren't you?

249
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,630
Did both Je Hyeok and Leo leave?

250
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,430
Go Yoo Na, that psycho! Why did she flip out all of a sudden?

251
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,910
She was looking at Je Hyeok and me in a strange way.

252
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,780
What could be the reason?

253
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,220
She wasn't just doing that to you guys. She was like that to Leo, too!

254
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,800
She was staring offensively in a mocking manner.

255
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,520
We shouldn't have invited that psycho.

256
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,090
Well, Yu Jeong.

257
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,940
- Go Yoo Na─ 
 - I'm sorry, Jae Yi.

258
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,940
For inviting Yoo Na without telling you.

259
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,930
But that was because of the land.

260
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,130
The land she owns.

261
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,770
The land?

262
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,400
Yu Jeong and I actually went to see Yoo Na.

263
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,430
We wanted to take the land no matter what.

264
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:56,120
Yoo Na said she would give us the land if only we invited her to a gathering with our husbands.

265
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,160
Do you guys believe her? After getting fooled so much?

266
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,770
I don't believe her,

267
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,160
but I was desperate.

268
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,600
Without the land, we will be in trouble, Jae Yi.

269
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,560
Do you really have to marry Je Hyeok?

270
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,500
Why?

271
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,790
Do you think he's not good enough for me, too?

272
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,520
Just because he's a single father who works under me?

273
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,370
No, it's not like that.

274
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,280
Do you remember

275
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,070
what happened to me after my parents died in the accident?

276
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,160
Since that day,

277
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,920
I gave up on having a happy family and only lived for Yeongun.

278
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,250
That's how I met Je Hyeok, who has a lovely daughter, Na Na.

279
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:59,300
I think he's a gift my parents sent from heaven.

280
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,610
So, Jae Yi...

281
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:08,990
I hope you don't say anything negative about us getting married.

282
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,210
Then, Yu Jeong,

283
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,880
couldn't you push back the wedding a bit?

284
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:24,000
As Yoo Na said, it won't be too late to think about it after finding out more about him.

285
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,960
Even if Je Hyeok has a secret he can't reveal,

286
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,410
could it be worse than mine?

287
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,460
I got pregnant by someone like Gi Do Shik, had a miscarriage,

288
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,580
and became infertile.

289
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,910
He doesn't know.

290
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,850
That's the last bit of pride I want to keep as a woman.

291
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:54,480
Do I really have the right to blame Je Hyeok for his flaws?

292
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,300
So just be happy for me, Jae Yi.

293
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:06,300
I don't think I could live a single day without Je Hyeok anymore.

294
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,260
That's how much I love that man.

295
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,660
I met with Go Yoo Na.

296
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,830
 Did anything happen?

297
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,450
It looked like she had some kind of insurance.

298
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,870
 Insurance?

299
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:31,230
She was talking as if she had prepared something, but what can she do as a wanted criminal?

300
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,590
She must have someone.

301
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,950
 Go Yoo Na's insurance is someone you know, too.

302
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,570
It can't be...

303
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:59,580

304
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,220
 The call is not going through. After the beep...

305
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,020

306
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,060
Drink some. You said you're cold.

307
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,580
Thank you... for staying with me.

308
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,380
Should we leave after you're done?

309
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,140
Why? Will you go to Jae Yi?

310
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:03,460
I lied to Jae Yi that I met you before I went to the US.

311
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,390
It looked like she believed it.

312
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,230
I guess you don't trust each other yet.

313
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,900
Why did you tell her a lie like that?

314
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,610
Because I didn't want to lose you.

315
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,380
Anything I cherished was taken from me.

316
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:38,950
What would you do if I told you to come back to me?

317
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,450
Hold on!

318
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,170
That's enough!

319
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,370
I got your answer.

320
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,610
Call me when you're tormented, like earlier

321
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,000
but no one's there to help you.

322
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,810
Do you feel sorry for me? Is it pity?

323
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,960
Because you're Jae Yi's friend.

324
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,280

325
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,870
 I can't seem to reach you.

326
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,550
 Something came up on the way to Yu Jeong's place.

327
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,830
 Everything is okay, right?

328
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,990
You said you don't like places like this. What brings you here?

329
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,690
I came because of you.

330
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,640
You said you come here whenever you feel stressed.

331
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,700
Am I stressed right now?

332
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,150
At the moment, I feel like I could fly!

333
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:37,520
Aren't you reminded of your late son because of Go Yoo Na these days?

334
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,920
The reason I leave her alone

335
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,720
is not to cause noise since an important event is coming up.

336
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:54,800
But I guess you decided to put speakers at the source of the noise.

337
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,660
Are you digging up dirt on me to protect your daughter?

338
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:06,780
No matter what Go Yoo Na does, I hope you don't get involved.

339
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,280
This place is definitely not for me.

340
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,110
Well, then.

341
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,570
You couldn't sleep at all?

342
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,060
How could I sleep? Nothing is working out.

343
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,180
Why not?

344
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,420
Did it not get resolved for the hanok hotel in Tongju?

345
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,760
I think Go Yoo Na played me for that.

346
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,340
By the way, why were you like that yesterday?

347
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,980
What?

348
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,610
W-What do you mean?

349
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,530
You didn't speak a word after Yoo Na arrived.

350
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,620
Like a scared rabbit who was captured in the wolf's lair.

351
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:38,560
Aigoo! W-When did I? W-When did I?

352
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,870
Is it because she knows where you worked?

353
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,060
So what? Was I ever ashamed of you?

354
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,590
No, you weren't.

355
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,850
Because people always whispered and murmured about my mom,

356
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,520
people looking at me like that is as natural as breathing.

357
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,520
So, you should be proud, okay?

358
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:21,480
No matter what people say, you're the husband of Yoon Hae Mi,

359
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,350
the vice president of Mariela Hotel.

360
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:28,060
- Okay?
 - Yes.

361
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm going to work.

362
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,780
Okay.

363
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,290
She's on it again.

364
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,780

365
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,300

366
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,350
These are the venues that are opening in three days.

367
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,180
 You apparently get it for joining some club.

368
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:27,760
 Right. I guess the club closed 10 years ago, but as far as I know, it's opening again.

369
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,120
The Ace Bar must be the members-only club where I met Jung Gi Ho.

370
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,600
Since he used to go there, they must deal drugs.

371
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,570
They could easily become a secret club, too.

372
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:48,760
But I need to go to Yu Jeong's wedding that day.

373
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,700
Her wedding is here, right?

374
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,600
Thankfully, it's in the Gunggok district.

375
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,030
Please call me if you notice anything on the wedding day.

376
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,280
Yes, I will.

377
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,770
I'll go meet with Je Hyeok, then.

378
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,940
You didn't answer my calls or texts.

379
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,160
I was busy.

380
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,070
I'm sorry.

381
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:42,330
Yesterday, I saw Yoo Na at Yu Jeong's house.

382
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,270
It wasn't actually the first time seeing her.

383
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,050
She showed up in front of us recently.

384
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,380
I'm sorry for not telling you all this time.

385
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,920
I actually ran into her yesterday.

386
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,910
On my way to Yu Jeong.

387
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,200
Is that so?

388
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,680
You must've been happy to see her. It's been a while.

389
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,960
Did you talk a lot? What did Yoo Na say?

390
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,130
Did she talk about me, too?

391
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,580
Can I ask you a favor?

392
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,660
Trust me, no matter what anyone says.

393
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,760
That's how I feel.

394
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,510
Congratulations on becoming the chairman, Team Leader Song Je Hyeok.

395
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,680
I mean, Chairman!

396
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,080
The kids would be so sad to see you leave.

397
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,000
I think he would be sadder than the kids.

398
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,810
I'll come by often. Please explain it well to them.

399
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:05,160
And the wedding will be at the auditorium here, too.

400
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,340
Excuse me.

401
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,140
Yes, are you here?

402
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,750
Let's go!

403
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,140

(Meaning angel and love)

404
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,610
Excuse me for a second.

405
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,480
Yes.

406
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,220
I'm here to see Team Leader Song Je Hyeok.

407
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,840
Ah, he's probably at the auditorium because some company came.

408
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,130
Try going there.

409
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,070
Thank you.

410
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,810
Jae Yi!

411
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,810
So, what brings you here without any notice?

412
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,950
Je Hyeok.

413
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,990
I know who Na Na's birth mother is.

414
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:42,500
I expected it... when I saw you walking in with her.

415
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:50,510
Do you mean you knew that Yu Jeong and Yoo Na were friends?

416
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,370
No.

417
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,720
How could I think of marrying Yu Jeong if I knew Yoo Na was her friend?

418
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,940
I was shocked to find out about it, too.

419
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,820
What kind of coincidence is this?

420
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,960
When did you find out, then?

421
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,690
Was it about a month ago?

422
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:17,180
When I was organizing my desk, I saw a picture of Yu Jeong and her friends.

423
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,360
And I saw Yoo Na in that picture.

424
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,540
I didn't want to tell Yu Jeong about her.

425
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:32,720
So I tried to break up with her by saying I suddenly felt burdened by her,

426
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,610
but she said she might die.

427
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,860
 I don't think I could live a single day without him anymore.

428
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:51,080
 That's how much I love that man.

429
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,880
I know I deserve to die.

430
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,210
Also, it's true that I left Yoo Na with our daughter.

431
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:10,930
But living with Yoo Na was hellish due to repeated lies and affairs.

432
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:18,350
And I started feeling sorry for Na Na, who'd be raised by her.

433
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,370
Jae Yi.

434
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,920
Could you pretend you didn't know?

435
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,810
I'll be good to Yu Jeong for the rest of my life to repay her for lying to her.

436
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:37,230
I don't think I could... live without Yu Jeong, either.

437
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,160
But I don't think Go Yoo Na will just sit back and do nothing.

438
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,950
She risked her life coming to Korea to get her daughter back.

439
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,090
Then... how about just until the wedding?

440
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,330
I haven't done anything for Yu Jeong.

441
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,750
At least, I want her to have a perfect wedding.

442
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
How about this, then?

443
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,660
I'll try to stop Yoo Na from doing anything until the wedding,

444
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,560
but you should come to an agreement with Yoo Na afterward.

445
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,610
So that Yoo Na doesn't suffer too much.

446
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,500
After all, she's still the mother of your daughter.

447
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,870
Thank you.

448
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,180
Thank you, Jae Yi!

449
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:40,240
Please don't tell Yu Jeong that I came here today.

450
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,510
I won't.

451
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,880
Jung Gi Ho, we need to meet up.

452
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,980
Why do we have to see each other when Dad is gone?

453
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,660
You're right. Your father died, and your mother got arrested.

454
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,550
But you're still taking drugs and letting yourself go.

455
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,730
That's why you're losing your share.

456
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,010
My share?

457
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,160
Are you talking about the land that Emily Go or whatever took?

458
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,830
He gave it to her before he died. What am I supposed to do?

459
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:08,110
Put your seal on it. I'll get it back for you.

460
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,770
Really?

461
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:16,030

462
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,930

463
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,780
Yes, Manager.

464
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,750
I'm watching Ace Bar right now.

465
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,210
Someone you know just went in.

466
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,620
Who is it?

467
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,210
 I just sent you the photo.

468
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,810
Yes.

469
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,010
Should I find out what he's here for?

470
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,560
 Well...

471
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,260
No, Go Yoo Na's land is more urgent right now.

472
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,100
I'm on my way to take the land now.

473
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,520
It was you, wasn't it?

474
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,910
Gosh, seriously!

475
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,920
Am I the call center of the sex industry or so?

476
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,870
Why is everyone filing complaints with me?

477
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:30,610
Also, I never sold that drug to your wife, okay?

478
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,820
What's this, then?

479
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,030
It's not the stuff I used to sell. Isn't it the new stuff you brought in?

480
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,790
Don't try to deny it. Give me everything you have right now.

481
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,190
I need to know what it is to sell it.

482
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,670
Looks like you made the decision sooner than I expected.

483
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,430
So, whose side will you be on?

484
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,540
Song Je Hyeok's or mine?

485
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,370
I'm neither on your side nor Je Hyeok's side.

486
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,870
I'm on Yu Jeong's side.

487
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:22,120
I won't let you destroy her happiness.

488
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,120
Did you forget what I have?

489
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,170
I have that land.

490
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:34,830
The land in the Gungguk district of Tongju that you, Yu Jeong, and Hae Mi want so badly.

491
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,670
Don't you need it anymore?

492
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,390
Yes, I do.

493
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,420
I need it badly.

494
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,370
That's why I haven't done anything.

495
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:51,390
Because you never know how long a lawsuit will last.

496
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,890
A lawsuit?

497
00:46:53,890 --> 00:47:00,180
Since the landowner is Emily Go, not Go Yoo Na, the notice must've been sent to the US.

498
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:05,780
What should we do? I requested the seizure of that property.

499
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,920
Jung Gi Ho requested the return of the statutory minimum inheritance as the decedent's child today, too.

500
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,850
Even though a man gave the property to his mistress before he died,

501
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:17,710
his heirs can request to get it back within a year.

502
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,020
That won't be the end of it.

503
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:25,340
I'll meet Lee Hwa Ryeon and tell her to sue you for emotional damage.

504
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:27,890
What a pity.

505
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,810
You'll have to find a good lawyer before you look for your daughter.

506
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,170
You're definitely a lawyer, Do Jae Yi.

507
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:45,800
But would you be okay if the lawsuit took so long, as you said?

508
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,770
You can't even put a tent on that land during the lawsuit.

509
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:53,010
Where will you build the arts and culture village you guys want so badly?

510
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,570
Should you be worrying about us now?

511
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,030
You should worry about yourself.

512
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:02,750
No matter how much you pretend to be Emily Go, you're Go Yoo Na.

513
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,270
Your identity will be revealed eventually.

514
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,360
Would you be okay going back to prison?

515
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,570
As Je Hyeok said, forget getting your daughter.

516
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:13,820
You may never see her again.

517
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,910
Do Jae Yi!

518
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:18,140
So, you should better give us the land and leave quietly.

519
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:23,310
I'll persuade Je Hyeok and let you see your daughter sometime then.

520
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:28,900
You care about Yu Jeong so much, but you let her marry Song Je Hyeok?

521
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,900
- Do you know what kind of jerk he is?
 - I do.

522
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,440
He was so terrible to you that you want to kill him.

523
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,760
But being good or bad is all relative.

524
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,970
I believe he might've been the worst man to you,

525
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:46,120
but he could be the best man to Yu Jeong.

526
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,330
You'll... regret saying that.

527
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:02,380
Choose between the land and your daughter soon and call me.

528
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,190
Also, don't try to do anything stupid before the wedding.

529
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,040
You'll get handcuffs on you immediately, then.

530
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,690
Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul?

531
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:34,010
This is Go Yoo Na.

532
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,760
I think it's time to present you as my card now.

533
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,320

534
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,240
 You look so pretty!

535
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,550
 So pretty.

536
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:12,510
You look so pretty, Yu Jeong.

537
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,380
People might think this is your first time.

538
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,110
What? I got confused.

539
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,840
You had put on a dress then.

540
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,820
Hello.

541
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,930
That's Na Na, Je Hyeok's daughter.

542
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,660
I mean, our daughter.

543
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,550
Na Na! Come here.

544
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,100
You're so pretty, my girl.

545
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,610
- Did you have fun at the kindergarten today?
 - Yes.

546
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,830
What did you do for fun today?

547
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:48,520
I made a drawing today.

548
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,420
You made a drawing?

549
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,370
- What kind of drawing?
 - They're already very close.

550
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:59,620
They have met often since I introduced Na Na to her.

551
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:04,590
Yu Jeong has been raising a child secretly all this time.

552
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:08,830
- Hello! You must be Na Na.
 - Hello.

553
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,390
Hello, I'm Aunt Hae Mi. Mom's friend.

554
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,160
- Call me Aunt.
 - Okay.

555
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,610
I'm rich and pretty. You can tell, right?

556
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,550
Thank you.

557
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,790
You'll keep your promise and make her happy, right?

558
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,820
I'll try to keep that promise for the rest of my life.

559
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,980
Okay, then.

560
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:41,090
We'll take a picture of the groom, bride, and flower girl.

561
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:43,090
Come this way.

562
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,150
Let's look to the front. Over there.

563
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,990
Let's start now.

564
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,770
Although my hunches aren't accurate,

565
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,430
something feels unnerving for some reason.

566
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:01,790
They appear perfect,

567
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:05,480
but something about them feels cold.

568
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,110
How about you?

569
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,250
Are you okay?

570
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,980
What about me?

571
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:23,190
I'm just asking if you're happy with Leo.

572
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,070
We're crazy about each other!

573
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,010
Is that so?

574
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,960
We just need to take care of Go Yoo Na's land now, then.

575
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,010
But don't worry so much.

576
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:45,320
It might take some time, but both the land and Go Yoo Na will be taken care of.

577
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,370
No...

578
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,500
I'll take care of everything.

579
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,930
Do you have a solution, by chance?

580
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:55,160
Huh?

581
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,500
Jae Yi, Hae Mi. Come here. Let's take a picture together.

582
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,020
Yes, let's take a picture together. Come!

583
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:08,240
Look at the lens! One, two, three!

584
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:14,630
 The worst decision we made 20 years ago was

585
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:18,310
 to get Yoo Na involved in our lives.

586
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:23,080
 We won't make the same mistake ever again.

587
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,760
 Goodbye, Go Yoo Na.

588
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,080

589
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,380

590
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,970

591
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:56,050
 The call is not going through. After the beep...

592
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,310
Are you trying to screw me over?

593
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:49,780

594
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,960
- What are you doing?
 - You're definitely talented.

595
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,910
Looks like you already created an ally.

596
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,600
I can't be as talented as you.

597
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,880
What will you do? You got stood up by Gi Yoon Chul.

598
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,500
You... have you been following me?

599
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,780
Why?

600
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:15,050
Are you anxious... that a big shot like him would be on my side?

601
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,060
No way.

602
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,350
I thought you were barking up the wrong tree.

603
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,510
He's very close to me.

604
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:32,570
- What?
 - So you should better go back to the US quietly.

605
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:36,080
Then Na Na, I mean...

606
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,880
She was Anna to us, right?

607
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,600
I'll raise Anna well.

608
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,050
Wouldn't you prefer to go to the US than to go to prison?

609
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:51,820
What would you do if I told Yu Jeong about everything?

610
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:59,110
If so, I might do something... to Anna, too.

611
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,710
Hey!

612
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:42,440
I sent this photo to everyone who'll be sent to all the events in the Gongguk district tomorrow.

613
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,920
They agreed to call me as soon as they found the mask or noticed anything strange.

614
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,910
Okay. Got it.

615
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:53,070
I'll pay close attention to Ace Bar.

616
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,430
It's finally tomorrow.

617
00:56:56,430 --> 00:57:01,610
The last day the bastard can be punished by law.

618
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:11,560

619
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,380
What's this about?

620
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:26,400
Whatever. Have you decided to give me the land?

621
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,210
The land isn't important right now.

622
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,980
Cancel Yu Jeong and Song Je Hyeok's wedding immediately.

623
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:38,160
- Are you serious─ 
 - He's marrying Yu Jeong with a purpose.

624
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,500
He's not doing it innocently!

625
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:46,060
Do you still have feelings for Je Hyeok, by chance?

626
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,000
You hated him enough to want to kill him,

627
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,940
but you can't stand him marrying another woman?

628
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,240
Do you... not believe me?

629
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,060
How am I supposed to believe you?

630
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,490
You were trying to do something to me using Gi Yoon Chul.

631
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:07,130
You should just go your way.

632
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:10,900
- Don't bother me.
 - Gi Yoon Chul was on his side, too.

633
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:17,730
That asshole knew all about me coming to Korea and visiting Gi Yoon Chul!

634
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,230
Go Yoo Na.

635
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:25,060
I'm not able to deal with you right now.

636
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,480
I'm dealing with something very important to me.

637
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,590
What I've been chasing after for 10 years.

638
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,580
So I'm begging you.

639
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,030
Please leave.

640
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:46,570
If you can't believe me, there's nothing I can say.

641
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,670
But I definitely warned you.

642
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:56,250
You, me, and Yu Jeong.

643
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:01,580
If something happens to us, don't regret it, then.

644
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:21,260
Is it possibly... that mask?

645
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:27,600
The one you saw... in the hotel room 10 years ago?

646
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,980
Never mind.

647
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,050
You never... believed me anyway.

648
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,360
 Anna!

649
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,840
 What do you want?

650
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,810
 Where did he go?

651
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:55,350
How should I know? He hasn't lived here for years!

652
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,490
 Here.

653
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,540
 Hand this to your husband when you find him.

654
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,620
 W-What is this?

655
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,520
 I have no idea.

656
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,020
 We found it in the bathroom ceiling when we moved in.

657
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:29,210
 Here it is. My part's done now.

658
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,710
 Let's get ready!

659
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,590
Slowly, slowly.

660
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:39,570
Slowly.

661
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:44,520
- Nice.
 - Okay, right there.

662
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,930
Congratulations.

663
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:01,490
Thank you for coming.

664
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:03,880
- Aigoo, you made it.
 - Congratulations.

665
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,740
Thank you.

666
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:08,420
- Congratulations.
 - Thank you.

667
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,670
Yu Jeong, you look so pretty.

668
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,620
Has Je Hyeok moved in?

669
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:27,380
Yeah, he moved into my house two days ago.

670
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:32,060
Why do you look so sad as a bride?

671
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:35,570
You don't want to get married anymore?

672
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:38,810
It's not like that.

673
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:47,200
I thought Mom and Dad would've been so happy if they were alive.

674
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,750
You don't know. Maybe it's better that they're not here.

675
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,530
To be honest, Je Hyeok's not exactly...

676
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:56,010
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

677
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,750
I'm trying to lighten her up!

678
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:03,500
Yu Jeong, your parents would've been so happy if they were alive.

679
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,160
It's not easy to find someone who loves you as much as Je Hyeok does.

680
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,820
Right?

681
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,720
I'm kind of nervous,

682
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,230
but I'm so happy right now.

683
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:25,000
I can't believe I ever got to be this happy.

684
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,050
That's how happy I am.

685
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,250
 - Congratulations.  
 - Thank you.

686
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,640
Thank you for coming.

687
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,350
Congratulations.

688
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:41,330
Thank you.

689
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,290
You look cool, Hyung!

690
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,380
I sincerely congratulate you.

691
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,900
I hope this will be your last wedding.

692
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,770
Let's go.

693
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,550
Thank you for coming.

694
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,440
Congratulations.

695
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,200
Is it finally beginning?

696
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,420
Finally beginning? What exactly?

697
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:13,400
Marriage is the beginning of a new life, or not?

698
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,640
I prepared a table for the parents.

699
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,470
I hope you have a good conversation.

700
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,970
Isn't he Chairman Kang Il Gu of Kangbo Group?

701
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:44,130
How come he's here?

702
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,860
Excuse me.

703
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,500
What brings you here?

704
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:07,370
I was friendly with the former chairman who passed.

705
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:11,570
It's his daughter's wedding. How could I not come?

706
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:16,650
Yu Jeong and Hae Mi don't know that you're my father.

707
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:19,760
I'd like to keep it a secret from now on, too.

708
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,090
If that's what you want.

709
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:35,950
- Where's your seat, Mom? Over there?
 - Over there.

710
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:40,720
Aigoo, Mother-in-law! Hello.

711
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,760
Aren't you standing out too much?

712
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:49,680
You should've dressed elegantly for an event like this.

713
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,220
You're just as guilty, okay?

714
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:57,650
You're definitely the wife of the owner of Daesungak and a princess.

715
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:01,810
I'll make sure I don't humiliate you, Mother-in-law.

716
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,370
I hope you have a good time!

717
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:08,300
Can't you do something about the way you talk, too?

718
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,010
What do you mean, "good time"?

719
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:19,070
Let me take you to your seat. This way.

720
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,590
 The wedding will start soon.

721
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:36,760
 Please take a seat, everyone.

722
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:46,830
 Do Jae Yi, stop that wedding.

723
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:26,960
 All right, the stars of the day.

724
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,210
 Please welcome the groom and the bride, Mr. Song Je Hyeok

725
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:34,050
 and Ms. Ju Yu Jeong with enthusiastic applause!

726
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,400
 Groom and bride, please enter!

727
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:22,790

728
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:26,080

729
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:34,540

730
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:38,720
The wedding will be without an officiator.

731
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:43,650
The groom and the bride will read the wedding vows together.

732
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:46,920
Wedding vows.

733
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:53,570
I, Song Je Hyeok, will love everything about you, Ju Yu Jeong, as your husband.

734
01:08:53,570 --> 01:09:00,900
I, Ju Yu Jeong, will give you, Song Je Hyeok, my everything as your wife.

735
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,010
I will embrace even the smallest flaws you have

736
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:07,870
and become your dependable partner for the rest of my life.

737
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,940
No matter what decision you make,

738
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:13,990
I'll always support you and cheer you on.

739
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:20,620
I, Song Je Hyeok, will be the husband who always respects my wife, Ju Yu Jeong.

740
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:25,170
That was the groom, Song Je Hyeok.

741
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:31,920
I, Ju Yu Jeong, will be the wife who always respects my husband, Song Je Hyeok.

742
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,620
That was the bride, Ju Yu Jeong.

743
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:40,470
They finished reading the wedding vows by promising eternal love for each other.

744
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:43,680
So, here comes the final step of the wedding vow.

745
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,780
The bride and groom will kiss now!

746
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,660
 It was him. Song Je Hyeok.

747
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:33,860
 He's the man behind the mask you're looking for.

748
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:48,940

749
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:22,980

750
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:30,140
♫  Dark desires hiding behind a mask  ♫

751
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:32,710
♫  They're liars  ♫

752
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:37,690
♫  The truth is completely hidden behind a curtain  ♫

753
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:45,770
 ~ Preview ~ 
I'll make sure your pain, sadness, and loneliness won't find you anymore.

754
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:50,170
 I'll make you the most beautiful and happiest woman in the world.

755
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:54,600
 I'm sure that Je Hyeok is a good man.

756
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,590
 Did you know that you're the biggest obstacle?

757
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,930
 I need to find some kind of evidence.

758
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:06,040
 You want to compare it with my DNA?

759
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:10,240
 Aren't you scared to get your cover blown?

760
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:15,010
 Where did Jae Yi disappear to, anyway?

761
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:18,280
 You got betrayed. I'll give you a weapon.

762
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:23,910
 What I need to do now is to take the Song Je Hyeok mask you're wearing right now.

763
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:26,770
 But if possible, please keep it a secret from Yu Jeong that we did it.

764
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:29,060
 We could've done it because we wanted to.

765
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:34,600
 I'll reveal the truth about everything that happened in this room that night.
