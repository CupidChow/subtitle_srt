1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,030

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,210
She's the wrong one.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,150
I thought you were giving that drink to Go Yoo Na.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,630
You think I knew?

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,280
I had no idea Go Yoo Na wouldn't come and someone else would drink it instead.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,880
So... will you do it to her instead of Go Yoo Na?

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,610
Are you crazy? She's an attorney!

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,440
She's totally different from someone like Go Yoo Na.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,080
She might not be able to tell anyone because she's embarrassed.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,940
Is that so?

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,350
I don't know, I don't know.

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,380
Each of these girls came over and harassed me.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,520
My head is about to explode.

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,750
I'll take a nap inside and think about it later.

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,650
Keep an eye on her, okay?

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,160
What a coward.

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:05,930

18
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,600
What? Did she run away?

19
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,640
Hey, bastard! She ran away!

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,730
H-Help me.

21
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,500
This is driving me crazy.

22
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,060
What should I do? What should I do?

23
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,570
I...

24
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,110
I need to stop the bleeding.

25
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,140
Give me a towel.

26
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,320
Yes, let's do this.

27
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,770
You drugged me without me knowing, and you drugged her while I was asleep.

28
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,830
And you tried to rape her.

29
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,870
- What?
 - I didn't do anything wrong.

30
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,950
I'm sure people would believe me.

31
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,630
You're a scumbag, but I'm the assemblyman's son.

32
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,960
Are you... done talking?

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,610
Why are you looking at me like that? Huh?

34
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,100
Hey!

35
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,540
Bastard!

36
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,420
You bastard...

37
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,930
Hey...

38
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,590

39
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,980

40
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,620
Move anywhere.

41
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,180
I'll come running to you immediately.

42
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,150
 I'll tell you why I need the mask.

43
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,280
 Come to my hotel room.

44
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,720
 The mask I gave you.

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,470
 Where are you keeping it?

46
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,590
 Why do you want to know that?

47
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,320
 I gave you that mask.

48
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,860
 I have the right to know that much.

49
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,930
What about the mask?

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,540
By chance... Song Je Hyeok?

51
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,590

52
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,920
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to voicemail.

53
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,320
 After the beep...

54
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,600
 Rest a bit.

55
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,830
 Please...

56
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,380
 Please stay with me just for a night.

57
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,280
 The door is opening.

58
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,950
 The door is closing.

59
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,160

60
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,940
 I tried to stop Leo, but he went to work again.

61
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,420
 He went to Room No. 918 at Grand Kangbo Hotel.

62
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,970
What are you doing here, Je Hyeok?

63
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,800

64
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,080

65
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,080
You're keeping this from Yu Jeong, too?

66
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,300
What kind of situation is this?

67
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,400
Why are you here instead of Leo?

68
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,420
I asked Mr. Jung.

69
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,020
I asked him to provide us with a space, so I can talk to you privately.

70
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,410
With me? Privately?

71
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:41,080
What do you need to talk to your wife's friend privately in a hotel room about?

72
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,300
 Give me... the card to beat Do Jae Yi.

73
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,660
 I'm not sure.

74
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,720
 I still don't have the assurance that you'll become the Tongju mayor yet.

75
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:00,110
Hae Mi, you must be having a hard time since the hanok hotel is no longer happening, right?

76
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,560
Yes.

77
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,570
If the hanok hotel is no longer happening,

78
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,310
Yeongun needs to give us the 10 billion won (~$7.4 million) we donated, too.

79
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,150
But they won't do that, either.

80
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,720
I know that you're in a very tough spot,

81
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,840
but please don't rush my Yu Jeong so much.

82
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,720
Please trust me and give us some time.

83
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,030
I'll make sure to take care of it somehow.

84
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,610
I know that you're a good husband, but I have a bigger fish to fry.

85
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:56,960
I wonder... if this would help with your stress.

86
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,440
Sometimes I stop by when I feel stressed, too.

87
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,240
It's completely confidential.

88
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,530
You can trust them.

89
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,730
I'll get going now.

90
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,060
It would look weird if we left the hotel together.

91
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,040
"Ice Party"?

92
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,380
By chance...

93
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,120

94
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,040
Ye Ji is staying in the backyard at this hour?

95
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,770
A mask?

96
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,040
Guys, you can do this well, right?

97
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,080
 Yes!

98
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,570
 Ahjussi, I'm Lee Yeon Ah, who was in the car accident the other day.

99
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,510
 Could I talk to you for a bit?

100
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
 Can I come in?

101
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,530
What? You're not even ready yet.

102
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,870
You haven't even changed.

103
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,320
Yeon Ah, the Angels are here!

104
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
I'll be out in a minute.

105
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,870
Okay, come out when you're ready.

106
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,920
The mask is the ticket?

107
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,450
What do they do inside wearing that?

108
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,990
Noona! I'm home!

109
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,640
Noona?

110
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,310
Where did she go with all the lights on?

111
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,340
You should've come a little sooner.

112
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,800
You would've seen something fun, then.

113
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,230
I came because I wanted to confirm something.

114
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,020
Why do you need that mask?

115
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,520
Are you back on Song Je Hyeok's side?

116
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,460
Gi Yoon Chul asked for it.

117
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,220
He said he'll make sure I'm no longer wanted if I give it to him.

118
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,270
Gi Yoon Chul? Why does he need that mask?

119
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,000
He said he needed a leash.

120
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
A leash to twist around Song Je Hyeok's neck.

121
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,040
Their relationship soured that much?

122
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,010
But you never thought about discussing that with me?

123
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,910
You're the one who betrayed me first.

124
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,500
I... saw you with Yu Jeong.

125
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,320
Your friendship brought me to tears.

126
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,510
You don't trust me.

127
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,710
You lied that the mask was at Kang Hoo's restaurant.

128
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,620
Is that why you brought Kang Hoo to the hotel?

129
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,670
Don't you think you're too childish?

130
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,000
I know I'm childish,

131
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,660
but I wanted you to feel it, just for a moment.

132
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,960
What it feels like to get something precious taken from you.

133
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,130
How painful and miserable it is,

134
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,170
and how difficult and heartbreaking.

135
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,440
I'm sorry.

136
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:36,110
I should've moved quickly for your daughter, at least.

137
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,130
I'm sorry, too.

138
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,650
You didn't do anything wrong.

139
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,960
But I feel so impatient because of Na Na.

140
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,840
Go Yoo Na. I need you.

141
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,290
You're the only one who knows who he is exactly.

142
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:17,530
I honestly... need you, too.

143
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,020
I'm scared

144
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,930
that I won't get to see Na Na again.

145
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,610
Go Yoo Na.

146
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,250
Yoo Na.

147
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:49,130
Let's start trusting each other and do this together.

148
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,680
Please?

149
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,940
You can do that, right?

150
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,330
Right, I...

151
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,160
I am free now.

152
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,070
Gi Yoon Chul canceled my fugitive status.

153
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,420
I'll try pursuing Je Hyeok more actively from now on,

154
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,950
so he can't hide in either a shadow or a bright spot.

155
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,960
By the way, how come you won't ask me?

156
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,080
Aren't you curious about Kang Hoo and me?

157
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,800
There's no way something could've happened, right?

158
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,600
 Kang Hoo, I think I'll throw up.

159
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,480
 I'm sorry,

160
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,580
 but could you get me some ice at the ice room near the stairway?

161
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,490
 Get some rest.

162
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,440
 Kang Hoo.

163
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,960
 Thank you.

164
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,050
What are you thinking so intensively about?

165
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,600
It's nothing. What is it?

166
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,090
You remember we have a magazine photoshoot this afternoon, right?

167
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,540
Please prepare for it.

168
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,970
Also, what Na Na wore last time, how shall I say it...

169
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,880
It was a bit too princessy, maybe?

170
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,720
She's a girl, but I prefer a healthy and strong image.

171
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,720
I know I can't avoid it,

172
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,300
but exposing Na Na for the campaign is a bit...

173
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,760
She might get stressed out.

174
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,910
It's something Do Jae Yi doesn't have.

175
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,110
A perfect family.

176
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,210
Well, do you have to leave right away?

177
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,460
Yes, I'm meeting with the party representative.

178
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,900
Right, you called me yesterday, right? I'm sorry.

179
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,140
We couldn't even talk because I came home so late.

180
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,420
So, what is it?

181
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,010
Do you need to tell me something?

182
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,990
No.

183
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,540
I'll tell you when I'm more certain about it.

184
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,400
See you later.

185
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,350
Why isn't she back yet?

186
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,900
Noona!

187
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,300
When did you come home? I was worried.

188
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,180
Noona!

189
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,800
Should we take a bath together like we used to?

190
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,930
Noona!

191
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,790
Noona!

192
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,370
Noona, what's wrong?

193
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,950
What are you doing?

194
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,300
Did you do it? I asked if you did it again!

195
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,500
 Do Jae Yi, Go Yoo Na, Ju Yu Jeong, and...

196
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,280
 Go Yoo Na, Ju Yu Jeong, and...

197
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,490
 you're the only one who's left, Hae Mi.

198
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,570
Noona! Pull yourself together!

199
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,990
Pull yourself together!

200
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,160
Where did you go last night?

201
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,800
What happened with whom?

202
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,170
Leo, we...

203
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,790
should give up now.

204
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,530
What?

205
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,630
We were a customer and a host.

206
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,380
I already could see the end.

207
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,770
We dragged it out for too long already.

208
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:38,070
I know you're not in the right mind now,

209
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,390
but how could you say we're a customer and a host─

210
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,630
It's not because of the drug.

211
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,890
I mean it.

212
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,550
Let's break up. Please?

213
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,530
I beg you.

214
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,950
Noona, this still isn't right.

215
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,520
Leave.

216
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,850
Leave!

217
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,770
Leave!

218
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,890
Get out of my sight!

219
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,970
- Please leave!
 - Noona!

220
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,700
Noona!

221
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,790
Are you crazy?

222
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,990
Leave.

223
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,150
I beg you, please?

224
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,990
Please leave!

225
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,700
I don't want you to

226
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,050
see me looking hideous like this.

227
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,820
Please leave!

228
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,050
I'll leave, but... let me say this one thing.

229
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,930
I'm sorry.

230
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,580
I promised to help you quit, but I couldn't.

231
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,970
Call me if you need me anytime.

232
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,740
I'll be waiting.

233
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,760
Cha Leo.

234
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,980

235
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,110
According to Ace Bar's internal record,

236
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:47,340
Hae Mi's husband is the person in charge, not Mr. Jung.

237
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,530
Leo is definitely related to Ace Bar.

238
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,520

239
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,000
But how could he suddenly be the person in charge?

240
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,470
I think they're trying to make Leo take all the blame if something goes wrong.

241
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,410
Because Ace Bar is also under his thumb.

242
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,970
Attorney Do, did you see the polls that came out today?

243
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,510
He's running ahead of you in the polls for the first time.

244
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,620
I think the interview he gave during Assemblyman Gi's event

245
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,470
left a good impression on the voters.

246
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,710
I need to make sure to ruin his relationship with Gi Yoon Chul this time.

247
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,750
Please find out the places Gi Yoon Chul goes to.

248
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:45,990

249
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,630
 How about we swap this photo for Do Jae Yi's ledger?

250
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:51,900
 Do Jae Yi, Go Yoo Na, Ju Yu Jeon, and...

251
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,470
 you're the only one who's left, Hae Mi.

252
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,700
Then, that was...

253
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,180
I told you last time, right?

254
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,910
When the Angels are here,

255
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,690
can you possess anything but the badge I gave you or not?

256
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,030
 No!

257
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,310
That's correct. You can't!

258
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,270
You can't put anything else on you but the badge I gave you.

259
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,490
- Okay?
  - Okay!

260
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,980
Okay, let's go, Princesses!

261
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,770
Hey, Ye Ji.

262
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,560
What's that on you?

263
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,160

264
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,980
Yes.

265
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,850
The Princes are next.

266
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,080
What's up, Hae Mi?

267
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,890
 You sent me this, and you're asking what?

268
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,760
"What's up?"

269
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,320
Was it your goal to get Jae Yi's weakness from me?

270
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,390
Gosh, how disappointing.

271
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,780
I did that for you, Hae Mi.

272
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,760
They say nothing is more healing than giving drugs to an addict.

273
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,970
Does Yu Jeong know what kind of person you are?

274
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,870
A lot of people don't know what kind of person you are, either.

275
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,560
 Well, like the chairman of Mariela Hotel?

276
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,910
Or your mother?

277
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,050
What?

278
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:43,980
So give me Do Jae Yi's ledger as soon as possible.

279
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,260
Otherwise, something unbelievably stressful that

280
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,260
even drugs can't handle will be waiting for you.

281
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,400
Hey, Song Je Hyeok!

282
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,790
You asshole!

283
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,560
Leo?

284
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,070
Leo!

285
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,830
By the way, why did you say "Leo"?

286
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,590
Does he ring the doorbell?

287
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,410
Why are you here? You didn't even call.

288
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,980
I went to the hotel because I had a surprise for you,

289
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,900
but they said you're on vacation.

290
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,760
That's why I came here right away.

291
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,180
You have another surprise for me? Even bigger than this?

292
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,240
What's wrong?

293
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,820
Did you and Leo...

294
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,780
Leo moved out.

295
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,250
I mean, I kicked him out.

296
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,900
How seriously did you fight that you kicked him out?

297
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,250
I don't want to say this since you're upset,

298
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:29,440
but I tried to stop you when you said you would marry Leo.

299
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,090
Someone with a job like that is rarely trustworthy.

300
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,870
"Someone with a job like that"?

301
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,860
How about Je Hyeok? How trustworthy is your husband?

302
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,100
Apparently, there's a phrase they use in gambling.

303
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,600
The one who wonders who the pushover in the game

304
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,440
is actually the pushover.

305
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,690
What are you talking about?

306
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,490
You're that pushover!

307
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:07,010
You think you're so classy and smart, but you get fooled more than anyone.

308
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,740
You're a fool, an idiot, and a pushover!

309
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,130
Hey.

310
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,990
Yoon Hae Mi, are you crazy?

311
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,020
Yu Jeong.

312
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,970
I won't tell you anything about your husband.

313
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:38,920
This is the last nice thing... I can do for you.

314
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,450
Bye now.

315
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,260

316
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,380

317
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,740
Jae Yi!

318
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,450
You should've come in.

319
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,440
Why were you hovering in front of the door?

320
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,010
I'm not hungry. I had blood sausage soup.

321
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,310
Eat just a little.

322
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:01,520
Right, you called me yesterday?

323
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,520
I was totally out of it yesterday because of Yoo Na.

324
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,300
- Yoo Na?
 - She was here yesterday.

325
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:17,390
She asked me to pick up medicine, but she got so drunk while I was gone.

326
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,100
I had to take her to the hotel.

327
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,530
I see.

328
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,020
That's it. Aren't you curious about it?

329
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,510
Well, it's possible to take a drunk woman home.

330
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,960
Is the broth kind of bland?

331
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,430
I put ribs and chicken stock in it,

332
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,240
so I didn't add the soup mix.

333
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:54,080
What kind of ramyeon doesn't have soup mix in them?

334
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,820
No wonder. That's why it was kind of bland.

335
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,000
You should watch your health. You eat ramyeon all the time.

336
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,970
Thank you for taking care of me.

337
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,350

338
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,920
Jae Yi.

339
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,150
To be honest─

340
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,410
 Kang Hoo Hyung!

341
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,260
Hyung! Are you in there?

342
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,400
You were in here.

343
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,010
I got kicked out,

344
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,700
but I have nowhere to go.

345
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,540
Since I married Noona Hae Mi,

346
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,130
I cut off ties with everyone.

347
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,740
Did you have a fight with Hae Mi?

348
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,350
Well...

349
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,510
That's what married couples do.

350
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:02,360
By chance, did she find out that you were working at Ace Bar?

351
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,810
Excuse me?

352
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,780
How did you know?

353
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,930
I'm running ahead of Do Jae Yi.

354
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,980
I am very happy about it, too!

355
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,400
If you help me out this time, I will never forget it.

356
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,130
Of course!

357
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,610
I'll see you tomorrow, CEO.

358
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,590
Thank you!

359
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,060
I need to talk to you.

360
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,030
Did something happen between you and Hae Mi?

361
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:58,030
Between Hae Mi and me?

362
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:04,400
Hae Mi said she was doing me a favor by not telling me about you.

363
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,410
What does that mean, anyway?

364
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,910
She has a secret, too.

365
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,310
But she told you my secret?

366
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,080
It's not even a secret.

367
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,510
Everyone has a history.

368
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,150
What do you mean "history"?

369
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,930
I used to work at Ace Bar.

370
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,180
I needed money to go to the US.

371
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,430
B-By Ace Bar...

372
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,310
You mean the kind of job Leo did?

373
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,510
What do you mean "that kind of job"?

374
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:44,400
Are you also the type of person who ranks people based on their occupation?

375
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,350
But...

376
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,520
But hiding something like that from me─

377
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,530
How about you? Aren't you hiding anything from me?

378
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,530
I don't get women.

379
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:07,090
You never know what kind of men they dated with elegant and pretty faces of theirs.

380
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,380
Wh-What men?

381
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,570
I won't say it with my own mouth.

382
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:22,580
That's my consideration for you.

383
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,610
Is it true that you're the person in charge at Ace Bar?

384
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,350
In charge of running the business?

385
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,760
A person in charge?

386
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,430
I just manage the VVIP customers.

387
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,670
I'm only doing that because Mr. Jung threatened me.

388
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,570
- Threatened?
 - Yes.

389
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:03,420
Mr. Jung told me that if I don't do what he says,

390
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,030
he'll sell drugs to Noona Hae Mi.

391
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,680
He dragged you into the club because of Hae Mi.

392
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,680
Song Je Hyeok, that bastard is playing all four of us.

393
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,510
Song Je Hyeok is...

394
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,690
Noona Yu Jeong's husband?

395
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,070
Yes, for the customers you manage...

396
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,750
The real person in charge of the secret club is Song Je Hyeok.

397
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,350
What?

398
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,510
How could that be possible?

399
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,930
I was not going to tell Hae Mi and Yu Jeong

400
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,580
until I found out everything about him.

401
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:58,310
I thought that was a way to protect them.

402
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,400
But even they seem to be in danger now.

403
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,610
Have fun at the kindergarten, Na Na.

404
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,860
Ahjumma!

405
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,240
Wait here for a moment.

406
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,580
Seriously! Why did you come back this time?

407
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,970
You didn't answer my calls or texts.

408
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,090
You can't be doing this.

409
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,020
You know how much I paid you.

410
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,500
I'll give you the money back if you want me to.

411
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,900
But I'll be in trouble if I stay in touch with you!

412
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,080
Ms. Ju told me that if you came back one more time,

413
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,580
she would get a restraining order or something like that.

414
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,400
Forget about the money.

415
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,200
Let me hug Na Na for the last time.

416
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,160
That's okay, right?

417
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:32,050
Then, I don't need to give you the money back?

418
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,060
Na Na, just wait a bit.

419
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,430
We'll see each other again soon.

420
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,960
T-That's enough.

421
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,300
Let's go. Let's hurry.

422
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,510
You lifted your head up.

423
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,380
They say politics and golf have one thing in common.

424
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,410
You fail the moment you lift your head up.

425
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,480
Let's go for lunch.

426
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,690
We can discuss how to strike a ball with an impact, too.

427
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:02,010
Should we just have one drink?

428
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,960
You must be thirsty after exercising.

429
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:18,520
You must be having a headache because of Song Je Hyeok lately.

430
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:25,600
If you came here to tell me that he's the one who killed my son,

431
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,870
you're wasting your time.

432
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,100
I don't give up on people that easily.

433
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,090
You don't give up on people easily.

434
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:37,980
That's why you still want to keep him by putting a leash on him?

435
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,710
I heard you're trying to get the mask from Go Yoo Na.

436
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:49,510
But Song Je Hyeok told me that just because there's his blood on the mask,

437
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:53,150
it doesn't prove that he sexually assaulted me.

438
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,770
But if you still need that leash for him,

439
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,620
it means that the mask is still useful.

440
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,110
What did you try to do with it?

441
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,600
That's why I'm trying to find out the value of that mask myself.

442
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,850
You should come and join us.

443
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:35,770

444
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,480

445
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:57,420

446
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,370

447
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:25,290

448
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,270
Would you be okay?

449
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,620
To be honest, I'm not okay.

450
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:49,150
Thinking about that night, I still feel so scared and tormented even now.

451
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,260
But I've been waiting for 10 years.

452
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,990
For a day like this.

453
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,480
 I was sexually assaulted.

454
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,170
 - There was someone wearing a mask that night─ 
- Here we go again!

455
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,130
 You're bringing up that mask again?

456
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:10,210
No one would believe me even though I told the truth 10 years ago.

457
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,970
 Don't make the case get even bigger.

458
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,630
 That would be better for you, too.

459
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,260
I'm no longer the same person anymore.

460
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,900
 So, you should get stronger, so you can defend yourself.

461
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,090
 Power is stronger than the law.

462
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:33,520
Now people pay attention to what I have to say.

463
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,820
Also, they will believe what I say to be true.

464
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,590
It's Do Jae Yi!

465
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,130
Thank you for coming, Assemblyman Gi.

466
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,070
Ms. Do invited me herself.

467
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:19,230
How could I not come?

468
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,060
You must've been surprised that I invited you.

469
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:28,860
I hope you believe what I have to say today.

470
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,730
Why do you think Jae Yi invited all of us?

471
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,810
I'm not sure.

472
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,120
I guess we're about to find out.

473
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,060
Hae Mi, you came.

474
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,330
You came, Hae Mi.

475
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:13,660
I'm waiting for you... to respond.

476
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,150
Respond to what?

477
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,150
I guess it's getting started.

478
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,940
Let's have a seat.

479
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,610
Yes.

480
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:09,870
Everyone, I want to greet you not as a candidate tonight but a different person.

481
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:14,350
Hello, I'm Attorney Do Jae Yi.

482
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,440
The reason I invited you here tonight is for the female victims of sexual assault.

483
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:34,990
Before we get to the main event, let's watch the video messages the victims sent me.

484
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:40,070
 I almost died when I was date raped five years ago.

485
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:44,130
 Thanks to Attorney Do, I was able to start a new life.

486
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:48,170
 You saved my life. I love you.

487
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,520
 Attorney Do even helped me learn how to do manicures.

488
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,920
 I have a will to live now.

489
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,970
 I'll never forget your kindness. Thank you.

490
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:01,770
 I want you to become the mayor of Tongju and help even more victims.

491
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,090
 I'll cheer you on.

492
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:18,620
I'm sure there are many more people who couldn't come forward.

493
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:27,530
That's why I'm thinking of being brave like them tonight.

494
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:36,350
To be honest, I'm a victim of sexual assault myself.

495
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,710
The reason I couldn't reveal it is

496
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:56,950
because no one believed me 10 years ago.

497
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:01,150
But I think things are different now.

498
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:08,140
In order to reveal the truth about that day, I've been collecting evidence.

499
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:14,380
I'm about to reveal who sexually assaulted me.

500
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,730
The culprit is...

501
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,940
This.

502
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,890
The man who wore this mask sexually assaulted me 10 years ago.

503
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:51,010
And I know the man who was behind that mask.

504
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,380
 My gosh, what happened?

505
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,190
Isn't that Assemblyman Gi's son?

506
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,410
Are those the three of you in the video?

507
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:34,940
Is Assemblyman Gi's son the one who sexually assaulted you?

508
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:37,870
Are the three of you involved in Gi Do Shik's murder?

509
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:41,250
Are you the one who's in the video, Ms. Do?

510
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,180
Ms. Do! Ms. Do!

511
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,720
Do you have anything else to say?

512
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,580
Jae Yi!

513
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,040
I'll find out what's going on.

514
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:28,380
 That's why I'm trying to find out the value of that mask myself.

515
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,030
 You should come and join us.

516
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,400
 You didn't believe me, but the public will believe in what I have to say.

517
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:44,170
Looks like you scored.

518
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:48,480
Jae Yi's event is all over the internet.

519
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,640
Are you here to thank me or something?

520
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,500
If you watch the video, you don't look like the culprit, at least.

521
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,960
It looks like it was one of the three.

522
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,500
I'm thankful that you tried, but I don't know what to say.

523
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,030
It was a wasted effort.

524
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:11,580
I'll reveal that I'm your ex-wife.

525
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:16,400
Having a murderer ex-wife will entirely ruin your image.

526
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,030
Looks like you're completely mistaken.

527
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,000
You married Jake, not Song Je Hyeok.

528
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,050
There's no record that Song Je Hyeok married you.

529
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,980
I knew you would deny it.

530
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,020
Do you know what this is?

531
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:43,800
It's the proof that Na Na's DNA matches mine.

532
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:48,160
You can't escape me as long as Na Na exists.

533
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:53,140
So give her to me,

534
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,850
and take off your disgusting mask and pay for your sin!

535
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,370
Either would be difficult.

536
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,790
I can't give you Na Na because she was already too exposed in the campaign.

537
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,970
And I already took off the disgusting mask.

538
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,760
I'm Song Je Hyeok all the way through.

539
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,620
I'll give you just one day to sort things out.

540
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:25,350
If you miss the deadline, you'll go back to being lowly Jake.

541
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,560
What's going on?

542
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,560
What the hell is...

543
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,600
How did a video like that...

544
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,390
Who would do this now?

545
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:08,530
By chance... could it be Yoo Na?

546
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:16,030
Do you think... I played that video?

547
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:28,200
You're suspicious of me again.

548
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,150
Can't you tell from the video? I wasn't there.

549
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:37,770
You were the ones who went to that room that day,

550
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,230
but I went to prison instead.

551
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:46,140
I had to go to the US, even after I got out.

552
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:52,800
Did you even imagine how unjust I felt?

553
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:02,750
I'm so sorry I didn't believe you 10 years ago.

554
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,230
But we were fooled, too.

555
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,620
You just found that out, too.

556
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,820
Yes.

557
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,750
You guys were fooled, too.

558
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:21,510
Let's not argue about the past.

559
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:25,860
What's important is that we're still in hell.

560
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,280
Because of that bastard.

561
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,180
Hold on.

562
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,050
I get that Yoo Na wasn't the culprit.

563
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,330
Who the hell is the culprit, then?

564
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,150
Jae Yi.

565
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:47,580
We're still in hell because of that bastard?

566
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,030
Who's that bastard?

567
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:01,440
Let me tell you.

568
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:09,940
That bastard Jae Yi was referring to... is Song Je Hyeok.

569
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,010
Your husband.

570
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,440
What?

571
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:19,260
That's why Jae Yi prepared this event, too.

572
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:23,400
Song Je Hyeok is the one who raped Jae Yi and killed Gi Do Shik!

573
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:27,220
She tried to expose him.

574
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,130
Are you crazy?

575
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,990
Stop.

576
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,890
Yu Jeong, I don't think it sounds totally ridiculous.

577
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:41,590
I mean, thinking about it, Yoo Na might be right.

578
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,950
Hae Mi, how could you do this now?

579
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,680
Your husband threatened me!

580
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,540
He wanted Jae Yi's ledger.

581
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:52,570
Your husband is a scary man.

582
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,990
Do you think he couldn't have murdered someone?

583
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:57,990
Yoon Hae Mi!

584
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:00,810
Seriously.

585
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:09,280
I admit it! He has flaws, too!

586
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,390
He said he used to work at a bar. But so what?

587
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:14,470
That's it.

588
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:18,620
He's not this horrible person you guys think he is!

589
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,540
Yu Jeong.

590
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,020
Yoo Na is right.

591
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:30,640
The one who raped me and killed Gi Do Shik is your husband, Song Je Hyeok.

592
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,290
Don't insult my husband!

593
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,120
If you insult him one more time,

594
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,360
I won't forgive you, even though you're my friends.

595
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,950
Hey, Ju Yu Jeong! I'm not done talking.

596
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,500
Let me finish!

597
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,820
Go away!

598
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,260
Yu Jeong, calm down and listen to me.

599
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,810
- I─ 
 - Go away!

600
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,030
Hey! Ju Yu Jeong!

601
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:00,530
Don't touch me!

602
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:03,000
Don't touch me!

603
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,600
I'm pregnant.

604
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:12,440
But... according to you guys,

605
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:18,160
my baby's dad is a rapist and a murderer.

606
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,240
How am I supposed to believe that?

607
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,110
How am I supposed to believe that?

608
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:41,410
No matter what you guys say, I believe in Je Hyeok.

609
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:47,000
Because that'd be what's best for my child.

610
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,100
I don't think there's a choice anymore.

611
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:58,750
I think it's... over for us now.

612
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,200
Completely.

613
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,130
Are you okay?

614
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:30,350
Yes, I'm okay.

615
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,370
I'm okay.

616
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:45,970
 Baby, what kind of person is your dad?

617
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:50,340
 What kind of man am I living with?

618
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,180
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!

619
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:26,830

620
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:31,840
 Noona, it looked like something happened, according to the internet.

621
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,710
 - Are you okay?  
- Leo.

622
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,800
Help me.

623
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:44,520
I think I'm completely screwed!

624
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,130
What should I do?

625
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,650
What should I do?

626
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,170
 Maybe it's all my fault.

627
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,000
 I shouldn't have gotten involved in your lives to begin with.

628
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,950
 There's only one way for us to survive.

629
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:32,280
 Song Je Hyeok. Finding his weakness.

630
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:44,840
 We still don't know who they are and what they do as a group.

631
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:50,210
 But they all wear masks.

632
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:55,130
 I'll become one of them today.

633
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,600
 Wearing this mask.

634
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:04,900
 When the lights go off at the orphanage that was filled with children's laughter,

635
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,410
 their party gets started.

636
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:13,900
 First of all, the party's symbol is masks.

637
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,220
 In order to enter the party,

638
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:19,530
 you have to go through a strict identification process.

639
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,600
 If you go inside after you pass, an employee is waiting for you.

640
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,540
Come this way.

641
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,270
♫  Oh, now. Unmask  ♫

642
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:30,490
You came late.

643
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,780
♫  The curtain rises and will reveal everything  ♫

644
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,340
♫  Spotlight the truth  ♫

♫   beneath the door of closely guarded secrets  ♫

646
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,410
Have a pleasant time.

647
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:52,550
 A deep and dark stairway is taking me to the secret party venue.

648
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:58,370
Could you please enter your membership number?

649
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:00,670
 Checking identification one more time.

650
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:05,210
 Leo, could you put me on the member list of the club?

651
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:07,330
 I can't just add you,

652
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:11,770
But I can give you the number of a customer who is out of the country.

653
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:15,310
♫  Oh, Now. Unmask  ♫

654

01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,500
Ma'am. You need to turn in your phone.

659
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,020
You're not allowed to record anything inside.

660
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:37,830
♫  On top of the tightrope show, everything is blood stained  ♫

661
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:39,280
You've been confirmed.

662
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,220
Have a pleasant time.

663
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,780
 The Angel's Club is unveiling in front of my eyes.

664
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:58,810
 It's... a party of their own.

665
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:14,570
 The space doesn't even have a security camera.

666
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:19,870
 It's a completely secreti space where no recording is allowed.

667
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:25,090
 They make the children work, but all they do is serving?

668
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:31,960

669
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:37,540
 Why is this area being filmed by the security camera?

670
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:03,530
 Hey, hey, because of you...

671
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:17,770

672
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,690
 Go to hell,

673
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:37,870
 along with the disgusting memories.

674
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:46,920

675
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:51,900

676
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,410
♫  The dark desire hidden behind a mask  ♫

677
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,920
♫  They're liars  ♫

678
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:04,410
♫  The truth is completely hidden behind a curtain  ♫

679
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:06,480
♫  My glamorous image  ♫

680
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,850
 ~ Preview ~ 
Is it true that the club's records were leaked?

681
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:14,400
 The entire truth behind the club is on here.

682
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,980
 Do you know how rashly your daughter has been behaving?

683
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,930
 Too much of anything brings about trouble.

684
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,420
 You know about cutting off the tail, right?

685
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:26,760
 Make the members ditch Song Je Hyeok.

686
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,260
 Do you know how I came all the way here?

687
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,800
 Do you call yourself a human?

688
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,740
 You show up now when she's in that condition?

689
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,700
 Is that stupid election that important? She's about to die!

690
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,820
 Na Na!

691
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,600
 Hey, if I lose the election, I'm dead!

692
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,130
 Everything comes after I win the election.

693
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:49,790
 Mr. Jung, clone a phone for me.
