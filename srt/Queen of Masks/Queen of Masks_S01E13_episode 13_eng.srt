1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,630

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,420

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,240
I heard you have something to say regarding Attorney Do.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,110
First of all,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,600
I was the one who told them to turn the CCTV off at the hotel.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,540
Why did you tell them to do that?

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,490
This is embarrassing to say, but I have a child out of wedlock.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,240
I invited her to the hotel, but I didn't want a record of it.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:42,440
But the employee turned it back on too quickly. Like a fool.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,570
Hold on.

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,150
Who's that child out of wedlock?

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,410
- Could it be...
 - Yes.

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,980
It's Attorney Do Jae Yi right here.

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,740
You were at the hotel with me that night in my office.

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,590
Jae Yi, let's not hide it anymore.

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,980
But you know, I think I saw something that night.

17
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,100
I can tell them, right, Jae Yi?

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,910
 Do you still care about the truth?

19
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,420
 Sometimes, the truth could hurt you.

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:35,010
 And your search for the truth could hurt someone who's precious to you, too.

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,940
What did you see? Did you see anyone suspicious?

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,670
I should better tell them, right?

23
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,460
We need to tell them anything that could be clues,

24
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,730
so they could find out the truth quickly.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,410
Tell us what you saw that night.

26
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,330
I went to the hotel past 10 p.m. that night.

27
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:10,890

28
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,260

29
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,550
 When I just got on the elevator,

30
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,330
 I saw a man in black clothes and a black cap

31
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,920
behind a pillar.

32
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,880
Did it say the letter "N" on the cap?

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,190
I remember it because I found it suspicious that he was hiding.

34
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,600
Did you see his face?

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,420
I couldn't see more because the elevator door shut right away.

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Black clothes and a black cap.

37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,600
The letter "N" on the cap.

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,240
Let me ask Attorney Do one more time, then.

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,320
You went to Grand Kangbo Hotel around 04:11 in the morning yesterday,

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,050
and you came out around 04:31.

41
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,760
Is it true that you were with Chairman Kang Il Gu in his office during that time?

42
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,030

43
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,010

44
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,060
Jae Yi! Jae Yi!

45
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,060
If you follow the chairman now, your relationship with him will be revealed.

46
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,350
Would you be okay with that?

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,120
 It's true.

48
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,380
What you're thinking is true.

49
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,960
Kangbo Group's Chairman Kang Il Gu

50
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,720
is my biological father.

51
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,930
That's how you were able to turn off the CCTV at Kangbo Hotel.

52
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,320
Because your father owns the hotel.

53
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,670
Is that why you protected him?

54
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,760
I'm kind of disappointed in you.

55
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,390
Why didn't you tell us that your father is a chairman of a conglomerate?

56
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,130
Shouldn't you be proud of that?

57
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,220
I'm not proud.

58
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,310
I'm hurt because of it.

59
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,600
I never thought of him as my father, not even for a moment.

60
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,580
Yes, I could see that.

61
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,750
By the way, why did the CCTV go back on?

62
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,370
Did it go back on? Why?

63
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,020
Since when?

64
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,800
Don't worry.

65
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,870
I'm the only one who got caught on the CCTV.

66
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,090
Also, Yoo Na was able to clear her name because of that.

67
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,600
It confirmed that you were just following me to the hotel without going in.

68
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,510
But your father...

69
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:09,080
I mean, Chairman Kang. Why did he come to the police station?

70
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,330
It's obvious. It was to get Jae Yi out.

71
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,880
You don't think of him as your father, but he must've thought of you as his daughter.

72
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,300
He did 10 years ago and now, too.

73
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,020
Anyway, I just realized that you have many secrets, Jae Yi.

74
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,520
How about you?

75
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,920
What about me?

76
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,530
 My husband and Hae Mi?

77
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,830
 Hae Mi is my friend.

78
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,600
 We're very close.

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,480
 What do you mean, the relationship between my husband and her?

80
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,550
 According to his note, he gave money to Yoon Hae Mi.

81
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,400
 It was a large amount, too.

82
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,430
 Did you really not know anything?

83
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,180
 By chance,

84
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,010
 was that about 10 billion won?

85
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,990
 Did you know?

86
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,080
Aren't you hiding anything from me?

87
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,870
The investment money Mariela Hotel gave our foundation...

88
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,230
Didn't you take it back?

89
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,430
 What kind of nonsense is that?

90
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,260
 Did that bastard...

91
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,100
 Did he do drugs by chance?

92
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,110
 I heard they found drugs at the scene.

93
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,690
 Why would he have messed around with an important transaction record?

94
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,320
 If the autopsy report says he was killed,

95
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,680
 you'd become a suspect starting then.

96
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,660
 A monetary relationship is as strong of a motive for murder as a romantic one.

97
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,740
Hey, did you forget that your husband tricked Leo and me?

98
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,840
I might've received threats, but not money.

99
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,380
Looks like you assumed wrong.

100
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,640
I'm sorry if that's not true,

101
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,290
but he definitely hid the money somewhere.

102
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,750
I'll make sure to get that money back.

103
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,750
That way, I could protect the foundation.

104
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,010
Whatever!

105
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,160
I feel kind of crappy. I'll get going.

106
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,610
I'll head out first.

107
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,120
Hae Mi! Hae Mi!

108
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,590
Did the police say that Hae Mi received money?

109
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,410
Yes.

110
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,460
Even in cash.

111
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,130
They wouldn't have said that for no reason.

112
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,540
But there's no way she would've received his money.

113
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,260
There must be an error.

114
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,840
Gil Man Ok?

115
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,180
Isn't Gil Man Ok Hae Mi's mother?

116
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,880
Hae Mi's mom might've received that money.

117
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,500
Whether it's money laundering or a slush fund,

118
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,300
she does all the dirty work for important figures.

119
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,260
But still, it's Hae Mi's mom.

120
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,970
It's the nanny.

121
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,430
She's on the way home from the hospital with Na Na.

122
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,290
Could I stay with Na Na here for a while, then?

123
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,390
Of course.

124
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,380
I should get going now, too.

125
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,150
Why? You should stay and see Na Na, too.

126
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,690
Well...

127
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,750
I need to stop by somewhere.

128
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,820
Drinking in the morning again?

129
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,980
Get up, Mom.

130
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,250
Get up!

131
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,960
I told you to get up!

132
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,640
You almost made my liver drop!
  (Korean idiom saying "scared the crap out of me")

133
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,470
You won't have any liver left if you drink like this every day!

134
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,100
Why are you doing this? You won't even go home!

135
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,870
I'm scared to be alone.

136
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,420
You know. That bastard hurt me last time.

137
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,720
You've been the godmother of the adult entertainment industry for 30 years,

138
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,540
and you're scared of something like that!

139
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,900
Aren't you afraid of something else?

140
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,050
Afraid you'd be found out about receiving money from Song Je Hyeok?

141
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,180
I was at the police station.

142
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,540
You received money from him under my name, didn't you?

143
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,240
In cash, even.

144
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,010
What nonsense are you spewing?

145
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,020
Why would I receive money from him?

146
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,020
A huge amount, like 10 billion?

147
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,080
I never said it was 10 billion.

148
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,300
Mom.

149
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:39,530
By chance, did you kill him to get that money?

150
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,040
Are you crazy?

151
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,170
I didn't do it!

152
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,780
I really didn't do it!

153
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:55,430
He was worried his assets would be revealed because of the election,

154
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,150
so he asked me to hold onto it temporarily, and I did!

155
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,330
Why did you receive it under my name, then?

156
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,230
He insisted that I do so!

157
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,330
So he could take it back from you if I refused to return it!

158
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,950
Mom, let's give that money to Yu Jeong.

159
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,880
She's looking for that money right now!

160
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,820
If she tells the police she knows about that money─

161
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,470
No! That can never happen!

162
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,290
I... lost all of that money.

163
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,430
I tried to close the bar and help you start a hotel,

164
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,020
and lost it in an investment scam.

165
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,000
Mom!

166
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,540
I might end up... becoming a murderer!

167
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,780
Because of the money you received under my name!

168
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,130
Would you be okay with that?

169
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,450
Just insist that you don't know about it!

170
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,690
The one who gave the money died. How could they prove it?

171
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,180
But if they find out,

172
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,720
don't get me involved.

173
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,610
I would be dead if I got caught by the police.

174
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,000

175
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,110
Only authorized personnel are allowed.

176
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,240
I came to find out if he was okay.

177
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Could you tell me that, at least?

178
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,250
I can't tell you anything. Please leave.

179
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,890
It's you.

180
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,260
Pulmonary fibrosis?

181
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,680
They say his lungs are solidifying.

182
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,670
He doesn't even smoke. How did he get that kind of disease?

183
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,890
Don't be silly, Mom. So what if he doesn't smoke?

184
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,010
He breathes in all sorts of dirty air in this world.

185
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,310
By the way, won't you greet me?

186
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,550
I'm still your father's wife.

187
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,580
Hello.

188
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,630
Let's skip the greeting between us.

189
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,980
Do either of us want to be the other's sibling?

190
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:56,790
I knew he had a pregnant girlfriend before we married.

191
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,680
He promised me that it won't ever become a problem.

192
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,750
So I married him.

193
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:08,870
But recently, I learned that he broke that promise.

194
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,090
Son of a bitch.

195
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,030
Ten years ago,

196
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,490
Father started a paper company under your name in Hong Kong

197
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,220
and set money aside.

198
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,500
Not less than 300,000 dollars.

199
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,380
Didn't you know?

200
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,550
Under my name?

201
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,770
He never said a kind word to me,

202
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,750
but he has been setting aside a fortune for you, little by little.

203
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,150
He's getting what he deserves with the illness.

204
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:48,080
It's for deceiving us for 10 years.

205
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,520
You should care for him. I'm not interested in doing so.

206
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,260
If it is three hundred thousand dollars...

207
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,610
that would be enough to pay for a caretaker, right?

208
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,710
Thank you in advance.

209
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,690
I would like to ask you something.

210
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,490
Why did the CCTV go on at dawn?

211
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,980
You definitely said it would be off until morning.

212
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,910
I won't ask you what you did at the hotel that day.

213
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,000
I made a mistake with the CCTV.

214
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,730
I thought that was enough time,

215
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,560
so I turned it back on before people came in for work.

216
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,720
That's why I went to the police station.

217
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,710
Because my mistake put you in trouble.

218
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,240
Is that why you said you saw someone suspicious?

219
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,220
It's true that I saw someone.

220
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,970
But it also had another purpose.

221
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:38,030
If I draw their attention to someone else, they will suspect you less.

222
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,070
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

223
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,160
Why did you reveal that I'm your daughter for my alibi?

224
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,130
And what's with the paper company?

225
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,790
Why are you causing chaos out of the blue?

226
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,710
You ditched my mom and me like an old pair of shoes.

227
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm not sure.

228
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,890
Ten years ago and even now, I don't care about other things.

229
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,430
I just hope you don't get involved in anything dangerous.

230
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,750
That way, your life would become easy.

231
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,610
I'm glad that she looks healthy.

232
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,670
But you still can't let your guard down.

233
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,520
The cholangitis could come back anytime.

234
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm sorry. I should've cared for her better.

235
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,140
You haven't been her mother for that long.

236
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,950
I'm the one that needs to be blamed.

237
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,700
I gave birth to her with the illness, and let him take her away.

238
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,930
It's mostly my fault.

239
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,350
Did you apply for a liver transplant?

240
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,480
Yes, I submitted my file to the organ transplant center

241
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,170
and did the first round of tests, too.

242
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,490
I'm her biological mother, and we have the same blood type.

243
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,790
There won't be any problems.

244
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,790
It's Mom!

245
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,940
Yes.

246
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,790
Yes, let's go to sleep.

247
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,040
 I might end up becoming a murderer!

248
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,340
 Because of the money you received under my name!

249
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,010
 Just insist that you don't know about it!

250
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,510
 The one who gave the money died. How could they prove it?

251
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,520
 But if they find out, don't get me involved.

252
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,570
 I would be dead if I got caught by the police.

253
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:16,690
She's worrying... more about herself than me.

254
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,670

255
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,840
Where did she go?

256
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,710
Noona!

257
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,550
Why are you drinking on the floor? We have a table.

258
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,050
Don't you feel like this sometimes?

259
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,310
I just wanted to collapse on the floor.

260
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,080
You're already drunk. Stop drinking.

261
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,610
Hear me out, Noona.

262
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,330
I find Kang Hoo Hyung kind of suspicious.

263
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,680
Remember I went out because Mother-in-law came over yesterday?

264
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,090
I went to Kang Hoo Hyung's restaurant.

265
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,150
 Well, when will you pay me?

266
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,530
 I want to leave the country before I get caught.

267
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,230
 I'll contact you when it's ready.

268
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,860
He was having a strange conversation with a stranger.

269
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,290
 Leave through the back door.

270
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,520
He was suddenly drinking a lot, too.

271
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,550
He seemed very different from his usual self.

272
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,630
People can be different from their usual selves.

273
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:24,880
But you shouldn't go crazy, at least.

274
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,600
Go crazy? Who did?

275
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,190
My mom.

276
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,280
Mother-in-law went crazy? What do you mean?

277
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,880
Shouldn't a parent try to take the blame no matter what

278
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,580
when their child is accused of murder?

279
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,920
But my mom is the opposite.

280
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,030
Even if I become a murderer, she told me not to get her involved.

281
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,140
What kind of mother is she?

282
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,650
You must've misunderstood something. You're mistaken!

283
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,710
Leo.

284
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,730
No matter what everyone said,

285
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,040
no matter how often they called me...

286
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,590
the daughter of a hostess,

287
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:29,080
I thought of my mom... as a dependable shield.

288
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:37,610
I thought she would protect me, even when the biggest storm comes.

289
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,590
Whom should I trust now?

290
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,920
It feels like the whole world collapsed.

291
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Na Na, you have to eat well, so you don't get sick.

292
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,860
Let's eat now.

293
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,440
Where did Dad go?

294
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,180
I don't see him anywhere.

295
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,220
Do you miss your dad?

296
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,140
It's not that.

297
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,460
I went to kindergarten, and the kids said he died.

298
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,850
They said I don't have a dad anymore.

299
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,350
Do I really not have a dad anymore?

300
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,560
It's true, Na Na.

301
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,160
You don't have a dad anymore.

302
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,620
He went somewhere far away.

303
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,300
But Na Na, not all the children in the world have a dad.

304
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,360
You can still live happily.

305
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,550
Also, you have two moms who love you more than anyone in the world.

306
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,270
- You will be happier that way.
 - No!

307
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,680
I don't have two moms. I have one!

308
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,720
Yes, I'm sorry.

309
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,830
I made a mistake. You have one mom.

310
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,590
I miss Mom!

311
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,540
Mom!

312
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,910
Yes, Na Na.

313
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,740
Tell that ahjumma to leave.

314
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,050
I don't like her!

315
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,350
Mom!

316
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,460
She just fell asleep.

317
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,350
I let her sleep in my bed because she wanted to.

318
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,370
Na Na asked me where her dad was earlier.

319
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,150
I guess the kids at kindergarten brought him up.

320
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:38,960
The news reported his death.

321
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:46,300
They probably overheard from their parents and told Na Na.

322
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,580
So how did you explain it to her?

323
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,280
I told her the truth.

324
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,810
She would find out eventually, anyway.

325
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,200
But I think that's making her obsess over you more.

326
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,900
She's afraid her mom might disappear, too.

327
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,790
Yoo Na, she's still a little kid.

328
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,640
That's why she's like this. Don't be so upset.

329
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,550
Yu Jeong.

330
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,590
How do you think I felt becoming Emily Go, Jung Goo Tae's mistress?

331
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:41,310
I did work as a hostess, but at least I had self-esteem.

332
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:46,560
But I didn't care about feeling mortified and humiliated.

333
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:55,040
I would've done worse things to come to Korea to see Na Na.

334
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,300
That's how I reunited with Na Na after all that.

335
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,300
Do you think I would want anything more?

336
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,200
I want nothing more now.

337
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,590
My only wish is to donate my liver to Na Na

338
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,040
and make her healthy.

339
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,190
That's all.

340
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,590
So Yu Jeong,

341
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,880
don't worry about me,

342
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:42,110
and I would like you to care for her, so she doesn't feel anxious.

343
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,120
That's what I ask of you.

344
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,900
Yes, I will.

345
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,400
When things get sorted out at the foundation─

346
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,980
 Mom! Mom! Mom!

347
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,040
 Mom!

348
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,610
Yes, Mom's here!

349
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,890
Are you okay?

350
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,150
I'll get you some water.

351
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:49,150
 Did it say the letter "N" on the cap?

352
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,050
 I remember it because I found it suspicious that he was hiding.

353
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,620
You must be tired from going to the police station today.

354
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,030
I'll help if you need an alibi for that night.

355
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,590
I can tell them that you were here with me that night.

356
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,140
You weren't here that night at that time, Kang Hoo.

357
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:39,600
Did you say the CCTV didn't work to hide that?

358
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,000
That's right.

359
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,270
I got rid of the CCTV footage.

360
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,030
I can't tell you now, but I had a reason, Jae Yi.

361
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,890
You came to the hotel that night. Why did you come there?

362
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,320
Also, why did you have to hide it from me?

363
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,800
Chairman Kang must have seen me.

364
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,240
I was following Secretary Choi that night.

365
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,400
Secretary Choi?

366
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,610
Assemblyman Gi's secretary?

367
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,100
Jae Yi, I'm confused right now, too.

368
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,080
I'll tell you everything once I figure things out. Everything.

369
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,500
I care about the truth as much as you do.

370
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,690
Please wait for a bit.

371
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,990
Let me ask you just one thing.

372
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,210
Song Je Hyeok's death.

373
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,740
Does it have to do with you?

374
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,840
No. Not at all.

375
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,130
Okay, then.

376
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,580

377
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,150
Yes, Hyung. Did you look into Myung Eun Soo?

378
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,070
 You think I have nothing better to do?

379
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,980
I asked you to

380
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,890
find the security guard who disappeared after turning the CCTV off the day Gi Do Shik died.

381
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:14,420
 Geez! How could I find someone who escaped abroad 10 years ago?

382
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,050
 He apparently came to Korea recently.

383
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,770
 I guess he's hiding from the debt collectors

384
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,920
 after losing all the money at a casino in the Philippines.

385
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,350
 Happy now? Geez.

386
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,270
Where's Myung Eun Soo right now?

387
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,970
Welcome.

388
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,890
I'm looking for someone.

389
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,890
I heard someone named Myung Eun Soo works here.

390
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,240
Oh, Mr. Myung?

391
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,330
He must be organizing stuff in the back.

392
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,050
Hey, Mr. Myung!

393
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,560
Yes?

394
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,680
As I said earlier, I can't talk about it.

395
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,040
They said they would kill me if I did.

396
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:18,030
So, you did turn the CCTV off that night following someone's order, right?

397
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,170
I heard you have a gambling debt in the Philippines.

398
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:29,740
You must need money to be on the run.

399
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,750
I'll give you money for it.

400
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,530
So tell me. Who was it?

401
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:44,600
The one who told you to turn the CCTV off 10 years ago at the hotel.

402
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,960
Continue living like that, then. Getting chased by debt collectors.

403
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,560
- I'll pay for this meal.
 - Hold on a sec.

404
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:09,630
To be honest, I can't exactly remember who gave me that order,

405
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,870
but I can tell you who paid me and told me to escape the country.

406
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,040
Who was that?

407
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,300
I haven't been following the news in Korea.

408
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,890
I didn't even read the newspaper.

409
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,470
But I happened to see an article.

410
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,760
That person was in this photo.

411
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,090
I was so shocked.

412
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,630
Do you mean Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul?

413
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,960
It's not him.

414
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,530
It's him.

415
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,150
This person gave me money and told me to leave Korea.

416
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:03,530
 Keep in mind that you can never come back to Korea.

417
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,380
This is Assemblyman Gi's secretary.

418
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,540
That means Assemblyman Gi made you do it.

419
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:21,380
Why would he make you escape the country

420
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,960
after turning the CCTV off on the night his son died?

421
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,320
How am I supposed to know that?

422
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,600
It was definitely him!

423
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,260
I was so scared.

424
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,380
I could never forget it.

425
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,270
Never!

426
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,640

427
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,610
Hello, sir.

428
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,390
There must be something else.

429
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:05,660

430
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,340
 He's moving toward a different direction than Assemblyman Gi's house today.

431
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,830

432
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,380
What is Secretary Choi doing here?

433
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,000
 Just give me some time.

434
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,330
 I'll tell you when things become clearer.

435
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,810
Is he the one who told you to turn the CCTV off?

436
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,890
Yes, that's him.

437
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,470
By the way, who is he?

438
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,980
You don't need to know.

439
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,420
Here's the money I promised.

440
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,370
Thank you!

441
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,830
But you don't seem like a detective.

442
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:53,140
You're not trying to get money out of me using this, either.

443
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,750
Why are you digging up the past?

444
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,580
What if you end up getting hurt?

445
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,040
This is important to me.

446
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,550
An assemblyman's son died that night.

447
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,430
Remember what I said. Don't just ignore me.

448
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,390

449
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,390
Mom. Mom!

450
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,210
Ice Party?

451
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,630

452
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,580
 How are you feeling?

453
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,750
 I'm okay. Just worry about yourself.

454
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,580
Hello, District Attorney. This is Chairman Kang.

455
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,050
You must be busy investigating Angel's Club lately.

456
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:59,320
I need to tell you something about that case.

457
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:08,410
Have you heard about the rumor that Assemblyman Gi is on that list?

458
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,730
You must've been surprised that I called you suddenly.

459
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,420
Nice to meet you.

460
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,650
I'm Prosecutor Choi Kang Joon's brother, Choi Kang Hoo.

461
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,030
I'm OCS's Han Sang Gook.

462
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:24,710
Prosecutor Choi told me to help you as much as I can.

463
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,580
What can I help you with?

464
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:32,510
I heard you mostly wrote about Assemblyman Gi 10 years ago.

465
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,870
I've been chasing after him since I was a newbie.

466
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,970
But what do you want to know about him?

467
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,900
As I understand, he became a celebrity politician

468
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,940
when he exposed Kangbo Group's accounting fraud 10 years ago.

469
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,270
Kangbo Group tried to cut the tail off by getting rid of Kang Il Gu.

470
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,280
That's true.

471
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,960
Kang Il Gu isn't Kangbo Group's son. He's their son-in-law.

472
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,750
If so, Chairman Kang must've resented Assemblyman Gi then.

473
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,410
I'm sure it was more than that.

474
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:11,900
Chairman Kang must've wanted to kill Assemblyman Gi.

475
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,810
But their relationship completely changed since that incident.

476
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,460
That incident?

477
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,740
The case of Gi Do Shik, Assemblyman Gi's son.

478
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:26,220
The fact that he did drugs and was promiscuous could've been exposed,

479
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,650
but Chairman Kang stepped in and got rid of all the articles.

480
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,520
By threatening them to pull out corporate ads.

481
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,730
The reporters at the time said Chairman Kang is such a good person.

482
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:46,390
He actually saved the politician who used to be his enemy.

483
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:50,170
Their symbiotic relationship started then.

484
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:54,930
Assemblyman Gi is especially generous with Kangbo Group

485
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,650
and Chairman Kang is Assemblyman Gi's patron.

486
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,780
 The facts of the notorious illegal secret club, Angel's Club,

487
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,970
 which was in the basement of Chunsarang Orphanage, is starting to come out.

488
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,770
 Tongju District Prosecutors' Office, which is investigating this case

489
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:16,040
 concluded that the person who created and ran the Angel's Club, which was a hotbed of illegal activities

490
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,950
 such as dealing drugs, gambling, and sexual assault of minors,

491
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:23,170
 was Song Je Hyeok, the former chairman of Yeongun Foundation and

492
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,200
 Hangook Party's mayoral candidate of Tongju.

493
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,430
 The Prosecutors' Office will now investigate whether he had an accomplice.

494
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:36,210
 The object of the investigation will be to find the mastermind.

495
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,040
Do you think they could find the mastermind?

496
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,380
Looks like even the members don't know who it is.

497
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,340
If they can't find him, I should expose him.

498
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,840
I promised Assemblyman Gi that I'll save him,

499
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:56,570
but he's the one who provoked me and threatened my friends first.

500
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:01,720
I don't think you need to expose him yourself.

501
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,750
I just talked to an informant at the Prosecutors' Office,

502
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,300
and Assemblyman Gi was summoned as a material witness for the Angel's Club case.

503
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,910
Someone blew his cover.

504
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,160
Who was it?

505
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,310
Yes.

506
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,800
Song Je Hyeok's autopsy result came out?

507
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,970

508
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,320
I'll tell you the result of the autopsy.

509
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:48,650
To cut to the chase, we concluded that Mr. Song Je Hyeok

510
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,320
injected a large dose of drugs containing sleeping pills

511
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,920
and committed suicide.

512
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,970
What do you mean by suicide?

513
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,720
Why would he...

514
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,740
The reason is...

515
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:20,320
 because it was confirmed that the drug he used was from Ace Bar,

516
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,790
 and only his fingerprints were found on the syringe that was at the scene.

517
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,110
 And the bedsheet that was on him when he was found

518
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,970
 from the turndown service was provided at 8 p.m. that day.

519
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:38,330
Only his DNA was found on it as well.

520
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:44,790
No evidence to indicate murder was found at all.

521
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,560
By the way,

522
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,420
with only that much of drugs...

523
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,180
How much drugs did he take?

524
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:00,070
On his left arm, there were two needle marks.

525
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:04,490
Looks like he injected twice over a period of time.

526
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,660
Mr. Song sold drugs.

527
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,330
There's no way he wouldn't have known the lethal dose.

528
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,730
The reason why I'm telling you this to the four of you

529
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:24,010
is to apologize for making you uncomfortable with the forced investigation.

530
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:30,770
Then... this will be the conclusion of the case.

531
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,980
Get home safely.

532
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:51,850
It was probably a suicide, right?

533
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,920
I didn't see this coming at all.

534
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,950
He apparently injected twice. We only did it once.

535
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:05,580
I guess he had a sense of shame, at least.

536
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:09,110
He might've been a coward.

537
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,580
Everything was about to be exposed.

538
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,920
Will you have a funeral?

539
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,220
The whole world is criticizing him.

540
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,660
He did disgusting things at the orphanage.

541
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,680
I'll just cremate him without a funeral.

542
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,780
Yes, just burn him! He wasn't a good husband.

543
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,950
At least it's over.

544
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,320
But why do you think he put the bedsheet over him?

545
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,220
It's weird. He supposedly decided to die.

546
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,370
Were you thinking about that all this time?

547
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,330
Maybe it's like a mask.

548
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:01,310
He wanted to hide his hideous appearance.

549
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,600
He gave up on everything so easily?

550
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:13,350
He tried to survive somehow, even by putting on a mask.

551
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:17,690
I know how you feel right now.

552
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,970
You must feel uneasy.

553
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,570
We probably all feel that way.

554
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,030
Our goal was to get him killed by someone.

555
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:30,150
It's taken care of now.

556
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,940
Just enjoy yourself, Jae Yi.

557
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:38,590
The revenge you've been dreaming of for 10 years, is finally over.

558
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:07,080
I'm sorry for making you come when you're busy.

559
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,830
I thought it would be weird to invite just men.

560
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,080
Do you need us for something?

561
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,120
We hired a service to get rid of all of Song Je Hyeok's stuff,

562
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,240
but it keeps popping up. It's so gross.

563
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,430
I'm sorry, but please get rid of it. It's piled up in the study.

564
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:25,920
Leo, just shove it all in the trash.

565
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,080
Yes! Let's go, Hyung.

566
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,540
Can we help you with anything?

567
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,120
No, it's okay.

568
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,050
You must feel much better once his things are all gone.

569
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,550
But why do you look so down?

570
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:55,840
Just because. I had this thought while I was getting rid of stuff.

571
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,520
What's wrong with all the men I end up with?

572
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,980
Don't blame yourself.

573
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,400
You weren't the only victim. We were all his victims.

574
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,500
Yes, just focus on the baby now.

575
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,340
Good work!

576
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,760
You made things easy for me. Thank you.

577
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,180
Call me if you need muscle from now on.

578
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:37,180
Aigoo! I'm much stronger! I'm younger than you.

579
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,320
I can be your muscle instead.

580
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,370
I wish you could've stayed for dinner.

581
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,380
I planned to meet someone.

582
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,070
I'll go on a date with Leo, too!

583
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:51,750
Huh? Really? What's going on?

584
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,100
Forget it. You can leave now, then!

585
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,750
We'll get going!

586
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,680
Let's go.

587
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,360
- Bye.
 - See you.

588
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,190
- See you.
 - Bye, Jae Yi.

589
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,080
Kang Hoo, just one second.

590
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,320
Could you get rid of this for me?

591
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,560
What's this?

592
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,940
They're proof of the bad things Gi Do Shik did in the hotel room.

593
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,040
I went to his grave

594
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,070
 and brought them back.

595
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:34,210
 I never opened them, but I kept them just in case.

596
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:39,720
I want to get rid of them completely now.

597
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,310
I'll take care of them.

598
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,620
Thank you.

599
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:03,620
You said you have a plan.

600
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,800
Where are you going? Let me drive you.

601
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:12,250
My plan was to be with you.

602
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,980
Let's have dinner together at my place.

603
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,370
But you don't eat at home.

604
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,810
I think I'll try to now.

605
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,280
I got rid of all the gross stuff at home.

606
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,360
Then... let's get groceries and go.

607
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,030
You will want to eat at home if you have a lot of food there.

608
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,570
Okay.

609
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,960
Get in.

610
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,560
Is she asleep?

611
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,840
I can only touch her while she's asleep.

612
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,600
She won't even let me lay my hand on her.

613
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,300
Stay with Na Na.

614
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,120
I got a call from the security office. They have mail for me.

615
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,920
Okay.

616
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,910
It's okay, Na Na.

617
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:35,290
I'm just so happy that I can see you.

618
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,330
Just don't be sick, okay?

619
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:55,330
Yes, Ma'am. Did the test result come out?

620
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:04,380
I... can't donate my liver to Na Na?

621
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,420

622
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,990

623
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:39,470

624
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:42,580

625
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:51,320
Noona, I'm done taking a shower! It's your turn.

626
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,970
What?

627
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,370
Where are you having a party tonight?

628
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,710
I'll be on my way.

629
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:17,270

630
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,910

631
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:58,600
We got all those groceries, and yet you have ramyeon again?

632
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,230
I wanted to start with ramyeon.

633
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:07,530
Next is pasta, tteokbokki, and steak.

634
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,820
I'll make all of them at home.

635
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,760
All of them.

636
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,190
Yes, I'm sure you didn't feel at home all this time.

637
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:21,020
You couldn't even eat here.

638
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:37,180
What are you thinking about?

639
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:43,170
Kang Hoo.

640
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:50,580
Do you... know what phrase I hated the most?

641
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,450
"A good day will come soon."

642
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,110
I couldn't see what was right in front of me

643
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:06,150
but they told me to live for the day that might never come.

644
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,520
It's like giving false hope.

645
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:17,600
But... I'm thinking to start feeling hopeful.

646
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:24,730
That feeling of being at a loss didn't go away.

647
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:32,700
I somehow feel empty, and I have doubts, still.

648
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:39,100
My days are not so sunny yet,

649
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,950
but I want to try to live, too.

650
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:48,180
At least once...

651
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:51,000
I don't want to live in hell,

652
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:55,810
but rather in happiness.

653
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:06,550
I'm... finally allowed to be happy, right?

654
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:12,550
As me, and Do Jae Yi.

655
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,750
♫  Before I knew it  ♫

656
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,140
♫  I couldn't casually ignore  ♫

657
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:32,170
♫  The flaming feeling I unconsciously ignited  ♫

658
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,710
♫  In some gap  ♫

659
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:39,410
♫  You are still flaming  ♫

660
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,990
Thank you.

661
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:43,260
♫  Today of all days  ♫

662
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,600
♫  Each step  ♫

663
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:51,800
♫  Feels like it brings me closer to you, yet you drift further away   ♫

664
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,450
♫  Within the gap of your heart  ♫

665
01:06:54,500 --> 01:07:00,900
♫  I'm going to fill you completely  ♫

666
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:10,350
♫  The sight of you always suffering alone  ♫

667
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:14,530
♫  The more time passes  ♫

668
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,860
♫  The more I look back  ♫

669
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:26,400
♫  Oh, time that has drifted far away  ♫

670
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,310
♫  Take me with you sometimes  ♫

671
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:38,410
♫  I am still very young and small  ♫

672
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,430
♫  Before I knew it  ♫

673
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:45,040
♫  I couldn't casually ignore  ♫

674
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:51,090
♫  The flaming feeling I unconsciously ignited  ♫

675
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,730
♫  In every gap  ♫

676
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:59,600
♫  You are fully flaming  ♫

677
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,170
♫  Today of all days  ♫

678
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,580
♫  Caught in a sigh  ♫

679
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:10,620
♫  Only a blurry image of you is drawn  ♫

680
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:13,400
♫  I'm filling all the gaps with you  ♫

681
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:20,000
♫  Within the gap of your heart  ♫

682
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:41,540
♫  Before I knew it  ♫

683
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,290
♫  I couldn't casually ignore  ♫

684
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:50,260
♫  The flaming feeling I unconsciously ignited  ♫

685
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,820
♫  I am also unaware  ♫

686
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:59,100
♫  That my heart is full of you  ♫

687
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:06,290
♫  The one who holds me, who never had anyone  ♫

688
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:11,100
♫  A memory left in the gap between my fingers  ♫

689
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:17,140
♫  Suddenly I find myself longing for you  ♫

690
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:48,320
 They're proof of the bad things Gi Do Shik did in the hotel room.

691
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,090
 I want to get rid of them completely now.

692
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,930
Crazy bastard.

693
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:26,470

694
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,010
It wasn't Song Je Hyeok who killed Gi Do Shik?

695
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,170
Who could it have been, then?

696
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:03,050
 You came.

697
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,570
 You didn't respond.

698
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:07,110
 I thought something happened.

699
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:10,540
 By the way, is this the best you can do?

700
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,650
- This voice is...
  - Dad.

701
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,010
 What a clingy bastard.

702
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:25,990

703
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,610

704
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:44,350
♫  Who are you, Mister?  ♫

705
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:54,400
♫  And why I can't find you?  ♫

706
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:02,920
♫  Don't tell, don't lie. Don't care about you  ♫

707
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,800
 ~ Preview ~ 
She's finally escaping from hell.

708
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,860
 You came.

709
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:10,950
 There's no reason to push her back in!

710
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,120
 Don't! Let me do it.

711
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,920
 That means you don't want me to say anything to Jae Yi.

712
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,730
 What if Chairman Kang Il Gu is a dangerous person?

713
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:23,630
 We should cut their ties.

714
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:27,400
 It was indeed Choi Kang Hoo. The one you saw in the parking lot that day.

715
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,690
 He followed me by putting this on my car.

716
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:32,730
 Why do you think he followed you?

717
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:38,080
 So, the tycoon Secretary Choi works for was the actual mastermind of the Angel's Club?

718
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,630
 I know it's shameless, but I'm sorry, Jae Yi.

719
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:45,210
 I'll devote my last days only to Jae Yi.

720
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,580
 I'm trying to pay for my sins from now on.

721
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:51,830
 Do you really think she needs a father now?

722
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:54,890
 I think that Choi Kang Hoo bastard knows something.

723
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:56,330
 I'll prepare for it.

724
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:00,210
 Would you like to come to my house this evening?

725
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:07,960
 Jae Yi, we'll be having dinner, just the two of us.
