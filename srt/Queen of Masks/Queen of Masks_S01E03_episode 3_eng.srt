1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,430
- Get going now.
 - Bye.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,330

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,510

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,140
I'll get going, too!

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:26,930

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,180
- Driver.
  - Yes.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,340
- Could you drop me off over there?
  - Yes.

8
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,610
 Hurry up and come.

9
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,410
 You need to party with me.

10
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,590
Crazy bastard.

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,860

12
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,190
 I couldn't tell her because Yu Jeong is apparently pregnant,

13
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,100
 but I think this is wrong.

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,390
 Where are you? Let's talk.

15
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,080
 Did you go to the hotel, by chance?

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,530

17
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,400

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,180
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,170
Sir, I'm sorry, but could you take me back to the hotel?

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,270
Did you come instead?

21
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,330
Feel free to drink some.

22
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,420
Your face tells me it's something serious.

23
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,730
I... saw it.

24
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,770
The text you sent to Yoo Na.

25
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,980
That girl. She should've been careful.

26
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,070
Do Shik! You are going to marry Yu Jeong in two weeks!

27
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,490
I can get married. What's the issue?

28
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,880
Stop talking to Yoo Na.

29
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,620
Otherwise, I'll tell Yu Jeong about everything.

30
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,460
Including you doing drugs.

31
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,290
Go Yoo Na, that bitch.

32
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,660
As if she doesn't have any secrets.

33
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,870
Should I reveal her secrets, too, then?

34
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,130
Her secrets?

35
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,750
She told you guys that she's a fashion designer, right?

36
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,540
She's actually a chief hostess at a hostess club.

37
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,770
It's even a very famous one in Gangnam.

38
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,940
- No way!
 - Why did a hostess like her approach you guys?

39
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,810
The clients sometimes want daughters of aristocratic families like you.

40
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,580
They think the hostesses are boring.

41
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,090
She tried to sell you guys to her clients by coaxing you!

42
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,580
Hey! Are you high right now?

43
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,560
If you can't trust me, just think about it!

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,370
How do you think I met Yu Jeong?

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,940
 Right, Yu Jeong.

46
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,130
 I know a very nice Oppa. Do you want to meet him?

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,440
 Why would "a very nice Oppa" want to meet with me?

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,590
 No, he's really nice.

49
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,910
 You should try meeting him first.

50
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,510
Did you know that Hae Mi does drugs, too?

51
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,330
Yoo Na did that to her, too.

52
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,050
 To set up the hotel for the spring event,

53
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,510
 I have to stay up for at least three to four nights. I'm in trouble.

54
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,410
 Is there a drug or something that keeps you awake?

55
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,710
 Do you want to try taking this?

56
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,800
 - It's a restorative medicine.
 - Really?

57
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,630
You're lying.

58
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,870
You're lying to me right now, right?

59
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,420
Check with Yoo Na yourself if you can't believe me.

60
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,790
It won't bother me at all.

61
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,400
Do you think I would let a scoundrel like you marry Yu Jeong?

62
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,500
I'll cancel your wedding and report you for drug use.

63
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,360
If this wedding gets canceled, who will lose more?

64
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,840
Yu Jeong is pregnant.

65
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,800
You can report me for drug use.

66
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,890
I can tell the police about Hae Mi.

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,920
You're going crazy, aren't you?

68
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,010
You can't do anything right now!

69
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,030
Are you crazy?

70
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,170
Did you drink that alcohol?

71
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,570

72
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,510
 How did you like my present?

73
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,630
 Don't do anything stupid.

74
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,140
 What's wrong, Lady?

75
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,980
Hey.

76
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,250
Where did you get this mask from?

77
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,160
The principal gave it to me.

78
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,630
Not you. You should put it in your jacket pocket, too.

79
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,750
Hello. Where did you get these masks from?

80
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,570
The owner of the stationery store nearby gave them to us,

81
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,240
so the kids can play with them.

82
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,980
Which stationery store?

83
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,290
It's called "Atom Stationery Store."

84
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,340
He had the business in front of our orphanage for a while.

85
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,000
Joon Hee! You can't lie down on the ground.

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,750
Ma'am, Joon Hee is lying down again.

87
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,250
Jae Yi!

88
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,240
We were looking for you!

89
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,670
Why do you look so upset?

90
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
What's that?

91
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,050
Well, it's nothing.

92
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,290
Why did Gi Yoon Chul, that bastard, come here?

93
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,550
Making me feel uncomfortable.

94
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,700
Did something happen between you and him?

95
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,730
Noona Yu Jeong didn't seem happy to see him earlier, either.

96
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,080
I mean, it was supposed to be about Jae Yi,

97
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,570
but he came for no reason and got the spotlight instead!

98
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,310
Oh, Jae Yi.

99
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,360
You're meeting for the first time, right?

100
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,400
He's my fiancÃ©, Song Je Hyeok.

101
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,910
Nice to meet you. I'm Do Jae Yi.

102
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,040
Hello, I'm Song Je Hyeok.

103
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,710
For some reason, I feel like I've met you before.

104
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,080
Maybe it's because Yu Jeong told me so much about you.

105
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,320
It's because Jae Yi is on TV so often.

106
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,730
One time, when I saw a celebrity at the hotel,

107
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,390
I was like, "Hey, you!" and slapped his back.

108
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,380
I thought it was someone I knew!

109
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,020
All right, why don't we all go get a drink somewhere?

110
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,770
Let's celebrate Jae Yi running for office.

111
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,510
- Let's go!
 - Well,

112
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,210
I don't feel so well today. I'llâ”€

113
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,710
Hey, we came here for you. Don't be like that!

114
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,910
Let's go! You should cheer yourself up.

115
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,310
You're okay with it, too, right?

116
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,850
Well, we also...

117
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,650
Let's go.

118
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,800
We can't miss out on the Jae Yi celebration.

119
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,560
Yes, let's go!

120
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
You need to drink on a day like this.

121
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,490
Let's go!

122
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,610
Hurry up!

123
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,350
Okay.

124
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,980
What's gotten into you?

125
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,240
You don't like drinking with a big group.

126
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,230
I should still join them.

127
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,570
They're your friends.

128
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,790
All right!

129
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,960
Noona Jae Yi.

130
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,340
Hyungnim.

131
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,440
Noona Yu Jeong.

132
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,230
Aigoo, why don't we stand up?

133
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,190
- Yes, let's stand up.
 - Stand up, Noona!

134
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,010
For Noona Jae Yi's win in the election!

135
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,990
- Cheers!
 - Cheers!

136
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,110
Huh?

137
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,600
Noona, you're supposed to chug the first round.

138
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,670
I'm sorry. I don't think it would go down well.

139
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,030
This one will definitely go down well. Why?

140
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,420
Because it's made in the golden ratio created in Cheongdam.

141
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,480
Try drinking it.

142
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,210
Leo, don't force Jae Yi to drink so much.

143
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,270
She doesn't drink alcohol offered by a man.

144
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,060
Why not?

145
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,360
Did someone spit into her drink or something?

146
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,320
Noona! Just drink it since it's among us!

147
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,240
Honestly, she shouldn't think of either of us as a man.

148
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,570
I belong to Noona Hae Mi.

149
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,190
Je Hyeok Hyung belongs to Noona Yu Jeong.

150
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,150
It's true, but...

151
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,590
Then, why don't you drink?

152
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,960
Why?

153
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,880
Do you think of me as a man, by chance?

154
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,490
I'll drink it, then.

155
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,430
That's enough. She doesn't want it.

156
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,560
Hyung!

157
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,470
I was trying to get her to relax since she seemed tense.

158
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,470
Why don't you join us and drink some, too?

159
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,570
People might think you're Jae Yi's boyfriend.

160
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,980
I am her boyfriend.

161
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,070
I have the right, then, right?

162
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,920
The right not to let Jae Yi drink.

163
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,700
Wow, Noona Jae Yi and Hyung Kang Hoo! Congratulations.

164
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,100
Wow, this is more exciting than the campaign announcement.

165
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,640
See? What did I tell you?

166
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,890
You used to deny it completely.

167
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,910
All right, hurry up and have a seat.

168
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,090
This time I'll make it

169
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,760
in the Las Vegas style.

170
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,590
- Nice!
 - All right!

171
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,670
Did you see her? Do Jae Yi.

172
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,420
Was she surprised to see you?

173
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,810
I don't know.

174
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,130
She did seem a bit surprised,

175
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,140
but I don't think it means that she killed my son.

176
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,200
She changed a lot.

177
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,270
She wasn't so shameless back then.

178
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,200
If you think I trust you 100%, you're mistaken.

179
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,510
The police definitely said you're the culprit.

180
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,840
You were the last person my son texted, too.

181
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,110
Also, they found your belonging at the crime scene, too.

182
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,070
It was a trap

183
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,840
set by someone to frame me.

184
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,930
By whom?

185
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,990
Wow, look at this.

186
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,610
You're so incredibly imaginative.

187
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,730
As his father, I want to find the real culprit, even if I have to search the whole world.

188
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,000
You're not just a father, Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul.

189
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,700
Since he's dead anyway,

190
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,030
wasn't it easier to have the hostess as the culprit

191
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,980
instead of the lawyer who likes to promote your political career?

192
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,980
But I guess you couldn't stand even that, since you had to

193
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,450
start campaigning for the presidency?

194
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,560
Since you had to pull me out of prison and kick me out of the country.

195
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,960
 Are you telling me to leave?

196
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,580
 I'm just relaying the message from the elder.

197
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,260
So, why did you want to see me?

198
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,180
Are you trying to tell me to

199
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,180
start reinvestigating and put Do Jae Yi in prison or something?

200
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,100
No, I'll be the one to take revenge on Do Jae Yi.

201
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,870
I need to get something greater out of a powerful man like you.

202
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,530
Looks like you want me as insurance.

203
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,720
What if I say no?

204
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,020
Then I have no choice.

205
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,400
I'll have to unearth your son's body.

206
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,500
Then the whole will find out what kind of person he was and

207
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,140
what he was doing when he got killed.

208
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,350
Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul, the future presidential candidate.

209
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,900
Could you take me to Grand Kangbo Hotel?

210
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,990
I'm staying in a suite there.

211
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,510
It's the room where your son got killed.

212
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,570

213
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,240
Attorney Do, I just checked, and it is being sold at the stationery store.

214
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,970
The owner didn't seem suspicious, either.

215
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,270
Yes, got it.

216
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,500
Thank you.

217
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,350
You know, Leo?

218
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,190
He went a bit too far earlier.

219
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,040
Even Kang Hoo had to step in.

220
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,470
What?

221
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,650
Kang Hoo got upset because of Je Hyeok, okay?

222
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,430
I thought they would start fighting.

223
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,000
Je Hyeok was just trying to humor Leo.

224
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,030
Humor Leo?

225
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,950
Humor him how?

226
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,210
I always noticed this.

227
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,280
Did you know that you kind of look down on my Leo?

228
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,800
I suggested couple gatherings many times, but you ignored me.

229
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,390
You didn't want Je Hyeok to meet Leo on his level.

230
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,580
How could you say that?

231
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,350
It was because Jae Yi doesn't have a boyfriend.

232
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,810
I felt guilty having a gathering like thatâ”€

233
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,710
Stop lying. I can see through you.

234
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,290
You know what?

235
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,000
Whether it's pork shoulder or pork belly, it's all from a pig anyway.

236
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,770
I'm saying Leo and Je Hyeok are the same.

237
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,400
They're just leeching off us women.

238
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,560
Are you done talking?

239
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,750
No, I'm not done.

240
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,120
I noticed earlier that Je Hyeok is kind of sly.

241
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,850
"Do you see me as a man?"

242
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,840
Do your homework before you marry him.

243
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,700
Make sure he doesn't have a hidden child, since he's so sly.

244
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,020
Why did you do that earlier?

245
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,760
You said you're my boyfriend.

246
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,000
Just because.

247
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,570
I thought they were being rude to you.

248
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,910
I hate rude people.

249
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,760
Why? What is it?

250
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,120
Why are you looking at me like that?

251
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,400
Thank you for helping me.

252
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:27,350
By the way, I was a bit sensitive today, too.

253
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,880
I could've just drank it, too.

254
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,450
Why are you sensitive today?

255
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,810
I saw that mask at the orphanage earlier.

256
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,490
I was so shocked that

257
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,640
I thought a child in the mask was... that man.

258
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,720
It was so silly.

259
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,510
Well, it just had the same design,

260
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,040
but the material was different, and it had a different logo on it.

261
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,570
It was a different mask.

262
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,360
Is it because the statute of limitation is expiring?

263
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,170
I... feel anxious.

264
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,980
Jae Yi.

265
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:35,160
If there's anything I can do to help catch that bastard...

266
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,540
Leo went out to smoke. I wanted to keep him company.

267
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,780
Congratulations again, you two.

268
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,370
Je Hyeok must be a nice person.

269
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:06,750
Most importantly, Yu Jeong likes him a lot.

270
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,300
So don't be upset, Kang Hoo.

271
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,280
Hey, Hyung.

272
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,670
I've been thinking.

273
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,630
I'll get back to work as you wanted.

274
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,420
But not as a host. I'll be managing the drugs.

275
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,980
Instead, Hyung,

276
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,550
you'd better not tell anyone.

277
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,270
Okay.

278
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,070
Thank you.

279
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,550
Did you smoke?

280
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,330
According to Hae Mi,

281
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,480
you're not good at drinking, and you don't smoke.

282
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,610
You're like a goody-goody.

283
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,800
Like a model student.

284
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,640
Everyone has a secret, right?

285
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,020
Especially from your future wife.

286
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,090
What's the secret you're keeping from Yu Jeong?

287
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,140
How about you?

288
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,520
Are you keeping a secret from Hae Mi?

289
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,830
Well, I thought I told her everything.

290
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,240
But I'm about to have one, sadly.

291
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,280
What is it?

292
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,970
So, the thing is, I got to...

293
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,280
Wow!

294
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,340
You swooped in so naturally. I almost told you everything.

295
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,340
You're a pro! A total pro!

296
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,020
Let's not tell each other, then.

297
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,750
Secrets are only fun when they stay secrets.

298
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,720
If the secrets are exposed, all the fun would be gone.

299
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,980
Just like smoke.

300
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,040
Is it fun?

301
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,830
Here we go! Is it fun?

302
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,580
You've grown, my baby.

303
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,440
Hello?

304
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,480
Yes. The gathering?

305
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,070
Oh, right!

306
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,480
I didn't even think of it!

307
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,480
 Emily, welcome to Korea!

308
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,260
 The man I found is the child's father, right?

309
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,310
 - Yes.
 - So,

310
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,330
 will you meet with him?

311
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,020
 I must.

312
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,230
 I have to put an end to things.

313
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,610
 I don't think it would be so easy to do that.

314
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,150
 He has someone behind him.

315
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,200
 It's even someone huge.

316
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,640
 Someone behind him?

317
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,430
 You have to find the child, not just the father, right?

318
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,030
 I think it would be dangerous to just go after him.

319
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,940
 If you do it wrong, forget the child.

320
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,190
 You might end up rotting behind bars forever.

321
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,790
My goodness. Oh dear.

322
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,290
You have to be careful.

323
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,240
- Thank you.
 - Yes, be careful.

324
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,280
Yes, yes.

325
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,040
Yes, yes. Okay.

326
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,470

327
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,760
Who gave you this?

328
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,110
That woman over there.

329
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,980
We'll get going now. See you.

330
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,220
- See you!
 - Bye.

331
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,580
- Bye.
 - Take care!

332
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,480
What will you two do now?

333
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,840
Today is your first day as a couple.

334
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,880
Don't be silly and get in the car.

335
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,920
Hyungnim, good luck!

336
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,910
Kang Hoo, fighting!

337
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,670
Bye bye.

338
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,070
Do you want to come in for a second?

339
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,250
Well,

340
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,890
you didn't get to eat earlier.

341
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,100
We have food left, too.

342
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,760
Should I?

343
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,600

344
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,290
Why did you do that earlier?

345
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,600
You acted like someone else at the gathering.

346
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,190
You were making naughty jokes, too.

347
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,750
I... like being naughty.

348
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,650
I just tried to humor Leo.

349
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,390
If I acted all proper, Hae Mi would've felt embarrassed.

350
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,130
I'm sure she's aware of his background.

351
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,560
Right?

352
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,680
That's what it was, right?

353
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,330
I knew it. You're so thoughtful.

354
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,830
How about you, Yu Jeong?

355
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,150
It didn't seem like you were so happy about

356
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,080
Jae Yi and Kang Hoo becoming a couple.

357
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,600
Well, the thing is...

358
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,880
It's not like that!

359
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,540
Just tell me.

360
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,970
We agreed not to keep secrets before we got married.

361
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:21,840
Actually... Kang Hoo's ex-girlfriend

362
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,600
used to be our friend.

363
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,980
So, Jae Yi being with her ex-boyfriend is...

364
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,140
It's so awful.

365
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,600
I wouldn't be able to do that.

366
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:42,160
Who is that awful friend, anyway?

367
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,580
You don't have to know.

368
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,470
She's someone you'd never run into.

369
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,830
 You know, Je Hyeok?

370
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,760
What about him?

371
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,740
What did he do again before he got a job at Yu Jeong's orphanage?

372
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,510
I don't know.

373
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,590
I didn't ask further when I heard he's a teacher. So boring.

374
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,280
Why?

375
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,800
 Huh? Thank you!

376
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,760
He didn't act like just a normal person.

377
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,120
What did you say?

378
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,120
When he handed me a cigarette earlier...

379
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,750

380
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,530

381
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,710
What is it?

382
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,030
It's nothing.

383
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,830
Didn't you say something about Je Hyeok's cigarette?

384
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,400
Yes.

385
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,140
I'm just saying he seemed well-mannered.

386
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,040
What?

387
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:55,050
Leo, go to bed before me when we get home.

388
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:59,290
I need to worry about the shaved ice to serve at the hotel all night.

389
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,940
Noona, to stay up all night, are youâ”€

390
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,190
I told you to stop being silly, didn't I?

391
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,940
Please be quiet!

392
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,520
I need to get some sleep.

393
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,410
 Someone behind him?

394
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,690
 You have to find the child, not just the father, right?

395
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,760
 I think it would be dangerous to just go after him.

396
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,640
 If you do it wrong, forget the child.

397
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,930
 You might end up rotting behind bars forever.

398
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,810
 So,

399
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:07,100
 you should prepare properly before you fight him.

400
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,130
 How impressive... is the one behind him anyway?

401
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:23,470
 If you... keep my land safe

402
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,890
 and return it to me after I become the minister, I'll tell you.

403
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:33,390
 It'd be a problem if you ran away with my land later.

404
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,340
Yes, Manager.

405
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,830

406
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,080
The taxi will be here soon.

407
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,640
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?

408
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,390
Yes, I'm okay.

409
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,720
Be careful.

410
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,930
I will.

411
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,810
Yes, Manager.

412
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,440
I'm on my way to the police station.

413
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,000
By the way, are you sure it's that mask?

414
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,240
The station chief says they raided an illegal gambling joint

415
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,190
and their theme was wearing a mask.

416
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,840
 And one of the guests was wearing that mask.

417
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,750
Okay.

418
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:49,520
If so, did you find out who was wearing that mask?

419
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,220
 Your Honor!

420
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:38,370
 It is true that I recorded the conversation by borrowing the watch from the defense attorney.

421
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,460
This mask. What happened?

422
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:57,060
Whenever I feel stressed, I need to play an exciting game.

423
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,640
But you interfered with my game, Attorney Do.

424
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,590
Where did you get it?

425
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,970
Since I can't steal from others, I stole from my husband.

426
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:15,560
That bastard is in jail for rape and calumny right now.

427
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,110
Because of you!

428
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,870
How did Mr. Kim Man Bok acquire this, exactly?

429
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:27,000
You apparently get it for joining some club.

430
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,390
Right.

431
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:33,680
I guess the club closed 10 years ago, but as far as I know, it's opening again.

432
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,410
Opening again?

433
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,970
 I signed up for a membership at a club a decade ago.

434
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,530
 That's where the club's meeting spot is.

435
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,060
That club... Do you know where it is?

436
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,390
Did Choi Bo Mi tell you where the club is?

437
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,390
No, Kim Man Bok kept it a secret from her, too.

438
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,280
It's definitely somewhere out there.

439
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,310
But it's so frustrating not knowing where it is.

440
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,500
Why would the club that closed 10 years ago open again?

441
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,670
Could it be connected to Gi Do Shik's case?

442
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,460
Even if everyone in the world says no,

443
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:29,210
he must know... that I saw that mask.

444
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,930
So he kept a low profile for 10 years until the case quieted down?

445
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:39,000
Because the statute of limitation expires in 10 years.

446
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,200
If we're right about that,

447
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,560
he might be the main member of the club.

448
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,610
Someone who can close the club and open it again.

449
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:53,070
I should interrogate Kim Man Bok in person.

450
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,060
Also, Attorney Do...

451
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,390
Have a look at this.

452
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,730
It was definitely Go Yoo Na who sent Gi Yoon Chul to my event.

453
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,500
Please continue following Go Yoo Na around.

454
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,620

455
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,550
Welcome, Chairman.

456
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,170
Why did you want to meet at a place like this?

457
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,040
Well, I'm stressed about something.

458
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,190
You don't have to worry.

459
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:57,650
As you can see, they can neither see us nor hear us.

460
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:13,230
Since you're so thorough, you probably never

461
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,500
showed your weakness to anyone.

462
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,610
But what should we do?

463
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,930
Go Yoo Na came back to Korea.

464
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,210
What did she say?

465
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,510
Did she say she didn't kill my son?

466
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,380
She said Do Jae Yi is the culprit.

467
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,280
Thankfully,

468
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,590
Go Yoo Na doesn't seem to know that Do Jae Yi is your daughter.

469
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,210
I'm so impressed with that, too.

470
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,290
I know it was a mistake you made when you were young,

471
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:53,540
but how can you hide it so perfectly in this day and age?

472
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,740
Do you want me to remove Go Yoo Na for you?

473
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,770
Making you the most powerful person in the country

474
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,280
is Kangbo Group's No. 1 mission.

475
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:14,360
But if some woman tries to reveal the truth about your shameful son,

476
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,830
I should get rid of her for you.

477
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,000
No.

478
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,440
As you said, what could some woman possibly do?

479
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,910
I just thought you should be aware.

480
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,090
I hope... you relieve stress well.

481
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:47,520
A place like this doesn't suit me.

482
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,510
Well, then.

483
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,200
I'm glad the culprit was caught.

484
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,030
I risked my life to find her.

485
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,550
Who's that woman?

486
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,900
It's Attorney Do Jae Yi.

487
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,090
Until we arrested the hostess, she was the prime suspect.

488
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:26,720
But why is she with Vice Chairman Kang Il Gu of Kangbo Group?

489
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,180
I think it's strange, too.

490
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:34,570
Anyway, since Vice Chairman Kang Il Gu came, the Chief gave us an order.

491
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:39,020
Since the real culprit was found, we shouldn't investigate Attorney Do anymore.

492
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,060
He even told us to remove the existing records, too.

493
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,690
Maybe she's his child out of wedlock or something.

494
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:53,450
His love for his daughter is making me tear up.

495
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,290
 Ms. Go Yoo Na, let me know if you need anything.

496
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,000
 Let me help you.

497
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,090
You should protect your daughter.

498
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,590
I'll punish my son's murderer.

499
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,370

500
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,690

501
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:32,610

502
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,720
Excuse me.

503
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,790
This is a members-only club.

504
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,760
Also, we're closed because of the remodeling.

505
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,470
You're just swapping out a few chairs. Remodeling, my foot.

506
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,440
I'm not a customer. I'm a subcontractor.

507
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:56,070
Tell Mr. Jung that Madam Go is here.

508
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,570
Look who's here!

509
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,520
I heard you had a hard time in prison.

510
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,030
Is it because you didn't see the sun?

511
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,620
Your skin is even more radiantâ”€

512
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,180
Cut the nonsense.

513
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:18,010
Mr. Jung. You know my ex-husband, right?

514
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,200
Were you married?

515
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,740
Who'd think you're married?

516
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,940
You could easily work nowâ”€

517
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:32,250
I mean, I did hear that you lived together.

518
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,150
But I haven't talked to him for a long time.

519
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,900
They say you can't get rid of old habits.

520
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,350
I guess he found a pushover and settled down.

521
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,700
I haven't seen him at all.

522
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,020
Do you think I'm here because I don't know how he's living?

523
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,040
What I want to know is the big shot who supports him.

524
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,410
Big shot?

525
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,100
A big shot is supporting him? Who is it?

526
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,150
You still don't get it.

527
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,470
Even though it has been 10 years... I'm still Madam Go.

528
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,120
Spill it now.

529
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,360
Or else, forget the remodeling. I'll shut the business down!

530
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:20,360
Hey. Mr. Jung is inside, right?

531
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,440
He's with a guest right now.

532
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,850
Was it Madam Go?

533
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,110
 What? You want to make a deal?

534
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,440
 So,

535
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,510
if I tell you where the club is, you'll save my company?

536
00:45:54,550 --> 00:46:00,080
And how will you ruin my business, exactly?

537
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,220
Your wife, Choi Bo Mi.

538
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,660
She got caught while playing at an unauthorized gambling joint.

539
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,670
Is she out of her mind?

540
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:12,160
After all the stealing, now she's gambling?

541
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,020
The company is already in danger because of you.

542
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:20,210
If your wife gets arrested, too, who would buy your products?

543
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:26,100
The sales will go down, and you would be totally done for.

544
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:34,810
So tell me.

545
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:36,660
The club.

546
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,530
Where is it?

547
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,490
All right, then. I hope you look forward to it.

548
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:52,010
There will be articles about your wife all over the internet tomorrow.

549
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,980
Angel's.

550
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:02,080
I'll tell you everything I know... about the Angel's Club.

551
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,370
That club's name is Angel's?

552
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,390
- Apple.
  - Apple!

553
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,720
- One more time.
  - Apple!

554
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,420
- Angel.
  - Angel!

555
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,430
- How about this?
  - Banana!

556
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:23,170
Very good!

557
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,630
You even did the homework well instead of playing last week.

558
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,290
Hello!

559
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,360
Team Leader.

560
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,620
I'll be right back.

561
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,970
There are visitors in the backyard.

562
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,830
What are you doing here without calling me? If someone sees you...

563
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,900
What are you doing?

564
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,500
Chairwoman, what are you doing here without notice?

565
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,070
Principal, is Je Hyeok...

566
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:01,220
I mean, is the Team Leader upstairs?

567
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:06,130
The Team Leader went somewhere for a moment because he had a visitor.

568
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:09,080
Visitor?

569
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,990
Je Hyeok!

570
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:21,050
Wait, your face...

571
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:23,820
What happened to your face?

572
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,690
I heard you had a visitor.

573
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,080
Did you get into a fight?

574
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,650
I invited friends to give them the wedding invitation. But...

575
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,590
I think I had an inferiority complex, I didn't notice.

576
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:45,600
A friend provoked it, so...

577
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,500
Inferiority complex?

578
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,150
Why would you have that?

579
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,370
He said I did a good job seducing the boss.

580
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,420
No way!

581
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,140
How could he say something like that?

582
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:07,710
I'll try to get used to hearing that I'm living off my woman.

583
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,350
I'll hear that for the rest of my life.

584
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:16,480
 I'm saying Leo and Je Hyeok are the same.

585
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,320
 They're just leeching off us women.

586
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,430
How about this?

587
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,410
You will be the chairman of the Yeongun Foundation from now on.

588
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:37,580
I'll just be the president of the arts and culture village promotion committee.

589
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,230
But...

590
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:44,220
if I become the chairman, what about the orphanage?

591
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,790
I'll figure it out somehow.

592
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:53,230
So, I want you to be the chairman of the Yeongun Foundation.

593
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,720
 That's why we can't just trust Jae Yi.

594
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,200
 We need to figure out how to survive ourselves.

595
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,810
You, too?

596
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,920
Have a seat.

597
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:16,050
I knew you were phony a long time ago,

598
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,530
but this is on another level.

599
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,150
How could you come here without telling me a word?

600
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:24,890
I couldn't help it because the foundation was desperate for money.

601
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,780
But you came, too.

602
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:31,920
I warned you that I'll find a way to survive myself!

603
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,180
The old saying was right.

604
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,660
It's fun watching people fight.

605
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,470
Just tell me.

606
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:51,430
Why did you come to see me after leaving so coldly?

607
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,360
Your land. What would it take to give it to us?

608
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,850
Don't make ridiculous demands such as killing someone.

609
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:04,000
I don't want to say the same thing again.

610
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,870
That's all I want, okay?

611
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,820
Yoo Na, we really need that land.

612
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,720
Help us figure out how, please?

613
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,240
 You have to find the child, not just the father, right?

614
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,860
 I think it would be dangerous to just go after him.

615
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,640
 If you do it wrong, forget the child.

616
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,760
 You might end up rotting behind bars forever.

617
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,250
How about this, then?

618
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,110
Be my friends again like in the old days.

619
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,740
Didn't you understand me?

620
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,390
Be friends with me like you did 10 years ago.

621
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:00,270
You don't understand what it means to be friends, do you?

622
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,820
You don't become friends with just anyone.

623
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,750
You become friends with someone you can trust.

624
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,530
Does Jae Yi know that you came here?

625
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:16,920
I think you're the ones who don't understand friendship.

626
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:24,130
I'm not asking for much.

627
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:29,020
Invite me just once when you're having a gathering with your husbands.

628
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:35,160
That way, we can build trust and make a deal, too.

629
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,000
Don't you think?

630
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,830
Hey, are you crazy?

631
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,880
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

632
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,990
Because I'm scared that Yoo Na wanted to become friends.

633
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,340
It was scary.

634
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,940
Do you want to invite her to your wedding?

635
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,760
That's the soonest gathering we have with our husbands.

636
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,460
No, not my wedding!

637
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,130
The wedding has to be perfect this time.

638
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,860
Will you give up on that land, then?

639
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:29,260
We have to retrieve the donation we gave your foundation, too, then.

640
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,370
That can't happen, either! How could you...

641
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,490
How could you do that so suddenly?

642
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:39,020
You don't want to do this or that! What are you planning to do?

643
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,960
Then... instead of the wedding,

644
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,550
how about we hang out at my house this weekend?

645
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:58,390
My Je Hyeok became the chairman recently.

646
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:00,490
We should celebrate, too.

647
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:04,140
Did you make him the chairman?

648
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:13,720
By the way, what should we tell Jae Yi?

649
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,590
Shouldn't we tell her that we invited Yoo Na?

650
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,460
Don't tell her in advance.

651
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,160
Then we'll have to tell her that we secretly visited Yoo Na today.

652
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,370
Let's deal with it when they see each other at your house.

653
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,420

654
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,580
These are all the event reservations in the Gunggok district on February 18th, right?

655
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:46,240
But there wasn't a secret opening event for a club named Angel's Club in the data.

656
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,580
Kim Man Bok definitely said it's happening in exactly a week.

657
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,220
We have no choice, then.

658
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:02,250
We should send people to every event in the Gunggok district that day.

659
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,350
Sounds good.

660
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,720
Are you keeping an eye on Go Yoo Na?

661
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,770
She hasn't done anything notable since she met Gi Yoon Chul.

662
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:12,060
She just went to the bar she used to work for.

663
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,390
But she did go to an unexpected place, too.

664
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:30,100
 Go Yoo Na, come to Yu Jeong's house this Saturday.

665
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,840
 I'll send you the address and time later.

666
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,210
Do we get to meet finally?

667
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,960
 Tell me.

668
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,640
 Who's the big shot who supports my ex-husband?

669
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,610
 National Intelligence Service?

670
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:58,640
 No, since he was from the US, is it the FBI?

671
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,700
 Mr. Jung!

672
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,610
 Geez! I'm serious!

673
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,990
 That's how mysterious he is.

674
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,970
 I did research on him using my old skills,

675
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,160
 but I couldn't figure it out.

676
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,040
Yes.

677
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,110
In front of the hotel? Who is?

678
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,130
Why didn't you just come upstairs instead?

679
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,460
Are you scared because it reminds you of what happened?

680
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,640
I wanted to go on a drive with you.

681
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,170
Where do you want to go with me?

682
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,030
You'll see when you get there.

683
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,620
She didn't come today.

684
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,330
I need to go find her.

685
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,720
What's with you?

686
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,740
What's the reason you brought me here?

687
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,970
To find your daughter.

688
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:04,530
Did you get... someone to follow me, by chance?

689
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:12,690
I guess you weren't exactly a virtuous lawyer.

690
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:16,100
You used to do dirty work for a bastard like Jung Goo Tae.

691
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,750
So, how much did you find out about me?

692
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:30,520
The condition of your parole is that you can't leave the country without permission.

693
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,290
But you ignored that and went to the US.

694
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:37,640
That means, you're wanted in Korea.

695
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,600
You were safe because you came as Emily Go,

696
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,980
otherwise you would've gotten arrested at the airport.

697
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,560
Is that all you have?

698
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,020
I thought you found out who my ex is or something.

699
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,530
Aren't you afraid of me?

700
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,250
With just one phone call, you would get arrested immediately.

701
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:00,020
I wouldn't have come if I were afraid of going to jail.

702
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,360
I prepared to die coming here.

703
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,910
Let's make a deal.

704
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,340
Give me that land.

705
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:18,340
Then, I'll get your daughter back from your ex-husband, no matter what it takes.

706
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:23,730
What do you think? Do you want to try trusting me?

707
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:28,340
You want me... to try trusting you?

708
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:44,070
What if... the father of my daughter is Kang Hoo?

709
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,750
Would you still be able to fight for me?

710
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,390
That makes no sense.

711
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:55,040
You broke up forever ago.

712
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,730
I saw Kang Hoo before I went to the US.

713
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:04,340
We were very passionate. I guess he didn't tell you.

714
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,100
Jae Yi, what I'm saying is

715
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,340
you can't trust anyone in this world.

716
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,070
So don't trust anyone.

717
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,600
Including Yu Jeong and Hae Mi.

718
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:34,900
You'll find out who the father of my daughter is soon.

719
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,550
If you still want to help me, then, go for it.

720
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,960
I'll give you my land, then.

721
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:46,160
I suppose you don't feel like driving me back anymore.

722
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,220
I'll leave on my own.

723
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,770
You should've waited. I would've prepared it for you.

724
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,800
You set this aside for me, I noticed.

725
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:59,400
How come you're not having ramen and soju today?

726
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:06,390
I didn't want to feel sorry for myself today.

727
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:00,610
Well.

728
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:07,040
Have you met Yoo Na since she got out of prison?

729
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,700
No, I haven't.

730
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:16,740
Then... when was the last time you saw her?

731
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,050
Same as you guys.

732
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,180
It was before that incident.

733
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:29,010
You're a bit weird today.

734
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:31,090
Did something happen?

735
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,090
No. It's nothing.

736
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:40,140
I'll get going.

737
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,480
Let me drive you.

738
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:46,250
No, don't come out.

739
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,140
Bye.

740
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:06,010

741
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,760
Manager, please find out

742
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,620
who is the father of Go Yoo Na's daughter.

743
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,800

744
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,560
It smells so good!

745
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:58,560
Looks like you'd take over the kitchen when we get married.

746
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,370
Is there anything you can't do?

747
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:04,540
Making money?

748
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,820
I told you not to wear the corrective shoes at home.

749
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,400
Your feet need to rest, too.

750
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:18,870
I'll be wearing them at home even after we get married.

751
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:22,740
I only want to show the perfect version of myself to you.

752
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,580
You're perfect to me as you are.

753
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,870
Je Hyeok,

754
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:38,470
I'll tell them all about it today.

755
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,450
By chance...

756
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:45,060
We agreed to talk about it after we get married.

757
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:46,860
No.

758
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:51,730
Just like how you don't think of my leg as my flaw,

759
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:55,700
I don't think of your condition as a flaw, either.

760
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:01,620
I actually can't wait to brag about it to my friends.

761
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,140
Did Hyung prepare all this?

762
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:24,710
It's the least he could do. He became the chairman, thanks to her.

763
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:26,590
Where's Kang Hoo?

764
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:30,320
He probably can't come because the restaurant is open on the weekend, too.

765
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,430
Thank goodness.

766
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:37,890
He must be tired! He should rest.

767
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:43,840
It's torture to talk long in front of food. Let's get started.

768
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,660
No!

769
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,400
There's someone who hasn't come yet.

770
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,040
Who?

771
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,950
You'll see later.

772
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,850
Don't lose your appetite by finding out in advance.

773
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:13,600
There's something I need to tell only my close friends before the guest comes.

774
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:22,950
I'll be having a pretty daughter soon.

775
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,180
Y-You got pregnant before getting married?

776
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:32,830
Hey! You phony little...

777
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:35,330
It's not like that!

778
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,400
Actually,

779
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,870
before Je Hyeok met meâ”€

780
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,580
Yes, Manager.

781
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,360
 Are you with your friends right now?

782
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,880
Yes, I am.

783
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,490
Why don't you step out and talk for a moment?

784
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:54,580
Well, okay.

785
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:57,350
I'll talk on the phone outside for a second.

786
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,350
That was an important moment!

787
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,440
I came out, Manger. You can talk now.

788
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,990
Who is the father of Go Yoo Na's daughter?

789
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:18,310
Why is she taking so long?

790
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:22,690
I can't wait until Jae Yi comes back!

791
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,210
Just tell us now.

792
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:26,010
If you're not pregnant before getting married,

793
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:29,150
what do you mean you're having a daughter?

794
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:36,740
Je Hyeok has a daughter.

795
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:54,900
Her name is Na Na.

796
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,130
She's turning four now.

797
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,210
Did you just find out?

798
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:15,880
It's true.

799
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,440
That jerk is my child's father.

800
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:30,950

801
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,790

802
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:07,310
â™«  Dark desire hiding behind a mask  â™«

803
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:09,930
â™«  They're liars  â™«

804
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:15,240
â™«  The truth is completely hidden behind a curtain  â™«

805
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,250
 ~ Preview ~ 
I warned you not to trust anyone.

806
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:23,150
 There's only one way for married couples to get along.

807
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:27,660
 Never getting caught with their secrets. Don't you agree, Hae Mi?

808
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:29,740
 Why were you like that yesterday?

809
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,150
 Like a scared rabbit who was captured in the wolf's lair.

810
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,320
 Isn't it how it always is?

811
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:40,220
 Your man you thought was an angel before getting married turns out to be the devil.

812
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:44,370
 Enough to surprise you. Totally shocking.

813
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:47,720
 Trust me, no matter what anyone says.

814
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:52,340
 I think Je Hyeok is a gift my parents sent from heaven.

815
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,040
 So, whose side will you be on?

816
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,590
 Song Je Hyeok's or mine?

817
01:11:57,590 --> 01:12:00,460
