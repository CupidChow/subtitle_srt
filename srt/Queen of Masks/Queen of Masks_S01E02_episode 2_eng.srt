1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,780

(2013)

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,980
Ms. Do Jae Yi.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,980
Did you drink with Mr. Gi?

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,210
Did you get into a fight?

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,750
Ms. Do!

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,590
You did this, didn't you?

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,030
You stabbed him like this!

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,940
A knife...

9
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,300
I...

10
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,010
I...

11
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,340
- I...
 - Yes.

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,570
I what? Huh?

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,440
What is it?

14
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,680
What?

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,200
You found the real culprit?

16
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,910
What?

17
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,600
You found evidence with Gi Do Shik's blood still on it?

18
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,120
Okay.

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,980

20
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,550
I think you can leave now.

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,190
Sir. I need to tell you something.

22
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,040
By chance,

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,900
was Gi Do Shik wearing a mask when it happened?

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,850
Or...

25
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,880
was there another man?

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,580
Another man... other than Gi Do Shik?

27
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,160
The mask...

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,110
The man in a mask.

29
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,950
A mask?

30
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,890
You're probably not in your right mind over something like this.

31
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,220
I searched the scene thoroughly myself.

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,750
There was no other man.

33
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,260
Sir, Sir!

34
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,990
Vice Chairman Kang Il Gu of Kangbo Group?

35
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,050
Aigoo! Vice Chairman, what brings you here?

36
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,390
You can leave now.

37
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,050
I still need to talk to the police.

38
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,280
The culprit got caught.

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,950
What else is there to talk about?

40
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:22,690
I... also went through something horrific that day.

41
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,770
I should go in and tell the police about it.

42
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,920
Don't make the case get even bigger.

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,770
That would be better for you, too.

44
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,850
I'm not making the case bigger.

45
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,130
There was another case that night,

46
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,990
and I was the victim of it!

47
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,120
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,810
You don't believe what I say, either?

49
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,720
What does it matter if I believe you or not?

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,800
What matters is that you should not get involved in this ugly case.

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,100
Because the world cannot know that Vice Chairman

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,390
Kang Il Gu of Kangbo Group has an illegitimate child like me.

53
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,860
This will be my last time helping you.

54
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,070
So, you should get stronger, so you can defend yourself.

55
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,580
Power is stronger than the law.

56
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,840

57
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,350
All lives are like plants

58
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,330
and their glories are like flowers.

59
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,000
We are aware that we'd wilt and dry eventually,

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,930
but after they leave us,

61
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,520
we can't help but feel sad.

62
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,300
But we should reflect on the things the plant and the flowers left,

63
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,090
and the fact that God led the soul of the deceased,

64
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,700
and on ourselves and think about those things.

65
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,650
How disappointing.

66
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,390
I wanted to see the end.

67
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,510
Who are you?

68
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,710
I'm Emily Go.

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,020
Are you guys more familiar with the other name?

70
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,950
Hello,

71
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,790
guys.

72
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,830
It's Yoo Na.

73
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,680
Go Yoo Na.

74
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,250
Have you been well?

75
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,150
Do Jae Yi.

76
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,420
Should we go talk somewhere?

77
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,510
It would be nice to avoid the rain, too.

78
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,350
You still can't believe it?

79
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,100
I guess it has already been 10 years.

80
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,230
You... didn't break out of prison or something, right?

81
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,920
- Hey!
 - What?

82
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,960
She... she got 15 years or something.

83
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,670
I guess being nice brings good luck.

84
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,970
I'm on parole for good behavior.

85
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,740
That's why you can't rehabilitate in prison.

86
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,500
- If you behaved well— 
 - What did you do after you got out?

87
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,180
I went to the US.

88
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,330
It was my dream to go to the US.

89
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,200
Was Jung Goo Tae your dream?

90
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,980
By chance, were you...

91
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,130
and Mayor Jung Goo Tae...

92
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,650
That's what people call it in Korea.

93
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,590
A mistress.

94
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,420
A mistress? Wait.

95
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,700
Jae Yi managed all of his mistresses...

96
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,380
Wow, an international affair, huh?

97
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,010
He had a mistress in the US who couldn't be managed?

98
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,160
By the way, how could you be like this?

99
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,940
But still, how could you be here when his wife couldn't even come?

100
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,590
You're just a mistress.

101
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,400
Do you... have a child?

102
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,760
Did you give birth to Jung Goo Tae's child?

103
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,300
No. I didn't.

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,470
If you came all the way here looking to get anything, give up.

105
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,770
When the husband dies, the legal wife gets the inheritance,

106
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,680
but the mistress doesn't get a single penny.

107
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,240
Your string has been cut.

108
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,410
I'm probably not the only one... whose string got cut.

109
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,260
I'll get going now.

110
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,610
I haven't been in Korea for a long time, so I have a lot to do.

111
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,110
Oh, and...

112
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,420
I'm not here to see Jung Goo Tae today.

113
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,360
I came here to see you guys.

114
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,710
We used to be

115
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,170
friends at one point.

116
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,040
Why do you think Yoo Na came?

117
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,210
Did she really come to see us?

118
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,080
She must be really crazy, then.

119
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,500
You know what she did to us.

120
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,620
Never mind that she lied, saying she was a fashion designer when she was a hostess.

121
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,550
She got you involved with someone like Gi Do Shik and I got into drugs because of her.

122
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,660
And Jae Yi...

123
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,550
What if she shows up again?

124
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,070
She didn't even give us her number. How would she show up again?

125
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,500
She wouldn't want to see us again, unless she's stupid.

126
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,420
Jae Yi, are you okay?

127
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,620
I'll get going now.

128
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,810
You're leaving?

129
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,250
Jae Yi! Why?

130
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,550
Where are you going?

131
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,970
What the hell are you doing?

132
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,550
You...

133
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,600
Why did you really come here?

134
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,090
You ignored me when I was looking for you.

135
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,730
Yes. I heard it.

136
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,330
You looked for me everywhere.

137
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,550
But I couldn't believe why you were looking for me.

138
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,590
I heard you

139
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,560
tried to ask me if there was another man there that night.

140
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,910
You know,

141
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,570
- because you went to Gi Do Shik's room. 
- No!

142
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,790
I didn't go to that room that night!

143
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,630
You're lying.

144
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,890
How come you didn't change at all?

145
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,430
Lying?

146
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,830
I'm lying, huh?

147
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,490
Yes.

148
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,080
I lied to you guys.

149
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,520
Although I was a hostess, I said I was a college student.

150
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,600
I was just curious about how daughters of noble families like you guys hang out.

151
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,820
But it turns out you're exactly like me.

152
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,050
You're liars!

153
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,390
That night...

154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,500
you were the last person to go into that room.

155
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,770
You... don't like that I came, right?

156
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,980
You're scared of me, aren't you?

157
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,360
But what can we do?

158
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,270
Whether you like it or not, you have to come to me.

159
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,780
I should... come to you?

160
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,120
Leave.

161
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,490
Getting rained on is no longer romantic at our age.

162
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,580
Didn't Jae Yi look kind of nervous?

163
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,350
She left first, too.

164
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,750
She must feel uncomfortable.

165
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,720
She's running for mayor.

166
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,600
It won't be good if Yoo Na talks about that case everywhere.

167
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,930
Crime of passion, drugs, rape, and murder.

168
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,610
That case involved everything dirty.

169
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,530
How about us?

170
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,710
What?

171
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,150
What if Yoo Na stirs up that case again─

172
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,280
Watch your mouth!

173
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,990
Be careful in front of Jae Yi, too.

174
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,990
Okay.

175
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,670

176
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,700
You're doing this again, Attorney.

177
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,320
I told you that night.

178
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,040
I searched the scene thoroughly,

179
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,360
but there was no trace of a man other than Gi Do Shik in that hotel room that night.

180
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,690
But...

181
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,420
for what reason do you keep saying there was another man?

182
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,220
What's this?

183
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,240
That night,

184
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,870
I...

185
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,570
I was sexually assaulted.

186
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,320
This is the evidence.

187
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,200
We... already did an autopsy on Gi Do Shik's body!

188
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,570
There was no evidence that he had intercourse!

189
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,460
It wasn't him.

190
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,990
You said he didn't wear a mask!

191
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,850
There was... There was someone wearing a mask that night─

192
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,690
Here we go again! You're bringing up that mask again?

193
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,380
Are you possessed by a ghost in a mask?

194
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,430
Excuse me.

195
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,130
By chance,

196
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,680
are you doing this because of Vice Chairman Kang Il Gu of Kangbo Group?

197
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,600
Did he tell you to close the case because the culprit was caught?

198
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,380
Is that right?

199
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,100
I even brought the evidence to you.

200
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,020
Do you...

201
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,370
Do you know how I felt bringing this here?

202
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,450
You can't be doing this.

203
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,590
Look, Ms. Do Jae Yi!

204
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,190
Don't you... have any shame?

205
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,700
You drank at the basement bar of the hotel that night, right?

206
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,040
With many male hosts.

207
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,740
I heard they found

208
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,330
a ton of ecstasy and condoms in the bathroom there.

209
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,620
Weren't you confused because you were high?

210
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,040
While fooling around with a host?

211
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,400
If people find out how hard you partied...

212
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,110
What were you?

213
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,560
A lawyer?

214
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,640
Your career would be over, okay?

215
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,300
I'm...

216
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,200
letting it go because I don't want a closed case to attract attention again.

217
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,900
So take this back and leave, okay?

218
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,610
Don't f*** around when I'm busy!

219
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,820
 (Various law books)

220
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,380
 Are you doing this because of Vice Chairman Kang Il Gu of Kangbo Group?

221
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,600
 Did he tell you to close the case because the culprit was caught?

222
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
 Look, Ms. Do Jae Yi!

223
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,400
 Don't you have any shame?

224
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,770
 Weren't you confused because you were high?

225
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,100
 While fooling around with a host?

226
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,960

227
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,570

228
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,020
I did it because you asked me to.

229
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,650
But you know we can't take personal requests, right?

230
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,440
I will never forget that you helped me.

231
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,800
So, what was the result?

232
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,870
The DNA found on your underwear, and Gi Do Shik's DNA

233
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,160
did not match.

234
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,870
So I was right.

235
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,720
In that room...

236
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,660
that night...

237
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,980
there was definitely another man wearing a mask.

238
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,690
What are you planning to do now?

239
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,150
I should find him.

240
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,080
On my own.

241
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,550
Please give this to Prisoner No. 6247,

242
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,570
Go Yoo Na.

243
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,700
She refuses visitations, and I tried mailing her and reaching her online,

244
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,830
but she won't respond.

245
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,720
I'm sure she won't even take it.

246
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,610
As you know, we can't force the prisoner to accept it.

247
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,520
Then, could you ask her just one thing for me?

248
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,840
If there was another man in that room that night.

249
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,400
Do you have a mask that looks like this by chance?

250
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,230
Do you have a white mask with a pattern on it?

251
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,830
Do you have a mask that looks like this?

252
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,500
Is it this one by chance?

253
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,160

254
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,370

255
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,380

256
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,130

257
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,010

258
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,930
Long time no see.

259
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,010
Has it been about five years?

260
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,890
You were a department head then.

261
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,640
I heard you were promoted to the head of the station.

262
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,240
So, is there a problem?

263
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,940
No, not yet.

264
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,160
But it might be a problem in the future.

265
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,850
I'm here to tell you that.

266
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,170
At your police station,

267
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,890
a celebrity represented by a major entertainment agency

268
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,150
was arrested for illegally purchasing fentanyl, right?

269
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,990
But his indictment was suspended.

270
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,260
A day after you had a friendly meeting with the CEO of the agency.

271
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,500
I did a bit of research on you, just in case.

272
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,910
You've been accepting money from the CEO of that agency regularly.

273
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,620
Through your son's bank account.

274
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,720
What are you trying to say?

275
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,520
Will you report me or what?

276
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,510
Aigoo, no way.

277
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,680
I would be losing a very important informant, then.

278
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,530
Informant?

279
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,460
If there's any case that involves a mask,

280
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,620
please contact me.

281
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,590
Without missing a single case.

282
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,810
Understand?

283
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,190
 I raided a hotel because I got a report about a man using drugs.

284
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,910
He was rolling in bed wearing a mask with a woman.

285
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,620
But...

286
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,400
 that mask looked like the one you were looking for.

287
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,850
This is...

288
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,190
your father's?

289
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,710
How many times do I have to tell you?

290
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,760
I stole it from my father's study.

291
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,200
He said it was a souvenir from a members-only club.

292
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,600
By Father, you mean...

293
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,670
The mayor of Tongju.

294
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,160
It's Jung Goo Tae, the mayor of Tongju.

295
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,530
Is he the man you're looking for?

296
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,340
No, he's not.

297
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,910
It was a young man.

298
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,400
As Jung Gi Ho said,

299
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,960
if it was a souvenir, Jung Goo Tae got from a members-only club,

300
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,370
that man could be a member of that club, too.

301
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,040
I searched all the members-only clubs in Tongju City,

302
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,920
but none of them produced masks.

303
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,750
It could be a secret club that's hidden from the public.

304
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,690
What if you ask Jung Goo Tae yourself?

305
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,610
But I'm nobody.

306
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,700
Why would he tell me about a secret like that?

307
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,110
What would you do then?

308
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,000
To catch a tiger...

309
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,420

310
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,780
 you must enter the tiger cave.

311
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,230
 Politics.

312
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,080
You want to get into politics.

313
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,490
I even moved to Tongju City hoping to get your help.

314
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,370
Please help me out, Sir.

315
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,560
I thought it was

316
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,870
kind of strange when you said

317
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,910
you would help me with a bastard like my son by quitting

318
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,260
your job as a public defender.

319
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,030
So,

320
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,220
why do you want to get into politics?

321
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,260
Because power... is stronger than the law.

322
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,140
You're clever.

323
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,050
What if I let you?

324
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:39,430
So your situation at home won't affect your political career,

325
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,520
I'll do my best and manage it.

326
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,670
Fine.

327
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:08,230
I'll give you a special politics lesson, so you could

328
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:12,370
get into politics safely.

329
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,490
♫  Dark desires hiding behind a mask  ♫

330
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,920
 First of all,

331
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,930
 improve your star power.

332
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,770
 Politicians are

333
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,350
 all about popularity, like celebrities.

334
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,140
Today's victory is meaningful because it defeated

335
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,610
the court's deeply rooted sexist point of view.

336
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,180
I hope this verdict serves as a reference point to

337
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,400
gender sensitivity that's been ambiguous in the legal profession.

338
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,300
 Not only the right hand,

339
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,750
 but let your whole body know what the left hand did.

340
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,550
 Advertise to everyone how admirable you are!

341
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,080
♫  Oh, now, Unmask  ♫

342
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,040
♫  The curtain rises  ♫

343
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,710
♫   and will reveal everything  ♫

344
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,300
♫  Spotlight the truth  ♫

345
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,110

346
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,260
 But...

347
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,080
 you have to be careful about something the more famous you get.

348
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,490
 Do you have a past?

349
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,800
 Either you caused big trouble, or you got involved in big trouble.

350
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,250
 The sort of thing that might get people talking if it's ever revealed.

351
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,100
 Watch out for things that might get blown up in advance.

352
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,190
 You never know when that bomb will go off and shackle your ankles.

353
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,370

354
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,670
 Parole?

355
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,580
 Yes. No. 6247, Go Yoo Na.

356
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,390
 She got out on parole a month ago.

357
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,570
 I haven't heard that from the Justice Department's announcement.

358
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,460
 We didn't know, either.

359
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,100
 But she suddenly qualified for it.

360
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,950
And then she went to the US and became Jung Goo Tae's mistress.

361
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,200
That's why I couldn't find her.

362
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,730
But why did she show up again?

363
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,030
Manager.

364
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,060
Please request a visit with Lee Hwa Ryeon.

365
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,500
The land Jung Goo Tae left...

366
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,580
I need to get it.

367
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,400

368
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,360
Does your wife know

369
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,820
that you come here to eat like this?

370
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,160
How about Jae Yi?

371
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,850
She looks busy.

372
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,520
She's getting into politics or something?

373
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,620
She's very greedy because she resembles you.

374
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,400
Aigoo. That's why they say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

375
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,000
You made my daughter a single mother and abandoned my granddaughter.

376
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,560
But the reason I don't humiliate you to the world is this one reason.

377
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,780
If something happens to my Jae Yi,

378
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,890
you have to help her.

379
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,250
Just like you did 10 years ago.

380
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,530
Okay?

381
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,090
Of course, she's my daughter.

382
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,780
Have you been well?

383
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,590
Do you still have nightmares these days?

384
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,970
Nightmares?

385
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,370
Why do you care?

386
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:42,150
Also, don't ever come here again.

387
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,650
I'm doing well.

388
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,330
I'm glad to hear that you're doing well.

389
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,120
I'll get going now.

390
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,850

391
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,860

392
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,730
Yes, Manager.

393
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:29,670
Lee Hwa Ryeon apparently declined your visit.

394
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,060
I'm going crazy here.

395
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,630
 What should we do?

396
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,570
We need that land to catch that bastard.

397
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,230
 If you buy just 2,000 pyung of that land,

398
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,850
 the entire military district will become this Jung Goo Tae's.

399
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,250
 You could buy land in a better location with that much money.

400
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,970
 Why are you obsessing over the military district that's not worth much?

401
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,430
 I'm telling you this because I think of you as family.

402
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,050
 There's a gem in that land.

403
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:13,900
 To get that, you must also buy all the surrounding land.

404
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,520
 A gem?

405
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,430
 What kind of...

406
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:23,140
 I signed up for a membership at a club a decade ago.

407
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,230
 That's where the club's meeting spot is.

408
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,830
 This is your father's?

409
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,650
 How many times do I have to tell you?

410
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,910
 I stole it from my father's study.

411
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,040
 He said it was a souvenir from a members-only club.

412
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,150
 Where is it?

413
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,540
 That club you're talking about.

414
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,640
 The location of the club is...

415
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,110
 I can't tell you that much.

416
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,400
 I can't show the gem to anyone so easily!

417
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,900
We need to secure that land no matter what.

418
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,810
So, we can find out what the hidden gem is,

419
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:26,400
and that way, we can catch that bastard's tail, too.

420
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,290
Jung Gi Ho left the hospital as soon as the mayor died and disappeared.

421
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,310
Should I look for him?

422
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,190
I've been cleaning after Jung Gi Ho's mess for five years.

423
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,570
I know where he is.

424
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,190

425
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,260
Hello.

426
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,970
Only members are allowed in here.

427
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,380
I'm with Jung Gi Ho, who just went in.

428
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:18,100
He said we should keep a distance since we got caught by his wife recently.

429
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,160
Let her in.

430
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,350
It's this room. You can go in.

431
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,030
Even if you hear anything from this room,

432
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,970
you can't come in, okay?

433
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,760
Gi Ho is kind of rough.

434
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,790
Hey. Let's talk if you're done letting it out on me.

435
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,350
How dare you come here?

436
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,070
You put me in a mental institution!

437
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,500
Isn't a hospital better than a prison?

438
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,050
Why are you here?

439
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,410
Are you here to send me to prison?

440
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:34,010
That would depend on your answer.

441
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,460
Tell me

442
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,110
why your mom killed your dad.

443
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:48,090
Shit. Mom told me not to tell you.

444
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,360
So you suffer a bit!

445
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,870
Do you still think I'm your lawyer?

446
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,000
Should I report you?

447
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,350
Shit! Seriously!

448
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,800
You sneaky bitch.

449
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,430
Emily Go.

450
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,480
Mom went crazy because of that bitch.

451
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,600
Why? Was she jealous by chance?

452
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,080
Do you think she'd get jealous?

453
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,620
He always had a mistress his whole life.

454
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,650
It's not that.

455
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,100
Dad was a womanizer, but never gave them a lot of money.

456
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:35,300
But he gave a huge part of his assets to that bitch Emily Go.

457
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,780
And Mom found out on the celebration party night.

458
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,540
That's why she lost her mind and...

459
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,420
What do you mean, a huge part of his assets?

460
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,640
That land in the military district.

461
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,000
It's all hers.

462
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,700
 But what can we do?

463
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,800
 Whether you like it or not, you have to come to me.

464
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,700

465
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:33,450
Are you telling me... to leave?

466
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,360
What if I don't want to?

467
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,470
But let me ask you this.

468
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:53,070
Who's getting me out of prison and sending me far away?

469
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,030
I'm just relaying the message from the elder.

470
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,210
Here. What would you like to do?

471
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,850
Instead, you can never come back to Korea.

472
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,870
Please keep that in mind.

473
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,210

474
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,980

475
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:41,530
I think meeting you... was the luckiest thing that happened in my life.

476
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,860
I got to adjust in a foreign land

477
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,600
and give birth to such a treasure, too.

478
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,390
I'll... be so good

479
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,460
to you and... our baby, too.

480
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,800
 Anna.

481
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,920
Anna!

482
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,580
What do you want?

483
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,610
Where did he go?

484
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,460
The man who used to live here!

485
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,000
How should I know? He hasn't lived here for years!

486
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:32,620
What about... my baby?

487
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,250
Did he take her?

488
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,680
Of course, he did.

489
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,350
You're not getting paid to stare at that photo all day.

490
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,750
Didn't you say you need money to go to Korea to find your ex-husband?

491
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,470
I heard that VIPs are visiting our restaurant today.

492
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,960
One of them is the mayor of...

493
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,000
To...

494
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,050
Tong... Tongju.

495
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:35,550

496
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,650
Aigoo, thank you so much for arranging such a lovely gathering.

497
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,780
- To a good day!
 - Thank you.

498
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,330
What a beautiful night.

499
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,790
Thank you.

500
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,910

501
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,360
The reason you wanted to see me privately is...

502
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,310
I heard... you're very powerful in Korea.

503
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,820
So, I wanted you to consider it as a charity case

504
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,890
for a poor immigrant and take me to Korea.

505
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,250
Do I have to take you to Korea?

506
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,410
You can just go.

507
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,460
Looks like you'd have an issue entering the country.

508
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,820
Why do you have to go to Korea, anyway?

509
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,200
That means you could go to jail.

510
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,520
I want to catch my ex-husband.

511
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:05,040
That bastard ran away with my child... to Korea.

512
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,260
I see.

513
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,030
You're going because of your child. That's why.

514
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,740
I don't know what to say, though.

515
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,960
I hate getting involved in other people's business.

516
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,570
Sir.

517
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:28,860
I don't want to go to Korea just because of my child.

518
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,870
If I go to Korea, I could see you often, too.

519
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,600
You're cute. And very cheeky, too.

520
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,210
All right.

521
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,900
Should we get you a new identity first?

522
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,840
For some reason, I find that so sexy.

523
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,810
Emily.

524
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,150
How's Emily?

525
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,500
For Emily.

526
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,550
For Emily.

527
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,950

528
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,210
Mayor, this is Emily.

529
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,520
Emily.

530
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,460
You'll have to go to Korea sooner than planned.

531
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,780
Do Jae Yi, that woman is trying to steal my land! How dare she?

532
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,200
 I want you to hold onto that land instead.

533
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,680
 Until I cut ties with Do Jae Yi, okay?

534
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,180
Am I

535
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,570
going to Korea?

536
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,150
 Oh, also...

537
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,990
I found your ex-husband bastard.

538
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:14,150
It turns out he's a real piece of work.

539
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Wait for me, my daughter.

540
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,600
I can see you soon.

541
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,650
No way!

542
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,600
How does Yoo Na own that land? How?

543
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,580
Jung Goo Tae, that bastard.

544
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,540
How could he give that much land to his mistress behind his wife's back?

545
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,350
She must've manipulated him! You know that's her specialty.

546
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:04,710
It's not the time to argue about that right now.

547
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,450
What should we... What should we do now?

548
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:12,330
How will you get the land from Yoo Na, Emily Go, or whatever?

549
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,550
We should get it back.

550
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:17,810
- We have to go to her.
 - How would you find where she is?

551
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,570
We don't even know how to contact her!

552
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,860
Why are we here?

553
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:39,060
Go Yoo Na is here.

554
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,250
How did you know she was here?

555
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,680
I found out what address she used to enter Korea.

556
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,450
Go Yoo Na, that total psychopath!

557
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,110
How could she come here now?

558
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:53,800
We'll find out why she brought us here once we go in.

559
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,680
Yes?

560
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,600
Let them in.

561
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,990
You came.

562
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,180
Do you remember this place?

563
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,760
At the club downstairs, Yu Jeong had her bridal shower.

564
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,960
Wearing masks.

565
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,400
That was fun.

566
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,500
I heard they remodeled this place.

567
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,900
But the layout is the same.

568
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,460
Was it somewhere around here?

569
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,620
Where Gi Do Shik died.

570
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,740
Stop saying nonsense and get to the point.

571
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:36,330
If you give us the land we need, we'll do anything you want.

572
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:40,950
You'll do what I want... anything?

573
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:49,560
We can pay you more than the market price.

574
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,230
Wouldn't that work?

575
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,220
You must think I'm the same Go Yoo Na who had no money and support.

576
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,410
I don't need money anymore.

577
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,480
What else do you want other than money?

578
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,220
I want you to kill someone.

579
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,750
My ex-husband.

580
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,580
I want you to kill him.

581
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:33,420
Just like how you killed Gi Do Shik at this very place.

582
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:49,030
Is it a trend to kill husbands these days?

583
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,140
Lee Hwa Ryeon killed her husband Jung Goo Tae, too!

584
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,560
I don't know what your ex-husband did, but why are you so proud?

585
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,410
You were with a married man, too. Jung Goo Tae.

586
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:10,200
If Lee Hwa Ryeon knew, you'd be dead, too. Do you know that?

587
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,770
Who's your ex-husband?

588
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,520
Who is he, and why should we kill him?

589
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,350
I'll tell you who my ex-husband is if you say you'll kill him.

590
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,510
What do you think? Can you kill him?

591
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,420
Are you out of your mind?

592
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,940
Why? You don't want to?

593
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,000
It would be easy since you've done it once.

594
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,460
You should do it, then.

595
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,840
You're the one who killed Gi Do Shik.

596
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,420
You... I heard you got raped here.

597
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,000
By a man in a mask.

598
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,710
That man in a mask could be Gi Do Shik,

599
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,010
and that's why you killed him.

600
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,800
But I heard that's how people are.

601
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,420
They forget the memories that are too horrifying.

602
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,990
Isn't that why you forgot, too?

603
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,720
The fact that you killed him?

604
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,460
You...

605
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:24,260
do you really want to die?

606
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,980
If it wasn't you, who could it be?

607
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,260
Was it you guys?

608
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:46,580
To be honest, my mouth is itching.

609
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,590
I can't wait to tell everyone about what happened.

610
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:55,700
If so, your hypocrisy and weakness

611
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,620
would all be revealed to everyone, right?

612
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,060
You couldn't even keep your heads up.

613
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:10,300
Why don't you do me a favor, then?

614
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,570
If so, nothing would ever happen.

615
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,960
Guys.

616
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,610
Let's go.

617
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,450
She's not even worth dealing with.

618
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,430
Can I do it, then?

619
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,100
Killing that bastard.

620
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,000
Do as you wish.

621
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,630
He's your ex-husband.

622
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,460
You can't just leave like this. Will you give up?

623
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,070
Will you kill someone, then?

624
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,330
We need to try something, at least!

625
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:25,390
- If she's ticked and pokes into the past─ 
 - Why?

626
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,020
Is there a reason why she shouldn't?

627
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,790
Go Yoo Na isn't a fool.

628
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,400
She even fooled us perfectly for over a decade.

629
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,000
She's very cunning.

630
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,070
Does she really think we would kill her ex-husband?

631
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,390
It's either a cry for help because she's so desperate or if not

632
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,360
she's announcing she will go after us.

633
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:03,250
I didn't give up on the land.

634
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:07,570
I'm just saying I can't be played by Go Yoo Na.

635
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:11,280
So trust me and wait.

636
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,390
I'll get going now.

637
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,530
And you?

638
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,900
Are you okay?

639
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,970
Are you okay if she pokes around what happened 10 years ago?

640
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,400
I'll get going.

641
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,130
Talk to me before you leave.

642
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,860
She's so stubborn.

643
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,620
She thinks she's superior.

644
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,870
Why are you doing this to Jae Yi, anyway?

645
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,140
She's too overbearing!

646
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,320
Yoo Na said she would reveal our pasts and ruin us,

647
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,720
but she's acting like she has nothing to hide!

648
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,810
I guess she's not feeling guilty toward Yoo Na.

649
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,750
No, I think

650
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,680
she might be doing that because she is guilty.

651
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,220
Guilty? Jae Yi is?

652
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,460
I never thought about this,

653
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,480
but listening to Yoo Na today

654
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,300
made me wonder if it was really Jae Yi who killed Gi Do Shik.

655
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,070
I would want to kill the bastard who raped me, too.

656
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:35,260
Jae Yi said she was assaulted by another man, not Gi Do Shik.

657
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,650
The police said there was no other man!

658
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,200
I don't know, I don't know.

659
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,210
I can't even think anymore.

660
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,570
I'm just so scared!

661
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,500
What if Yoo Na pokes around that case again─

662
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,550
Then it's over.

663
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:55,980
What we did to Gi Do Shik isn't the issue.

664
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,890
I did drugs.

665
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,790
You got played by him, got pregnant, and had a miscarriage.

666
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,620
- If the world finds out about it─ 
 - Hey!

667
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,980
Don't even mention it.

668
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,820
I don't even want to think about Je Hyeok finding out.

669
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,540
That's why we can't just trust Jae Yi.

670
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,610
We need to figure out how to survive ourselves.

671
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:27,870
Do you mean, you would contact Yoo Na separately or something?

672
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,180
If I can survive.

673
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,620
 Who's your ex-husband?

674
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,430
Idiots.

675
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,380
You have no clue.

676
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,760
Why are you acting this way?

677
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,500
You're letting it out on food.

678
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:21,640
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

679
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,970
By chance,

680
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:33,770
are you curious to hear about Yoo Na?

681
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:39,820
I heard she refused to see you when she was in prison.

682
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,140
She hasn't been in touch since she got out on parole, too.

683
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:48,970
So, I'm asking if you're curious about her.

684
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,740
Eat. The noodles will get soggy.

685
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,090
Kang Hoo, to be honest...

686
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,670
You have something on your clothes.

687
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,310
I'm sorry.

688
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,380
I'll get going.

689
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,370
Let me answer first.

690
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:56,570
You asked me if I'm curious about Yoo Na.

691
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,320
I'm not interested in hearing about her.

692
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,260
But I want to ask you this.

693
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:09,100
What can I do to get you out of that hell?

694
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:34,100

695
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,800

696
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,650

697
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,400
I'll end this hell.

698
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,670
Manager.

699
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:08,900
I think we need to get someone to follow Go Yoo Na.

700
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,600
Please find out who her ex-husband is.

701
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,800
He's the only one who can stop her.

702
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,500
 Branch Manager.

703
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,180
Our loan situation,

704
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,670
could you delay it a bit?

705
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:29,200
It's on the news. I'm taking on a big project in Tongju City.

706
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,160
As soon as the business starts─

707
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,980
Chairwoman, Director Kim Heung Shik is here.

708
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,920
I hope you understand and make it work.

709
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,580
Yes.

710
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,480
Hello.

711
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,900
Would you like some tea?

712
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,150
First of all, Chairwoman─

713
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:56,590
You can speak casually when we're alone, Ahjussi.

714
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,870
Yes, Yu Jeong.

715
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:04,080
This is about Team Leader Song Je Hyeok.

716
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,700
Tongju's Mariela Hanok Hotel will have 51 rooms in total,

717
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,510
from floor B3 to the 3rd floor.

718
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,810
The construction will take four years and cost 300 billion won.

719
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,210
By employing over 1,000 people and leveraging,

720
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:24,630
it could contribute to the local economy.

721
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,240
By building a traditional Korean hanok hotel...

722
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,160
Thank you!

723
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,030
Thank you.

724
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:37,450
Are you on drugs?

725
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,210
You're thriving these days.

726
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,320
Give me some if it's good for me, too.

727
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,310
What drugs?

728
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:01,660
If you really want to know, it's the sense of accomplishment.

729
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:04,410
If all of your ideas get accepted,

730
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,360
you're energized without taking a drug like that.

731
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,260
I'll admit it.

732
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,130
You're capable.

733
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,150
This is why they say God is fair.

734
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:20,980
You were given the power I don't have,

735
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,960
but you were given an embarrassing family, too.

736
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:30,620
Embarrassing family?

737
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,530
Is it true

738
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:36,390
that your mom and your husband

739
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,430
used to work at clubs?

740
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,420
Is that what you're talking about?

741
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,080
I don't know what to say.

742
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,960
I'm not embarrassed about that at all!

743
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,510
You're the one who's ashamed, Director Kim Ji Hee.

744
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,680
Your nickname is "Bomb" for a reason.

745
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,690
Bomb?

746
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,030
Because you're the chairman's niece*,
  (She made it sound like the f-word)

747
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:09,470
the company couldn't do anything except to accept you.

748
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:13,830
But each department is afraid that you'd go off, so they toss you around

749
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,030
like a bomb.

750
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,080
What?

751
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,950
How dare you... shit...

752
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,450
If I kick you with my knee, you'll need another nose job.

753
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,470
Well, should I?

754
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,380
Are you insane? Let go!

755
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:54,870
If you bring up my family again, I won't let it go.

756
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,670
You'd no longer be a bomb.

757
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:59,990
You'll be a firework and disintegrate in the air.

758
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:06,930
 Noona, now is about the time you get pissed off at work, right?

759
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,770
 Think of me and restrain yourself.

760
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:14,570
 I'll use a lavender-scented bath bomb and prepare a bath for you.

761
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:17,400
 Fighting, my honey!

762
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:43,710
 Do Jae Yi, what did you decide on Yoo Na's land?

763
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,970

764
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:00,170
Why did you want to see me?

765
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:03,740
- You'll need to come back to work.
 - What?

766
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:07,100
Kids these days just aren't as professional as you.

767
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,370
Geez! You know, I got married.

768
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:11,890
Hyung.

769
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:15,730
Rather than satisfying many women like I used to,

770
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:20,810
I'm satisfied with my life, where I only focus on my noona.

771
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,320
Okay.

772
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,950
If that's what you really want.

773
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:27,790
Yes.

774
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:35,360
By the way, does your wife know, too?

775
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,010
About the kind of things you did?

776
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,360
I'm sorry.

777
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,840
I tried my best,

778
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,440
but I guess I'm not talented at cooking.

779
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,220
It's okay.

780
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,580
When we get married, I'll cook for you all the time.

781
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,450
 How much

782
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:41,800
 do you know about your future husband?

783
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,120
 What are you talking about?

784
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:48,840
 Do you know how much money he spent last year on an unknown cause?

785
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,320
 It's 1.9 billion won (~$1.4 million).

786
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:56,850
 Do you know where that money went to?

787
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,530
Je Hyeok.

788
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,430
I...

789
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,470
know it might be uncomfortable,

790
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:14,580
but I think we should tell each other about our secrets.

791
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:18,830
That way, we won't have any misunderstandings after we get married.

792
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,700
Do you think I'm keeping a secret from you?

793
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,400
Yu Jeong.

794
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,380
Could you possibly accompany me to the orphanage tomorrow?

795
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:59,980
Was it about a year ago when I came to this orphanage

796
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:02,570
as a sales director?

797
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:09,760
Seeing you put almost too much effort into these kids

798
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,090
made me think, "How could someone so nice exist?"

799
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,520
Angel!

800
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,110
Angel, you came.

801
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:24,740
Angel?

802
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,510
Yes. Angel.

803
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,260
That's Mr. Song's nickname.

804
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:35,010
He's called Angel at this orphanage.

805
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,530
I think people found out

806
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:52,050
that I paid for Ye Ji's leg surgery.

807
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:57,360
So other orphanages called me about their sick children.

808
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,110
They asked me to help them, too.

809
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:06,740
I couldn't just say no because they're not from our orphanage.

810
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,790
So I had no choice but to pay them.

811
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:14,840
And you couldn't include that in our company's ledger,

812
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,560
because it wasn't for our orphanage.

813
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,320
I'm sorry.

814
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,450
The foundation's funds have to be transparent,

815
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,760
but I made a mistake.

816
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:32,720
But whenever I see sick children, I can't just ignore them.

817
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,190
Because they remind me of you.

818
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,700
 Branch Manager.

819
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,380
I'm sorry to call you so late.

820
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,950
I needed to talk to you urgently.

821
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:53,060
It's regarding the loan payment that's due tomorrow.

822
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:56,000
You remember the 10 billion (~$7.4 million) we got from Mariela?

823
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,520
Please use that to block that for now.

824
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,160
Yes, I know that it can't be done.

825
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,180
But Tongju City will start the construction soon

826
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:10,290
and I can pay for it when the investment money comes in.

827
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,960
I'll risk my credit for it.

828
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,010
 Jae Yi. What will you do with Yoo Na's land?

829
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:01,490
That's the land we'll be building the arts and culture village on,

830
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,890
but Go Yoo Na owns it now.

831
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:09,420
I asked you to come to show it to you.

832
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:13,280
Go Yoo Na is definitely talented.

833
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,520
She got a land like that from a man so easily.

834
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,120
It will be

835
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:23,300
difficult to find other land to build an arts and culture village on, right?

836
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,980
It has to be that land.

837
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,560
There's a gem hidden in there.

838
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,690
What gem?

839
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:33,700
Is there a gold mine? Is there oil?

840
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,370
Yu Jeong.

841
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:38,900
You said your orphanage's there, right?

842
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,290
Yes.

843
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:44,050
Although, it's a small land. Smaller than 2,000 pyung.

844
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:49,250
Can I announce my candidacy there two days from now?

845
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,950
Would that be okay?

846
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:54,850
You want to announce your candidacy in the middle of Yoo Na's land?

847
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,660
How provocative.

848
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:02,180
You think Yoo Na would give us the land because of that?

849
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:06,620
Don't worry. I have a plan.

850
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:11,160
More importantly, I want to hear your answers first.

851
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,260
After I officially announce my candidacy,

852
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:17,460
the media will focus on me even more.

853
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,900
Including everyone surrounding me.

854
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,250
Would you guys be okay?

855
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,990
If you don't feel confident, quit now.

856
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:39,060
You can disband the operating committee.

857
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:43,570
And you can take back the donation from the foundation. Then it's over.

858
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:45,330
What are you talking about?

859
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:48,180
Of course, we'll join you.

860
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,060
Of course!

861
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:53,030
I need to build a hanok hotel there.

862
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,480
Fine.

863
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:07,280
If so, stand beside me when I announce my candidacy in two days.

864
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:13,090
I need to show people that I have dependable friends like you by my side.

865
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,960
Thank you so much for coming.

866
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,280
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable by contacting you.

867
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,240
You think of me as a murderer.

868
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,400
Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul.

869
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:47,860
But... what if I'm not the real culprit who killed your son?

870
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:51,250
If so, who is it, then?

871
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,570
Who's the murderer who killed my son?

872
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:20,670

873
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,700
The fact that you're running for mayor of Tongju feels out of the blue.

874
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,480
What prompted this, exactly?

875
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:43,340
Yes. Former mayor Jung Goo Tae donated the military district to Yeongun Foundation

876
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,410
hoping for the arts and culture village

877
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:48,930
to be built and become a landmark for Tongju.

878
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:51,740
Although former mayor Jung Goo Tae passed away,

879
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:54,830
I decided to run for mayor of Tongju

880
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:58,770
to realize his resolution regardless of my shortcomings.

881
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,970
Since you announced your candidacy,

882
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:05,530
will the construction of the arts and culture village start?

883
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:09,590
Yes, I'll try my best to make sure the construction

884
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:14,450
starts as soon as possible alongside

885
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:17,520
my trusty friends right here.

886
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,720
Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul!

887
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,720
What brings you here?

888
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:52,980
Well, as an assemblyman for Tongju,

889
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:56,730
how could I miss an announcement for the

890
01:15:56,730 --> 01:16:01,190
head of our city to run as mayor of Tongju?

891
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,370
Also, I...

892
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:09,530
have a special relationship with Candidate Do Jae Yi, too.

893
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,770
Isn't that true?

894
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:24,280
You came to an event for a novice politician like me.

895
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,770
I think I can understand why you've been loved and

896
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:32,060
respected by the people of Tongju for 25 years.

897
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:39,170
Everyone, shall we applaud Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul?

898
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,850
Why did he come here?

899
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:05,570
Neither of us is delighted to see each other.

900
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,690
 How did you like my present?

901
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,790
 Don't do anything stupid.

902
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:49,200

903
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,590
So, this is the symbol of the secret club.

904
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,530
Try it on.

905
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:24,000

906
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:31,230

907
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:35,890
♫  Dark desires hiding behind a mask  ♫

908
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:38,450
♫  They're liars  ♫

909
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:41,160
♫  The truth is completely hidden behind a curtain  ♫

910
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,650
 ~ Preview ~ 
Why did Gi Yoon Chul, that bastard, come here?

911
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:46,180
 It was definitely Go Yoo Na who sent Gi Yoon Chul.

912
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:48,680
 Please continue following Go Yoo Na around.

913
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,760
 I'll be the one to take revenge on Do Jae Yi.

914
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:57,180
 This mask. How did you acquire it, exactly?

915
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:00,320
 If there's anything I can do to help catch that bastard...

916
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,430
 Congratulations again, you two.

917
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,990
 What will you two do now?

918
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:06,910
 Today is your first day as a couple.

919
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:11,460
 You can't trust anything in this world.

920
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:13,800
 Secrets are only fun when they stay secrets.

921
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,840
 Is that all you have to say?

922
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,160
 What are you planning to do?

923
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,850
 Be my friends again

924
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,780
 like in the old days.

925
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,580
 What's with you?

926
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,510
 She didn't come today.

927
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:26,410
 What if the father of my daughter is Kang Hoo?

928
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,560
 So don't trust anyone.

929
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,960
 Aren't you afraid of me?

930
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:35,480
 Let's make a deal.

931
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:40,120
♫  On top of the tightrope show, everything is blood stained  ♫
