1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,880
 Jae Yi, even if I die, your father should never...

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,670
 Mom!

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,500
 Mom!

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,590
 Mom.

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,480
 This is... Do Jae Yi.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,250
 It's Suite 2401, right?

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,260
 Do Jae Yi!

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,220
 Did you come instead?

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,190

11
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,950

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,350

13
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,910
 I searched Ye Ji's room as you ordered, and this was found.

14
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,800
 I think Do Jae Yi gave it to her.

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,700
 We should meet, Jae Yi.

16
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,600
 Please hear what I have to say.

17
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,140

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,240

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,960

20
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,090

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,700

22
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,830
Next. Four.

23
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,940

24
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,510
Why? Is it hard?

25
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,340
It's not that. I'm upset.

26
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,090
We don't get pocket money since the Angels don't come these days.

27
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,910
Serving alcohol at your age is wrong, don't you know?

28
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,690
I know, but still.

29
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,530
I need money to get the leg surgery.

30
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,050
I want to run around like other kids, too.

31
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,340
Don't worry. I'll make sure to get you the leg surgery.

32
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,690
But apparently, I can make a lot of money like you, too, once I'm a little older.

33
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,700
What do you mean?

34
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,590
The principal told me. When I'm old enough to wear a school uniform like you,

35
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,100
the Angels will give me a lot of money.

36
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,080
I can't wait to wear a school uniform, too.

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,780
 The reason why I don't give up on catching him is

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,030
 because the bad men don't do bad things just once.

39
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,290
 If we stay silent, someone else might get hurt.

40
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,790
 And it could be someone we love, too.

41
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,200

42
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,760
Attorney Do Jae Yi?

43
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,960
Don't waste your energy.

44
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,300
What the hell are you doing?

45
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,820
 I didn't bring you here. It was Yu Jeong.

46
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,130
You'd ruin your life because of your friends.

47
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,420
 Just tell me why.

48
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,930
 What did I...

49
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,040
What did we do to you to make you do this?

50
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,740
What you guys did to me

51
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,690
was to catch my attention?

52
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,010
Quit spewing bullshit and tell me the truth.

53
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,620
Was all of this your plan since 10 years ago?

54
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,440
Geez. How could I have planned all this before?

55
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,920
I'm so annoyed that I got involved with you guys, too!

56
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,320
To be honest, what happened 10 years ago was a coincidence.

57
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,760
To be exact,

58
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,540
 - Did you come instead? 
 - you created that coincidence.

59
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,720
 She's the wrong one.

60
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,460
 I thought you were giving that drink to Go Yoo Na.

61
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,390
 Hey, bastard! She ran away!

62
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,970
If you didn't come to that room, Gi Do Shik wouldn't have died.

63
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,320
So,

64
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,370
is that why you approached Yoo Na?

65
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,400
Did you feel guilty for making her a murderer?

66
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,890
Should I feel guilty for falling in love?

67
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,010
We loved each other! That's why we had Na Na.

68
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,760
You should've stopped with Yoo Na, then!

69
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,670
Why did you approach Yu Jeong?

70
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,210
 I love Yu Jeong, too.

71
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:09,110
 She's pretty, rich, and she's totally smitten with me.

72
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,010
How could I not love her?

73
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,580
 You're lying.

74
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,970
Your only goal was to take this orphanage.

75
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,560
Why did it have to be this orphanage out of all places?

76
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,670
There are children here!

77
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,140
 Because there are children here.

78
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,050
They don't even have parents to help them, even if something happens.

79
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:40,290
When the rich people come here, people think it's noblesse oblige.

80
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,280
They think they came to do a good deed.

81
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,300
 There can't be more of a perfect spot to play secretly.

82
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,130
Your secret play is over.

83
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,600
Do you think the documents will get buried if you kill me?

84
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,970
Kill? Why?

85
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:10,370
There's another way to ruin someone without killing them.

86
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,670
You know that better than me.

87
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,810
 Yes.

88
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,370
 It's what you think it is.

89
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,710
The documents you stole can't hurt me at all.

90
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,610
So quit chasing after me and this club immediately.

91
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,350
Otherwise... what you're thinking about will start.

92
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,700
Unless you surrender.

93
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,380
 Jae Yi, you've been through so much.

94
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,430
 I'll relax your body and mind now.

95
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,620
Take a long nap.

96
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:14,250

97
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,430

98
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,300
I told her to call me when she got home.

99
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,610
She's always like this.

100
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,760

101
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,830
Yes, Yeon Ah.

102
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,900
Ahjussi, I think I could testify.

103
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,520
I mean, let me.

104
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,850
 Do you mean it?

105
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,400
Can you really do that?

106
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,360
Attorney Do was right.

107
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,440
If I don't muster up the courage, Ye Ji will get hurt like me, too.

108
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,130
I'll tell Jae Yi.

109
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,670
 Let's discuss it with her.

110
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,150
By the way, Ahjussi,

111
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,220
I think I just saw Attorney Do.

112
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,430
You saw Jae Yi? Where?

113
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:08,000
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

114
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,050
 Na Na has to be a part of the campaign!

115
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,440
 Let's talk after the election.

116
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,600

117
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,770

118
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,410

119
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,600
 The door is open.

120
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,120
Yes, how can I help you?

121
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,470
I'm here to see Patient Ju Yu Jeong.

122
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,270
Visiting hours are over. Please come back tomorrow.

123
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,540
Open it. It's an urgent matter.

124
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,250
No. Please come back tomorrow.

125
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,310
Open it right now! Right now!

126
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,140

127
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,360
I'll call the security if you keep doing this.

128
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,520
Please leave.

129
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,510
Hold on!

130
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,520
Open it! Before I break everything!

131
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,150
What are you doing right now?

132
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,360
- Open it for now!
 - Open it!

133
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,950
What are you doing?

134
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,400
Hey, Ju Yu Jeong, you're here, right?

135
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,490
Na Na is sick!

136
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,280
She might die!

137
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,560
How could you...

138
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,510
How could you do this?

139
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,320
How could you possibly do this?

140
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,000
Yu Jeong!

141
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,310
Yu Jeong!

142
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,660
Let Na Na live!

143
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,080

144
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,430
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

145
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,070

146
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,900
Chief! Send the officers to Chunsarang Orphanage immediately!

147
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,050
 Attorney Do is in danger!

148
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,030
What are you talking about so suddenly in the middle of the night?

149
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,290
Just send them there!

150
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,780
Attorney Do is being held hostage by Song Je Hyeok!

151
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,330
Hey! I was humiliated because I raided that orphanage because of Do Jae Yi last time!

152
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,060
 To report an illegal activity,

153
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,230
 acquire concrete evidence and follow the procedure. Got it?

154
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,160
Wait! Chief! Chief!

155
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,870

156
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,780
Hey, Yeon Ah.

157
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,350
Ahjussi, the door to the club is locked.

158
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,930
I think she's locked in there.

159
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,860
 I can't even send police, this is driving me crazy.

160
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,320
Then I'll try going inside.

161
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,270
- I can do it.
  - You will?

162
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,040
No, no! It's dangerous!

163
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,650
Yeon Ah! Yeon Ah!

164
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,910
Aigoo, she's so tenacious.

165
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,390
She's really desperate.

166
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,990
Until when should we keep her in there?

167
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,220
We can't... do this for so long.

168
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,920
We should keep her in there until she goes crazy.

169
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,080
What could she do if I let her out afterward?

170
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,080
As a lunatic.

171
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,720
What's going on at this hour?

172
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,400
Someone went on a rampage, demanding to see Ms. Ju.

173
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,540
 Should I call the police?

174
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,300
No, don't call the police.

175
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,120
I'll be right there.

176
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,270
Thank you.

177
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,980
Go Yoo Na!

178
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:54,230
I'll be out for a moment. No one can know that Do Jae Yi's in here.

179
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,270
Watch her closely.

180
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,780
Yes. Got it.

181
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,130

182
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,870
What?

183
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,760
Where?

184
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,690
Right now?

185
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,720
Okay, I'll go to the backyard.

186
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,980
Geez! Lee Yeon Ah.

187
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,020
How dare you try to call?

188
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,680
If we don't get out now, we'll both die!

189
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,560
You crazy bitch!

190
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,390
Let go!

191
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,650

192
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,420
You're sick? How?

193
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,860
My stomach has been hurting a lot.

194
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,050
Stomach? Take a digestive med, then.

195
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,930
It's not that. It's more of a gynecology issue.

196
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,180
Can I possibly go into my room at the club?

197
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,500
I left my medicine there.

198
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,690
I told you to prepare things in advance. Why did you leave it there?

199
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,570
Should I keep a medicine like that in my dorm room, then?

200
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,170
Keep talking back at me like that.

201
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,760
Fine, follow me.

202
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,970
 There's a small entrance only we know about next to the main entrance.

203
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,660
 Come in through there.

204
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,140
You're only supposed to come in here when the Angels come.

205
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,990
I don't see anything.

206
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,690
There's nothing here.

207
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,310
Did it fall under the bed? Could you check?

208
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,020
Geez, how annoying!

209
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,420
It's not here.

210
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,700
By the way, Yeon Ah.

211
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,150
I feel like I'm being tricked by you.

212
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,980
Are you tricking me by chance?

213
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,440
Shit, I was right.

214
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:19,600
Why? Why are you tricking me? Huh?

215
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,510
Did you lure me here?

216
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,160
Why? Why did you lure me in here?

217
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,530
Did Do Jae Yi make you?

218
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,700
Don't be startled.

219
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,590
I know... what you're thinking about.

220
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,600
I know what you do.

221
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,630
I know all about it, you stupid teenager.

222
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,190
Are you okay?

223
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,790
I'm okay.

224
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,390
We need to find the master key right now!

225
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,540
Let's go.

226
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,120

227
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,420
- Jae Yi! Jae Yi!
 - Attorney Do!

228
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,800
Jae Yi! Jae Yi!

229
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,220
Don't touch it!

230
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,100
- It's a poisonous powder.
 - P-Poisonous?

231
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,070
Let's get out of here. I can't feel her breathing.

232
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,370
Thank you. I'll talk to her.

233
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,220
Okay.

234
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,980
Aigoo, I'm so sick and tired.

235
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,400
Don't you know this makes things worse for Na Na?

236
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,600
Let me ask you a favor.

237
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,010
If Go Yoo Na can't donate her liver as her biological mother,

238
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,570
let Emily Go do it.

239
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm Emily Go, too.

240
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,300
Are you kidding me right now?

241
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:22,250
Say you had Na Na with Emily Go when you were in the US.

242
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,680
Make up a document like that.

243
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,000
I know you can do it.

244
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,100
Why do I have to go through the trouble of forging a document?

245
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,240
You know... I have land in Tongju, right?

246
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,030
The one Jung Goo Tae gave me.

247
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,500
I agreed to give it to Jae Yi,

248
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,160
but I'll give it to you.

249
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,530
I heard Jae Yi found out about your business at the orphanage.

250
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,170
You'll need a new space.

251
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,500
You aren't trying to pull anything, right?

252
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,080
Na Na is more important than that land to me.

253
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,210
You'll take the land and I'll take the child.

254
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,640
Okay, I'll contact you when the document is ready. But...

255
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,830
don't tell Yu Jeong.

256
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,540
Things will get complicated if she finds out.

257
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,260
Gosh, look at you! Seriously.

258
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,930
Ms. Ju.

259
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,730
Looks like she's sleeping.

260
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,170
 I'm not the one who's mocking you.

261
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,570
 Do you know who ruined your life using drugs?

262
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,270
 Your lovely husband Cha Leo.

263
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,310
 He says he loves you and he'll protect you.

264
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,860
 Isn't that the greatest insult?

265
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,580
You were home, Noona.

266
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,490
Noona.

267
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,120
What are you doing─

268
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,500
I heard it was you.

269
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,410
The one who put me in this hell.

270
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,770
How dare you pretend to care about me after that?

271
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:29,420
When Gi Do Shik died 10 years ago, I went to that room.

272
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,510
Do you know why?

273
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,470
To get this!

274
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,220
If it were not for this,

275
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,740
I wouldn't have gotten involved in that disgusting case, either.

276
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,560
I should quit using drugs, then, right?

277
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,090
But I craved it more.

278
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,580
Whenever I think of that day,

279
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,120
and whenever I feel stressed!

280
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,180
Every single night,

281
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,870
I fight the urge to take drugs.

282
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,860
Do you know how much I struggled every night

283
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,240
scratching my whole body without you noticing?

284
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:23,070
But you were the one who put me in this hell?

285
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,410
Were you the one who ruined my life?

286
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,910
How could you do that to me?

287
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,130
How could you?

288
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:48,640
 Do you know who addicts blame most when they hit rock bottom?

289
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,110
 The one who sold the drug to them.

290
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,850
 If her life goes wrong, she'll hate you the most.

291
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,980
But Noona,

292
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,400
my life wasn't exactly heavenly, either.

293
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,250
Living with you...

294
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,290
I mean, as I fell in love with you,

295
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,580
my life has been hellish, too.

296
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,140
Every day, I was nervous and anxious, thinking you might look for drugs again.

297
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,960
I couldn't sleep because of guilt.

298
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,460
That's why I started at Ace Bar again, so they don't sell drugs to you.

299
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,800
Don't you know that made me struggle even more?

300
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,970
The police received a report about you.

301
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,780
You might go to jail for selling drugs if things go wrong!

302
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,750
Just for selling drugs?

303
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,810
I'll commit a lot more crimes from now on.

304
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:51,100
I got involved in a secret club, too. Not just Ace Bar.

305
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:57,240
But... I'll go deeper into that world.

306
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,990
I'll expose what that bastard Song Je Hyeok does

307
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,320
and ruin his life, too.

308
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,340
Are you crazy?

309
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,550
That would ruin not only his life but yours, too!

310
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,630
I don't care what happens to my life.

311
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,780
Noona.

312
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,630
I hope you don't do stuff like this.

313
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,970
If you give this to Song Je Hyeok and ruin Jae Yi,

314
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,930
do you think you'd be okay?

315
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,600
You would regret it.

316
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,760
No, you would feel tormented.

317
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,550
Just like how I feel tormented for what I did to you.

318
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,570
So don't give this to him.

319
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,540
It's my last request.

320
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,010

321
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,090
- What happened?
 - I think she ingested blowfish venom.

322
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,690
I can't feel breathing or pulse.

323
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,270
Prepare the intubation.

324
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,560
 You f***ing moron!

325
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,980
You let Do Jae Yi go?

326
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,560
Is this how you do your job?

327
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,910
She totally tricked me. I'm sorry. It's my fault.

328
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,770
What happened? I heard she fainted.

329
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I don't think he'll die because he's so strong.

330
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,380
Not him. I meant Do Jae Yi!

331
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,560
She fainted. I checked the security footage, and she seemed unconscious.

332
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,000
Search every hospital in Tongju.

333
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,300
If she's alive, shut her up forever.

334
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,990
- You know what I mean, right?
 - Yes.

335
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,200
Got it.

336
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,540
 There's no antidote for blowfish venom.

337
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,670
 We need to monitor her while giving her oxygen and wait for the blood pressure to drop.

338
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,900
 Starting now, the next 24 hours will be critical.

339
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,820
 That would not only ruin his life but yours, too!

340
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,950
 I don't care what happens to my life.

341
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,940
 I hope you don't do stuff like this.

342
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,540
 If you give this to Song Je Hyeok and ruin Jae Yi,

343
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,890
 do you think you'd be okay?

344
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,800
Hello.

345
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,000
Leo was arrested?

346
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,890
I'll go to the police station right now.

347
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,640

348
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,570
It was you, wasn't it?

349
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,410
How could you do this?

350
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,380
I haven't given you my answer yet!

351
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,590
I thought you were struggling to make a decision, so I made one for you.

352
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:52,230
So forget about that puppy and protect yourself.

353
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,500
Today is the last day you can give me Do Jae Yi's weakness.

354
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,820
People might think I'm a stranger, not your husband.

355
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,520
I got spooked while sleeping.

356
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,560
Why are you sleeping so much?

357
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,990
The nurse said you went to sleep early.

358
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,250
Did you go out last night?

359
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,780
No way.

360
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,210
Where would I go in the middle of the night?

361
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,280
If so...

362
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,290
What's this, then?

363
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,900
I went out on a walk yesterday.

364
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,420
I wanted to get some fresh air.

365
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,600
I guess it must feel stuffy to stay in bed.

366
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,350
Anyway, there's something I want to discuss with you.

367
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,800
I'm thinking of closing down the orphanage.

368
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,220
Why?

369
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,740
You used to love that place.

370
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,320
I lost my interest now.

371
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,960
Why? You don't want to?

372
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,450
No.

373
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,780
Go ahead.

374
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,280
I don't get involved with the foundation anymore.

375
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,320
Thank you for trusting me.

376
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,070
Since you still have the right to make a decision,

377
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,400
I'll get you the paperwork when it's ready.

378
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,630
Je Hyeok.

379
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,820
Na Na is doing well, right?

380
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,790
Of course! I think she's enjoying the trip a lot,

381
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,530
since she's not even contacting you.

382
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,600
I'll get going, then.

383
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,660
Looks like you're feeling better since you're eating well.

384
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,520
- Na Na.
 - Yes?

385
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,570
I...

386
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,560
might not be able to come for a while.

387
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,010
But the next time I come back, instead of calling me ahjumma,

388
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,360
could you call me Mom?

389
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,770
Huh? I have a mom, though.

390
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,390
A mom is

391
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,320
someone who can do anything for you.

392
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,240
I... can do that for you.

393
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,790
So until then,

394
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,290
don't be sick, okay?

395
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:45,860
Leave now!

396
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,520
Before her dad comes! Hurry!

397
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,210
I won't make you feel uncomfortable from now on.

398
00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:00,120
I'll come back proudly as her mom next time.

399
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,800

400
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,620
What are you so angry about this time?

401
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,450
Jae Yi!

402
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,640
Did you know he almost killed her?

403
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,490
- Who is "he"?
 - The one

404
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,940
who did the unspeakable thing to Jae Yi 10 years ago!

405
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,910
So how's Jae Yi right now?

406
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,830
I don't know yet.

407
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,610
She's at a hospital, apparently!

408
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,400

409
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,480
All of this for that mask.

410
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,940
Live. Please.

411
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,810
The fact that I came here─

412
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:20,400
I know. It's a secret.

413
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,520
I'm the only one who knows about your relationship with Jae Yi.

414
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,830
If so... could I ask you a favor?

415
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,990
If Jae Yi wakes up...

416
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,680

417
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,400
It was Song Je Hyeok's trap.

418
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,340
He framed me for everything

419
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:13,980
he did at Ace Bar and he even reported me.

420
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,800
He's a really dangerous person.

421
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,590
You should've never gotten involved with him.

422
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,270
Did you move out to let me see you like this?

423
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,460
I wanted to avenge him for you.

424
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,020
I know he's torturing you.

425
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,480
But I ruined everything.

426
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,850
I'm sorry, Noona.

427
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,630
Cha Leo. Lift your head.

428
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,320
I didn't mean it when I said you ruined my life.

429
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,580
I did it to myself!

430
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,310
I ruined my own life. Who else can I blame?

431
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,850
I just wanted to blame someone.

432
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,530
Otherwise, I'd be too shameful.

433
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,260
So, it's not your fault.

434
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,590
Don't blame yourself.

435
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,100
Don't cry about stuff like this! Be a man!

436
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,690
Did I raise you this way?

437
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,000
Don't worry.

438
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,880
I'll get the best lawyer and get you out.

439
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,170
Until I come back,

440
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,330
eat well and...

441
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,510
be healthy, okay?

442
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,640
Are you going somewhere?

443
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,580
Why do you sound like you're leaving somewhere?

444
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,980
 I'll send you Do Jae Yi's ledger.

445
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:50,340

446
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,940
- I'll be out for lunch.
 - Okay, see you!

447
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,390
Yes, I'll be right there.

448
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,600
What? Do Jae Yi is gone?

449
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,990
You don't know where she went?

450
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,960
If you can't find her, we're all dead. You know, right?

451
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,540
Search everywhere, including her home and office!

452
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,470
Where did she go now?

453
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,410
 Chairman, you got a package from Yoon Hae Mi.

454
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,150
 I put it under your desk.

455
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,460

456
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,980
What's this?

457
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,520
 Oops! What should I do?

458
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,720
 It's burnt!

459
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,610
 This is for what you did to my man.

460
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:18,340
 Get it, Song Je Hyeok?

461
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,960
They're both flipping out at the same time!

462
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,210
Chairman, this is Song Je Hyeok.

463
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,720
I wanted to send you a photo.

464
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,470
It's a photo of Vice President Yoo Hae Mi.

465
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,210
Take a rest.

466
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,340
Excuse me, Ma'am.

467
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:08,550
I'm sorry, but can I borrow your phone?

468
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,340
Well, yes.

469
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:40,020
I want ramyeon instead of this.

470
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,840
Looks like you're finally doing better, since you're asking for ramyeon.

471
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,220
But not yet.

472
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,640
The doctor said it would take a few days to come back to normal.

473
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:55,390
By the way, why did you transfer me here?

474
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,990
When you were unconscious, someone visited you at the hospital.

475
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,460
 Could I ask you a favor?

476
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,410
 If Jae Yi wakes up, leave the hospital right away.

477
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:19,230
 And take her to somewhere no one could find her.

478
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:25,450
His gaze felt as though it was more like a strong warning.

479
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:32,380
Since he must love you, I decided to listen to his warning.

480
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,410
You need to live to get anything done.

481
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,380
I know how you feel, but you should take care of yourself first.

482
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,880
Is it because I came back to life?

483
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:56,220
I'm so thankful for having you by my side.

484
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,730
I don't think I'd be lonely even if I die.

485
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:04,390
Don't be silly. I managed to bring you back to life.

486
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:08,760
Who's this?

487
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,960
The ones other than me who would make you feel not lonely.

488
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,980
Come on in!

489
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,370
You guys...

490
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:30,150
They called. I told them you're here.

491
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:35,130
Do Jae Yi, I knew you were reckless, but you went too far!

492
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,740
Why did you go there alone and let this happen to you?

493
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,360
Son of a bitch.

494
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,930
I should've hit him with my stilettos, not the glass door.

495
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,980
By the way, did you come here together?

496
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,250
No way.

497
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,670
We ran into each other in the front.

498
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:59,120
I'll stay at the lodging down there tonight. Call me if you need anything.

499
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,220
- Also─
 - Get going.

500
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,050
We'll take good care of her.

501
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:06,900
We won't eat her alive. Don't worry and leave.

502
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,230

503
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,430

504
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,980

505
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,320
Long time no see, Assemblyman Gi.

506
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,420
Drink some.

507
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,910
Was drinking what you were in such a rush about?

508
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,540
We even closed the bar for you tonight. I'm disappointed.

509
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,910
Will you beg me by pouring me a drink or something?

510
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,990
Your polling numbers dropped because of the video of your son.

511
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,960
Even your information-acquiring skills dropped, too.

512
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,640
Even today I got a call from a well-known chairman.

513
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,830
He said he's interested in the new club.

514
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,540
The new club?

515
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,940
I'm closing the Angel's Club. As well as Ace Bar.

516
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,060
And I'll start a new club.

517
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:13,830
Something bigger and more secretive.

518
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,580
With what money?

519
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,780
The Gongguk district of Tongju will be mine soon.

520
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,960
If I become the mayor and start a new secret club there,

521
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,530
the entire Tongju City will become my kingdom.

522
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,190
What else can the members do? They better come to me.

523
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:39,690
Do Jae Yi found out everything about you!

524
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:45,060
You think she'll do nothing just because you messed with the document?

525
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,920
Do you know what her Achilles heel is?

526
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,380
It's her friends and her sense of justice.

527
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,720
Go Yoo Na, Ju Yu Jeong, and Yoon Hae Mi.

528
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,400
And even the children at the orphanage are under my control.

529
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,600
What could she possibly do?

530
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,760
So, you should better worry about yourself, not me.

531
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,870
The fact that the members lined up in front of me means you're done for.

532
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,810
What?

533
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:24,330
I guess blood is thicker than water.

534
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,890
Do Shik resembled you a lot.

535
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:32,080
He could've stayed alive if he had taken it easy,

536
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,620
but he kept crossing the line.

537
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,070
Did you just confess? That you killed my son?

538
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,060
Do you know what he said as he died?

539
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,140
"Dad! Dad!"

540
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,050
He kept calling for you like a child.

541
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,550
You son of a bitch!

542
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:01,200
How dare you do that to my son!

543
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,530
Sir, calm down.

544
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:09,280
Unless you want to croak like your son,

545
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,540
you'd better not look down on me. Okay?

546
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,830
Move!

547
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:33,770
You bastard. I'll kill you!

548
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,060
I didn't know, either,

549
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:54,500
that Hae Mi went to an awful party like that.

550
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,540
I understand.

551
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,330
You have to let go of Hae Mi for the hotel's sake.

552
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:08,830
But please make sure that photo doesn't get leaked.

553
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,630
I beg you.

554
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:26,350
Song Je Hyeok.

555
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:29,610
You son of a bitch.

556
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:34,160
I'll eat you alive.

557
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,330
I...

558
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,570
will kill Song Je Hyeok.

559
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,610
I think I'll actually become a murderer this time.

560
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,500
I came here to tell you that, Jae Yi.

561
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:04,550
Do you mean that?

562
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:10,780
I asked him to let me donate my liver to Na Na,

563
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,080
but he won't do it.

564
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,710
I'm sure he'll just try to take the land.

565
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,570
But I'm doing the same thing.

566
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:22,200
I'll use the land as bait,

567
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,430
bring him to a secret place, and kill him.

568
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:30,310
I can't let Na Na be with someone like him for the rest of her life.

569
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:31,870
What if you get arrested?

570
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,640
I just need to avoid getting arrested before the transplant surgery.

571
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,070
I don't care what happens afterward.

572
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,000
What do you mean you don't care?

573
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,350
If you get caught this time, it would be your second murder, technically.

574
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,290
Wouldn't that make you a serial killer or something?

575
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,580
What else can I do, then?

576
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,960
There's no way to take Na Na away.

577
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,410
I'll do it instead.

578
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:06,610
Seeing Leo... in jail today was so devastating.

579
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,600
Why is he in jail?

580
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:15,450
Leo was arrested for selling drugs, money laundering, and embezzlement!

581
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,450
Because he fell into his trap.

582
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,900
But I don't think it would end here.

583
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,620
He'd interfere with Leo and me for the rest of our lives.

584
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,460
Did you try reaching Yu Jeong?

585
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,040
I would've done something if I were able to.

586
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:39,550
She's at the same hospital as Na Na, but she never visited her once!

587
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,610
I just got a call from Yu Jeong.

588
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:49,240
She asked me where I was, so I told her I was meeting with Jae Yi.

589
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,640
I gave her the address because she asked for it, too.

590
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,140
Why did you tell her?

591
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,650
What if she tells Song Je Hyeok?

592
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:57,240
Yu Jeong still wouldn't do something like that!

593
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:02,430
Also, her voice sounded kind of weird.

594
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:06,590
She called using someone else's phone, too.

595
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:13,100
Is she being watched by Song Je Hyeok by chance?

596
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,850
Someone must be here.

597
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,060
What if it's him?

598
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,730
Isn't that Yu Jeong?

599
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,470
Guys!

600
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,800
Yu Jeong!

601
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,790
Yu Jeong!

602
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,450
- Yu Jeong, are you okay?
 - Yu Jeong.

603
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,020
Get up.

604
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,960
Yu Jeong.

605
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,000
Jae Yi!

606
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,560
I...

607
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:20,630
am not as...

608
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,460
clueless as you think.

609
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,080
I thought he was strange, too.

610
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:35,980
 Mr. Jung, clone a phone for me.

611
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,970
When my suspicion was confirmed,

612
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:43,710
I was reminded of the things I tried to ignore, too.

613
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:48,580
He acted like he

614
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,710
has known me for a long time.

615
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,960
 I don't get women.

616
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,040
 You never know what kind of men they dated

617
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,320
 with elegant and pretty faces of theirs.

618
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,510
 I won't say it with my own mouth.

619
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:08,640
 That's... my consideration for you.

620
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,970
When you guys told me he's a rapist and a murderer...

621
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:17,080
 Song Je Hyeok is the one who raped Jae Yi and killed Gi Do Shik!

622
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,300
 Your husband threatened me!

623
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,600
 Seriously,

624
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,620
 Yoo Na is right.

625
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:26,240
 He's not this horrible person you guys think he is!

626
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:32,270
I pretended to be in denial, but I also thought it was possible.

627
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:36,670
But hearing the baby's heartbeat...

628
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,620
For a moment...

629
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,350
 I thought it might not matter, even if it were true.

630
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,530
I thought I might never have a baby,

631
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:57,570
but getting pregnant with his baby made me go crazy for a second.

632
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,710
And...

633
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:06,210
 You know I have land in Tongju, right?

634
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:10,740
 You'll take the land, and I'll take the child.

635
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,230
 Okay.

636
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:19,800
 I'll contact you when the document is ready. But... don't tell Yu Jeong.

637
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,510
 Things would get complicated if she found out.

638
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:27,300
I saw him exchanging Na Na's life for some land.

639
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,960
I felt scared.

640
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:36,020
I thought my baby could be used for his ambition someday, too.

641
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:42,600
 So I went over to where Gi Do Shik is buried.

642
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,330
 I thought going there would help me decide.

643
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:55,210
 I promised myself not to ruin my life because of a man anymore.

644
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,800
I know it's too late to go back.

645
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,350
But in order to protect

646
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:09,050
Na Na and the baby in my womb,

647
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,860
I'll leave him.

648
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:16,150
So will you get divorced?

649
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:18,170
Do you think he'd do it willingly?

650
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,290
I won't get divorced.

651
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,930
I'll kill him.

652
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:28,960
I can't let my children be the devil's children.

653
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:37,690
Do you remember... how I approached you guys?

654
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:41,380
I said I went to the same college as you.

655
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,510
I know it's too late, but I'm sorry.

656
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,580
For scamming you.

657
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:54,490
It wasn't completely a lie that you became a fashion designer.

658
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:57,310
You were an amazing dresser.

659
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:00,780
Yes, you didn't do it out of a bad intention.

660
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,490
I did do it out of a bad intention.

661
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:11,150
But since I got to know you, I started actually liking you guys.

662
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,550
I developed a goal while being with you.

663
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:19,270
It was to get away from that sickening bar and thugs

664
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:22,190
and live free of shame.

665
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,650
But...

666
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:30,040
I ruined you guys.

667
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:36,370
Only if I didn't introduce Yu Jeong to someone like Gi Do Shik,

668
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:40,310
you guys wouldn't have gotten involved with Song Je Hyeok, either.

669
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:53,330
For that reason,

670
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,890
I...

671
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,530
will kill Song Je Hyeok.

672
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,910
I'd be killing my ex-husband out of passion while fighting over custody.

673
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,710
When a man gets killed,

674
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:07,420
they suspect the wife first, apparently.

675
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,660
Apparently, killing between married couples is very common.

676
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,830
So I'll do it.

677
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,370
They say a smart bitch can't beat a tough bitch,

678
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:17,770
and a tough bitch can't beat a crazy bitch.

679
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:21,240
I'll do drugs, become a crazy bitch and kill him!

680
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,520
That's enough, guys.

681
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:29,550
I'm the one who started this revenge.

682
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:34,640
You, your children, and

683
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:40,080
even the innocent children at the orphanage are in danger because of me.

684
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,150
I'm the one who'll put an end to this.

685
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:47,440
Look what happened to you trying to fight alone.

686
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,420
You'd better stop trying to do this alone.

687
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:54,770
I won't leave you alone, either, Jae Yi.

688
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,520
I won't hold back, either.

689
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,740
I'll kill the bastard who almost killed you!

690
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:09,060
 They should be out soon.

691
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:11,380
 How much longer?

692
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,680
- Nothing yet?
 - No.

693
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,000
Are you not ready yet?

694
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,570
Please wait a moment.

695
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,320
For how long?

696
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:31,270
Do you really have to go this far?

697
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:41,180
My goal was to catch him anyway.

698
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:47,350
I feel like your hard work is going to waste.

699
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,640
Let's get started now.

700
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,620
Where the hell is she?

701
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:57,880
I told you to find her by searching the whole country, didn't I?

702
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,820
We need to find her to decide whether to kill her or not, you asshole!

703
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:03,770
 I did find her, but...

704
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:06,650
Really? Where is she?

705
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,630
 Breaking news came up just now.

706
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:12,430
- What?
  - Do Jae Yi's doing a live press conference.

707
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:14,780
Press conference?

708
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:27,710
 Attorney Do, we haven't seen you since the video scandal from 10 years ago.

709
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:31,610
What have you been doing all this time instead of campaigning?

710
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:35,430
I've actually been quite busy.

711
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:39,220
I'm sorry for making you worry.

712
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:44,310
 I'll reveal everything first.

713
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:49,200
 It needs to be in front of the press and the public eye.

714
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,910
I have nothing to say regarding the video.

715
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:56,380
The reason I asked you to come here

716
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:03,940
is to let you know that I'm no longer a mayoral candidate for Tongju.

717
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,190
I'll step down.

718
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,630
 What's the reason?

719
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,060
 Is it due to your polling numbers dropping because of the video?

720
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:17,350
No. I have something else to do now.

721
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,550
 Do Jae Yi.

722
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,420
What are you trying to do, exactly?

723
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,820
 You'll reveal everything. And then?

724
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,710
 And then...

725
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,510
 I'll start a party.

726
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:45,410
 Exactly like the one 10 years ago that was steeped in blood.

727
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:52,660
 We were played by him then,

728
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:56,960
 but things are different now.

729
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,380
 He'll be played by us instead.

730
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,480
 The dress code is to wear black.

731
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,100
 We should be courteous.

732
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,760
 Since it might be his last.

733
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:20,220
 After tonight, we'd be born again.

734
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:33,410
 We'll go back to being us

735
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,370
 who were beautiful and confident

736
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:46,170
 before we met him 10 years ago.

737
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:59,990

738
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,620
The cleaning service is here!

739
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,880
Excuse me.

740
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:25,080

741
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:29,510
♫  The dark desire hidden behind a mask  ♫

742
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:32,170
♫  They're liars  ♫

743
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:37,530
♫  The truth is completely hidden behind a curtain  ♫

744
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,500
♫  My glamorous image is a scenario covering your eyes  ♫

745
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,810
 ~ Preview ~ 
I suddenly thought this.

746
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,800
 Why do I have to pick just one?

747
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,330
 I can try having all of them.

748
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,950
 Attorney Do might be in serious danger if things go wrong.

749
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:54,110
 In any case, this fight ends only when one of us dies.

750
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:58,570
 Why don't you be my speaker? Tell him that bastard from 10 years ago is back.

751
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:01,260
 - Where is the bastard right now?
 - Did Hae Mi say she'll get the drugs?

752
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,710
 Remember to take the customer's secret to your grave.

753
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:08,080
 I'm sure there's something I can do next to him.

754
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,490
 You'd better do it right.

755
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:11,270
 It's quince tea that's good for bronchial tubes.

756
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:15,480
 I thought you might be exhausted from meeting so many people these days.

757
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,670
 Get closer, closer. Closer!

758
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:20,430
 Will you die? Or will I?

759
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:24,310
 There was a shocking incident at Chunsarang Orphanage in Tongju City.

760
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:28,230
 To be responsible for the upsetting incident at Chunsarang Orphanage.

761
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,540
 Where's Mr. Song right now?

762
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,240
 I don't know.

763
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:38,160
 No matter where he is, he's probably hanging in there right now.
