1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,140

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,930
I'll get going, too.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,880

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,850
My driver arrived at the parking lot.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,010
I'll get going.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,330
Okay, bye.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,980

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,000
Why are you bothering me now?

9
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,460
I guess Yu Jeong was here.

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,370
By the way, I'm not opposed to Yu Jeong marrying a scumbag like you.

11
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,740
It's not about the person. It's about their background, anyway.

12
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,330
I like how you think.

13
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,910
It would've been easier if Yu Jeong were as cool as you.

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,970
So,

15
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,950
give that to me.

16
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,190
You mean this?

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,590
Hey! Shit!

18
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,380
You addicted bitch!

19
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,380
That's right. That's right.

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,610
I heard your mom received tips from customers kneeling, too.

21
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,770

22
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:07,100

23
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,350
 I sent the delivery guy to No. 707.

24
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,170
 I'm Mr. Jung, who takes the customers' secrets to my grave.

25
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,730
It's just this one time.

26
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,170
 The door is opening.

27
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,460
Are you done talking to Jae Yi?

28
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,150
Shall we talk now?

29
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,190

30
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,270
You betrayed me. What do you have to say?

31
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,520
Let me ask you just one thing. Why did you kill Gi Do Shik?

32
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,470
No.

33
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,060
Why did you kill Gi Do Shik and frame me for it?

34
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,250
You trust Do Jae Yi more than me?

35
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,920
Don't trust her too much.

36
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,920
She's on your side now because of the mask, but you never know when she'd betray you.

37
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,240
She's still better than you.

38
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,610
At least Jae Yi didn't run away after framing me.

39
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,460
Let me warn you.

40
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,110
If you treat Na Na badly because I'm on Do Jae Yi's side,

41
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,850
I'll kill you.

42
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,350
I've got nothing to lose.

43
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,100
 You saw Jae Yi?

44
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,110
- Where?
 - In front of Yoo Na's hotel.

45
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,680
It's obvious. She probably was there to see Yoo Na.

46
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,980
Why did you go there, then?

47
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,970
I went to a seminar at the Grand Kangbo Hotel.

48
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,210
Dressed like that?

49
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,130
Is that what you care about right now?

50
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,210
Jae Yi might've betrayed us!

51
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,990
Maybe she went there because of the land.

52
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,680
If so, there's no reason why she would've ghosted us for over a week!

53
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,430
If she betrayed us as you say, what should we do then?

54
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,220
 I'll give you a weapon.

55
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,280
 Stab her in the pit of her stomach.

56
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,600
Here.

57
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,640
It's yours now.

58
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,720
Thank you

59
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,930
for giving it to me and not him.

60
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,530
Just remember you promised to get my daughter back.

61
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,160
That's the only thing I want.

62
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,060
By the way, how did you meet someone like him?

63
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,230
 Here's your food.

64
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,440
It was in the US by accident.

65
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,300
 Give me more tips if you'll stare at me like that.

66
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,700
 I'm sorry.

67
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,970
 You looked familiar.

68
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,000
 By chance, do you know Ace Bar in Korea?

69
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,410
 I work there. I'm Jake.

70
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,850
It turned out he was a host at a popular host bar.

71
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,610
Right. A host and a hostess.

72
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,960
We thought we could rely on each other in a foreign country.

73
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,170
But why did you break up?

74
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:22,490
He said he came to the US to turn over a new leaf.

75
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,040
I believed him,

76
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,560
because I was sick of that industry.

77
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,660
But...

78
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,640
 Here you go.

79
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,200

80
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,170
 Are you Yoo Na?

81
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,120
 Yes? Why?

82
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,580
 You're under arrest.

83
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,450
 For what?

84
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,900
 Prostitution, illegal international exchange transactions,

85
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,500
 attempting to profit from the sale of illegal drugs.

86
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,950
 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say...

87
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,740
He was providing drugs and prostitutes for VIPs from Korea behind my back.

88
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,960
He even exchanged currency illegally for them.

89
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,070
He used my account for those dirty jobs, so I was framed for everything.

90
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,480
 Where did he go?

91
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,040
But while I was trying to resolve it, he ran away with Na Na.

92
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,650
 My baby.

93
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,520
That bastard.

94
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,430
But you know... he ran away after doing that to me.

95
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,920
Could it be a coincidence that he met you in the US?

96
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,560
While I was living with him, I showed him a picture of us.

97
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,420
Among the four friends, he was involved with you, me,

98
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,870
and now even Yu Jeong.

99
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,960
How could that be a coincidence?

100
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,040
So you mean all of this was Gi Yoon Chul's plan?

101
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,940
For what purpose?

102
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,580
I don't know.

103
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,770
I'm not sure, but it's true that we're horribly tangled up.

104
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,550
Anyway,

105
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,800
will you tell Yu Jeong that he's the one who raped you?

106
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,560
 But if possible, please keep it a secret from Yu Jeong that we did it.

107
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,230
 Her character is so pure. She'd get hurt.

108
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,370
I don't know.

109
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,850
Will Yu Jeong believe me?

110
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,620
I wonder if she would get the wrong idea.

111
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,890
Then wait on telling Yu Jeong for now.

112
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,900
I need to worry about my daughter's safety.

113
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:00,310
If Yu Jeong finds out Na Na's my daughter,

114
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,410
 I'm not sure if she would love her the same way.

115
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,890
Let's wait.

116
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,440
If I take Song Je Hyeok's mask off,

117
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,340
she would believe me then, too.

118
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,170
How will you take it off?

119
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,940
Like he said, this mask doesn't prove that he raped you.

120
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,600
I'll make him a star.

121
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,650
A star? You mean Song Je Hyeok?

122
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,710
If he's been working in the dark, it would be difficult to rise to the surface.

123
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,870
If I bring him to the light and make him a star,

124
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:44,530
no matter how perfect his mask is, his true face has to come out.

125
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,420
You should be in charge of the bright side.

126
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,140
I'll be in charge of the dark side.

127
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,390
It would be easier to pressure him from both directions.

128
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,000
Would you be able to? No matter what, he's still your ex-husband.

129
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm more worried about you.

130
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,130
Because no matter what, he is still Yu Jeong's husband.

131
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,280
Let's do this, Go Yoo Na.

132
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,130
 Na Na sometimes asks about you.

133
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,820
 Remember.

134
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,640
 You, me, and our daughter.

135
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,740
 We were happy in the US.

136
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,950
 If so... can you let me see Na Na?

137
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,790
Good luck, Do Jae Yi.

138
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,160
 You couldn't retrieve the mask?

139
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,370
Go Yoo Na gave it to Do Jae Yi.

140
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,110
What should we do?

141
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,100
Doesn't this make it more dangerous then?

142
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,900
Because the mask has more to do with Do Jae Yi than Go Yoo Na.

143
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,690
So tell Assemblyman Gi.

144
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,890
Tell him to stop Do Jae Yi from becoming the mayor of Tongju, no matter what.

145
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,600
Otherwise, it won't be just me,

146
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,560
but the entire Angel's Club could get destroyed.

147
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,130

148
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,110
 The DNA from the evidence I have and

149
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,600
 the DNA from the blood on the mask match.

150
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,960
Now it's clear that he's the culprit.

151
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,170
How could he change his identity so perfectly, though?

152
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,390
He didn't even get a traffic ticket under the name Song Je Hyeok.

153
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,880
Please contact the chairman of Mayor Jung Goo Tae's supporters' association.

154
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,710
I'll pour my everything into the mayoral election in Tongju now.

155
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,290
 Yoo Na, this is Kang Hoo.

156
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,760
 Could I see you briefly?

157
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:09,560
When Mayor Jung was alive, we used to come here often.

158
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,600
I remember how much I enjoyed the food here.

159
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,410
You run this restaurant, right, Supporters' Association Chairman?

160
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,950
Well, I suppose so.

161
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:31,800
Mayor Jung said at the appointment celebration party

162
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,530
that he was considering me as his successor.

163
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,840
What if you become the chairman

164
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,850
of the supporters' association for me in this election?

165
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, that's...

166
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,470
The thing is...

167
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,850
You made it, Sir.

168
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,110
- Sit down, sit down.
 - Yes.

169
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,890
I thought you knew better than this.

170
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,100
You can't barge into someone's meeting like this.

171
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,980
Actually, I'm here because I wanted to talk to the chairman.

172
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,950
I advised them to cancel the correction order.

173
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,050
You can relax now.

174
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,550
Aigoo! Thank you, Assemblyman! Thank you.

175
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:40,130
The chairman accidentally expanded this restaurant illegally.

176
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,430
I've been a regular for decades here. How could I just do nothing?

177
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,780
I helped him out a bit.

178
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,490
Chairman, could I have an acorn jelly salad?

179
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,820
It's not on the menu, but it was so tasty!

180
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,650
Yes!

181
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,560
I'll make it for you now!

182
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,420
I've been an assemblyman in Tongju for 25 years.

183
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,620
I mean, you have no base.

184
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,340
You're trying to become the mayor now?

185
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,940
You might upset your stomach if you try to eat it raw like this.

186
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,850
I thought you'd no longer have the wrong idea about me by now.

187
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,870
Do you really have no idea who the real culprit, who killed your son, could be?

188
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,300
Look carefully.

189
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,620
Try not to miss what's right under your nose.

190
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:17,130

191
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,580
Yes, Sunbae?

192
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,170
Isn't it funny?

193
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,380
There must be all kinds of ingredients in this pasta dish,

194
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,880
but a few of these black truffle pieces that were put on at the end overwhelm the whole dish.

195
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,200
You must feel so relaxed.

196
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,010
How could you even eat right now?

197
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,620
What's this?

198
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,950
My black truffle.

199
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,670
What?

200
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,970
Jae Yi laundered the money she got from cleaning up after

201
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,390
Jung Goo Tae's family through my mom's business.

202
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:18,620
I'll use this... to take the land in Tongju.

203
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,700

204
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,640
Are you saying you'll threaten Jae Yi with that?

205
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,400
Threaten, my foot!

206
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,480
I said it's the black truffle!

207
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,050
I'll just keep an eye on the situation and

208
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,490
whether I give this to Jae Yi or Gi Yoon Chul,

209
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,900
I just need to take the land.

210
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,320
Do you have a digital copy of this?

211
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,010
My mom is from the old days.

212
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,360
This is all there is.

213
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,680
If you want me to share this with you,

214
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,560
give me the 10 billion won (~$7.4 million) you took from the hotel first!

215
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,510
Fine! I'll give it back.

216
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,410
Are you happy now?

217
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,080
How's your newly married life? Is it fun?

218
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,960
 Why do you keep letting your friends drag you around?

219
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,410
 What are you, an idiot?

220
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,870
It's just... different from before we married.

221
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,040
I think he changed a bit, too.

222
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,460
All men change after getting married!

223
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,670
All men change! All of them!

224
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,430
Right?

225
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,650
That must be it, right?

226
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,620
I'm worried about Na Na more than Je Hyeok.

227
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,030
Being nice to her once in a while is different from raising her.

228
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:29,880
It's been only a year since I met Na Na,

229
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,620
but it's like she was mine from the beginning.

230
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,250
I love her so much that I feel like I'm going crazy.

231
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:40,870
I can't imagine my life without Na Na anymore.

232
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,880
That's even worse.

233
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,320
What if her mom shows up?

234
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,570
She committed a crime and went to jail!

235
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,150
She has no right to see Na Na!

236
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,200
Who cares if she went to jail?

237
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,660
She's still the mother and gave birth to her.

238
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm actually worried she would tempt Je Hyeok using Na Na.

239
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,340
Why did you have to marry someone so complicated?

240
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,420
You should've married someone simple like me.

241
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,490
 A VVIP is waiting in a suite in Mariela Hotel.

242
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,200
 Give her the present and tell her that you put what she needs inside.

243
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,620
It's for Noona. Noona.

244
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,840
Hae Mi Noona is the only one for me. It's okay.

245
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,380
Where's the VIP-only elevator?

246
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,730
Go this way.

247
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,540
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

248
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,020
Hello.

249
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,930
What did that man ask you just now?

250
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,830
He asked where the VIP-only elevator was.

251
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,390
Oh, I see.

252
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,270
Wow, I think I came to the wrong room.

253
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,910
Here's the present.

254
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,180
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you?

255
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,170
The hotel is right here.

256
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,430
I'll get going!

257
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,110
Okay.

258
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,860
 You can't anymore.

259
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,280
You have so much to pay back already.

260
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,410
You want to borrow again?

261
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,320
It's because I need to pay back the donation money I received from Mariela Hotel.

262
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,930
Can you use my house as collateral?

263
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,880
You know the donation money?

264
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,040
There's a rumor in the finance industry

265
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,810
that the land can't be conveyed because of the lawsuit.

266
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,400
The arts and culture village.

267
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Is it really being built by the Yeongun Foundation?

268
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,050
Ma'am. Yes, I'm on my way home.

269
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,650
Did you pick up Na Na?

270
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,990
 No.

271
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,930
Chairman called.

272
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,670
He said he'd pick up Na Na himself.

273
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,030
If he stopped by the playground? He's taking a while.

274
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,250
Je Hyeok said that?

275
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,090
Okay, then.

276
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,630
They're at the playground?

277
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,310
Please take me to the playground.

278
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,610
Who are you?

279
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,820
Do you

280
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,170
remember me?

281
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,020
I remember you, Anna...

282
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,170
I mean,

283
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,940
I remember you, Na Na.

284
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,330
I don't know.

285
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,620
But why are you about to cry, Ahjumma?

286
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,400
Just because... you're so pretty.

287
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,540
You're pretty, too, Ahjumma.

288
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,770
Although my mom is prettier.

289
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,380
Na Na. Is it okay if I touch you?

290
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,430
Hold on!

291
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,510
I gave you what you wanted. It's my turn now.

292
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,510
Tell me.

293
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,770
Do Jae Yi. What's her future plan?

294
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,730
There isn't much yet.

295
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,430
I'll tell you if I notice any movement.

296
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:38,850
If you want to keep seeing Na Na, you'd better do things right.

297
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,020
I have a question.

298
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,580
You even became the chairman of the foundation using Yu Jeong.

299
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,090
What do you want now?

300
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,790
You're even running a secret business.

301
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,210
It's my instinct.

302
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,880
Just like how you are obsessed over your maternal instinct,

303
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,040
my instinct is money.

304
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,540
I want to put the ones who have been looking down on me under my feet and conquer them.

305
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,740
And that business is necessary for that.

306
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,920
By business, do you mean that club or whatever?

307
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,600
I need to know something in order to help you.

308
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:39,230
You're still... the father.

309
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,330
Just don't frequent the Ace Bar.

310
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,880
I don't want you to get hurt, either.

311
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,800
You're still the mother.

312
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:07,360
Yu Jeong doesn't know about us yet, right?

313
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,980
Mom!

314
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,300
Yes, Na Na! You came!

315
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,770
Na Na! Did you have fun?

316
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,360
I drew this at the kindergarten today.

317
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,520
Really? Let me see!

318
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,920
Wow! You did a great job!

319
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,790
Thank you so much, Na Na!

320
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,840
I can't live a single day without you anymore.

321
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,510
I love you, my daughter!

322
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,390
By the way, Na Na, where did you go with Dad earlier?

323
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,320
I didn't see you at the playground.

324
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,410
We went to a different playground.

325
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:54,650
And we played with some Ahjumma there.

326
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,830
Some Ahjumma?

327
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,180
She's apparently someone Dad knows.

328
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,010
She's pretty like you, Mom.

329
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,780
 Who's waiting for me, anyway?

330
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,870
 You'll find out once you go in.

331
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,910
 May I ask you to pour me a drink, snooty Attorney Do?

332
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,870
 What are you doing right now?

333
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,500
 I'm suggesting flipping the script.

334
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,380
Hey! Are you out of your mind right now?

335
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,630
I'm sorry.

336
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,770
She begged me so much.

337
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,240
Forget it! I have no reason to see you!

338
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,970
I'm not the same Do Jae Yi today.

339
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,540
Please give me another chance.

340
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,450
I'm so sorry about then, Kim Joong Ho, the chair of the nomination committee.

341
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,120
You'll no longer need to win a nomination since you're running for mayor of Tongju now.

342
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,220
What made you change your attitude so much?

343
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:31,080
Since I'm a newbie in politics and an independent candidate,

344
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,390
there's no one to support me in this field.

345
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,510
You're the only one on the same level as Assemblyman Gi Yoon Chul of Hangook Party.

346
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:45,370
If you can provide support for me in my political career,

347
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,870
it would be my greatest honor.

348
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:52,520
You're asking me a lot by just offering me a drink.

349
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,780
If I do become your political supporter,

350
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,340
what would I get out of it?

351
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,490
As long as you could do that for me,

352
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:11,410
you'll end up having me.

353
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,640

354
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,800
You said you were running as an independent since you were sick of the old dynamics

355
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,680
between Junghan and Hangook Party.

356
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,980
What made you join Junghan Party like this?

357
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,150
I promised to build the arts and culture village that would become the landmark of Tongju.

358
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,010
In order to keep my promise,

359
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,020
I realized I needed an organization to support me.

360
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,850
Since you became the candidate of the Junghan Party,

361
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,250
your biggest rival would be the candidate from Hangook Party.

362
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:17,120
Which candidate are you keeping an eye on currently?

363
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,160
 There's no one unless there's another candidate

364
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,610
 who's more refreshing than me.

365
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:32,340
You know that Jae Yi is the No. 1 mayoral candidate, right?

366
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,300
People at the market are already making a fuss that my granddaughter

367
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,070
became the mayor!

368
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,240
You're giving me more food than usual.

369
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,010
Of course!

370
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:49,030
I'll charge you more than usual.

371
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,560
How much do you need?

372
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,820
Well, enough for Jae Yi to run her campaign.

373
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,610
I'll send it to you.

374
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,300
Money won't be enough!

375
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,350
Your daughter is running for mayor.

376
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:08,890
Maybe you could move obstacles in front of her.

377
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,890
I know you could do that!

378
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,190
I'll do my best.

379
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,190

380
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,950
We're not open yet.

381
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,880
Hello.

382
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,450
Mr. Jung hasn't come in yet.

383
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,550

384
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,720
I'm... here to see you today, Min Gi.

385
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,350
Drink some.

386
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,110
Well, I'm not a host.

387
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,890
Should I call you one?

388
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,450
I said I'm here to see you.

389
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,440
I'm more attracted to you than the hosts.

390
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,000
You have a refreshing face.

391
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,090
What do you think about actually becoming a host?

392
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:16,030
Isn't it better to drink with the noonas than delivering drinks to them?

393
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,680
Mr. Jung said I'm not suited for that.

394
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,400
What does he know?

395
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Women know men better.

396
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,260
You know Leo, right?

397
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,130
I introduced him to his current wife.

398
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,190
What should I do, then?

399
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,390
Thank you.

400
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,100
You're quite the drinker!

401
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,990
You could easily take over Tongju seeing the way you drink!

402
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,720
How have you been stopping yourself from drinking all this time?

403
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,270
I think I finally discovered my talent.

404
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:17,120
Don't forget that you promised to give me my share if you get the arts and culture village.

405
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,560
Gosh. How could I forget?

406
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,420
By the way, Jae Yi...

407
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,270
didn't you look down on the Hangook Party members too much in front of the press?

408
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,640
A politician can't be like that.

409
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,610
You could swear at them all you want to yourself, but you have to act on the outside.

410
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,700
Look at these amazing actors!

411
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,030
I thought I should get things ready for them to come out.

412
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,400
Who'll come out?

413
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,760
Is there someone you want to compete against?

414
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,260
Assemblyman, since you used to be in the media,

415
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,970
you must be friendly with the reporters.

416
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,540
I'm stronger than Gi Yoon Chul in that area.

417
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,920
I'm pretty tight with the media.

418
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:10,550
Then, please spread a rumor to the political reporters.

419
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,660
A rumor?

420
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:23,210

421
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,400
How much did you drink anyway?

422
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,190
I feel like I'll get drunk, too.

423
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,320
I drank kind of a lot.

424
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,170
There's no choice.

425
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,250
But you still can't drink so much.

426
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,580
Don't overdo it. You'll hurt your health.

427
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,240
I'm fine.

428
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,840
I'm worried about those guys.

429
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,340
Those guys?

430
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,260
Yes, Hae Mi and Yu Jeong.

431
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,780
They still trusted me and followed my lead.

432
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,050
You can't even tell them the truth.

433
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,580
You must be in a tough spot.

434
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,140
What are you planning to do?

435
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,930
I should talk to them in person.

436
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,480
I can't stop them from feeling betrayed,

437
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,380
but I want to make sure they feel less hurt.

438
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,470
Hangover ramen? Okay?

439
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,560
Okay.

440
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:13,370
 Yu Jeong, Hae Mi, let's meet.

441
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,470
 I'm responding late because I was busy.

442
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,040
 Why did you want to see me suddenly?

443
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,310
Kang Hoo.

444
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,790
 Trust me, no matter what anyone says.

445
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,010
 That's how I feel.

446
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,920
I'm just thankful for you.

447
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,710

448
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,650
- Yes.
  - Chairman.

449
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,200
 A reporter from OCS is here.

450
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,370
OCS?

451
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,510
Okay, let them in.

452
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,020
Hello, I'm Reporter Han Sang Gook of OCS.

453
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,360
What brings you here?

454
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,650
A mayoral candidate of Tongju?

455
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,850
Me?

456
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,800
You didn't know!

457
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,210
It's a rumor among political reporters like me.

458
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,700
You really have no idea, do you?

459
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,660
I heard that the Hangook Party is

460
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:52,620
planning to have you as their candidate for Tongju's mayoral election.

461
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,380
Why would the Hangook Party want me?

462
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,160
I've never done anything in that field.

463
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,360
You're as refreshing as Junghan Party's candidate Do Jae Yi.

464
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,390
And I heard you were called the "Angel" among the children at the orphanage.

465
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,570
They think the angel could compete against Candidate Do Jae Yi, the icon of justice.

466
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,460
That's why!

467
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,630
Excuse me for a moment.

468
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,760
Yes. This is Song Je Hyeok.

469
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,790
Junghan Daily?

470
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,270
- Excuse me for a second.
 - Okay.

471
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,960
Yes.

472
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,140
Myungjin Today?

473
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,390
Here he comes! Here he comes!

474
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,140

475
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,010

476
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,350
The game is set up.

477
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,910
Do I just need to get the rabbit out now?

478
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,830
I kept thinking about treating you

479
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,460
for coming to the wedding, but it ended up taking so long.

480
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,780
This is my treat. Feel free to drink a lot.

481
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,210
You're the talk of the town these days.

482
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,600
What if you actually become the mayor of Tongju at this rate?

483
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,350
Reporters kept bugging me about it.

484
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:52,660
So I yelled at them and said it's not true.

485
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,950
Do they think a mayoral election is a joke?

486
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,130
They don't even know what his origin is.

487
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:03,390
My origin?

488
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,770
Don't be like that and help him out.

489
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,340
If a dependable young man like him becomes the mayor

490
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,270
and become your right-hand man,

491
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,680
it would help your presidential campaign, too.

492
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,630
Come on!

493
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,570
Stop saying all this crappy nonsense!

494
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,760
What do you think about it, Chairman Song?

495
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,840
What do you mean? What do I think?

496
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,100
Are you interested in getting into politics?

497
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,500
I don't know.

498
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,230
I've never thought about it before.

499
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,500
Let me know if you make up your mind.

500
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:02,940
If you decide to truly devote yourself to Tongju.

501
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,610
You were already here.

502
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,170
Here.

503
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,720
I come here often.

504
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,970
They pair nice wines with the steak, too.

505
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,420
It's not that great for me.

506
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,600
Sometimes your trusty regular spot betrays you like this.

507
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,920
Did you have a nice trip with Kang Hoo?

508
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,620
How about you?

509
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,920
What about me?

510
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,600
Are you happy to be married?

511
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,200
What could be so bad?

512
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,840
You know, it was my dream to have a perfect family.

513
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,750
Right.

514
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,380
Did you know that Je Hyeok's articles were all over the internet today?

515
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,910
They say he's suddenly running for mayor of Tongju as Hangook Party's candidate.

516
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:42,890
What will you do?

517
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:47,420
You might end up getting beaten by Je Hyeok, Jae Yi.

518
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,360
It's just a rumor.

519
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,030
Don't you know reporters?

520
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:56,040
They spread all kinds of rumors when it's election season.

521
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,060
Don't be like that!

522
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,810
Honestly, what's Je Hyeok lacking, exactly?

523
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,560
He's handsome and has a great image.

524
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,360
And now he's the chairman of the Yeongun Foundation!

525
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,680
He didn't even want to become the chairman.

526
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,420
There's no way he's running for mayor.

527
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:20,350
Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.

528
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,560
The plan for building the arts and culture village in Tongju.

529
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,160
I don't think I can do it with you guys.

530
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,390
Just like what Hae Mi said, the political circles are eyeing Je Hyeok right now.

531
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:41,140
Making the foundation he's the chairman of be responsible for a huge project like that?

532
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,630
It would be risky.

533
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,890
The political circles will try to lure him in no matter what.

534
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,600
- But how could you─ 
 - I told you

535
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,070
that she betrayed us.

536
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,070
Did you join forces with Yoo Na under that condition?

537
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,360
Was it to ditch us?

538
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,470
What are you talking about? Why would I ditch you guys?

539
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,390
That's enough.

540
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:07,370
I won't believe anything you say from now on.

541
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:13,390
Jae Yi, could you please reconsider it?

542
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,060
We really need that land.

543
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,380
You'd better get up, too!

544
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,040
Jae Yi.

545
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,500
I beg you. Please reconsider it.

546
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,270
- I beg you, Jae Yi!
 - Get up!

547
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,540
- Get up!
 - Jae Yi!

548
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,670
Come out.

549
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,160
Jae Yi! Gosh!

550
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,730

551
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,020
You're totally best friends, aren't you?

552
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,970
Do you even come to the same restaurants now?

553
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:00,560
Do Jae Yi, a thin line separates best friends from becoming enemies.

554
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:06,110
The fact that we were best friends means I know everything about you.

555
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,670
Even your weaknesses.

556
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,300
Do you regret it?

557
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,570
That you betrayed them and joined my side?

558
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,180
How did you know I was here?

559
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,900
I went to your office because I didn't want to talk on the phone,

560
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,990
and the manager said you were here.

561
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:42,220
What is it about?

562
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,570
 Tell me.

563
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,000
 Have you noticed a strange meeting at Ace Bar?

564
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,750
 The thing is...

565
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,780
 About once a month,

566
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,940
 we don't let normal customers in and make the whole space available.

567
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,050
 Once a month?

568
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,330
 When is that?

569
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,410
On the 18th of every month,

570
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:15,310
there's a strange meeting where the employees and normal customers aren't allowed.

571
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:19,680
It turns out to be the Angel's Club.

572
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,350
Ace Bar was the Angel's Club?

573
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,650
How did you find that out?

574
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,410
Did you meet with Song Je Hyeok by chance?

575
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:34,560
I got the information by selling out my daughter.

576
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,940
You... really have to catch him.

577
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,980
Thank you.

578
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:52,860
I'll... make sure to get your daughter back.

579
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,330
You scored, I noticed.

580
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:00,010
You really turned him into a star.

581
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:04,860
But do you think he'd really run?

582
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,480
I should make him.

583
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,150
Even if I have to grab him by his collar.

584
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,500
What did you want to talk to me privately about?

585
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:33,420
What do you think about actually running for mayor of Tongju?

586
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,950
You brought up my background earlier.

587
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,440
Why did you change your mind?

588
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:50,390
Do you know why Chairman Kang told you to run?

589
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:58,230
Because you're an easy opponent his daughter can beat.

590
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,780
So you should better make sure to beat her.

591
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,380
I'll support you.

592
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,950
I understand that you want to keep Chairman Kang in check,

593
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,800
but I'm not interested in being used for that.

594
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,810
You have nothing to lose one way or another.

595
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:32,340
Tongju City might become yours if all goes well.

596
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,410
 Let's meet up. Come to Ace Bar.

597
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:01,550

598
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:10,130
How many reservations do we have today?

599
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,790
I think we're almost fully booked.

600
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,820
Really?

601
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,090
Hello.

602
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,150
This is a members-only club.

603
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,430
Are you a member by chance?

604
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,130
I'm here to see another guest.

605
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,550
His name is Song Je Hyeok.

606
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,020
I'll take you to the reserved room.

607
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,080
Come this way.

608
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:38,290
♫  So watch out, you won't know  ♫

609
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:42,260
♫  Look at my eyes now, I control my life  ♫

610
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,060
♫  So get out, tumbling down  ♫

611
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,210
♫  It's not a joke  ♫

612
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,290
♫  It's not a joke, baby  ♫

613
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:54,120
♫  You can call me crazy  ♫

614
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,140
♫  I can see you, showtime  ♫

615
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,120
♫  Don't hesitate, alright  ♫

616
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,850
♫  I ain't no joking  ♫

617
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,720
♫  Take everything or nothing  ♫

618
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,070
What's this about?

619
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:29,740
You wanted to see me so late.

620
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,560
You must be busy.

621
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,230
Getting to the point as soon as we sat?

622
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,070
Pour me one.

623
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,010
You said you don't take drinks from men.

624
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:48,290
You're not a man to me, I said.

625
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:19,130
Are you trying to make up over a drink, or did you miss me?

626
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,270
Don't get me wrong because I told you to pour a drink.

627
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,190
I called you because I was about to explode from stress.

628
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:33,070
You must've seen the articles.

629
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:38,760
They talk as if you're a worthy rival to me.

630
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:43,330
What a joke. How could you be my rival?

631
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:47,210
How dare you with your origin?

632
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,020
Origin! Origin!

633
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,490
Why do people care about one's origin so much?

634
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:00,420
Aren't you the granddaughter of the owner of a blood sausage soup shop?

635
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:05,800
I wasn't talking about money or background.

636
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,030
I guess I meant a natural class.

637
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:19,270
I'm curious what your natural class is.

638
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,310
Gosh. I wanted to relieve stress.

639
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:27,660
Let's forget it.

640
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,710
This isn't fun.

641
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:35,780
Is this enough?

642
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,380
What's that?

643
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,430
You used to be a host.

644
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,800
I heard you were pretty successful.

645
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,260
Is it because you've aged?

646
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,600
I'm not attracted to you at all.

647
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,380
This is what class is.

648
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,830
Though you're a piece of trash, I don't want to give a single penny to,

649
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:05,780
I'm tipping you, since I made you come and pour me a drink.

650
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,610
Understand?

651
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:16,190
What would you do if I really became your rival?

652
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:21,090
You used to pour drinks for women at a bar like this.

653
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:23,950
And you want to become the mayor of a city?

654
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,170
Hey! Wake up.

655
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:32,250
The best you can do is the chairman position you got by scamming Yu Jeong.

656
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,790
That's all you get.

657
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:39,190
Honestly, that position is too good for you as well.

658
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:43,310
This is the perfect place for you.

659
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:46,830
The very bottom.

660
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:28,420
Assemblyman Gi? This is Song Je Hyeok.

661
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,970

662
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,170
The rumor should've just stayed a rumor.

663
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:42,040
Why are you running for mayor in Tongju suddenly?

664
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,890
Sometimes the rumors become a reality.

665
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:50,990
It's not that bad of a reality, though, isn't it?

666
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:54,030
Yeongun Foundation is in crisis right now.

667
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,940
If I become the mayor, I can save Yeongun.

668
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,420
There's no guarantee that you'd win.

669
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,110
Your opponent is Jae Yi.

670
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,260
How would you be able to beat her?

671
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,630
Jae Yi! Jae Yi! Jae Yi!

672
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,940
Do you still trust her more than me?

673
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,650
Do you think I'm a joke?

674
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,440
You were abandoned by her, didn't you?

675
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,380
That's why the arts and culture village is no longer happening.

676
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,000
You can't just sit still!

677
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,700
You have to stop her no matter what!

678
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,320
You said your dream is to start a perfect family.

679
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,610
If so, you should help me become the mayor.

680
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:46,570
That way, we can protect the foundation and our family, too.

681
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:50,890
 We went to a different playground.

682
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:54,440
 And we played with some Ahjumma there.

683
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,860
 She's apparently someone Dad knows.

684
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:00,640
 She's pretty like you, Mom.

685
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,110
Okay.

686
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:07,600
I'll support your decision.

687
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,430
But...

688
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:15,660
protecting the foundation isn't the only way to create a perfect family.

689
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:23,200
You have to... protect Na Na and me too.

690
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,920
Okay, I will.

691
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,700
Thank you.

692
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,730
I believe in you.

693
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,560
Thank you for seeing me.

694
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:45,590
Why did you want to meet behind Jae Yi's back?

695
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,820
You can't be asking me to come back.

696
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:54,020
I wanted to know more about Gi Do Shik.

697
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,880
Gi Do Shik? Not Song Je Hyeok?

698
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,640
The incident from 10 years ago.

699
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,700
It started in Gi Do Shik's room.

700
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,320
Since Jae Yi is going after Song Je Hyeok now,

701
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:13,040
I wanted to go back to the day when that happened to Jae Yi.

702
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,140
It's true love.

703
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,810
Kang Hoo.

704
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,390
Aren't you being too cruel to me?

705
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,600
I'm sorry,

706
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,640
but you're the only one I can ask about Gi Do Shik.

707
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,570
What do you want to know about him?

708
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:55,160
Threaten Jae Yi using this.

709
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:01,360
Or give it to Song Jae Hyeok.

710
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,400
Which will be better for me?

711
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:11,330

712
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,510
What's this about?

713
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,770
Yes, it was him!

714
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:26,360
It was your husband!

715
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,230
I didn't recognize him because I just saw him briefly before the wedding.

716
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,980
I saw your husband at the hotel.

717
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:40,310
He was going up to a room.

718
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:44,490
It was even the most luxurious presidential floor.

719
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,110
What?

720
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:51,070
Your husband was a host before you got married, right?

721
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:54,300
Maybe the mutt hasn't gotten over his old habit.

722
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,740
- Are you serious right now?
 - Gosh!

723
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,500
Looks like you're about to hit me.

724
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,400
Bye!

725
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:20,890

726
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,560
Excuse me.

727
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:38,460
You're Na Na's nanny, right?

728
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,840
Yes.

729
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,090
Are you here to see her mother?

730
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,990
No.

731
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,920
Actually, I'm here to see you.

732
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,550
Me?

733
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,690
Yes.

734
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:59,290
I don't know what's in the boxes, but a lot of it was being transferred inside.

735
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,770
It's Song Je Hyeok's car.

736
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:15,420
 He came back after the place closed.

737
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,620
It looked like something was going on at Ace Bar.

738
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,830
18th is...

739
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,960
tomorrow.

740
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,010
What should we do?

741
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:36,680
Gi Do Shik... was a typical scumbag.

742
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:41,960
He was another rich boy who was into alcohol, drugs, and women.

743
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:46,080
That's all I know.

744
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:51,260
Is there someone who can tell me about him now?

745
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:54,330
His friend, maybe?

746
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:57,820
His friends are just like him, too.

747
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,360
Do you think they'll tell you anything special?

748
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,730
But still, try to think a little harder.

749
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:14,160
Yu Jeong's orphanage?

750
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,340
He used to do volunteer work there every weekend.

751
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,600
He said Gi Yoon Chul would cancel his credit card otherwise.

752
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,940

753
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:46,360
Are you okay?

754
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,250
Blood! I didn't see you!

755
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,590
Blood. Here.

756
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:12,540

757
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:22,780

758
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,490
Are you all ready?

759
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,300
 Yes!

760
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:33,810
We received a report of a secret organization that supplies drugs in the Gunggok district.

761
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,920
Let's wipe them out!

762
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,760
 Yes!

763
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:44,950
Go in!

764
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,410
Hurry, hurry!

765
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:53,050
We got a report that drugs are being sold here.

766
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,400
Is this real?

767
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,230
Move! Move!

768
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:58,150
Go in!

769
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:05,610
Hand it over!

770
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:07,540
Give it!

771
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,400
Police!

772
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,340
Give it to me right now!

773
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,580
Give it to me!

774
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:29,080
What do you think you're doing?

775
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,070
How could you accuse us of being drug dealers when we're doing business lawfully?

776
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,430
You were right, Attorney Do.

777
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,950
Song Je Hyeok wasn't here.

778
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,380
 The 18th is tomorrow.

779
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,340
 What should we do?

780
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,530
 Please prepare for it for now.

781
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,300
 You're still concerned about the Chunsarang Orphanage, right?

782
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,870
 On the Angel's Club's opening day,

783
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:06,310
 Song Je Hyeok had a wedding at Chunsarang Orphanage.

784
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:10,030
 I thought that wedding was maybe the opening event for the club.

785
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:14,090
 What could they have done at the orphanage where the children are?

786
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:18,320
 Why don't you invade Ace Bar like Go Yoo Na suggested?

787
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,910
 Let's invade both of them.

788
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,260
It's true.

789
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:28,080
This is the place, not Ace Bar.

790
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,330
I'm counting on you.

791
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:32,470
If this goes wrong, I'm finished. You know, right?

792
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:35,960
Yes. Let's go!

793
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,900
Let's go.

794
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,830
Excuse me, excuse me! Why are you here so late at night?

795
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:03,570
 This is just the beginning.

796
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,150
 I waited 10 years for this.

797
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,540
 It's the beginning of my revenge toward you.

798
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,990
 I'll destroy you...

799
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,130
 more cruely...

800
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:29,820
 and more relentlessly.

801
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:36,290
 For... making me...

802
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:43,120
 go through hell at that place that night.

803
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:56,180
 Your mask will come off now the moment this door is opened.

804
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:18,700
What is it?

805
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:27,150
Do you know who this is?

806
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:29,190
It's you!

807
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:37,330
Then... who do you think this pretty baby is?

808
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:45,030

809
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,100

810
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:53,470
♫  Dark desires hiding behind a mask  ♫

811
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:56,010
♫  They're liars  ♫

812
01:10:56,010 --> 01:11:01,460
♫  The truth is hiding behind the curtain  ♫

813
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:05,770
♫  My flashy looks are just to distract you  ♫

814
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:07,380
 ~ Preview ~ 
Choi Kang Hoo?

815
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:11,730
 Gi Do Shik. Do you remember him?

816
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:14,310
 What an annoying bastard.

817
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:18,620
 I think I can find out the truth about the orphanage soon.

818
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:21,540
 If so, Song Je Hyeok would be over, too.

819
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,170
 Answer him.

820
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:27,560
 I'm curious what you think, too.

821
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,620
 Can't we set the secret club aside

822
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,530
 and take care of Song Je Hyeok first?

823
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,510
 - You remember me, right?
 - Yes!

824
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:38,340
 I'm desperate to take Na Na back.

825
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:43,830
 I won't be destroying my precious family because of that worthless past.

826
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,010
 No matter what happens.

827
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,980
 I will protect them.

828
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,540
 Promise me just one thing.

829
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:56,250
 That you won't do anything that would destroy our family, Je Hyeok, me, and Na Na.

830
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,270
 I can't promise that.

831
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:03,100
 I can't forgive your husband.

832
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,540
♫  They're liars  ♫

833
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:08,540
♫  The whole world is blindfolded  ♫
