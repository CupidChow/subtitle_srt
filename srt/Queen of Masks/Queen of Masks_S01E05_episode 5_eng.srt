1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,350

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,410
Will you marry me?

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:17,440

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:24,190
That bastard is humiliating his family!

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,240
Does he love his fiancée that much?

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,230
I'm so thankful that Assemblyman and Do Shik like our Yu Jeong a lot.

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,840
Not at all! You offered your kind and well-behaved daughter to us.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,230
I should be thanking you instead.

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,380
Now that we're on the topic...

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,850
My flawed daughter is marrying into such an impressive family.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,440
Is that really enough for the wedding present?

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,770
It costs a lot of money, and it won't help your career at all.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,520
You never know if it would become a money-sucking ghost or a goose that lays golden eggs.

14
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,880
Now that you mentioned it.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,530
Let me bring this up.

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,250
Why don't we finish this up today?

17
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,850

18
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,100
Are we in that much of a rush?

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,050
The wedding is in two weeks.

20
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,520
We don't have to keep delaying it.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,120
I guess you're right.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,030
Hold on.

23
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,370
I think it makes sense to do this after the wedding.

24
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,430
A small contract is still a contract.

25
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,180
True. I guess you never know until the wedding day with kids these days.

26
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,490
Why don't we leave them alone?

27
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,100
The kids would feel uncomfortable if they knew we were here.

28
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,780
 Hyung!

29
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,760
- What happened? Did she run away?
 - Yes.

30
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,410
Hyung!

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,000

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,080
 They finished reading the wedding vows

33
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,890
 by promising eternal love for each other.

34
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,050
 So, here comes the final step of the wedding vow.

35
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,110
The bride and groom will kiss now!

36
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,780
 It was him.

37
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,040
 Song Je Hyeok.

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,500
 He's the man behind the mask you're looking for.

39
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,090
Now, they will present the rings.

40
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,150
The bride and groom's sweet and precious daughter,

41
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,550
Ms. Song Na Na is here to deliver the rings.

42
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,360
Looks like she favors Mom.

43
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,490
Now the groom, Song Je Hyeok, and the bride, Ju Yu Jeong,

44
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,860
promised to become a couple who will share happiness and sorrow

45
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,300
for the rest of their lives in front of friends and family.

46
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,530
I declare that their wedding has been successfully completed.

47
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,910
 (TN: In Korea, a wedding is not "official" until registered with the government)

48
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,600
Go Yoo Na!

49
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,970
What happened?

50
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,930
How did you end up with that mask?

51
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,580
He left it in the US, and I brought it with me.

52
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,680
Are you sure it was Je Hyeok's?

53
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,050
You might've taken someone else's from that room that day.

54
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,920
You trust him more than me?

55
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,970
It's not about whom I trust!

56
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,960
I care more about whom the mask belongs to.

57
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,890
That's why I have to be careful.

58
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,290
Let me ask you something, too, then.

59
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,810
What's with the blood on the mask?

60
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,570
That day,

61
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,200
when he did something awful to me,

62
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,310
I...

63
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,110
I swung a knife and ran away.

64
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,060
Since you know now, you should give me that mask.

65
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,660
If I get the blood on the mask tested,

66
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,590
I can find out if it really belongs to Song Je Hyeok or not.

67
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,580
What if I gave it to you?

68
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:10,040
If I did, would you betray him and Yu Jeong and get me my daughter back?

69
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,740
Forget it.

70
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,560
I'll find out myself,

71
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,890
if the mask really belongs to Song Je Hyeok or not.

72
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:37,040
I spent the last decade trying to find out who the mask belongs to,

73
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,400
I can't let you take the lead on something so important to me.

74
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,440
Fine.

75
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,150
So you don't care whom I give that mask to, right?

76
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,380

77
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,420
Let me make a toast.

78
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,260
Please pick up the glasses in front of you.

79
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,380
To their happiness for 10 years and 100 years!

80
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,540
To their happy married life!

81
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,300

82
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,510
Look how radiant she is.

83
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,560
I'm talking about Yu Jeong.

84
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,400
You must be disappointed.

85
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,800
If only that didn't happen to your son,

86
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,670
that jewel could've been yours.

87
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,650
Ms. Gil, are you provoking me right now?

88
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,120
Assemblyman, please look at the camera for a second.

89
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,350
Chairman, please look this way as well.

90
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,460
Let me take one, too.

91
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,880
Let me take a group shot.

92
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,190
Okay.

93
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,220

94
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,560

95
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960

96
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,630
 I haven't noticed anything that appears to be an opening event for the Angels' Club.

97
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,440
 What are we missing?

98
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,710

99
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,010

100
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,660
- I'm hungry!
 - You came.

101
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,420
I couldn't eat anything because of the dress.

102
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,220
Is something going on?

103
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,750
You've been acting weird since the wedding.

104
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,460
It's nothing.

105
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,390
She must be disappointed that Yu Jeong got married.

106
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,750
But don't worry.

107
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,040
She might come back in no time.

108
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,130
What a great thing to say on their wedding day.

109
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,780
Look! Dressed up like that, he looks like someone else.

110
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,050
Honestly, he could easily be the top dog in the industry I'm in, too.

111
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,770
You're right.

112
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,240
Yu Jeong should get nervous.

113
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,200
He looks like a celebrity today.

114
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,790
Excuse me.

115
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,710
Let me do it.

116
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,060
Thank you.

117
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,350
- Guys.
 - Yu Jeong!

118
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,760
Congratulations!

119
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,120
Did you enjoy the meal?

120
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,200
Congratulations!

121
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,560
Congratulations!

122
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,250
- Bravo!
 - What are you doing to the groom right now?

123
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,040
You shower people with champagne at the club like this!

124
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,710
Are we in the club? Don't let your old habits come out!

125
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,820
- You're all wet!
 - I'm okay.

126
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,900
- Take your jacket off first! My gosh!
 - I'm okay.

127
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,760
You could catch a cold. You should take it off, Je Hyeok.

128
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,230
No, I'll go change over there.

129
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,550
Just take it off. Don't make the bride worry.

130
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,340
Yes.

131
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,400
Then I'll go change now.

132
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,810
Wait for me, Je Hyeok!

133
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,990
Were you looking for this?

134
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,360
Where are Kang Hoo and Leo?

135
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,620
They went to get the cars.

136
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,880
Sorry about the champagne earlier.

137
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,820
Leo is still immature.

138
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,180
No, I'm actually glad.

139
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,450
Thanks to him, I didn't have to go to that table.

140
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,790
I really didn't want to run into him.

141
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,490
Gi Yoon Chul. He must be a pervert.

142
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,000
How could he come to his son's ex-fiancée's wedding? He should know better.

143
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,970
I think he knows Je Hyeok,

144
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,080
but I'm too scared to ask him about it.

145
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,500
What are you scared of? You even got a marriage license!

146
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,980
So what if he finds out about your past?

147
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,190
You got a marriage license already?

148
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,980
Why did you do that already? What's the rush?

149
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,170
Jae Yi. I saw it earlier.

150
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,990
The way you were looking at Je Hyeok.

151
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:14,120
You must be worried that I chose someone wrong again.

152
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,260
Jae Yi, don't worry.

153
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,860
I'm confident that I'll live happily this time.

154
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,530
I'm sure that Je Hyeok is a good man.

155
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,830
Thank you so much for making time for us.

156
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,890
So, will you be taking Yeongun's entire assets now, then?

157
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,680
I have to manage them well from now on

158
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,780
since important people like you would be watching.

159
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,560
Congratulations on your wedding again.

160
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,760
I hope only happy things happen to you.

161
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,210
Then, enjoy your trip.

162
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,750
You know that you have to treat the jewel carefully, right?

163
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,170
Then, I'll get going now.

164
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,430
- Okay.
 - Yes.

165
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,300
Na Na went to the camp with Aunt.

166
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,430
Please take these home for us.

167
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,420
Got it.

168
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,010

169
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,560
Are you going on the honeymoon right away?

170
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,550
Yes.

171
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,160
I'm kind of looking forward to it.

172
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,200
Je Hyeok prepared it alone to surprise me.

173
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,500
He's so romantic.

174
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,760
I wonder where you'll go to.

175
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,500
 Has Je Hyeok moved in?

176
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,810
 Yeah, he moved into my house two days ago.

177
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,760
Well, I'll get going now.

178
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,880
If Kang Hoo asks for me, tell him that I had to leave in a hurry.

179
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,160
Yu Jeong, you...

180
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,740
have to call me when anything happens.

181
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,350
Okay?

182
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,160
Yes, I will.

183
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,210
I'll get going.

184
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,940
Sir, hello.

185
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,540
You know me, right?

186
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,560
Of course, I do. You're a friend of the Chairwoman.

187
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,130
What is this about?

188
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,770
Well, I'll bring Yu Jeong's stuff home for her.

189
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,100
I prepared a surprise present, too.

190
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,490
Why don't you give that to me?

191
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,200
I'll deliver it for you.

192
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,740
Well, I need to set it up a bit.

193
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,090
I have to do it myself.

194
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,530
Since it's a surprise present,

195
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,990
please don't tell Yu Jeong and Je Hyeok that I went instead.

196
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,560
Okay, got it.

197
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,730
What's the passcode for the front door?

198
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,970
The fact that Do Jae Yi was

199
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,440
sexually assaulted by the man in a mask that night was true?

200
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,550
 That day, when he did something awful to me,

201
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:29,390
 I swung a knife and ran away.

202
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:35,530
If she ran away, who killed Gi Do Shik, then?

203
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,940
By chance...

204
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,020
Je Hyeok.

205
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,510
Yes?

206
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,850
Please tell me now

207
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,630
the surprise honeymoon destination.

208
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,990
That place is...

209
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,410
I need to find some kind of evidence.

210
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,700
We're not going all the way there like this, right?

211
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,830
We just arrived.

212
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,490
The place we'll spend our first night together.

213
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,160
Are we at the airport already?

214
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,210
It's the most beautiful and peaceful place in the world.

215
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,020
It's...

216
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,810
this place.

217
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,290
You made me look forward to it.

218
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,400
We're having our honeymoon at home?

219
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,570
Just come in for now.

220
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,210
Hold on.

221
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,800
I'll put on the corrective shoes.

222
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,150
Je Hyeok!

223
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,300
- You don't need stuff like that.
 - Well.

224
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,980
Wait.

225
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,740
Are you disappointed that the surprise honeymoon destination was our home?

226
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,690
It's a once-in-a-lifetime event.

227
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,520
Having that at home is a bit disappointing.

228
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,520
I wanted to have our only honeymoon here.

229
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,570
Because this is the world of Ju Yu Jeong, the woman I love the most in the world.

230
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,020
Just wait and see.

231
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,870
You've been protecting this world, feeling lonely,

232
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,850
but I'll make it the most beautiful and happy place.

233
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,010
And I'll make sure your pain, sadness,

234
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,630
and loneliness won't find you anymore.

235
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,040
So we should spend the night here

236
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,500
to celebrate the fact that I entered your world.

237
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,540
I'm sorry.

238
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,390
I didn't even know that was your intention.

239
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,090
If so...

240
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,930
The champagne smell!

241
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,990
I don't think I can embrace you smelling like this.

242
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,330
I'll go take a shower, too.

243
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,590
Then, Queen first?

244
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,930
Did you have fun?

245
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,720
How...

246
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,280
Were you watching... me?

247
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:01,530
A mouse comes into the house sometimes.

248
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,630
What should we do?

249
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,400
You got your cover blown by the mouse.

250
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,910
It was you, wasn't it?

251
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,910
That night.

252
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,330
- That mask.
 - Mask?

253
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,640
What mask?

254
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,010
Do you think I'm doing this without any evidence?

255
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,790
I don't know what evidence you have,

256
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,380
but you want to compare it with my DNA?

257
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,120
I haven't used that toothbrush often.

258
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,540
Why don't you bring something that's more definitive?

259
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,190
What could there be?

260
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,530
Should I kiss you like I did to Yu Jeong?

261
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,530
Or...

262
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,720
My hair?

263
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,530
Or...

264
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,080
The same thing

265
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,280
as the evidence you have?

266
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,330
You crazy...

267
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,510
Just wait and see.

268
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:22,740
I'll make sure to reveal that you're

269
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,040
that bastard from that night.

270
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,210
Why?

271
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,870
You can confirm right now!

272
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,720
If I'm that man in a mask that night or not!

273
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,010
Aren't you scared to get your cover blown?

274
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,980
I'm scared. I'm scared to death that Yu Jeong would find out...

275
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,680
that you and I did it.

276
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,940
But the evidence you have

277
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,770
doesn't prove that I did something bad to you unilaterally.

278
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,190
We could've done it because we wanted to.

279
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,550
But if possible, please keep it a secret from Yu Jeong that we did it.

280
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:38,140
Even thought It was 10 years ago, her character is so pure.

281
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,450
She'd get hurt.

282
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,580
What will you do?

283
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,560
There's no evidence that I did something bad to you.

284
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,360
There's only evidence that we did it together.

285
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,330
Je Hyeok, where are you?

286
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,790
You're making me shy at a place like this.

287
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,960
 Bye!

288
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,890

289
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,750
 What will you do?

290
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,040
 There's no evidence that I did something bad to you.

291
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,670
 There's only evidence that we did it together.

292
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,380
 But the evidence you have

293
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,100
 doesn't prove that I did something bad to you unilaterally.

294
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,570
 We could've done it because we wanted to.

295
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,210
 Nothing would've happened if you lived quietly.

296
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,250
 You have no shame.

297
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,260
 Because you tried to find me, you suffered for 10 years.

298
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,710
 I was always watching you,

299
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,900
 and I showed up in front of you again as your friend's husband.

300
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,530
 Right, feel free to visit me anytime if you miss that night.

301
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,480
 I'll always be around you.

302
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,500
♫  All of a sudden  ♫

303
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:10,670
♫  I can't get past the blooming feeling I wasn't aware of  ♫

304
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,830
♫  In some gap  ♫

305
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,380
♫  you are still blooming  ♫

306
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,470
♫  Today of all days   ♫

307
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,740
♫  step by step  ♫

308
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:30,360
♫  it's as if I am reaching you more as I move farther away  ♫

309
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:38,030
♫  I am going to fill in the gaps of my heart completely with you   ♫

310
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,310
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep.

311
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,570
 Jae Yi! Jae Yi!

312
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,720
Jae Yi! Jae Yi!

313
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,400
Jae Yi, wake up! Jae Yi!

314
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:13,660
 I hope you don't wear a white shirt in front of me from now on.

315
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,340
 This?

316
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,590
 Kang Hoo, to be honest...

317
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,090
Jae Yi.

318
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,880
 Mom!

319
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,600
 Mom! Mom!

320
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,590
Let's go.

321
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,620
Mom. Mom, Mom!

322
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,560
Why do you keep calling Mom so much?

323
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,630
Because you're pretty.

324
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,630
Do you think I'm that pretty?

325
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,370
You're the prettiest in the world!

326
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,950
Do you think I'm that pretty?

327
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:12,310
I think you're the prettiest in the world, too, Na Na.

328
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,460
- By the way, Mom.
 - Yeah?

329
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,520
You're not going anywhere anymore, right?

330
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,410
You'll keep living with me, right?

331
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,350
Of course.

332
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:30,470
I'm your mom. Where else can I go?

333
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,780
I'll always be by your side.

334
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,380
Here it comes!

335
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,600
- Hello, Ms. Ju.
 - Hello, Ma'am.

336
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,860
Hi, Na Na.

337
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,090
Hello!

338
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,420
Should we get in the car together?

339
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,880
It's okay. Hold her hand.

340
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,780
She's in your care, Ma'am.

341
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,650
Yes, don't worry.

342
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,500
Na Na, say goodbye to Mom.

343
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
I'll be back soon!

344
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,780
Yes, Na Na. Have fun!

345
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,790
Bye.

346
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:31,390

347
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,550
What's this all of a sudden?

348
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,520
I'm glad.

349
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,180
At least you take good care of the child.

350
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,450
Were you watching me?

351
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,140
Why?

352
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,780
I wasn't exactly watching you.

353
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,830
Anyway, do you know where Do Jae Yi is?

354
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,020
I don't know.

355
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,030
She's ignoring my calls and texts, too.

356
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,780
Do you know?

357
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,860
I wouldn't have asked you if I did.

358
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,180
I asked you because I couldn't reach her, either.

359
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,680
You could've just asked me on the phone.

360
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,600
Why did you come all the way here?

361
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,430
Do you know

362
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,840
that you're the biggest obstacle?

363
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,430
What?

364
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,430
Forget it.

365
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,690
If Jae Yi calls you, tell her to call me.

366
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,060
I need to ask her something.

367
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,550
What a coward!

368
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,270
She ran away because I scared her once?

369
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,320
She hasn't come home for a week already.

370
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,460
She's not even showing up at the office.

371
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,120
Why did you scare Do Jae Yi anyway?

372
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,310
 Did you get caught by chance─

373
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,870
What do you mean, get caught?

374
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:08,100
I took a preventative measure because she might poke around regarding the mayor of Tongju.

375
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,300
 Since nothing's getting in the way anymore,

376
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,100
is the Angels' Club beginning now?

377
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,080
Tell the members

378
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,230
that... it's the devil's turn now.

379
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,060
 Hi.

380
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,500
 I'm the guy who used to live in the apartment before.

381
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,010
 I called you a few times earlier to ask you to look for

382
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,430
 something important I left behind.

383
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,200
 What?

384
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,690
 My ex-wife took it?

385
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:57,380
Go Yoo Na is the problem right now. Not Do Jae Yi.

386
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,260
 I know you have the mask.

387
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,990
 Don't do anything stupid.

388
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,930
 You know who's behind me, right?

389
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,420
I know who's behind you.

390
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,330
I have so many people to show off to now.

391
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,480
 It's Go Yoo Na. We should meet.

392
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,440
 If you stand me up again, I'll come to the National Assembly.

393
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,850
 Who came?

394
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,310
Yoo Na did? In front of your house?

395
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,010
Yes!

396
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,760
I was seeing Na Na off on the kindergarten bus,

397
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,970
and she asked me if I could reach Jae Yi.

398
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,470
I'm so scared of how she keeps showing up out of the blue.

399
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,590
I'm also scared of you showing up early in the morning like this!

400
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,870
Why not use your phone?

401
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,590
Je Hyeok was home.

402
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,890
If I called you, I would have to talk about Yoo Na.

403
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:10,660
I'm so embarrassed in front of Je Hyeok that I have a friend like her.

404
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,090
Speaking of Je Hyeok.

405
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,290
You were supposed to donate the orphanage property to the promotion committee.

406
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,110
Why aren't you doing it?

407
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,650
Je Hyeok is very attached to the orphanage.

408
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:30,290
Then give the money the hotel donated back!

409
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:34,520
I really don't know what to say to the chairman!

410
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,400
Fine!

411
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,080
If we hear from Jae Yi, we'll ask her what happened with Yoo Na's land

412
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,230
and give it back to you.

413
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:45,370
So, you should better stop bringing up money in front of me!

414
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,520
Where did Jae Yi disappear to, anyway?

415
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,940
I couldn't reach Kang Hoo, either.

416
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,070
Could they... be together, by chance?

417
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,220
Thank you.

418
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:32,400
I think it's been 10 years since I relaxed without doing anything like this.

419
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:37,400
Yes. Don't do anything and rest.

420
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,910
You're my sanctuary again.

421
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,990
You know, right?

422
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:50,410
That you've always been my sanctuary.

423
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,920
Jae Yi.

424
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,490
Yeah?

425
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:07,000
You won't quit this battle, right?

426
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,780
I know...

427
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,380
that it's exhausting to just watch.

428
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,280
So Kang Hoo...

429
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,730
I didn't mean it like that.

430
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,000
I just wanted to confirm.

431
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,960
So Jae Yi,

432
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,500
don't ever get discouraged.

433
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,710
I'm always there for you if you get tired.

434
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,270
Okay?

435
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,610
Okay.

436
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,040
It's a wine from Napa Valley I personally brought from the US.

437
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,920
Have some.

438
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,660
Why are we meeting here, out of all places?

439
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,170
- This is─
 - I know.

440
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:16,260
It's the room where Gi Do Shik, your only son, died.

441
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:22,660
The reason why I called you here is to talk about your son's death.

442
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,780
My son?

443
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:38,980
What's this?

444
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,140
10 years ago, on the day your son died,

445
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:49,040
Do Jae Yi was sexually assaulted by a man wearing this mask in this room.

446
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,440
This blood is from when she swung a knife at that man.

447
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,740
My son didn't sexually assault anyone!

448
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,520
When did I tell you it was him?

449
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,020
I suppose it was Song Je Hyeok.

450
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,940
Song Je Hyeok?

451
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:10,530
I've been thinking while looking at this mask.

452
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:15,210
I don't think it was Do Jae Yi who killed your son.

453
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,570
It's not easy for a woman to fight two men using a knife.

454
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,050
Who's the real culprit, then?

455
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,930
Couldn't it be Song Je Hyeok?

456
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,830
You've been helping out the man

457
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:43,630
who killed your son without knowing anything.

458
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,610
Why don't you jump ship?

459
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,600
Leave Song Je Hyeok and come to me.

460
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:05,360
If you're telling me a lie, you'll have to take responsibility.

461
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,570
Keep in mind

462
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,560
that I'm capable of getting you out

463
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,000
of prison and put you back in it, too.

464
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,340
Let's leave now.

465
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,380

466
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,870
Did you know that Jae Yi's friend Yu Jeong got married?

467
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,390
I went to the wedding.

468
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,200
You went to see Jae Yi!

469
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,570
You should keep an eye on her that way.

470
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,210
She's your daughter.

471
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,730
Nothing's going on with her, right?

472
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,240
I couldn't reach her for about a week,

473
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,900
but she called me just now.

474
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,840
In an energetic voice,

475
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,450
she said she found a way to free herself or something.

476
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,710
I don't know how she found a way to free herself

477
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,100
from what's been constraining her for 10 years,

478
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,260
but I'm just glad.

479
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:55,080
Jae Yi's mom from heaven must be protecting her.

480
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,780

481
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,450
Attorney Do.

482
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,470
I had a nice vacation, thanks to you, too.

483
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,930
Gosh, it couldn't have been much of a vacation.

484
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:30,210
People must've been calling and looking for me a lot.

485
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,580
You have no idea.

486
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:36,320
Chairwoman Ju Yu Jeong and Vice President Yoon Hae Mi called a lot.

487
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,780
I'll call them when I'm ready.

488
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:45,970
Song Je Hyeok can't hear about what I've been up to at all.

489
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:51,230
I know, but how will you fight him on your own?

490
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,070
That's why I'm thinking of letting a soldier in.

491
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:57,080
It's someone who knows my enemy well.

492
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,770

493
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,720
Isn't it pretty?

494
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,490
Okay.

495
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,920
 You're all I can think about.

496
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,460
 You're a flower to me.

497
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,870
Look at you now.

498
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:30,470
It's hard to make a living, isn't it?

499
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,310
Follow me. Let's talk.

500
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,010

501
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,920
 I'll never do it!

502
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,530
I'm only managing drugs here as we promised, okay?

503
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,380
I'll never manage clients.

504
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,280
Come on.

505
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,000
It's not just a normal client, I said.

506
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,690
I won't do it!

507
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,660
Leo.

508
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:03,820
There's a secret club that only has the top VVIPs.

509
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:07,100
You'll be managing those members.

510
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:11,460
You're effective with the VVIPs.

511
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,730
That's how you seduced your wife, too.

512
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,100
I didn't seduce her! I love her!

513
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,530
Yes, love.

514
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:21,830
But it looks like your love is suffering a bit these days.

515
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,690
It looked like she was looking for drugs, too.

516
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:26,170
What?

517
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,850
So, did you give something to her?

518
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:32,010
No, not yet.

519
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,660
But you never know if you keep acting this way.

520
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:45,910
So let's do it just once. Just once.

521
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,340
I won't ask you again.

522
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:00,490
It's just this once!

523
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,720
Instead, if you sell drugs to my wife,

524
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,490
I'll burn this whole place down, okay?

525
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,820
You came.

526
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,410
- Ma'am?
 - Yes.

527
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:23,180
I got Cha Leo, Yoon Hae Mi's husband.

528
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,650
Good work.

529
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:29,400
We could get Yoo Hae Mi, too, if we're lucky.

530
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,980
 You can't go in! You can't go in!

531
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,620
- I'm sorry.
 - Yes.

532
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,830

533
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,140
I'm the chairman here.

534
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,980
Please be polite.

535
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,290
Are you the one who killed my son?

536
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,590
Go Yoo Na came to me and showed me the bloody mask.

537
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:57,030
I heard it happened when you sexually assaulted Do Jae Yi!

538
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:01,740
- Please be careful what you say.
 - Answer me!

539
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,610
Was it you?

540
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,190
It's true what happened with Do Jae Yi,

541
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:13,470
but I'm not the one who killed Do Shik!

542
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,440
Do Jae Yi was holding the knife.

543
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,120
How could I have killed Do Shik?

544
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:22,250
I got attacked by Do Jae Yi and ran away.

545
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:26,550
So I don't know what happened afterward!

546
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,120
If you really killed my son,

547
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,840
you'll face a death that's even more miserable than my son's.

548
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,170
Do as you wish.

549
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,780
Also, it's dangerous that Go Yoo Na has that mask.

550
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:55,820
I won't tell Chairman Kang Il Goo about what you did to Do Jae Yi.

551
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,130
So take that mask back.

552
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,930
Okay?

553
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,550
 You're all I can think about. You're a flower to me.

554
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:17,010
I don't think your sweetness is working, either.

555
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,070
 Let's meet at Grand Kangbo Hotel after an hour.

556
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,890
 You know to keep this a secret from Leo, right?

557
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:34,120

558
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:51,000

559
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,940
You came, Ahgassi.

560
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,000
It's been a while.

561
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,480
Long time no see!

562
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,590
Have you been well? Where's Mom?

563
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,630
She's in the room.

564
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:23,590
I told you to give me alcohol. What's this raisin tree tea for?

565
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,490
I don't give alcohol to anyone just because we sell alcohol.

566
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,970
What's this about?

567
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:33,870
You never come here because you're afraid that people will see you.

568
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:37,110
It's not because I'm afraid that people would see me.

569
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:40,880
It's because I'm annoyed by how you yell at Leo.

570
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,650
I worked so hard to raise you.

571
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,580
I can't believe he's the one you chose! Geez! Geez!

572
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,880
Here we go again! Geez!

573
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,170
What did I expect by coming here?

574
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,000
Yoo Hae Mi! Sit down!

575
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,390
You came here because something happened.

576
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:07,080
What is it?

577
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,930
What's going on?

578
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,500
Mom.

579
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,780
The arts and culture village Jae Yi is building in Tongju.

580
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:24,250
She was supposed to include Yu Jeong and me in it after she took the land from Yoo Na.

581
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,940
But I can't reach Jae Yi for more than a week.

582
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,420
How am I supposed to interpret this?

583
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,580
Interpret, my foot.

584
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,210
You got betrayed!

585
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:37,280
I did? By Jae Yi?

586
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,450
You think she doesn't know how to do math?

587
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:41,490
She could split the land with Go Yoo Na.

588
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:45,800
Why would she include you and Yu Jeong and split it three ways?

589
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,570
No way.

590
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,090
I've been friends with her forever!

591
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,390
She'll never betray us.

592
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:59,570
People betray even their own families for money.

593
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,240
And as a friend? That's nothing.

594
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,130
Do you think you and Yu Jeong would never do that?

595
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,360
Mom,

596
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:18,530
just like you said... what should I do if she really betrayed me?

597
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,310
What do you mean what should you do?

598
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,330
I'll give you a weapon.

599
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:28,160
Stab her in the pit of her stomach.

600
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,020
Weapon?

601
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,120
By chance... do you know Jae Yi's serious weakness?

602
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,670
 Go Yoo Na, we should meet.

603
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,510
 Give me the mask,

604
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,200
 then I'll give you your daughter.

605
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:30,180
 Give me the mask and I'll give you Na Na.

606
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,450
 I'm on my way to the hotel now.

607
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:40,480

608
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,970
Do Jae Yi...

609
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,150
or Song Je Hyeok?

610
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,020
You came home early.

611
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,440
You know, the orphanage property?

612
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,300
We're supposed to donate it to the promotion committee.

613
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,270
I think we need to rush it.

614
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:13,330
We haven't received the land to build the arts and culture village yet.

615
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,860
Hae Mi wants to take care of that first.

616
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,850
- Let's donate that first and─
 - No.

617
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,890
We can't donate it.

618
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:25,350
If I say no, you can't!

619
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,640
Aren't I the chairman of the Yeongun Foundation?

620
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,600
Was it just a title?

621
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,540
Well, it's not that.

622
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,630
I can't reach Jae Yi to resolve the issue,

623
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,710
and Hae Mi keeps rushing me.

624
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,000
Why do you keep letting your friends drag you around?

625
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,410
What are you, an idiot?

626
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:51,100
An idiot?

627
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,990
 Unless you want to humiliate your family,

628
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:57,100
 you should go home and get a good prenatal education.

629
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,660
 Let's hope it's not an idiot like you.

630
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,690
How could you say such a thing?

631
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,990
I'm sorry.

632
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:22,800
I said the wrong thing because I was so angry.

633
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:30,320
I'm the one who you should trust and depend on from now on.

634
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:35,330
But I think you care about your friends too much.

635
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:38,390
Please listen to me, too, from now on.

636
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:43,710
The one who loves and cherishes you the most in this world

637
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:48,880
is me, your husband.

638
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,290
Yes.

639
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,200
I'll step out for a second.

640
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,660
Don't fall asleep and wait for me.

641
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,410
We're still newlyweds.

642
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,400
Tell him not to worry.

643
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,930
I'll make sure to secure the mask.

644
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,950

645
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:34,350
Are you here to take this?

646
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,360
What should we do?

647
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,970
I got it first.

648
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:54,650
You're sitting in the same spot you sat 10 years ago.

649
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:57,110
I heard you got scared and ran away,

650
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:59,840
but I guess you got braver in the meantime.

651
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,700
I know.

652
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,760
But I'm not afraid of you right now.

653
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,030
To be honest, I feel kind of sorry for you

654
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:18,140
that you're scared I would take this mask.

655
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,420
I'm scared of you? No way!

656
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,740
Did you forget? The statute of limitation expired.

657
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:28,370
That's when we didn't know this mask was yours.

658
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:32,000
The statute of limitation gets extended when the culprit's DNA gets found.

659
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,160
The statute of limitation was on pause when you ran away from the country.

660
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:42,250
That means, your statute of limitation is still in effect. Very much so.

661
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:47,490
Let's say the statute of limitation got extended.

662
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:50,420
What can you possibly do?

663
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,200
I told you.

664
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:58,560
This mask doesn't prove that I did anything bad to you.

665
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:01,380
I know.

666
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:06,280
What I need to do now

667
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,120
is to take the Song Je Hyeok mask you're wearing right now.

668
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:16,750
I'll reveal everything, including the fact that you raped me

669
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:22,360
10 years ago, and everything that happened

670
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,750
in this room that night.

671
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:30,530
You want to reveal everything that happened 10 years ago?

672
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:37,520
You might end up touching what you're not supposed to, then.

673
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:44,000
Is it that... Angel's Club?

674
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,300
Where they wear masks?

675
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:52,720
Wow, you've caught up quite a bit all this time.

676
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,600
Just wait.

677
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,910
If I take control of Tongju after becoming the mayor,

678
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,860
I'll reveal everything, including where you belong,

679
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:03,140
what kind of things you do,

680
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:06,870
and what your goal is.

681
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:09,660
I'm looking forward to it.

682
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,410
You won't disappoint me, right?

683
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,930
Yu Jeong.

684
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,760
I think Jae Yi betrayed us.

685
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,370
 The door is opening.

686
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:18,630
Are you done talking to Jae Yi?

687
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,500
Shall we talk now?

688
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:37,260

689
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:45,930

690
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,840
Do you like staring at me that much?

691
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,080
Should we get married?

692
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,020
I like you a lot.

693
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:19,240
We just met yesterday.

694
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,280
What do you know about me?

695
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,900
I can start getting to know you now.

696
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:28,870
I'm curious... what your world would be like.

697
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:45,660
I think meeting you... was the luckiest thing that happened in my life.

698
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,420

699
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,820
♫  Dark desires hiding behind a mask  ♫

700
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,440
♫  They're liars  ♫

701
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,780
♫  The truth is completely hidden behind a curtain  ♫

702
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,170
 ~ Preview ~ 
You saw Jae Yi? Where?

703
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:09,750
 In front of Yoo Na's hotel.

704
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:13,550
 - Let's do this.
 - Good luck, Do Jae Yi.

705
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:18,380
 If Jae Yi betrayed us, what should we do then?

706
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:19,900
 What are you planning to do?

707
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,500
 Threaten Jae Yi using this.

708
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,980
 Or give it to Song Je Hyeok.

709
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:29,960
 Now it's clear that he's the culprit.

710
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,350
 Is this enough?

711
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:34,210
 This is the perfect place for you.

712
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:36,710
 The very bottom.

713
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:38,170
 Jae Yi! Jae Yi! Jae Yi!

714
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,560
 Do you think I'm a joke?

715
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,910
 Na Na sometimes asks about you.

716
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:44,070
 Me, you, and our daughter.

717
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:47,860
 We were happy in the US.

718
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,820
 Tell me.

719
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:53,460
 Do Jae Yi. What's her future plan?

720
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:59,670
 No matter how perfect your mask is, your true face will eventually get revealed.

721
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,530
♫  The whole world is blindfolded  ♫
