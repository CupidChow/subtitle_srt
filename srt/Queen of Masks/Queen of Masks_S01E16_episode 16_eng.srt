1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,350

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,430
Thank you for making difficult decisions.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:15,470
You'll be getting an unbelievable amount of money and power through the new club.

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,180
I kept my promise to help you.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,890
Now it's your turn.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,370
How will you keep your promise to cut ties with Jae Yi?

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,830
I haven't contacted her. She hasn't contacted me, either.

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,290
That won't be enough.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,720
You need to be more decisive. For example...

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,940

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,970
You want us to reveal Jae Yi's weakness?

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,840
You don't just want us to cut ties with her.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,540
You basically want us to become her enemies.

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,660
That's right. Enemies.

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:10,970
You have to do that much to end a friendship that's more than 20 years old.

16
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,610
You've known her for a long time.

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,450
You must know her better than anyone.

18
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,110
But as you know, she used to be called an "Icon of Justice."

19
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,640
How could someone like that have a weakness?

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,760
She actually does.

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,100
She used to do dirty work for Jung Goo Tae's family.

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,950
You burnt the evidence for it.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,840
It's not a weakness if there's no evidence.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,800
What kind of ledger doesn't have a copy?

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,650
Is there a copy?

26
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,190
Yes, there is.

27
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,490
Let's just do it since we agreed to do it, anyway.

28
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,620
Jae Yi won't get hurt, even if that gets revealed.

29
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,380
She has a dependable father who's a tycoon. What's there to worry about?

30
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,730
You want her to get hurt and be in your arms, right?

31
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,130
That way, her suffering would end, too.

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,320
You're definitely clever.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,970
I'm thinking of caring for Jae Yi now.

34
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,210
There's a file for Jae Yi's money laundering record.

35
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,200
That's enough for us to earn your trust, right?

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,650
Yes. Jae Yi is on her way here right now.

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,210
You should brace yourselves.

38
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,860
You have to be merciless when cutting someone off.

39
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,100
You came.

40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,840
What are you guys doing here?

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,460
From now on, they're no longer your friends.

42
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,100
They're my clients.

43
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,740
What did he mean just now?

44
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,830
I just asked you what he meant!

45
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,420
It's just as he said.

46
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,420
We won't be seeing you anymore.

47
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,570
You said your life ended up this way because of us.

48
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,200
Then you should cut us off.

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,710
My life ended up this way because of you guys?

50
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,970
Who said that? Did he say that?

51
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,300
There's truth to it, isn't there?

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,960
Your life would've been easier if you didn't get involved with me.

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,560
Let's call it quits now.

54
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
Hey! Go Yoo Na!

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,610
Let's just do that, Jae Yi.

56
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,610
We need to do this for our own survival.

57
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,790
We beg you.

58
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,280
Yu Jeong, do you feel that way, too? Huh?

59
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,230
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry, Jae Yi.

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,390
How could you guys?

62
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,270
How could you guys do this to me?

63
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:22,260

64
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
Do you get it now?

65
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,160
I told you to become more powerful.

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,770
But is this what you've been devoted to?

67
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,700
Friends? Trust? Loyalty?

68
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,900
Useless stuff like that?

69
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,860
Why are you doing this?

70
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,190
Why do you have to take it this far, anyway?

71
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,090
Jae Yi.

72
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,840
Have you trusted me... even once?

73
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,480
You have to trust the most powerful person to gain power.

74
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,540
That's what I'm so disappointed about.

75
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,420
I'm disappointed as a father, too.

76
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,240
Why do you not trust me?

77
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,200
You betrayed Mom and abandoned me.

78
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,830
How could I trust someone like you?

79
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,150
I did betray your mother, but I didn't abandon you.

80
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,410
It was the same both 10 years ago and now.

81
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,820
I think I've been abiding by my conscience as a father, at least.

82
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,760
Conscience?

83
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,620
You wouldn't have committed murder if you had such a thing.

84
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,700
Murder?

85
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,840
It all started because of you.

86
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,510
10 years ago, for his ambitions in politics, Gi Yoon Chul

87
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:10,050
tried to take the Angel's Club from me, which I worked so hard on.

88
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,380
I couldn't just let that happen.

89
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,350
But that's when

90
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,950
 I happened to meet Song Je Hyeok.

91
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,450
Why did a famous vice chairman like you want to see me?

92
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,090
I heard you're the best in this field.

93
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,720
You sell drugs, too.

94
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,010
I heard you're gifted in selling, whether it's alcohol or drugs.

95
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,060
But I'm not into men.

96
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,910
So I can't sell alcohol to you.

97
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,380
Do you want drugs, by chance?

98
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,550
No, sell me something else.

99
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,270
A weakness of some bastard.

100
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,220
- A weakness?
 - His name is Gi Do Shik.

101
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,640
I heard Assemblyman Gi's son is your customer.

102
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,580
Film him taking drugs.

103
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,720
One of him touching a woman while high would be─

104
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,900
If I do, what would you get me?

105
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,050
A mask.

106
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,530
- A mask?
 - Only the most powerful people in Korea get to wear one.

107
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,860
What do you think?

108
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,410
Do you want to try it on?

109
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,370
 I noticed his malevolent nature immediately.

110
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,160
My flawed daughter is marrying into such an impressive family.

111
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,100
Is that really enough for the wedding present?

112
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,360
Now that you mentioned it.

113
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,000
Let me bring this up.

114
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,780
Why don't we finish this up today?

115
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,490

116
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,330
Are we in that much of a rush?

117
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,210
The wedding is in two weeks.

118
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,690
We don't have to keep delaying it.

119
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,380
I guess you're right.

120
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,170
Hold on.

121
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,580
I think it makes sense to do this after the wedding.

122
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,640
A small contract is still a contract.

123
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,370
Is it because you're still attached to it?

124
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,690
That's why you're sabotaging me.

125
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,190
Chunsarang Orphanage, which you worked so hard on,

126
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,870
will be given to me as a wedding present.

127
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,850
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

128
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,270
We should be honest with each other.

129
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,990
As a son of a sushi restaurant owner, slicing fish for a living,

130
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,620
you married a daughter of Kangbo Group and became the vice chairman.

131
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,050
Doesn't everyone know about that?

132
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,860
But you don't share blood with your son-in-law.

133
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,160
You're in a precarious position in which you might get ousted anytime.

134
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,660
That's why you created it.

135
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,750
The pleasure dome in the basement of the orphanage.

136
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:11,090
It was to become the real owner of Kangbo by gaining the authoritative figures' support.

137
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,330
I guess that's how you are.

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,530
You're maintaining the assemblyman position by luck

139
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,510
but you lack administrative abilities and money.

140
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,230
You don't know when you will lose your position.

141
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,350
Is that why you're selling your son?

142
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,890
Will you steal the pleasure dome I built in the orphanage?

143
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,060
You're right.

144
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,730
I didn't know... that my son would get me so much power.

145
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,920
I guess that's why old people used to say

146
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,520
that children are the most important crop to harvest.

147
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,360
Let's just wait and see

148
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,080
 if your son will benefit you or be a toxin.

149
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,430

150
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,170
 I turned the CCTVs off. Get the party started.

151
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,990
 In order to find a weakness of Gi Yoon Chul's son, Gi Do Shik,

152
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,550
 I sent that devil to the hotel.

153
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,320
 But...

154
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,570
 you came to that room instead of Go Yoo Na.

155
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,020
She's the wrong one.

156
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,850
I thought you were giving that drink to Go Yoo Na.

157
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,780
You think I knew? I had no idea Go Yoo Na wouldn't come and someone else would drink it instead.

158
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,210
I don't know, I don't know.

159
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,960
Each of these girls came over and harassed me. My head is about to explode.

160
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,380
I'll take a nap inside and think about it later.

161
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,400
Keep an eye on her, okay?

162
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,020
What a coward.

163
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,320
 Is the party over? Did the recording go well?

164
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,960
Hey!

165
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,150
Hey!

166
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,400
 That's when... things started getting complicated.

167
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,120
 Why won't you respond? Did you possibly fail?

168
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,940
What brings you here?

169
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,650
I knew something had happened because you didn't respond.

170
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,910
By the way, is this the best you can do?

171
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,620
Dad... Dad...

172
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,780
Clingy bastard.

173
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,140
If you had not come here that day,

174
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,930
I wouldn't have had to have blood on my hands.

175
00:14:53,930 --> 00:15:00,180
Your daughter... was sexually assaulted by Song Je Hyeok.

176
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,040
But...

177
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,610
you covered him up and ignored me.

178
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,110
How could you still call yourself a father?

179
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:17,430
At the time, I thought Gi Do Shik was the one who did that to you.

180
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:23,110
I thought I did my job as a father by killing him.

181
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,810
Then what about Song Je Hyeok and Gi Yoon Chul?

182
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,550
You're the one who killed them, too.

183
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,930
I should have had Song Je Hyeok killed sooner.

184
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,300
 I found out later that he's the one you were looking for.

185
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,930
I got your revenge.

186
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,810
Gi Yoon Chul...

187
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,390
 chose to kill himself.

188
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,280
It wasn't my fault.

189
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,390
How about Kang Hoo? Why did he have to die?

190
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,270
Do you still trust Choi Kang Hoo?

191
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,700
He came to me and

192
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,530
threatened me for money using the file from 10 years ago.

193
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,670
You know that money was found in his car, too.

194
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,200
 This is the 500 million won (~$360.000) that was found in his car.

195
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,110
Did you think I'd buy a trick like that?

196
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,060
Kang Hoo wasn't that kind of person.

197
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,770
You saw your friends earlier.

198
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,160
You're not supposed to trust people.

199
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,140
Why don't you... try trusting this instead?

200
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,850
This is the mask for the new secret club I'm starting.

201
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,030
I'm thinking of creating an even more secret club

202
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,360
for more powerful people than the Angel's Club.

203
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,760
You're really out of your mind.

204
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,300
The world we're living in is making us crazy.

205
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,460
To survive in this world, people put on a mask like this

206
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,520
either knowingly or unknowingly.

207
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,600
Do you think you'd get any credit for living without a mask?

208
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,840
Do you think a mask like that could cover up the truth?

209
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,180
What do you see behind the mask?

210
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,480
Truth? Look.

211
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,630
What do you see right now?

212
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,750
The truth is always dirty and ugly.

213
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,060
That's why I create masks.

214
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:10,790
Because the ugly truths get hidden if you put on a mask.

215
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,060
You as well should grow powerful using that mask.

216
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,560
And try creating the world you want.

217
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,040
Did you think I would accept your proposal?

218
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,160
If you say no,

219
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,190
you will become a murderer like me.

220
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,630
What?

221
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,590
The night Song Je Hyeok died, you came to this room, too.

222
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,710
You asked me to turn the CCTV off, right?

223
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:13,610
 Please pause the CCTV at Grand Kangbo Hotel on the date and time of my request.

224
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:19,090
You... recorded that?

225
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:30,480
Your friends will become your accomplices, too.

226
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:40,340
You were the one... who took pictures of us.

227
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,270
Will you... trust me now?

228
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,430
So let's stop this now, Jae Yi.

229
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,720
You can't defeat me with power.

230
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,530
You should join me instead.

231
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:27,770
If you do, you and your friends will be happy, too.

232
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,970
No.

233
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,710
I'll never forgive you.

234
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,420
I'll never back off.

235
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,650
I'll be waiting.

236
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,210
Come back to me if you change your mind.

237
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,490
Chief, will you really be like this?

238
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,400
I told you there's conclusive evidence.

239
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,570
 I'll pretend I didn't hear what you said.

240
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,920
 I have to get to work. Well, then.

241
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,340
He hasn't changed at all.

242
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,050

243
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,980
Prosecutor Choi, this is Do Jae Yi.

244
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,100
Your brother Choi Kang Hoo's...

245
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,110
 Geez, I shouldn't have answered.

246
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:43,920
 Attorney Do, I need to get going because I have an urgent meeting.

247
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,300
 Let's talk later.

248
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,190
Kang Il Gu must be behind all this.

249
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,500
He's trying to make you powerless.

250
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,720
Yes.

251
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,840
Breaking news?

252
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,070
It was revealed that Attorney Do Jae Yi managed scandals for the late Jung Goo Tae's family

253
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,010
 before he passed and accepted billions of wons for commission.

254
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,290
 It was very unexpected since she has been called

255
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,200
 the "Icon of Justice" for helping the female victims of sexual assault.

256
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,360

257
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,830

258
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,290

259
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,350
- It's me.
  - Yes, talk to me.

260
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,890
I need time to prepare myself for it.

261
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,010
You'll give me time, right?

262
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,750
You're abandoning your lifelong values.

263
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,380
Of course, you need time.

264
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,750
- I understand.
  - Also...

265
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,550
I need to ask you something.

266
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,920
Who's the one who killed Kang Hoo?

267
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,250
Well...

268
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,510
I have no idea.

269
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,940
Okay.

270
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,250
What did she say?

271
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,390
It's none of your concern.

272
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,990
Jae Yi seems totally destroyed now, right?

273
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,710
I'm still not sure if this was necessary.

274
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,580
How do you feel about blowing yourself up?

275
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,220
This is what I wanted.

276
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,390
I actually feel good about it.

277
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,790
I assume it wasn't easy tricking him.

278
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,110
Good job.

279
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,020
It was easy. Lying is my specialty.

280
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,410
Yu Jeong's acting was actually impressive.

281
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,980
Wow, that was unbelievable.

282
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,830
You showed complicated emotions in which you weren't sure what to do.

283
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,390
"I'm sorry, Jae Yi!"

284
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:13,630
Chairman Kang must think we really abandoned Jae Yi, right?

285
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,610
Thank you for choosing me.

286
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,260
 What would you like to do?

287
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,790
 Will you accept my gift?

288
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,010
 Let's talk before we leave.

289
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,040
 When Chairman Kang said he would help my mother if I cut Jae Yi off,

290
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,040
 I understood why, although it was painful to me.

291
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,560
 He said Jae Yi needs to cut ties with her past to be happy.

292
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,760
 And it's true we were a part of her past.

293
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,720
 But...

294
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,190
 the moment I heard he created that Angel's Club, I got chills.

295
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,970
 I didn't show it,

296
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,680
 but it felt like my hair was standing up when he was touching that mask!

297
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,630
 I don't remember anything he told me, either.

298
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:33,020
 The moment I entered, all I could think about was when we could get out of there.

299
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,870
 Him telling us to cut Jae Yi off for her sake is all an excuse!

300
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,110
 It's because he won't be able to lure us into the new club if Jae Yi were by our side!

301
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,080
 You should say something, too.

302
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,980
 You must have thoughts, too.

303
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:55,630
 Does talking about what kind of person he is solve anything?

304
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,380
 I'm wondering how we can escape from his threats.

305
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,030
 Threats?

306
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:11,870
 He said he would take back the gifts if we refused to join the new club.

307
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,240
 If that's not a threat, what is?

308
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,000
 I don't want to get help from him.

309
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,970
 The moment I heard my mom was involved with the Angel's Club,

310
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,990
 I thought the sky was falling.

311
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,240
 And he wants me to work for a club like that?

312
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,370
 Queen? Forget it!

313
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,880
 I'll just stay by Jae Yi's side.

314
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,100
 Yes.

315
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,370
 I'm thinking of doing the same.

316
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,790
 Of course, I want to save the foundation.

317
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,030
 It was inherited from my parents, too.

318
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,830
 It would be a good thing to have for the kids, too.

319
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,560
 But...

320
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,950
 I realized it while running around trying to save the foundation.

321
00:27:53,950 --> 00:28:00,010
 Because of Song Je Hyeok, the foundation's reputation got totally tarnished.

322
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,690
 It won't be a good background for the children.

323
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,140
 It would actually be shameful to them.

324
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,230
 For that reason, I'm no longer attached to the foundation.

325
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,670
 So, you guys would choose Jae Yi?

326
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,550
 Yoo Na, you should just get help from Chairman Kang.

327
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,750
 Nothing is more important than Na Na's surgery right now.

328
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,820
 Then... how about we do this?

329
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,530
 I can be the solution to your problem, Yoo Na.

330
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,900
 You would no longer need his help, either, then.

331
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,580
 I share the same blood type with Na Na.

332
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,480
 I'm sorry to tell you this just now.

333
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,660
 I know what you're thinking about.

334
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:11,410
 You're trying to get an abortion and donate your liver to Na Na.

335
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,300
 You fool! Your baby isn't Song Je Hyeok's.

336
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,550
 It's completely yours.

337
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,580
 And you're saying you will abort it?

338
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,040
 Thank you... for saying that.

339
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,360
 But don't worry.

340
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,930
 I can give birth and donate my liver to Na Na, too.

341
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,330
 I already asked the doctor, too.

342
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,540
 Na Na will be okay even if she gets the surgery after I give birth.

343
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,130
 Really?

344
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,220
 Yoo Na.

345
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,750
 Na Na is my daughter, too.

346
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,620
 Do you think I wouldn't do that much for my daughter?

347
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,180
 Thank you, Yu Jeong.

348
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,520
 Thank you so much.

349
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,070
 What's this now? I feel guilty about Yu Jeong now.

350
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,830
 I'll make sure to pay back the money my mom took from Song Je Hyeok.

351
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,120
 - If I use her ledgers─
 - No.

352
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,490
 That's okay, too.

353
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,310
 If I close the foundation,

354
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,970
 I can pay back the investment money from Mariela Hotel.

355
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,430
 The only thing I'm worried about is the orphanage.

356
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:05,210
 We got taken advantage of by the disgusting club and I couldn't save the children.

357
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:14,010
 Guys, we should stay by Jae Yi's side for now.

358
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,850
 If we help each other little by little,

359
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,930
 we don't need to accept Chairman Kang's favor.

360
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,960
 Jae Yi, we need to talk.

361
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,400
 How could you guys?

362
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,890
 How could you guys do this to me?

363
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,030
Jae Yi, you must be really determined.

364
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,980
You can even predict the future now.

365
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,470
I can't believe he tested us just like you said he would.

366
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,070
We almost got caught if it were not for the secret ledger you gave me.

367
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,710
He was probably trying to find my weakness while testing you guys.

368
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,080
But are you okay?

369
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,370
Your reputation got ruined too much.

370
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:36,450
If someone has to reveal their true face, I have to be the first one.

371
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,930
Does Chairman Kang think we're completely on his side now?

372
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,400
I don't know.

373
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:56,160
But I'm still scared having you guys by my side.

374
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:03,740
Thinking about it, your lives became so difficult because of me.

375
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,720
I feel so bad because of that.

376
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,430
Don't get the wrong idea.

377
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,530
We didn't take revenge on Song Je Hyeok just for you.

378
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,080
It was for all of us.

379
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,470
But if you didn't initiate it, we wouldn't have been able to.

380
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,690
Revenge doesn't have to involve strangling or stabbing someone.

381
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:29,690
You kept pressuring and taunting him, and you went at it again when you failed.

382
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,290
And you ended up making them kill each other.

383
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:38,060
Thanks to you, we were able to take that revenge together.

384
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:45,710
Yes, if it were not for you, I still would've been that monster's wife.

385
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,120
Yoo Na couldn't have reunited with Na Na, either.

386
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,090
Hae Mi would've suffered from addiction, too.

387
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,540
You ended up saving all of us, Jae Yi.

388
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,090
Thank you for saying that.

389
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,900
Just focus on the future.

390
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,820
That's what's important.

391
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,440
You're right.

392
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,100
The real fight starts now.

393
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,840
Do you think we could succeed?

394
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,640
We have no choice. It's for our survival.

395
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,620
Let's consider this as putting on a mask.

396
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,760
A mask of betrayal.

397
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,960
 I have no idea.

398
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,040
 What did she say?

399
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,370
 It's none of your concern.

400
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,910
Yes, I knew it.

401
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,730
Looks like Do Jae Yi is trying to win her friends over.

402
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,010
Tell her to come up.

403
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,350
Jae Yi is here, apparently.

404
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,790
Pardon?

405
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:58,270
You made up your mind sooner than I expected.

406
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,830
Seeing my friends helped.

407
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,160
You saw your friends?

408
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,140
Yes.

409
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,740
I contacted them, but they ignored me.

410
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,140
So I went to Yu Jeong's house.

411
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,980
Looks like you told them about the new club, too.

412
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:28,880
I'll... try putting that mask on.

413
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,820
Since Kang Hoo died, my career got ruined

414
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:40,210
and if I don't even have friends now, I won't be able to go on.

415
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,410
Do you mean it?

416
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:53,320
What can I do to earn your trust?

417
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,170
Father.

418
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,700
I know it's hard to believe right now.

419
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,410
This situation is awkward for me, too.

420
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:19,130
But let's try working together

421
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,440
Yes. Let's do that, Jae Yi.

422
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,710
Yes.

423
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,670
Then, I'll get going.

424
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,520
- Secretary Choi.
 - Yes.

425
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,010
I didn't bring my car today.

426
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,980
Could you drive me back?

427
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,320
That's okay, right, Father?

428
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,280
Let's do that, then.

429
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm in your care from now on.

430
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,060
What would you like me to do?

431
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,600
Pardon?

432
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,750
How would you like me to kill you?

433
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:23,580
You killed Kang Hoo.

434
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,580
You will suffer much more terrible pain than what you inflicted on Kang Hoo.

435
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,590
I hope you look forward to it.

436
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,820
This is the place.

437
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,150
It's Secretary Choi's apartment.

438
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,640
I installed a spying chip in the smart security system.

439
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,660
We can control everything, including the entrance and the CCTV, from now on.

440
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,080
He must've installed a CCTV in the room because he wanted to protect something.

441
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,600
It's probably because of the safe.

442
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,930
I looked through the CCTV history and found a video of him opening the safe.

443
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:16,250
Secretary Choi doesn't seem to trust Kang Il Gu that much, either.

444
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,420
The knife he stabbed Kang Hoo with must be in there, too.

445
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:30,670
But that safe has a double lock system. It will be hard to open it.

446
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,120
Would it be necessary to open it ourselves?

447
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,970
We need to make him open it himself.

448
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:43,900
Do Jae Yi knew that I killed Choi Kang Hoo,

449
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,950
and she threatened me by saying she won't forgive me.

450
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,970
Jae Yi did?

451
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:55,300
Would she want to be on our side when we killed Choi Kang Hoo?

452
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,570
Don't worry.

453
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,570
You won't get hurt.

454
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,720
There's no way he would abandon me, right?

455
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,540
Have a safe trip.

456
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:41,020
I'm excited to be Emily Go again after all this time.

457
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,990
I didn't think Emily Go's passport would be useful like this.

458
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,330
Na Na will be okay while I'm gone, right?

459
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:55,290
Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.

460
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,250
Na Na. I'll go on a trip briefly.

461
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,750
Be a good girl while I'm gone, okay?

462
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,150
Where are you going, Ahjumma?

463
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,900
It's balloon flower root tea, which is supposed to be good for the lungs.

464
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,420
Thank you for being so caring.

465
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,650
But I'm disappointed.

466
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,500
I heard you're opening a new club.

467
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,570
I was so disappointed to hear that from Hae Mi.

468
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,100
But he still helped you out.

469
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,440
Also, you're not that honest, either.

470
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,680
You have the client ledger, too.

471
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,460
Do you still keep things like that around?

472
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,530
What else can I depend on? That's all I got.

473
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,430
But Yu Jeong ended up taking that from me.

474
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,010
Chairman Ju Yu Jeong?

475
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:01,040
She became sly since she lived as Song Je Hyeok's wife.

476
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,270
I said I can't give her the money, so she took that instead.

477
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:09,610
You know you're not supposed to trust people.

478
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,900
But why do you trust Secretary Choi so much?

479
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,330
The reason why I asked you to come here was

480
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:19,140
because I feel uncomfortable being at the hotel when he's around.

481
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,540
What happened?

482
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,960
 You know the Angel's Club, right?

483
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:30,060
 There's this one drug the principal gave me through the back door before they got caught.

484
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,960
Here. This was being sold at the Angel's Club, right?

485
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,700
How did you get this?

486
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:55,240
Secretary Choi has been smuggling drugs from the Angel's Club,

487
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,800
and I happened to get my hands on it.

488
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,640
Can you trust someone who deceives you behind your back?

489
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,050
I hope he only smuggled drugs.

490
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,610
You never know what else he has been smuggling.

491
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,930
Check Secretary Choi's bank account.

492
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,440
When you're suspicious of someone,

493
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,860
the first thing you need to check is their bank account.

494
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:38,920
If he contacted someone using my weakness, it will show.

495
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,590
I'm looking forward to it.

496
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,470
What did Do Jae Yi say?

497
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,120
- Sir.
 - Are you...

498
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,460
hiding something from me by chance?

499
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,050
Pardon?

500
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,520
There's no way you would betray me, right?

501
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,550
Sir.

502
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:20,090
I've been doing all sorts of dirty work for you.

503
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:25,970
To be honest, I still can't trust all of her friends.

504
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,510
Do Jae Yi met with the members of the Angel's Club.

505
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,000
Do you know what they talked about?

506
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,180
 What did Do Jae Yi say?

507
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:48,530
 She told me to tell the Prosecutors' Office that Chairman Kang is the owner of the Angel's Club.

508
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,510
 But what evidence is there?

509
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:55,390
 How did she end up getting Daesungak's ledger?

510
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,980
 She was threatening us using that.

511
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,310
Her friends gave her that weapon.

512
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:06,760
That means they're plotting together.

513
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,210
You need to trust me, sir.

514
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,700
 I checked Secretary Choi's bank account as you told me to.

515
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,720
 A significant amount of money was transferred to his bank account,

516
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,340
 from the bank account in Hong Kong created under Do Jae Yi's name.

517
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,600
 She told me to tell the prosecutors' office that Chairman Kang is the owner of the Angel's Club.

518
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,240
 You need to trust me, sir.

519
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,560
 I hope he only smuggled drugs.

520
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,800
 You never know what else he has been smuggling.

521
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,670
 What can I do to earn your trust?

522
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,250
 Father.

523
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,470
Take care of him.

524
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,050
Thank you for telling me first like this.

525
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:18,040
This is why I gave Jae Yi the ledger.

526
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,330
Would you like to hear more?

527
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,630
 For the ones who come to the opening,

528
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,610
 the ledgers created by Daesungak will be given as a gift.

529
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,920
 Please welcome me to the new club.

530
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:56,580
Looks like Jae Yi's finally in your arms.

531
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,440
 Are you happy now?

532
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,650
 Are you giving me my ledger now, Ms. Ju?

533
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,460
Yes, Yoo Na.

534
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,410
 Hey. I sent the money to Secretary Choi's account.

535
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,340
 By the way, you're rich.

536
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,140
 Can I spend some while I'm in Hong Kong?

537
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,020
Have a safe trip back.

538
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,680
 Okay. I'll be back tonight.

539
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,220
The things I've been worried about seem to have been resolved now.

540
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:03,460
We can finally start creating our world now.

541
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,780
Thank you for trusting me, Jae Yi.

542
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:13,600
Would you like to try the mask on?

543
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:20,940

544
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:26,980

545
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:32,940

546
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:38,920

547
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:45,410

548
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,590
It's all over now!

549
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:50,590
Your disgusting mask game.

550
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,540
Did you play me?

551
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:05,090
We've never been on your side.

552
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,710
That mask game is so childish!

553
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:11,370
Aren't you ashamed as a father?

554
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,360
It's all over.

555
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,280
I acquired evidence you can't escape from.

556
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,650
I even got it from that bastard whom you trusted so much.

557
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,460
Jae Yi.

558
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:32,830
What do you think you could prove with that evidence?

559
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,740
You still have a chance to hold my hand.

560
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:43,930
All you would have left are your friends who have nothing.

561
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,260
Will you be able to remove people's masks in this world?

562
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,830
At least I removed one mask.

563
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,360
The mask of yours.

564
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,430
Do you think I'd get defeated like this?

565
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:05,860
I told you. Power defeats the law.

566
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,360
 No matter how much you fight,

567
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,250
 there's no one in this country

568
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,210
 who could defeat me.

569
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:35,220
You're so foolish that you haven't learned that yet.

570
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,420

571
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,900
You have the right to remain silent.

572
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,010
You have the right to an attorney.

573
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,780
Goodbye.

574
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,740
Catch him!

575
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,890
 I'll kill him.

576
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,590
911! Call Emergency!

577
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,790
Chairman!

578
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,790
Chairman! Chairman!

579
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:36,480
Call 911! Hurry!

580
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,730
 Chairman Kang Il Gu, who was arrested for murder, instigation of murder,

581
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:47,830
 drug distribution, and concealment of criminal profits

582
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,220
 was killed by an assailant while he was

583
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,840
 being taken to the police station yesterday.

584
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,680
 Mr. Choi, the killer of Chairman Kang

585
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,570
 was arrested after being chased by the police.

586
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:02,800
 Mr. Choi has been Chairman Kang's right-hand man for over a decade.

587
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:08,020
 But he committed the crime because the relationship deteriorated recently.

588
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:38,360

589
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,700

590
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:49,290
♫  The one who holds me, who never had anyone  ♫

591
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:56,170
♫  A memory slipping through the gap between my fingers  ♫

592
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,150
Just cry.

593
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,630
You can cry now.

594
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,980
It's okay to cry, Noona.

595
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,340
Even I'm tearing up, too.

596
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,800
♫  I am looking for you more  ♫

597
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,740
No.

598
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,620
I won't cry now.

599
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,540
It will be hard to stop once it starts.

600
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:27,470
But...

601
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,950
if I get reminded of

602
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,850
Kang Hoo, in everyday life,

603
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,910
even a little...

604
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,930
Little by little,

605
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,330
I'll cry for him.

606
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:44,900
For a very long time.

607
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:49,520
♫  Yet you drift further away  ♫

608
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,240
♫  Within the gap of your heart  ♫

609
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,410
♫  I’m going to fill you completely  ♫

610
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:06,110
How's college life? Is it fun?

611
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:09,610
It's fun, but I feel impatient.

612
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,740
I want to graduate quickly and go to a law school.

613
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,050
You won't be able to do anything but study soon.

614
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:20,800
So you can enjoy yourself now.

615
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,580
She has a boyfriend, too.

616
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,180
Hey!

617
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,760
It's okay to have a boyfriend.

618
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,440
It should be someone nice, though.

619
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,510
He's really nice.

620
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,390
He always walks me home at night.

621
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,860
And he's handsome, too.

622
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:47,300
How's the apartment? Do you like it?

623
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,610
Yes, thanks to you, I was able to get a nice place.

624
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,620
Thank you.

625
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,170
Attorney Do.

626
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:03,710
For the first time in my life, I have hope.

627
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:08,040
If I work hard like now, I'd be able to achieve my dream,

628
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:12,130
and I'd be able to get leg surgery for Ye Ji, too.

629
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:19,060
Thank you for letting me have hopes like that.

630
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,600
I'll work really hard.

631
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:27,570
I'll make sure to become a great lawyer like you.

632
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,440
You can't become a lawyer like me.

633
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,680
You have to become an even better one.

634
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,270
I believe you could do that, Yeon Ah.

635
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,540
I have something for you.

636
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,680

637
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,210
Chicken stock?

638
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,630
You have to cook since you live alone.

639
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:06,640
With that, you can make everything, including pasta, tteokbokki, and bulgogi.

640
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,150
It will make things pretty flavorful.

641
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:13,890
How do you know how to make stuff like this?

642
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:21,390
Someone very precious taught me.

643
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,400
Anyway, you have to use it quickly because it's homemade.

644
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,290
Unni, I want tteokbokki!

645
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,020
Okay.

646
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,950
How pretty.

647
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,960
My Na Na is so, so pretty.

648
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,300
Should we go now?

649
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,000
Hold on. I need to do something before we go.

650
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,230
I have to put this on before I go out.

651
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,030
I want to look as pretty as you since we're going out together.

652
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:15,530
I'll put it on quickly.

653
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,700
You look pretty.

654
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,720
Hold on.

655
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,150
I don't think I'm as pretty as you yet.

656
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:29,540
I should put on a little more. Do you want some, too?

657
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,170
Here.

658
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,070
What do you think? Does my skin look as nice as yours?

659
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,680
Yes!

660
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,350
Wow, you're so good at taking medicine, too.

661
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,990
You're such a sweetie!

662
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,090
When we go to the hospital next week,

663
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:53,360
I should say a lot of nice things about you to the doctor.

664
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,700
You know you're joining the swimming class at kindergarten next week, right?

665
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,970
I'm afraid of water.

666
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,640
That just shows you have become healthy enough.

667
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,420
Don't worry. I'll come with you to the pool.

668
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:14,200
Thank you, Mom!

669
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,000
Na Na.

670
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,310
What did you just call me?

671
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,730
I called you Mom.

672
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:40,580
How...

673
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:46,170
How did you know I was your mom?

674
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,040
You just seem like a mom.

675
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,170
Yes.

676
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,230
You're right.

677
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:06,600
I'm your mom.

678
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:14,210
Thank you for... calling me mom, Na Na.

679
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,540
Thank you so much!

680
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,550

681
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:37,090
You're finally eating since I'm treating you to something proper.

682
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:41,450
- Sir! A plate of wagyu, please.
 - Okay.

683
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:45,030
I have so much appetite because it's fresh and tasty.

684
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,600
I know how hard it is to quit drugs.

685
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,600
So you should eat a lot of tasty food and cheer up!

686
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,220
Noona, I thought...

687
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,620
you were cool when you became the vice president of Mariela Hotel,

688
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,110
but you're just as cool now.

689
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:06,300
You bravely turned yourself in and followed the rehabilitation program well, too.

690
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,570
You're so strong!

691
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,310
So cool.

692
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,050
We should've brought Mother-in-law, too.

693
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:20,570
I heard she doesn't go out and stays home.

694
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:24,790
Why don't we bring her some, since she loves sushi?

695
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:28,280
She's protesting because she's mad at me.

696
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:31,950
She must be sad because she had to close Daesungak.

697
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:35,710
She devoted herself to that place her whole life.

698
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:40,770
What else could she do? She even gave the police the client ledger.

699
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:45,500
She managed to get out on parole because there were extenuating circumstances.

700
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,410
But who would come to a bar that reveals all the customers' secrets?

701
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:53,880
Wow, I suddenly feel so burdened.

702
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,000
Noona, we really have to become successful for her.

703
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,810
Don't worry!

704
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,440
I told you to just count on me!

705
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,030
I've always been counting on you.

706
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,930
Let's eat. We need to go to work soon.

707
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:09,370
Right! We won't have time to eat later. Hurry!

708
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,900
Isn't it good?

709
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:20,570

710
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:31,190
Mom, don't worry.

711
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:34,120
Traditional bars are out of style now.

712
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:38,910
Look, isn't it cool? Hotel Daesungak!

713
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:44,370
You're making me live my dream again.

714
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,930
This isn't a hotel.

715
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:51,550
It's a joke compared to the hotel you worked for.

716
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:55,130
Mom! You don't get truly healed by the size of something.

717
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:57,020
This is a trendy spot now!

718
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:02,430
The customers are posting pictures of your garden on social media because it's so pretty!

719
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,870
It's all thanks to you.

720
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,980
Thank you.

721
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,390
What's the point of that?

722
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:11,850
You foolishly let your friend have a birthday party for her baby here.

723
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:14,320
Do you think I let her use it for free?

724
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,590
I'm the one who suggested having the party here!

725
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:20,510
We need as many customers as possible. What are you saying?

726
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,180
I'll become rich quickly and

727
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:26,430
treat you with the best service.

728
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:30,040
Geez, stop! Get rid of your old habit!

729
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,020
You don't work in that industry anymore.

730
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:35,000
You can't be rude to Leo from now on anymore.

731
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
He's the general manager of Hotel Daesungak!

732
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:46,190
Oh! You came!

733
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:48,870
Hey! Welcome!

734
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,600
Na Na!

735
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,380
Aigoo, sweetheart!

736
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,970
You dressed like a princess!

737
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,840
Noona.

738
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,970
I'll take one now.

739
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:07,970
- Look over here!
 - Mi Ra, over there.

740
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:10,320
One, two!

741
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,960
One, two.

742
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,030
Look at me, Mi Ra. Should we smile?

743
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,860
- So pretty!
 - Yes! Smile!

744
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,930
How come she's so sweet?

745
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,020
Has it been about six months since Na Na got surgery?

746
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,680
Yes, I'm strong now!

747
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,330
Is that so?

748
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,900
Na Na must be happy.

749
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,300
You have two moms who are willing to give you anything.

750
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,290
You should have a baby to give everything to, too!

751
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:42,600
You've been married for so long. How come there's no good news yet?

752
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,800
Leo, do you possibly have an issue?

753
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,120
Me? You're kidding, right?

754
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,400
Noona, tell her! She doesn't know how strong I am.

755
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,700
- Stop that! Sit!
 - Why don't you tell me?

756
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,640
Don't exaggerate! Sit down!

757
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:00,760
Guys, let me join you!

758
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,430
Go Yoo Na, why don't you tell us now?

759
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:07,360
How did you let Yu Jeong get Chunsarang Orphanage back?

760
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,740
Where did you get that much money?

761
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,020
Well, I just used my talent a bit.

762
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,260
 Emily Go.

763
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,420
 How dare you lie to me?

764
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,410
Anyway, you're extremely talented.

765
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:33,270
You're able to get money or land from people.

766
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:37,260
Attorney Do, I just got a phone call.

767
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:40,710
It looks like the victim is hesitant to file a lawsuit.

768
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:42,880
I guess the perpetrator threatened her.

769
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,120
Is that so? I'll talk to her myself.

770
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,350
She can't give up because of a threat like that.

771
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,340
Yong Pil, why don't you sit, too? Have some food.

772
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,540
Yes.

773
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:00,280
Yong Pil, can I offer you a job?

774
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,010
I can pay you a lot more than Jae Yi.

775
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:07,380
It's okay. I'll just stay by Attorney Do's side.

776
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,430
Guys! Mi Ra will pick an object soon. Come here!

777
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:15,800
Come on over! See which object she picks!

778
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,530
- Mi Ra!
 - Which one will she pick?

779
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,470
Aigoo, so pretty!

780
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,590
This one, this one!

781
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,900
Look at this! It's a gavel!

782
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:33,300
Mi Ra! What's this?

783
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:36,420
It's not too late.

784
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:38,540
Just muster up the courage.

785
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,290
I'll take care of everything else.

786
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:44,800
How about this? Mi Ra!

787
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:52,350
She'll become a judge!

788
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,880
What's this?

789
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,240
 Kang Hoo.

790
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,170
 I think it's finally here for me, too.

791
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,390
Mi Ra will become a singer!

792
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:21,590
 The days on which I feel so happy,

793
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:25,450
 because nothing suffocates me,

794
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,350
 and I feel so comfortable and relaxed.

795
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:37,940
 Of course, the hard days will come, too.

796
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:43,410
 But I believe,

797
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:46,750
 that if you have the courage to speak the truth,

798
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:50,920
 you can win in the end.

799
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,010
- Jae Yi! 
 - Noona Jae Yi!

800
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:54,370
Come here! Let's take a picture!

801
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:57,400
Jae Yi, let's take a picture with Mi Ra.

802
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:09,510
 I'm thinking of fighting again.

803
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:15,590
 I'll fight to take off all the ugly masks in the world.

804
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,880
 I can do it.

805
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,800
 As long as I have these friends who love and support me.

806
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:43,550
The four friends look great. Should we take one with just the four of you?

807
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:46,350
- Should we? It's been a while!
 - Yes, yes!

808
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,380
 We're finally complete.

809
01:11:55,230 --> 01:12:00,370
The four friends! One, two, three!

810
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:07,910
 And our friendship will continue in the future.

811

812

 ~ Outtakes ~  
I'm here. Let me try lifting you.

820
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,100
- You can't, you can't!
 - Why not?

821
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,370
- You can't!
 - I just worked out!

822
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,540
Are you here?

823
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:50,400
Geez, I'm sorry. Okay, okay!

824
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,140
I'll build a better orphanage somewhere else.

825
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,880
I promise, okay?

826
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,680
Am I playing her son? Is she my mom?

827
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,160
Your boss is done for now.

828
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,560
So put that down and...

829
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,440
Aigoo, that was too slow.

830
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,320
Thank you so much for enjoying Queen of Masks.

831
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,100
We've been working hard all this time.

832
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:15,170
I'm so happy that we finished things well.

833
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:21,100
The atmosphere at the set was warmer than expected.

834
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:25,720
There was good chemistry among the cast. I think we had a lot of fun.

835
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,520
Thank you so much for enjoying our show.

836
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,970
We'll come back with good projects again. Thank you!

837
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:41,810

838
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:47,970
