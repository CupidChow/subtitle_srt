"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

2
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,370
Even though there are a ton of
delinquents and ex-delinquents...

3
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,250
this BL world is famous
for having almost no bad endings.

4
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,960
It looks like gang fights
still happen, though.

5
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,530
Hold it!

6
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,590
Back off.

7
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,640
You wanna try something?

8
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,990
Let's let our bosses handle this.

9
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,890
It's Toru-san from East High.

10
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,470
Yeah.

11
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,340
You West High scumbags
need to know your place.

12
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,900
Hey.

13
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,550
Ah!

14
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,210
This is bad.

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
Get him!

16
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,550
Punch him in the face!

17
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,340
- Go get him!
- Take him down!

18
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,740
Hit him, hit him!

19
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,810
You punk!

20
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,960
That's enough!

21
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,880
A few days later...

22
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,010
I'd end up running into
these delinquents again...

23
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,380
in the most unexpected place.

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,730
(Episode 7: VS The Rumble)

25
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,580
Want another bite?

26
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,770
Hmm?

27
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Hey.

28
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,406
Are you sure no one followed
us? We weren't seen, right?

29
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,479
Shut up.

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,246
If you're that worried, why
don't you just go home?

31
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,800
I never said I was leaving.

32
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,590
Just think about it.

33
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,250
You, the leader of West High...

34
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,230
and me, the leader of East High...

35
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
if word got out that
we're actually dating...

36
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,980
imagine the chaos.

37
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,950
Exactly.

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,170
Two opposing sides...

39
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,410
falling in love.

40
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,790
This is the epitome of that trope.

41
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,710
The love between two
delinquent gang leaders.

42
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,420
You've got a little something here.

43
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,090
Underneath this grand charade...

44
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,570
the fights are kept from escalating.

45
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,690
And thus, peace is
maintained in this world of BL.

46
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,630
That's right.

47
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,270
Love can save the world.

48
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,750
I'm home.

49
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,430
By the way, they just mentioned...

50
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,290
West High and East High.

51
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,450
Could there be delinquent gangs
at Ayato's school too?

52
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,800
Whatever's going on at his school...

53
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,970
could end up affecting me.

54
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,850
I'd better ask him about it first.

55
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,750
- Wah!
- Whoa, you scared me.

56
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,000
What is it?

57
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,110
Are there any delinquents at your school?

58
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,490
My school?

59
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,470
Hmm... There are some
guys who look the part.

60
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,890
There are?

61
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,510
But they don't really fight.

62
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,140
Besides, the biggest power at our school...

63
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,230
is Tojo's fan club.

64
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,280
So he rules the school with
his overwhelming popularity?

65
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,270
That's Tojo for you.

66
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,470
Scary.

67
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,300
As for me...

68
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,539
there aren't really delinquents
or brawls among college students.

69
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,620
It's peaceful.

70
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,400
Hmm... Which coffee should I get...

71
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,430
Just as I was thinking that...

72
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,550
If you're not going to pick, get lost.

73
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,830
Ah.

74
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,630
You're in the way.

75
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,800
Why is he picking on me?

76
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,750
I have no idea. It's so annoying.

77
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,700
So...

78
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,170
You...

79
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,760
You want to fight?

80
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,950
Bring it on.

81
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,520
You...

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,840
Don't you look down on me.

83
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,770
Things were about to escalate into a fight.

84
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,159
But if I were to talk back here...

85
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,480
I'd raise a major flag.

86
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Therefore...

87
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,839
this way...

88
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,070
ignoring him is the safest bet.

89
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,730
But...

90
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,790
Hey.

91
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,290
Don't ignore me.

92
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,990
Hey.

93
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,710
You looking down on me?

94
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,930
If I ignore him...

95
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,450
he might get even angrier.

96
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,710
And that would just raise another flag.

97
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,570
So...

98
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,130
the proper course of
action for a mob character is...

99
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,330
This.

100
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,670
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

101
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,380
Say something, huh?

102
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,590
Haha... Oh...

103
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,240
Bye...

104
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:35,201
To genuinely and honestly
act completely baffled.

105
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,410
But...

106
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,079
Hey, you okay?

107
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,300
No, I'm not really sure
what's going on, but...

108
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,860
It's that guy again.

109
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,770
Let's go.

110
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,060
Yeah.

111
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,430
Looks like I'm completely on his radar now.

112
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,710
That was just a temporary solution.

113
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,450
Uh...

114
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,100
Where's the fried chicken set meal...

115
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,420
If you're not choosing, hurry
up and get out of the way.

116
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,340
You're in the way.

117
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,060
Tch, you fall from just that?

118
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,870
But when I keep getting
picked on like this...

119
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,670
someone like this is bound to show up...

120
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,160
Hey, wait a minute.

121
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,820
You.

122
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,130
You've been messing
with him this whole time.

123
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,770
Don't you think that's enough?

124
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,420
Huh?

125
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,040
I don't know what your problem is...

126
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,120
but you're being pathetic.

127
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
What did you say?

128
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,270
You want a piece of me?

129
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,090
Take it outside.

130
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
Let's go.

131
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Are you scared?

132
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,130
And there it is.

133
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,930
A weak mob character...

134
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,270
and a hero who stands up for justice.

135
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,970
It's pretty obvious who's
going to get the flag.

136
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,630
I wish you both happiness.

137
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,780
Then, a few days later...

138
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,950
Hey.

139
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,306
Apparently, the guy his
ex-girlfriend cheated on him with...

140
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,670
looks a lot like you.

141
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,660
So he got you mixed up
and kept messing with you.

142
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Huh?

143
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Hey.

144
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,290
Go on, apologize.

145
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,430
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,170
Apologize properly.

147
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,340
I am truly sorry.

148
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,640
All you can do in these situations
is smile and forgive, right?

149
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,320
Haha, it's all good.

150
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Thank you.

151
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,220
That's great.

152
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Are you leaving?

153
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Thank you.

154
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
Thank you so much.

155
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,750
Ah.

156
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,110
Let's go.

157
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Okay.

158
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,570
Where do you want to go?

159
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:09,730
I want something sweet.

160
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,490
- Let's get sundaes then.
- Okay.

161
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,790
Man, I never thought I'd get
caught up in something like that.

162
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,509
Everyone, please be careful.

163
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,230
Don't get dragged into
other people's fights.

164
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:36,530
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

165
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,210
If you see a pretty
girl, assume it's a guy.

166
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,660
While killing time in the
cafeteria before my next class...

167
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,720
I overheard this conversation.

168
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Huh?

169
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,410
You're going to meet someone
you met in an online game?

170
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,170
That's totally normal these days.

171
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Besides,

172
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,700
she's a girl our age.

173
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,800
I've heard that recently...

174
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,200
it's become common to meet people
through dating apps and stuff.

175
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,080
But, to cut to the chase...

176
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,480
that's a dangerous move.

177
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,490
Because this is...

178
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,200
a world of BL where men
pairing up with men is the norm.

179
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Bye-bye.

180
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,520
This is the cat cafe, Cat Mate.

181
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,160
To sum it up in one sentence:

182
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,970
"If you see a pretty
girl, assume it's a guy."

183
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,240
the online version.

184
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,090
Online, you can't see the person...

185
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,010
so the difficulty of pretending
to be a girl is much lower.

186
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,330
So, when are you planning to meet?

187
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,640
This weekend.

188
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,860
I see.
Well, you have to tell me what she's like.

189
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,870
Of course.

190
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,950
Mhm.

191
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
I wonder...

192
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,930
how this will turn out.

193
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,040
(Episode 8: VS The Match-Up)

194
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
And then...

195
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
the following week.

196
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,000
This is pretty addictive.

197
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,990
Ah.

198
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,150
Hey, hey.

199
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,600
Hey, you've got to hear this.

200
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,930
So this guy...

201
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:43,310
He arranged to meet a girl
he met in an online game.

202
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,840
- But when he got there...
- Hey, don't say it.

203
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,070
Apparently, a guy showed up.

204
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,670
- Hey, I told you not to tell him!
- What's the big deal?

205
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,550
Not sure why he felt
the need to tell me this...

206
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,360
Anyway, let's see what
kind of person this was.

207
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
Koga-san~

208
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,620
Koga-san~

209
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,760
Koga-san~

210
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,130
Koga-san~

211
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,830
I heard the guy was a total beefcake.

212
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,530
Here you go.

213
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,090
Here's the bento I promised you.

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,430
Aah~

215
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,530
Ah~

216
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,820
I hope you like it.

217
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Mmm.

218
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm so glad.

219
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,600
This tank top...

220
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,060
I knitted it myself.

221
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,950
Oh, really?

222
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,760
So cute.

223
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
So cute.

224
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
Want some more?

225
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,280
You're just so adorable~

226
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,630
Online, he always used polite language.

227
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,890
And his tone was so gentle.

228
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,780
He seemed like a homebody,

229
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,450
and even said he was shy.

230
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,200
Anyone would've gotten the wrong idea.

231
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
Mmm...

232
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,236
Whether it's a polite beefcake,

233
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,830
a domestic beefcake, or a shy beefcake,

234
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,240
they're all pretty common in this world.

235
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Oh, right.

236
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,230
Look at this.

237
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,160
This is the guy's username.

238
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,420
How do you read this?

239
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,500
Yumehoshi Ichigohime Ai.

240
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,010
With a sparkly name like that,

241
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,490
anyone would assume it was a cute girl.

242
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,800
Right?

243
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,440
Mmm... I guess so...

244
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,910
Come on, you shouldn't meet up with someone
with a name that intense.

245
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,560
Crap, I gotta get to class.

246
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,930
- See you later.
- Yeah.

247
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
And so...

248
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,350
As for me...

249
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,220
I got more and more addicted.

250
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,030
I just couldn't quit.

251
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,410
I couldn't stop.

252
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,860
As a result...

253
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,480
it had to be all those soggy fries.

254
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,890
I gained weight.

255
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,480
This won't do.

256
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,730
I'll choose this female trainer.

257
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,470
Um...

258
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,010
Ah, good evening.

259
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,070
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

260
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,350
It's over there.

261
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Come on in.

262
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,540
Hello.

263
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,770
I'm the trainer,

264
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,280
Saotome Hitomi.

265
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,390
Huh...?

266
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,470
Sorry.

267
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Did I startle you?

268
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,870
You see,

269
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm often told my name sounds feminine.

270
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,910
Alright, let's get started.

271
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Hup.

272
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,589
Even if this is a BL world,

273
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,659
and there are a lot of androgynous names,

274
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,180
this is taking it too far.

275
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Alright.

276
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's begin.

277
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,556
So, what part of your body
do you want to work on?

278
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,580
Uh...

279
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,850
Um...

280
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,020
- It's this area, isn't it?
- Ah... yes...

281
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,260
Leave it to me.

282
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,610
I'll shape you into your ideal body.

283
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Because...

284
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
Because...?

285
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
You,

286
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,310
aside from that little belly,

287
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,470
are exactly my type.

288
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
What do I do?

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,470
How do I avoid this flag?

290
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,050
What do I do?

291
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,280
What should I do, Mob Character A?

292
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,550
I've got it!

293
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,370
Thank you very much.

294
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
You...

295
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,699
It seems that even without me,

296
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,140
you can train just fine on your own.

297
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,350
Yes.

298
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,640
You... don't need me, do you?

299
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,450
Anyway,

300
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,399
Operation: Evade the Flag
with an Insane Workout...

301
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,530
was a complete success.

302
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,420
As expected of me.

303
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,960
Oh, you're back.

304
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
I overdid it.

305
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:32,510
Huh?

306
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,790
Eh?

307
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,570
Aaaah!
Wait, Brother, what happened to you?!

308
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,590
Are you okay?!

309
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,950
Sigh. I know they make me fat,

310
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,630
but I just can't quit soggy fries.

311
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,550
Soggy is the best.

312
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,890
Bye-bye.

313
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,800
(Next Episode)
Next on A Man Who Defies the World of BL...

314
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,119
When a guy with glasses takes them off

315
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,700
and turns out to be super hot...

316
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,066
You know that's what's going to happen.

317
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,900
Next time on
A Man Who Defies the World of BL,

318
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,059
a double feature: "VS Christmas" and
"VS Accidentally Falling Asleep Returns."

319
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,240
Don't miss it!
