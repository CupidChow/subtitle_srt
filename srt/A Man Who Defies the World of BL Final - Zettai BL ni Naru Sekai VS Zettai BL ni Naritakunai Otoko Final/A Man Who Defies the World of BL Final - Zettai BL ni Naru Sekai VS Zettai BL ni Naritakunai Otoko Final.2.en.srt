00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,000
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

2
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,990
Another perfectly ordinary day.

3
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,660
And that's just fine by me.

4
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,940
This is kind of sudden, but...

5
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,650
My little brother is a real pain.

6
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,220
After a get-together with my college friends,

7
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,820
I just got home.

8
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,880
But man, that ramen place was the best.

9
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,530
For some reason,

10
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,520
my dopey-looking little brother
is passed out in my room.

11
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,600
Judging by the scene,

12
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,870
chances are...

13
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,280
Ayato...

14
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,540
must've snuck into my room to borrow my glue stick.

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,700
Where is it?

16
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,500
Found it, found it.

17
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,570
Big bro, I'm borrowing this.

18
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,860
Huh?

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,870
Whoa, what a throwback.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
This is so good!

21
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,330
And that's when...

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,390
he found a manga that caught his eye.

23
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,700
Look.

24
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,540
This is the classic.

25
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,320
Then he read while tossing the books all over the place.

26
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,750
And finally, he just fell asleep reading.

27
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,220
Anyway, let me say it again.

28
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,650
I want to sleep now, so my little brother is in the way.

29
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,520
Besides, this guy...

30
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,680
Like this.

31
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,540
Once he's asleep,
you can't wake him up no matter what you do.

32
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,490
Ow, that really hurts.

33
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,050
Hmm?

34
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,320
Did I mishear that?

35
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,240
(Episode 3: VS The Accidental Nap)

36
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,700
In that case,

37
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,980
there's only one thing to do.

38
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,050
Hup.

39
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,970
I can't be bothered to drag him back to his room.

40
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm tempted to just dump him in the hallway...

41
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Hup.

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Mmm.

43
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,570
Mission accomplished.

44
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,980
Man, that was exhausting.

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,950
Carrying an unconscious person...

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,160
is way more work than you'd think.

47
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,000
Alright...

48
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,440
Time for bed.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh?

50
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,490
What a throwback.

51
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,090
Whoa, so good.

52
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,990
This guy took my manga from my room.

53
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Hey.

54
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,920
Big bro, wake up.

55
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,910
Don't just barge into someone's room

56
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,670
and fall asleep, okay?

57
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
That's not it.

58
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,110
But, chances are...

59
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,550
you came into my room to borrow something,

60
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,850
found a manga that caught your eye,

61
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,930
and then read while tossing the books everywhere,

62
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,270
before falling asleep, right?

63
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
So,

64
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
your...

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Oh, my.

66
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,730
You two slept together?

67
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,460
You brothers are so close.

68
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,880
It's nice to have a brother.

69
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,150
Such good kids.

70
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,020
That's...

71
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,650
Don't take any more.

72
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,590
I can't believe I accidentally fell asleep too.

73
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,740
Maybe I slept too well.

74
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,400
Somehow, today's meal tastes especially good.

75
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
Kuroki.

76
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,400
Are you kidding me?

77
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,080
Why did you suddenly show up at my place yesterday?

78
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Ah.

79
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,540
No.

80
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,760
When I woke up, you'd already ditched me

81
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,640
and disappeared.

82
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,490
That's pretty cold.

83
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,600
Huh?

84
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,380
That's a harsh way to put it.

85
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,970
Huh?

86
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,390
While you were asleep, Kyohei,

87
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,350
I washed you up in the bathroom.

88
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
What?

89
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,810
Washing an unconscious person...

90
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,220
That must've taken some serious strength.

91
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,710
You... You think that makes everything okay?

92
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,450
Look.

93
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,560
We smell the same now.

94
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Let's go.

95
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,300
What is this plot twist...

96
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,130
For example,

97
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,400
whether Japan's economy as a whole is good or bad.

98
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Oh no...

99
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,400
I ate too much for lunch.

100
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,240
Of all the times,

101
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,500
with his low, baritone voice luring me into a sweet slumber,

102
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,450
it's Professor Matsuda's economics class.

103
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,850
In contrast, microeconomics is

104
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,840
the study of how individual actions and decisions are made.

105
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,630
For example,

106
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,580
Oh no...

107
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,050
I'm going to fall asleep if this keeps up.

108
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,750
Since my little brother has a boyfriend,

109
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,000
it didn't turn into a BL situation.

110
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,380
But "falling asleep" is a BL flag in itself.

111
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,500
Oh no...

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Huh?

113
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Ah...

114
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
You're awake.

115
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,790
Professor.

116
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,470
You looked so peaceful sleeping,

117
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,410
I didn't have the heart to wake you.

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,770
It's quite alright.

120
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,870
If you don't mind,

121
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,660
how about I give you a special lesson now?

122
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,940
In my room.

123
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,960
Could this be...

124
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,220
the "professor and student"

125
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,660
forbidden BL plotline beginning?

126
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
What do you say?

127
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
What should I do?

128
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,310
What should I do?

129
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,750
What should I do?

130
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,080
What am I going to do?

131
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,910
This is the moment it comes in handy.

132
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,480
Stabilize the economy,

133
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,890
or solve unemployment,

134
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,600
inflation, and other issues.

135
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,020
Huh? Is that... my voice?

136
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,940
In contrast,

137
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,030
I knew this might happen,

138
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,280
so I recorded your lecture.

139
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,540
I see...

140
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,310
I'll review the lecture when I get home.

141
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
So, if you'll excuse me.

142
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,030
Ah... Wait.

143
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,820
And so, having escaped a BL development,

144
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,970
I'm home.

145
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,360
I went home to review the lecture,

146
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,710
or at least, that was the plan...

147
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,240
Regarding the differences
between microeconomics and macroeconomics,

148
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,020
first, macroeconomics is...

149
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,510
from a broad perspective,

150
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,750
the study of economic trends of a country or the world.

151
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,280
For example, whether Japan's economy
as a whole is good or bad...

152
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Everyone,

153
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,850
be very careful not to fall asleep in class.

154
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,880
And don't fall asleep while studying, either.

155
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:10,460
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

156
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
After-School Tutoring Session.

157
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,550
Three Questions Per Person.

158
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,030
I'm off.

159
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,540
So annoying.

160
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,750
Why do we have to leave together?

161
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,950
The very sight of me with you...

162
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,200
What if people see us again?

163
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,580
Here, your lunch.

164
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,760
- Thanks.
- So you're just going to pretend you don't know me again?

165
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,350
They'll find out sooner or later anyway.

166
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,640
Oh, right.

167
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,740
I'm going to Tojo's tutoring session today.

168
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,780
Tell them I'll be home late.

169
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,870
Tutoring session?

170
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,150
Yeah.

171
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,050
What a suggestive phrase.

172
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,160
Which means...

173
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,830
Open your textbooks.

174
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,410
Alright, then...

175
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Let's begin.

176
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,780
It must be something like that.

177
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,790
Oh, Tojo's hair.

178
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,340
It's not that color anymore.

179
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,890
Oh... is that right?

180
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:57,940
Seriously...

181
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,070
Stop letting your imagination run wild.

182
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,810
Oh.

183
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
Sorry.

184
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,270
By the way...

185
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,690
How did you know what I was imagining?

186
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,930
So, that tutoring thing...

187
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,640
Hmm?

188
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,520
Oh.

189
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,120
Yanagi, Minami, and I all bombed our midterms.

190
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,140
So we decided to ask Tojo to help us study.

191
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,500
- Uh-huh.
- Then word got out,

192
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,300
and everyone was like, "Me too, me too!"

193
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,910
So in the end, in a classroom after school,

194
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,940
the Tojo cram school opened.

195
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,830
Tojo cram school...?

196
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,730
Your Group Tutoring Session After School.

197
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,610
Let's get started now, but...

198
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,250
the rule for questions is...

199
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,060
a maximum of three per person.

200
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,890
Got it?

201
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,460
Yeah!

202
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,250
I like you.

203
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,670
Please go out with me.

204
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,200
Tojo... you might as well ask them to pay you tuition.

205
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,650
I already told you.

206
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,370
Tojo doesn't even wear glasses.

207
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,690
Wait, how can you see the fantasies inside my head?

208
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,370
Then, can you tell Mom and Dad I'll be home late?

209
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,660
A study session?

210
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,520
I wonder how this is going to turn out.

211
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,520
(Episode 4: Vs. The Study Group)

212
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Alright, everyone.

213
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,460
That's it for today's class.

214
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,790
The exam is next week.

215
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,310
So make sure you all study hard.

216
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,470
An exam...?

217
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,550
What's this?

218
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,520
Why is my notebook completely blank?

219
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,280
Ah...

220
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,980
I've been so busy trying to dodge BL flags
and running simulations every day...

221
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,810
that I haven't been paying attention in class at all.

222
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,580
At this rate, I'm definitely going to fail.

223
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,570
I'll...

224
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,880
be a sophomore again next year.

225
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,790
And the year after that, still a sophomore.

226
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,200
And for every year after that!

227
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What do I do?

228
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
What do I do?

229
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,740
What do I do?

230
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,410
Everyone...

231
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,670
May I have your attention?

232
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,160
Huh? Who's that guy?

233
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,790
That's Saionji, the most brilliant student
since this school was founded.

234
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,670
That's...

235
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,890
purple sage, a symbol of wisdom and respect.

236
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,860
I'm hosting a study group at my place tonight.

237
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,670
Anyone interested in coming?

238
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,000
- I'll go!
- Me too! Please teach me!

239
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,390
To escape the fate of being held back...

240
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,070
Should I go?

241
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,530
Should I go?

242
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,990
Should I go or not?

243
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,200
They both said they're going to a study group today,
so they'll be back late.

244
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,340
- A study group?
- Yep.

245
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,430
I see.

246
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,900
It's nice to see young people working hard.

247
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,130
This is insane!

248
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,690
It's incredible.

249
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,610
It's huge!

250
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,320
I thought he lived alone, but...

251
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,070
- There's a bronze statue.
- Why is there a bronze statue?

252
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,050
He even has a bronze statue.

253
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,970
No one's home today.

254
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,380
So everyone, please make yourselves comfortable.

255
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
Awesome!

256
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,430
What is going on?

257
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,390
Is he a genius and a rich kid?

258
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,730
This guy has to be
a main character in this BL world.

259
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,500
But it's fine.

260
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,870
With so many people here...

261
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,180
I just have to act like a background character.

262
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,090
If I stick to my role as a nobody,
I won't trigger any flags.

263
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,030
Okay, let's start the study group.

264
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,710
Okay, thank you.

265
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,490
I'll start by explaining the basic concepts.

266
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,220
Okay.

267
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,110
What normal person has a whiteboard in their house?

268
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,060
- The material on page 45...
- Is this guy the study group master or something?

269
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
First,

270
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,570
In short...

271
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:57,910
just remember that "the difference in perceived value
to consumers is the source of gains from trade."

272
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,800
And you'll have no problem with the exam.

273
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,660
Oh, I see.

274
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,790
I totally get it now.

275
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,200
Well... I have work, so I'm gonna head out.

276
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:06,930
Okay...

277
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,460
- Take care.
- Me too...

278
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,190
Thanks for teaching us.

279
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Take care.

280
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,850
You're a really good teacher.

281
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
Thanks.

282
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,530
Well, I live pretty far, so I'm heading home.

283
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,660
- Take care.
- You too, thank you.

284
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,940
Yeah.

285
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,330
Take care.

286
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,210
And then...

287
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,760
before I knew it,

288
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,390
Alright.

289
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Well...

290
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,860
I should probably get going too...

291
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,340
Huh?

292
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,770
You're leaving...?

293
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,590
I'm so tired of eating alone.

294
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Here you go.

295
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,380
What about your parents?

296
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,670
They're abroad.

297
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,050
They haven't been back for six months.

298
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,410
Ever since I was a kid...

299
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,820
it's always been like this.

300
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,520
I'm always alone.

301
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,090
So...

302
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,910
to get my parents to pay attention to me...

303
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,130
I studied like my life depended on it.

304
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,150
But...

305
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,790
my parents don't care about me at all...

306
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,640
They're only passionate about their own work.

307
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,210
This whole sob story...

308
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,990
feels like it's going to take a while.

309
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,550
I really have to pee right now.

310
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,420
But I can't leave.

311
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,370
If my parents wouldn't...

312
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,240
I hoped my classmates would care about me.

313
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,660
That's why I...

314
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,880
host these study groups from time to time.

315
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,890
But,

316
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,530
everyone just comes to me for help with schoolwork...

317
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,820
No one cares about me as a person.

318
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
I'm...

319
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,650
still all alone in the end.

320
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,620
You...

321
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,910
You have such kind eyes.

322
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,740
Huh?

323
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,060
You...

324
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,300
You won't leave me all alone, will you?

325
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
What do I do?

326
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,870
What do I do?

327
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
What do I do?

328
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,330
What do I do, Mob Character A?

329
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,340
Huh?

330
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,800
We have guests?

331
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Huh?

332
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,410
Why are you guys back?

333
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Dad...

334
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,930
Mom...

335
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,900
What do you mean, "why"?

336
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,740
Because today...

337
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,590
is your 20th birthday.

338
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,370
You remembered...

339
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,710
Happy birthday.

340
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,110
Happy birthday~

341
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,000
Dad... Mom...

342
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,560
- What's wrong?
- I think he's crying.

343
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,580
Big boys don't cry.

344
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,890
- Because...
- Oh, honestly.

345
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,520
Anyway...

346
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,020
thanks to the surprise return of his parents,

347
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,520
I narrowly avoided it turning into a BL situation.

348
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,430
But the problem is...

349
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,570
Ah...

350
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,630
I can't hold it anymore!

351
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,790
Ah, I managed to avoid the flag.

352
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,750
Everyone, remember to go to the bathroom
when you get the chance!

353
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
Bye-bye!

354
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,230
(Next Episode)
Next time on A Man Who Defies the World of BL:

355
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,070
The slight glimpse of a guy's collarbone
is pretty exciting, right?

356
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,070
Next time on A Man Who Defies the World of BL:

357
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,510
Vs. Contradiction

358
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,080
and Vs. Work Experience. Two stories.

359
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,560
Stay tuned.
