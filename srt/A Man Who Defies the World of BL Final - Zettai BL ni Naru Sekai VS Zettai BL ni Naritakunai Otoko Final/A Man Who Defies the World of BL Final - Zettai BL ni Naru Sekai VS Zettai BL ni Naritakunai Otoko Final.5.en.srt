"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

2
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,020
December.

3
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,010
The main event of the season...

4
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,060
is, of course...

5
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,060
New Year's Eve.

6
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,200
Here you go.

7
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,630
Delicious.

8
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Huh?

9
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,390
Isn't Ayato's shrimp bigger than mine?

10
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,790
What?

11
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,100
What are you, a kid?

12
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,420
It's definitely bigger.

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,980
You're not getting any.

14
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:42,930
Hey!

15
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,640
Hey... Cut it out! Hey!

16
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,350
After the year-crossing soba...

17
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,500
it's time for...

18
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,900
Bro, look at this. It's hilarious.

19
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,140
Alright! My turn to pick.

20
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,440
Hey! Why'd you change the channel?

21
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,840
Hey, it's my turn to watch!

22
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,980
After the singing competition and...

23
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,520
the variety show...

24
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,690
it's time for...

25
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,560
Happy New Year.

26
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,700
Happy New Year.

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,390
Happy New Year.

28
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,990
Happy New Year.

29
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,090
I wanted to use...

30
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,840
my little fantasy skits to fast-forward time...

31
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,000
But time passes one day at a time, after all.

32
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,290
So that holiday still comes first.

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
That's right.

34
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,270
Christmas.

35
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,850
(Episode 9: The Christmas Chapter)

36
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,030
Christmas.

37
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,470
It should come as no surprise...

38
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,990
that it's an event filled with BL romance flags.

39
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,510
So, what that means is...

40
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,010
Welcome.

41
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,720
Welcome.

42
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,020
Please, have a seat anywhere.

43
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,380
I can't believe I ran into you on a day like this.

44
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,000
It must be fate.

45
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,650
Kikuchi?

46
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,550
No.

47
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,880
You really are...

48
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,360
my soulmate.

49
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,020
No, he's *my* soulmate.

50
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,820
No, mine.

51
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,820
- He's mine! He's mine!
- He's my soulmate! Mine!

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,650
If I just wander around outside...

53
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,310
this kind of thing could happen.

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,670
Hey, bro, you stopped working.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,570
Oh... sorry.

56
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,670
That's why I...

57
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,960
in preparation for Christmas...

58
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,260
have prepared the perfect flag-avoidance plan.

59
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,980
Stop with that creepy laugh.

60
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,620
Oh, sorry.

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,340
Get back to work.

62
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,500
It's a very merry Christmas~

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Hah!

64
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
And so...

65
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,850
Christmas Day arrived.

66
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,500
First up, the preliminary battle on the 24th.

67
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,830
The entire day,

68
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,920
I worked a one-day gig where I didn't have to show my face.

69
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,350
Then,

70
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,640
on the 25th,

71
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,610
I'm so full. That was delicious.

72
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,600
Man, having a feast on Christmas...

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,880
is the best.

74
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,690
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

75
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,880
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

76
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,080
Thanks, bro.

77
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,060
Can't hear you.

78
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,430
Thanks!

79
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,180
Want some tea?

80
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,830
With the money I earned from my gig on the 24th,

81
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,790
I treated my whole family to a feast on the 25th.

82
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,180
It cost a lot,

83
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,370
but everyone had a great time.

84
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,220
Plus, I got to show Ayato
what a great big brother I am.

85
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,550
All in all, not bad.

86
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,030
And just like that,

87
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,230
I safely made it through the two most
flag-prone days of Christmas.

88
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,940
I've successfully reached the 26th.

89
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,130
That's right. I'm a background character.

90
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,180
The ultimate background character.

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,530
Just then...

92
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,630
Ah.

93
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,060
You're...

94
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Hello.

95
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,940
That was a close call. Scared me to death.

96
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,950
But being off by one day makes all the difference.

97
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,070
Today isn't a special occasion.

98
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,850
And luckily,

99
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,230
he's with his family.

100
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,070
That means,

101
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,340
there's no way a flag can be raised.

102
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,280
Oh, are you going to dinner with your family now?

103
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,790
Oh, um...

104
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,070
Today's my birthday.

105
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,490
My brother made a reservation for me.

106
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,090
I told him he didn't have to.

107
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Oh?

108
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,930
Is that so?

109
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Happy birthday.

110
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Oh.

111
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,670
Thank you!

112
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,310
Wait!

113
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,450
Isn't this...

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Um...

115
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Well then,

116
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,810
goodbye.

117
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,490
Hey, your face is really red.

118
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,540
- Huh?
- Are you catching a cold?

119
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,200
Are you okay?

120
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,480
It's not a cold...

121
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,040
He wished me a happy birthday...

122
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,730
This is the best birthday ever.

123
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,260
I've just realized.

124
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,390
Special days can be created out of thin air.

125
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,810
That look in his eyes...

126
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
That's...

127
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,860
the look of someone gazing at the one they love...

128
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,470
Just as I thought.

129
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,650
Is there no room left for me?

130
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,120
Huh...?

131
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,610
Igarashi...

132
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,740
It's been a while.

133
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,400
Kikuchi.

134
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,670
This is...

135
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,470
It suits you, don't you think?

136
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,030
It's a flower from my shop.

137
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,520
Your shop?

138
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,210
I opened a flower shop.

139
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,580
Because I...

140
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,740
couldn't stop thinking about you.

141
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,410
Only when I was looking at flowers...

142
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,040
could my heart be at peace.

143
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,240
I'm so glad I got to see you again.

144
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,680
Take care.

145
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,350
Igarashi...

146
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,760
Can we start over?

147
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,080
Kikuchi...

148
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,700
I finally understand.

149
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,690
The one I need... is you.

150
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,880
I've been waiting for you to say that.

151
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

152
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,140
You think a simple apology is enough?

153
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Then...

154
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,220
what should I do?

155
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,980
What should you do?

156
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:21,860
You... already know, don't you?

157
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,200
And so, the two of them...

158
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,730
finally got back together.

159
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,050
- Again.
- No.

160
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,840
- Again.
- No way~

161
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,410
- Why did it end like that? One more time.
- I said no.

162
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,980
My, what a dramatic turn of events.

163
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,090
That being said,

164
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,010
that kiss was pretty intense.

165
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:22,910
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

166
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,020
I completely let my guard down.

167
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,590
What's wrong?

168
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,620
I... I'm pathetic, aren't I?

169
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,820
This may seem sudden,

170
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,440
but as a background character,

171
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,390
I'm actually a very quick learner.

172
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,390
Oh.

173
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,130
You're awake.

174
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,430
If you don't mind,

175
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,920
I'd like to give you a special lesson.

176
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,840
In my room.

177
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,500
After the 'fall asleep
and it becomes BL' disaster last time,

178
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,090
I didn't dare let my guard down for a second.

179
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,450
However...

180
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,310
On this day,

181
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,000
I completely let my guard down.

182
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,210
What's there to be cautious about
when you're sleeping at home?

183
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,020
But considering my brother might bring friends over,

184
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,860
I should have just gone to my own room to sleep.

185
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,260
And now,

186
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,050
a huge flag...

187
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,080
has just appeared.

188
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,990
(Episode 10: The 'Fall Asleep and It Becomes BL' Returns Chapter)

189
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,150
He's looking right at me.

190
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,900
Here it comes!

191
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,650
He's even checking to see if anyone's around.

192
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,550
What is he planning to do?

193
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,360
This is very bad.

194
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,520
I have two options at this point.

195
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,550
Option one.

196
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,290
Pretend I'm just waking up, and get up.

197
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Mmm...

198
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Ah...

199
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,910
I slept so well.

200
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,470
Oh, you're here?

201
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,770
Pardon the intrusion.

202
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,090
Welcome.

203
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,270
Huh?

204
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,300
Your sleeping face...

205
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,370
I wanted to look at it a little longer.

206
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
However,

207
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,480
if I did that,

208
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,830
I might end up like this,
hearing some bizarre confession from him.

209
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,240
Option two:

210
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,500
keep pretending to be asleep.

211
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,660
I...

212
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,380
I'm the worst, aren't I?

213
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,030
There's a high probability he'd try to steal a kiss.

214
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,090
Neither of those options will work...

215
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,790
Right, that's it.

216
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,220
There's a third option.

217
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,100
Ugh... So cold...

218
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,660
So cold.

219
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,020
I call this the "Just Barely Believable Fake Sleep Tactic."

220
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,330
This way,

221
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,420
he can't do a thing.

222
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,360
The only downside is that it's a bit hard to breathe.

223
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,560
But I just have to endure until this long-haired brat

224
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,080
goes back to Ayato's room.

225
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Huh?

226
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,650
Just now, he gently...

227
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,120
He gently covered me?

228
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,870
Oh, what took you so long?

229
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,870
Ah, I got lost.

230
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,280
You got lost?

231
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,580
Huh? The bathroom is just down the hall
to the right on the first floor.

232
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,170
Oh...

233
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,650
What?!

234
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
This jacket...

235
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,960
Can you have Ayato return it next time?

236
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,200
It's still winter.

237
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,090
It'd be a huge problem if he caught a cold
because he didn't have his jacket.

238
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,700
That would just raise another unnecessary flag.

239
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,590
Oh, what should I do...?

240
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,000
Hmm? What is it?

241
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,540
Need the bathroom again?

242
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,230
No.

243
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,250
It's just something...

244
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,160
Meanwhile, I was...

245
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,510
Ahhh, it hurts!

246
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,620
Ow, ow, ow!

247
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,390
Your whole body is so stiff.

248
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,630
Ahhh, it hurts!

249
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,610
As for why I was getting a massage...

250
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,560
To keep from making a sound,

251
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,140
I tensed every muscle in my body to the limit.

252
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,570
In the end,

253
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,780
my entire body was one big, exploding muscle ache.

254
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,310
It hurts so much!

255
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,800
Relax.

256
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,050
Breathe out slowly.

257
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,880
Gracefully, like Suiko Tenno.

258
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,870
Aren't massages supposed to be
so relaxing you fall asleep?

259
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,370
At this rate,

260
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,650
I won't be able to sleep for a single second.

261
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,410
Ah...

262
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,480
Oh my stiffness!

263
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,060
The stiffness isn't gone yet.

264
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,470
Your stiffness...

265
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,630
- Aches and pains, go away.
- Ow, ow, ow!

266
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,760
Everyone, be careful not to sleep too soundly.

267
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
Bye-bye.

268
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,070
(Next Episode)
Next time on A Man Who Defies the World of BL:

269
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,660
The curve of a taut glute.

270
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,400
It's truly a mystery.

271
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,670
The final episode of A Man Who Defies the World of BL

272
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,380
features "VS Misfortune" and "VS Valentine's Day."

273
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,870
Look forward to it.
