1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,760
In microeconomics,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,060
the demand and supply curves are...

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,910
I've realized something.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,950
I'm a resident of a certain world.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,870
This is a very basic, yet important...

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,900
A so-called...

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,790
In other words...

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,090
I'm a resident of a BL world.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,940
But...

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,290
as a background character
who absolutely refuses to be in a BL story,

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,820
I've been dodging every possible flag
that gets raised.

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,270
But...

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,950
Will you accept my feelings?

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,510
I guess I...

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,090
I can't forget you.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,830
What do I do?

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,360
What am I gonna do?

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,180
Now this...

19
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,510
Hey, bro.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,140
Bro.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,060
Hmm?

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,350
Look, right here.

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,290
You've got a grain of rice on your face.

24
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,230
Huh?

25
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,760
Seriously, what are you doing?

26
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,410
Huh?

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Was all of that...

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,320
just a dream?

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,560
In other words,

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,820
I knew it.

31
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,530
I refuse to give in to this world.

32
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,170
Another bowl.

33
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,220
Whoa.

34
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,390
Another bowl.

35
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,830
Whoa.

36
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,990
Another bowl!

37
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,420
Whoa, whoa.

38
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,330
Thanks for the food.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,410
So much energy this early.

40
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,130
He's really something.

41
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,760
Who eats four bowls of rice for breakfast?

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,100
- Pretty cool, huh?
- What's cool about it?

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,570
Hey, you'll get a stomachache.

44
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,310
- He's growing up so well.
- Such a good man.

45
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,050
Yeah.

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm heading out.

47
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,380
And so...

48
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,510
in a world where everything becomes a BL story,

49
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,670
as a man who refuses to be a part of it,

50
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,230
I'm just a background character.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,690
My grueling day-to-day battle...

52
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,560
begins for the fourth time.

53
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,900
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

54
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,290
March...

55
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
That's right.

56
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,180
Speaking of March...

57
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,790
Today, we're having special chirashi sushi.

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,820
Oh, right.

59
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,850
- It's delicious, Mom.
- Really tasty.

60
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,570
Ah, Girls' Day is the best.

61
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,610
But...

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,010
we don't have any girls in the family to celebrate.

63
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,230
What are you talking about?

64
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,590
- We do.
- Huh?

65
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,820
Mom.

66
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,190
Congratulations.

67
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
Congratulations.

68
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,190
Oh, stop it.

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,520
But thank you.

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,490
- Thanks.
- Don't be shy.

71
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,250
- Don't be shy.
- Go on, Mom. Eat up.

72
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,130
- Okay.
- Here you go.

73
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,850
Time to eat!

74
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,690
The clam broth smells amazing.

75
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,570
Girls' Day.

76
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,510
Next up...

77
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,080
the second button.

78
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,780
Can I have it?

79
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,450
Sure.

80
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,370
Then...

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,760
can I have yours too?

82
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Yeah.

83
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
Actually...

84
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,180
I've always had feelings for you.

85
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,190
Me too.

86
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,810
I've always had feelings for you.

87
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,280
It's graduation season.

88
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,170
Graduation ceremonies.

89
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,990
And after that...

90
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,340
The cherry blossoms are blooming up north.

91
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,300
I see. It's flower-viewing season.

92
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,760
How about we all go flower viewing next week?

93
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,490
Huh? The whole family?

94
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,790
- What if people see us?
- Who cares?

95
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,160
It'll be nice.

96
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,040
Sigh.

97
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,560
Flower viewing...

98
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,530
We can drink now.

99
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,970
Flower viewing...

100
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,470
And other dangerous events
are coming one after another.

101
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
But...

102
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,390
the thing you need to watch out for most in March...

103
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,090
is something you're all very familiar with.

104
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
That's right.

105
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,250
It's...

106
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,930
Achoo!

107
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,390
Hay fever season is here.

108
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,430
(Episode 1: The Hay Fever Chapter)

109
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,740
A trade-off...

110
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,070
is a relationship where, in order to get one thing,

111
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,500
you have to give up something else.

112
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,610
Okay.

113
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,350
That's all for today's class.

114
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Achoo!

115
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,950
Here.

116
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,650
Are you okay?

117
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Thanks.

118
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,060
Watery eyes.

119
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,970
Flushed cheeks.

120
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,880
These symptoms of hay fever...

121
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,130
can accidentally raise a BL flag.

122
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,030
Hey.

123
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,970
Wanna go to a cafe with better air quality later?

124
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Huh?

125
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,910
Yeah.

126
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,890
Let's go?

127
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,750
I knew this would happen.

128
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,860
Use this.

129
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
This is bad.

130
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,590
This is really bad.

131
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,420
This dangerous atmosphere...

132
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,050
I have to find a way to escape it.

133
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,050
Everyone.

134
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Listen to me.

135
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,470
For the time being,

136
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,770
I'm taking a leave of absence
from school to go abroad.

137
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,870
To a world without hay fever.

138
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,280
So, farewell.

139
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,780
Unfortunately, reality isn't that simple.

140
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,590
Here.

141
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,770
Use this.

142
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,280
So I have no choice but to...

143
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,710
Are you okay?

144
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,680
I've decided to adopt a no-defense strategy.

145
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
That's right.

146
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,710
That's the idea.

147
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,740
If I can just push past the watery eyes...

148
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,630
and the flushed cheeks...

149
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,310
everything will be fine.

150
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,090
The only problem is...

151
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,970
my physical and mental strength...

152
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,150
will be slowly worn down.

153
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:05,030
But no matter what,
I have to survive this hay fever season.

154
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,370
It's been a while. My name is Mayama Masumi.

155
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,020
It's him... a treasure trove of inspiration.

156
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,270
I'm a BL manga artist suffering from severe hay fever.

157
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,250
Time to gather some more material for inspiration.

158
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,410
He's appeared once again.

159
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,780
That BL manga artist.

160
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,360
What kind of story will he create?

161
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,430
And what kind of "versus" awaits us up ahead?

162
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,780
Stay tuned to find out, everyone.

163
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,340
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

164
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,930
Just pretend to be my lover?

165
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,650
Just stand next to me and be introduced as my boyfriend.

166
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,640
Here's the curry rice.

167
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,080
- Sorry for the wait.
- Thanks.

168
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,180
By the way, I'm moving soon.

169
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,320
Huh? Why?

170
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,650
They found out our apartment building faked
its earthquake resistance data.

171
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,450
For real? That's insane!

172
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,720
- It's dangerous.
- So dangerous.

173
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,310
Sigh...

174
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,750
You seem down.

175
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,870
What's wrong?

176
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Well...

177
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,620
The other day...

178
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,190
I told my boyfriend I was hanging out with friends...

179
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,350
but I was actually meeting the guy
I'm cheating with, and I got caught.

180
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Oof...

181
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
You're so screwed.

182
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,750
It's bad. He saw my phone.

183
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,080
When people hear the word "pretense,"
they usually think of...

184
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,020
criminal acts or faking an alibi
for an affair, right?

185
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,460
Even in this BL world full of happy endings,

186
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,980
pretense still exists.

187
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,950
(Episode 2: The Pretense Chapter)

188
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,710
The "pretense" incidents that occur in this world...

189
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,470
are mostly harmless.

190
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,820
This is the main one.

191
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,050
Hey, guys.

192
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,390
I have a favor to ask...

193
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,530
Can someone please pretend to be my boyfriend?

194
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,260
Pretend to be your boyfriend?

195
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,310
Yes, please!

196
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,610
A male customer at my part-time job confessed to me.

197
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,640
I turned him down,

198
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,440
but now he's kind of started stalking me.

199
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,460
But I don't have any female friends
who can pretend to be my girlfriend.

200
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,670
It doesn't matter if my fake partner is a guy or a girl.

201
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,710
I just need him to give up.

202
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,350
So... please, just play along.

203
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,680
Please.

204
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,930
Thank you very much
for that detailed plot synopsis.

205
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,550
Please, anyone...

206
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,690
Fake Lovers.

207
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,660
In other words...

208
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,550
He's looking for someone to be his "fake boyfriend".

209
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,150
You should go for it.

210
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,530
Takehara.

211
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,030
Huh?

212
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,550
I'm sure you've all noticed.

213
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:25,230
Everyone here is a couple.

214
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
And another couple.

215
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,450
In a situation like this,

216
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,040
the one who's most likely
to be pushed into being the "fake lover"...

217
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,360
is obviously me.

218
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,140
To get myself out of this...

219
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,220
I decided to strike first.

220
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,680
Hey, why me?

221
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,530
Well...

222
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,850
if that stalker guy
finds out his lover is also a man,

223
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,620
as a man,

224
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,720
he'd naturally compare himself to him, right?

225
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,520
Ah... You have a point.

226
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,290
If a plain-looking guy like me shows up,

227
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,190
or someone meek-looking like Natsu,

228
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,770
he'll think he's the better man,

229
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,380
and that he'd be a more suitable lover, right?

230
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,560
But it's different with a well-built guy like you.

231
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,680
He'll feel completely outmatched as a man.

232
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,650
And then he'll back off.

233
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,400
That's not how it works...

234
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,630
Ooh, that makes sense.

235
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,830
Well, I guess that could happen.

236
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,210
Hey, Masaya, Yoji.
What kind of nonsense are you two spouting?

237
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,750
Please, Takehara.

238
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,130
Just stand next to me,

239
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,290
and let me introduce you as my boyfriend. That's all.

240
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,970
Please.

241
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,690
Just do me this one favor.

242
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,590
All right, fine.

243
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,370
Thank you so much.

244
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,810
I owe you one.

245
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,470
Is this really going to be okay...?

246
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,350
All right, let's go.

247
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,260
I feel a little bad for the actual couples here...

248
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,030
but think of it as us adding a little spice
to their love lives.

249
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,390
Anyway, today, once again,

250
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,930
in this world that will inevitably turn into a BL,

251
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,310
I've successfully dodged all the BL flags,

252
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,660
and survived another day unscathed.

253
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,450
Isn't that Ayato?

254
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,590
It's rare to see him without his usual group of friends.

255
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,290
Hey, you're pretending you don't know me.

256
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,400
Even though we're brothers.

257
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,450
Trying to pull the
whole "pretend we're strangers" bit, huh?

258
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,750
But...

259
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,670
It's probably just that typical teenage thing...

260
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,010
of not wanting your friends to see your family.

261
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,850
I can't say I don't get it.

262
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,080
So I'll play along and pretend I didn't see him.

263
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,460
Hey, isn't that Ayato's older brother?

264
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,200
Huh? No way. Who's that guy?

265
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,410
No, that's definitely him, right?

266
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,820
They have the exact same vibe.
Those genes are strong.

267
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,870
Busted in a second.

268
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

269
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,390
What's this? What's this?

270
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,740
He's so plain.

271
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,690
In any case,

272
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,890
my little brother's "Operation: Pretend to be Strangers"
was a total bust.

273
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,050
As for their "Operation: Fake Lovers"...

274
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,820
I wonder how that's going?

275
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,220
Thanks again, Takehara.

276
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,280
Thank you for pretending to be my boyfriend.

277
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,630
Thanks to you,
I finally got rid of that stalker.

278
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,270
That's great.

279
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Um...

280
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
Hm?

281
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,170
There's something I want to tell you.

282
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Is that okay?

283
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,620
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

284
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
So...

285
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,010
What did you want to say?

286
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Well...

287
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,380
Um...

288
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
It's just that...

289
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,290
Hey, come on, spit it out.

290
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,130
Instead of pretending to be a couple...

291
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
From now on...

292
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,950
From now on...

293
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,190
let's be... a real cou...

294
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,870
Takehara.

295
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,630
Will you be my real boyfriend?

296
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,090
Huh?

297
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,750
I...

298
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,650
I've liked you for a long time.

299
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,790
Stop!

300
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,860
Natsu...

301
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,640
Takehara and I are dating.

302
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,030
Is that true?

303
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
Yeah.

304
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,080
So from now on,

305
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,520
please stop this "pretend couple"
charade.

306
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,910
Natsu...

307
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,150
Even if it's to help someone,

308
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,080
this kind of thing...

309
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,970
I can't take it anymore.

310
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,980
Oh, so that's how it was...

311
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,870
I'm sorry, Natsu.

312
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,440
It's all my fault.

313
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,290
Koga...

314
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I...

315
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,540
I had no idea you two were dating.

316
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,770
I overstepped.

317
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,060
I caused a rift between you two.

318
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,620
Koga.

320
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,570
You're a good person.

321
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,090
Don't worry about us.

322
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,770
Right, Takehara?

323
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,380
Yeah.

324
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,080
That's a relief...

325
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,440
Okay, let's head back then.

326
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,160
Thanks, you really helped me out.

327
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,860
Yeah, thank you too.

328
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
Let's go.

329
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,130
Um... Takehara.

330
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,200
Natsu.
Yeah?

331
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,750
Can we still be friends?

332
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,660
I know I just confessed to Takehara,

333
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,570
so it might be shameless of me to ask.

334
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Of course.

335
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,050
Let's stay friends.

336
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,830
That's right.

337
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,140
The friendship we've built...

338
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,500
isn't fake.

339
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,530
I'm so glad.

340
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,460
My, what a heartwarming development.

341
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,980
- All's well that ends well.
- Wanna get some ramen?

342
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,340
- Oh, yeah!
- Let's go, let's go.

343
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
Huh?

344
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,300
I ordered a beef sandwich,

345
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,800
but this isn't beef!

346
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,890
Everyone, be wary of "fakes."

347
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Bye-bye.

348
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,020
(Next Episode)
Next time on A Man Who Defies the World of BL...

349
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,330
The veins on a guy's arm.

350
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,550
For some reason, I just can't help but stare.

351
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,690
Next time, it's "VS Killer Moves."

352
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,410
And "VS The Study Group."

353
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,380
Look forward to it.

354
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,980
What am I gonna do?
