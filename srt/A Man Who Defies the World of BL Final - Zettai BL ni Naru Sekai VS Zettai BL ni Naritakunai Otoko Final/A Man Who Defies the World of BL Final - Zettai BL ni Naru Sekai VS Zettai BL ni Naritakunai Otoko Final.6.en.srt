00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,000
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

2
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,520
Bad boys or little devils.

3
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,670
Intellectuals or airheads, etc.

4
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,990
In this world,

5
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,930
all these tropes can lead to a BL plot.

6
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,330
But...

7
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,250
it's not just your own personality

8
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,620
that can get turned into a trope.

9
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,680
Huh? Your house burned down?

10
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,710
Yeah.

11
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,160
The gas stove in the next apartment exploded,

12
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,880
and it took my apartment and wallet

13
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,930
down with it.

14
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,730
Sano, I'm begging you.

15
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,470
Just let me crash here until I find a new place.

16
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,060
Let me stay with you.

17
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,310
Thanks a lot
for handling this episode's intro for me.

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,470
Speaking of which, you again?

19
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,510
I had no one else to turn to but you, Sano.

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,950
First a stalker, now a fire.

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,640
Koga, you have the worst luck.

22
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,670
Seriously.

23
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,510
I'm at my breaking point.

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,180
That's right.

25
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,050
In this world,

26
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,530
having extremely bad luck,

27
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,420
or "misfortune," can also be a trope
that triggers a BL plot.

28
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,830
(Episode 11: VS Misfortune)

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,720
- Time to eat.
- Time to eat.

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,030
To be honest,

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,590
I don't think a flag can be raised between me and Koga.

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,370
And why is that?

33
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,340
Because a jinx paired with a background character

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
doesn't make for much of a story.

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Seriously.

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
You've been through a lot.

37
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,190
Your house actually burned down.

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
That must've been so tough.

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,950
That's terrible.

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,970
Thanks, everyone.

41
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,280
This is a huge help.

42
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,880
Eat up, eat up. There's plenty more,
so have seconds.

43
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Don't be shy.

44
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
What's wrong?

45
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,430
This kindness...

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,860
I'll never forget it for the rest of my life.

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,910
You're being dramatic.

48
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,510
Really, you're overdoing it.

49
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,170
Look at him eat.

50
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,280
In the end,

51
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,030
I let him move in anyway.

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,990
But deep down, I'm scared to death.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,030
I'm worried that Koga the jinx

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,180
is going to bring misfortune
upon our background character family.

55
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,910
What was that?

56
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,950
What's going on?

57
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,020
What is this?

58
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,320
It's not an earthquake.

59
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,010
I think a huge truck just drove by.

60
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,140
What the heck was that?

61
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,860
- That's never happened before, right?
- Yeah! Never.

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
This is...

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,540
the beginning of the misfortune.

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Great.

65
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,810
That was fast.

66
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,350
Hey.

67
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,860
I'm home.

68
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,330
Hey.

69
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,740
Huh? What's wrong with you?

70
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,960
I didn't win the lottery for
my bias' concert tickets.

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Huh...

72
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
Great.

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Jeez...

74
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
Hey.

75
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,590
- Wait!
- I'm home...

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Okay.

77
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,980
Sigh...

78
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,020
What's wrong?

79
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,910
The company said there won't be any bonuses next term.

80
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,450
What?

81
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,780
Don't use props.

82
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,080
If you use them now...

83
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,460
- I'm home.
- Mm.

84
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,010
Sigh...

85
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,060
What's the matter?

86
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,390
My wallet's gone.

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
What?

88
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,670
I feel so bad. It feels like this is all my fault.

89
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,070
That's not it at all.

90
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,580
Of course that's not it.

91
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,050
It's really not.

92
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,850
Emotionless, perfectly robotic lines.

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,480
I knew it. Everyone secretly thinks
Koga is the one bringing the bad luck.

94
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,840
Hm?

95
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Huh?

96
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,260
That's weird.

97
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,890
Hmm.

98
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,990
I'm the only one who hasn't had
anything bad happen to them yet.

99
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,580
Does that mean...

100
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,840
what's going to happen to me next?

101
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,510
I've saved up enough money
from my part-time job.

102
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,280
And I've found a new apartment.

103
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,070
During this time,

104
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,430
thank you all so much for taking care of me.

105
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,580
Take care.

106
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,100
Good luck.

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,800
Aww.

108
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,380
You know, you could've stayed

109
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,760
a little longer.

110
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,270
Yeah.

111
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,510
Right.

112
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,110
There they go again.

113
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,820
Emotionless, perfectly robotic lines.

114
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,970
Seriously.

115
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,450
Thank you all so much.

116
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,360
Thanks.

117
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,770
Thanks.

118
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,580
Hey, that hurts.

119
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,020
That's really uncomfortable.

120
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,110
And so, the jinx

121
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,510
Koga's stay at my house

122
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,600
seemed to end without any
misfortune befalling me.

123
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,650
However...

124
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,570
Ah!

125
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Whoops.

126
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,300
Of course it wasn't going to end just like that.

127
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,980
What will happen in the final chapter of
A Man Who Defies the World of BL?

128
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,240
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

129
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,760
I really do love you after all.

130
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,400
Please, just don't let me end up in a BL.

131
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,710
What in the world...?

132
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,870
Huh?

133
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,750
It's Hatano.

134
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,190
Hm?

135
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,200
What's he doing here?

136
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,660
Okay.

137
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
I should be safe now.

138
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,070
I've successfully avoided the flag.

139
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,080
Or so I thought.

140
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,420
I'll just grab some hot pork buns or
something and head home.

141
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,190
For me, Ayato,

142
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,510
and Koga...

143
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,280
Oh, wait. I don't need to get one for
Koga anymore.

144
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Um...

145
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,660
That voice is...

146
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,150
That guy from before...

147
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,410
was he your boyfriend?

148
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Huh?

149
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,670
Oh, no, he's just a classmate.

150
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,440
His house burned down, so he was
staying with me for a bit.

151
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,620
I see.

152
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Still,

153
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,640
the fact that you two lived together...

154
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,330
I can't help but feel jealous.

155
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
Huh?

156
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,190
So, in other words,

157
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,520
he still hasn't given up on me?

158
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,040
Time to eat.

159
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,330
In this world where one wrong move
could land you in a BL,

160
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,010
please, just don't let me end up in a BL.

161
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,060
Here, have a tangerine.

162
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,070
Darling, what did you wish for?

163
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,130
For our family to be healthy.

164
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,530
Same as me.

165
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,490
What about you, Ayato?

166
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,870
Huh?

167
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,410
Oh, um, well...

168
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,910
- It doesn't matter what I wished for.
- Aww.

169
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,530
Ayato.

170
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,550
I know.

171
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,720
I know what you wished for.

172
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,440
For your happy days with Tojo
to last forever.

173
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,530
Right?

174
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,330
And now,

175
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,550
one of this world's main events is just
around the corner.

176
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,240
And that is...

177
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,300
(Valentine's Day)

178
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,460
(Final Episode: VS Valentine's Day)

179
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,510
The day of the main event is finally here.

180
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,550
This time, too,

181
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,710
I can't let my guard down.

182
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,190
To avoid raising any unnecessary flags,

183
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,580
I have to spend the day quietly.

184
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,130
Ayato's friend is coming over.
Go buy a cake or something.

185
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,070
She's probably just feeling bad that her son's boyfriend
always brings such thoughtful gifts.

186
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,070
On Valentine's Day,

187
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,100
my mom sent me that text.

188
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
And so,

189
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,170
when she says Ayato's friend,

190
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,210
could she mean...?

191
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,550
Is he coming over?

192
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,420
Should I just ignore it?

193
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
No.

194
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,580
For a deadbeat college student living at home,

195
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,130
a parent's command is absolute.

196
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,450
I guess I have to go.

197
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,870
The problem is the timing.

198
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,720
If I run into that Hatano guy

199
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,100
when I drop the cake off at home,
it'll be a disaster.

200
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,840
That's why...

201
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,610
And so...

202
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,430
Mission accomplished.

203
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,940
This is my chance to sneak out...

204
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,600
I'm home.

205
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,300
No one's home, so make yourselves comfortable.

206
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,670
Thanks for having us.

207
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Come on in.

208
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Should I bring the key in?

209
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,350
- It's fine, just leave it there.
- OK.

210
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,380
Whoa, this place is spotless.

211
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,420
I know, right?

212
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,540
Wow, you're so tidy...

213
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,610
What the heck?

214
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,080
He's not here?

215
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,630
I was worried for nothing.

216
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,330
Huh?

217
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,140
Is that a Corgi?

218
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,790
Hm? That's a lamb, isn't it?

219
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,330
See?

220
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,580
- Whoa! You have a Switch!
- A Switch!

221
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,890
What's this?

222
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,170
- Grab that bigger controller over there.
- This one?

223
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
This one goes here.

224
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,710
- Here, take this.
- Okay.

225
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,510
Let's play.

226
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,940
Alrighty.

227
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,900
- Know how to play?
- Nope.

228
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,100
This is to move forward.

229
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,930
And this is back.

230
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,270
Use this one to turn.

231
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,380
Ah.

232
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,570
Hello.

233
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Ah...

234
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Hi.

235
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,570
- Um...
- Ah... Sorry, I gotta head out. See ya.

236
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,030
That cake looks delicious.

237
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,730
Good thing I sent my brother on an errand.

238
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,030
Are these...

239
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,640
Your brother bought them?

240
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Yup.

241
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,550
Hatano, which one do you want?

242
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,680
I...

243
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,210
I...

244
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,320
I'll have the chocolate cake.

245
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,410
Whoa, I didn't know you could be that loud.

246
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,300
Hey, Hatano.

247
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Toru-san!

248
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,430
Whoa, careful!

249
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,300
I really am in love with you.

250
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,000
I love you.

251
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,590
I just...

252
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,470
can't give up on you.

253
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,590
Because you...

254
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,350
are my soulmate.

255
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,590
Hatano.

256
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,080
I...

257
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,310
Um...

258
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,450
I can't date a minor.

259
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,440
In that case...

260
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,820
Three years from now.

261
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,590
Please give me another chance in three years.

262
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,660
Please.

263
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,370
Alright.

264
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you.

265
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,170
Well then...

266
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,110
In three years.

267
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,770
I'll contact you.

268
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,590
I should go now.

269
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,060
Three years later...

270
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,770
He'll probably have forgotten
all about me by then.

271
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,700
I guess I really am just a mob character.

272
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,590
There's no way I'm getting dragged into a BL plot.

273
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,130
Is that really true?

274
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,110
Huh?

275
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,370
Who's there?

276
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,010
Do you really think
the story will end just the way you want?

277
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,020
Your story...

278
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,390
should have a sequel, shouldn't it?

279
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,370
A sequel?

280
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,010
No way that's happening.

281
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,500
(3 Years Later)

282
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
Mmm...

283
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,040
Another year of working my butt off.

284
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,680
Good work this year.

285
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,190
A white Christmas?

286
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,500
No, wait.

287
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,910
Today's the 26th.

288
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,800
Christmas is already over.

289
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Wait.

290
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,150
Gotta hurry or I'll be late.

291
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,980
Right.

292
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,890
But, before that...

293
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,510
Anyway...

294
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:02,030
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

295
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,550
concludes here.

296
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,090
See you again someday!

297
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
(The characters and events in this story
