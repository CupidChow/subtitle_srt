"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

2
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,590
Hey everyone.

3
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,050
Ever witness a scene like this?

4
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,620
Explain why you're late.

5
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,040
Well...

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,220
On my way to the station,

7
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,080
an old woman was lost.

8
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,460
After I took her where she needed to go,

9
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,820
- I missed my train...
- Stop making excuses.

10
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,810
- I'm sorry.
- Do you even get it?

11
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,500
You're always full of excuses.

12
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,250
- I know...
- What is this?

13
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,090
Anyway,

14
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,160
this is what you call a contradiction.

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,270
We were all waiting for you.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,440
(Episode 5: VS Contradiction)

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,260
This may be a peaceful BL world,

18
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,110
but contradictions like that one

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,610
happen all the time here.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,020
Hey, what are you looking at?

21
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,730
Huh?

22
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,480
I wasn't looking at anything.

23
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,860
Don't play dumb.

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,380
You...

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,190
You were just checking out
my little brother, Hinata, weren't you?

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,380
You want me to knock you out?

27
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,400
- Bro... calm down.
- I wasn't looking at him like that.

28
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,870
I swear.

29
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,270
I definitely wasn't looking at Hinata that way.

30
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,090
I have someone else...

31
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,240
that I like.

32
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,930
You wouldn't even give him a second look...

33
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,650
That's right.

34
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,950
Why you...!

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,480
Are you saying my brother isn't good enough for you?

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,410
Bro! Just calm down!

37
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,520
- Is he not good enough?
- That's not what I meant!

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,620
I don't want to give him up to you,

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,010
but it really bugs me that you rejected him.
It's a contradiction.

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
- You were totally looking.
- What?

41
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,770
Seriously,

42
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,510
can't he do something
about that nasty attitude of his?

43
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,030
You mean Mitsuru?

44
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,810
Yeah.

45
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,460
Mitsuru...

46
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,030
I knew it.

47
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,330
That Mitsuru guy has a terrible attitude,

48
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,060
and he can't read the room at all.

49
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,310
He's such a buzzkill.

50
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,070
He might have a sharp tongue,

51
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,620
but he's not wrong.

52
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,110
Just because he hit a nerve,

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
you're talking behind his back?
Don't you think it's lame?

54
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,710
Huh?

55
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,040
What's with you all of a sudden?

56
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,460
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,730
Weren't you the one who started it?

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
You totally were.

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,290
I'm allowed to talk crap about my friends,

60
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,550
but I get annoyed when other people do.

61
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,190
That's another contradiction.

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,210
Next up,

63
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,480
there's this kind of contradiction.

64
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,290
Hey.

65
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,520
Who were you with yesterday?

66
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,660
Does it matter who it was?

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
What?

68
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,670
Is it someone you can't tell me about?

69
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Such a bad boy.

70
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,000
Looks like you need to be punished.

71
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,530
W-Wait.

72
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
I'll tell you...

73
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,410
I'll tell you.

74
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Nope.

75
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,930
This is your punishment.

76
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And...

78
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,940
I've been misunderstanding you. I'm sorry.

79
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,810
It's okay.

80
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,800
It was my fault too. I'm sorry.

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,700
Good boy.

82
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,860
I'll give you extra love today.

83
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

84
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,290
Whoa.

85
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,340
Whether you're a good boy

86
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,740
or a bad boy,

87
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,720
whether it's punishment or making up,

88
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,040
it all ends with them doing the same thing.

89
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,600
That's a contradiction of sorts.

90
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,000
All right, that's all for today's lesson.

91
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,060
And then, one day...

92
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,150
Whoa.

93
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,790
Looks like it's about to rain.

94
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,770
Oh, I forgot my umbrella.

95
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Seriously?

96
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Actually...

97
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,320
I forgot my umbrella too.

98
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,030
Huh?

99
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,270
Just kidding, I brought it.

100
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,890
I'm so prepared.

101
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,750
This one act

102
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,350
would end up leading to a BL situation

103
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,690
which I totally didn't forsee at that time.

104
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm back.

105
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,230
Whose is this?

106
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,590
So, long story short...

107
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,840
I decided to sneak the umbrella back
when no one was around.

108
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,440
Okay, this should be fine.

109
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Um...

110
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,470
That's mine.

111
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Oh...

112
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,830
Did you... use my umbrella without asking?

113
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,790
This is bad.

114
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,950
This is definitely turning into a BL situation.

115
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,010
So, in a situation like this,

116
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,160
should I lie and say I didn't use it,

117
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,720
or be honest and admit I did?

118
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,350
Which one should I choose?

119
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,910
First, let's try this option.

120
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,170
Did you... use my umbrella without asking?

121
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,770
I didn't use it.

122
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,040
Don't lie.

123
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,440
I'm not lying.

124
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,290
Oh, really?

125
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,830
You're such a bad boy.

126
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,190
Looks like you need to be punished.

127
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
W-Wait.

128
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,410
- Actually...
- Nope.

129
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
This is your punishment.

130
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
This won't work.

131
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,920
Okay then... what about the other option?

132
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Did you... use my umbrella without asking?

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,790
I accidentally mistook it for my own.

135
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,590
I'm really sorry.

136
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,610
I see.

137
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,030
It can't be helped then.

138
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm really sorry.

139
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,370
You're...

140
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,830
such a good boy.

141
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,110
I'll have to give you extra love.

142
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,560
This won't work either.

143
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,060
Whether I'm a bad boy

144
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,460
or a good boy,

145
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,020
it still turns into a BL situation.

146
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,890
What the heck?

147
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,880
So what am I supposed to do?

148
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,130
What do I do?

149
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
What do I do?

150
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,990
What do I do?

151
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,580
What am I supposed to do, Mob!

152
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,010
Hey.

153
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,330
My umbrella...

154
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,270
Did you use it without asking?

155
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
I'm screwed.

156
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,250
Now...

157
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,130
That's it.

158
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,130
Hmm, I think I might have.
I don't really remember.

159
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,040
Hmm.

160
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,350
Huh?

161
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,400
You see, I sometimes suffer from sudden memory loss.

162
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,660
Sorry about that.

163
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,030
Huh?

164
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,010
Oh, right.

165
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,650
As an apology, here...

166
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,390
This is for you.

167
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,460
Have something to eat.

168
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,110
Be more careful next time.

169
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,270
Okay~

170
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,580
And just like that,

171
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,760
since being a good boy

172
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,360
or a bad boy didn't work,

173
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,950
I decided to be a weirdo instead.

174
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,190
And with that, I successfully dodged the BL plot development.

175
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Heh heh.

176
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,480
Phew, that was a close call.

177
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,980
Everyone, make sure you take good care of your belongings.

178
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:04,720
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL Final"

179
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,190
- Work experience, huh?
- Ayato's going to a bakery, right?

180
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,580
I bet he'll be popular with the customers.

181
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,350
- Morning.
- Morning.

182
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,960
Ooh, this looks delicious.

183
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,400
Time to eat.

184
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,210
Oh, that's right.

185
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,630
I have my work experience thing.

186
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,880
Work experience?

187
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,670
So I have to go work at a real company.

188
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,220
You don't have to make me a bento for three days,
starting the day after tomorrow.

189
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,250
Aya, have you decided where you're going?

190
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,210
Why don't you come to Dad's company?

191
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,550
No way.

192
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,720
Why not?

193
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,490
Wouldn't that be great?

194
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,820
- I'll go too.
- Why would you do that?

195
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,620
Work experience.

196
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,640
Back then, I just randomly picked
the convenience store near my house.

197
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,790
But my little brother,
despite being born into a mob family,

198
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,930
is the protagonist of this BL world.

199
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,620
So his work experience placement

200
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,080
is bound to be somewhere where drama unfolds.

201
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,940
Yeah, for example,

202
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,950
he's probably going to a kindergarten.

203
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
Huh?

204
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,770
With Tojo, of course.

205
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,820
If Tojo ends up being popular with the kids,

206
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,890
try not to get jealous.

207
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,920
Don't pout.

208
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,110
Hmph.

209
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,600
It's not a kindergarten or a nursery school.

210
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,910
And it's not where Tojo is going either.

211
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,730
You're way off.

212
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,570
Besides, I'm not pouting.

213
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,170
Then where is it?

214
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,650
A bakery.

215
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,070
A bakery...?

216
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,510
Welcome.

217
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,300
Care for some bread, fresh out of the oven?

218
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,660
Ayato, what's today's special?

219
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,820
This one.

220
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,760
I smell something...

221
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,490
What?

222
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,340
So creepy.

223
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,440
Amidst the sweet aroma of bread...

224
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,170
I smell a BL drama about to unfold.

225
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,380
(Episode 6: VS Work Experience)

226
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,970
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

227
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,880
Man, my brother...

228
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,520
says the weirdest things.

229
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,020
Huh? Weird things?

230
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,150
Oh.

231
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,290
It's nothing.

232
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
So...

233
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,770
About the work experience
starting the day after tomorrow...

234
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,500
Tojo, you're going to a kindergarten, right?

235
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,830
Yeah.

236
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,760
I bet you'll be a hit with the kids.

237
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,910
Hmm?

238
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,370
Are you jealous?

239
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,470
What? Of course not.

240
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,710
Hmm?

241
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,680
I'm a little sad you don't get jealous over me.

242
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,690
Tojo...

243
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,520
Ayato, you're going to the bakery, right?

244
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,740
You'll definitely be popular with the customers.

245
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,780
What? No, I won't.

246
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
I'd...

247
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,950
get jealous, you know.

248
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,420
Just kidding.

249
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,240
Hey!

250
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,710
Stop teasing me.

251
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,870
- I'm not teasing you.
- Yes, you are!

252
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,310
In any case,

253
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,220
it seems even work experience
has become a sweet seasoning for these couples.

254
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,340
- Oh, hold on.
- Hmm?

255
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,440
Oh, it's from our teacher.

256
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
Okay.

257
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,710
What?

258
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,020
No way.

259
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,020
And so...

260
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,220
On the day of the work experience...

261
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,850
- Here's your dad's lunch.
- All right, thanks.

262
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,500
Oh, Ayato, your work experience starts today, right?

263
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,920
At the bakery.

264
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,510
Do your best.

265
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,530
I'm not a child.

266
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,900
But thanks.

267
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,770
- I'm heading out.
- Take care.

268
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,850
Good luck out there.

269
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,020
He didn't say anything,

270
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,930
but yesterday...

271
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
Hello?

272
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,990
Hello.

273
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,010
This is Tojo. Is Ayato home?

274
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, Ayato's not back yet.

275
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,200
Oh, is this his brother?

276
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,650
I couldn't get through to Ayato's phone.

277
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,870
Well, you see...

278
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,560
About the work experience tomorrow,

279
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,010
the girls who were supposed to go
to the kindergarten with me all called in sick.

280
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,950
Oh, really?

281
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,580
So,

282
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
I was wondering if I could ask Ayato to fill in for them.

283
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,790
I see...

284
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,030
I'll try calling his cell again.

285
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,550
If you see him, could you please
let him know for me as well?

286
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,320
Yeah, got it.

287
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,800
Just don't go accidentally making
any promises about the future and getting yourself trapped.

288
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,830
Why did I end up
doing what my brother said, anyway?

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Still...

290
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,040
Work experience with Tojo, huh?

291
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,250
With Tojo.

292
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,940
Spending time together...

293
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,510
for work experience.

294
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:56,970
With Tojo.

295
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,210
Together.

296
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,560
Go get me two cartons of milk.

297
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,580
What a pain.

298
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,950
Come on, please?

299
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,810
And so...

300
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Ah...

301
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,740
This convenience store...

302
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,950
is the one where I did my high school

303
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,650
work experience.

304
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,690
That's 184 yen.

305
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,470
417 yen.

306
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,260
- Would you like this meal heated up?
- Yes, please.

307
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,400
All right, one moment, please.

308
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,260
Brings back memories.

309
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,680
I need milk anyway, so I might as well get it here.

310
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,380
Welcome.

311
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Huh?

312
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,300
This guy is Ayato's classmate... Hatano.

313
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,210
I knew it.

314
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,570
I can't give up on you.

315
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,090
You... what are you doing here?

316
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,510
Oh, no.

317
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,230
This is really, really bad.

318
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,500
You... what are you doing here?

319
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,700
Oh, uh, no.

320
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,950
I used to do my work experience here.

321
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Huh?

322
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,280
You did?

323
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,950
I'm doing my work experience here right now.

324
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,980
What?

325
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,980
What a coincidence.

326
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,480
I can't believe that while I was lost in nostalgia,

327
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,460
I'd end up raising a BL flag.

328
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,220
My work experience.

329
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,120
I'm so glad I chose this place.

330
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,350
Oh! You haven't paid!

331
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,940
I accidentally raised another flag.

332
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Oh.

333
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,830
Sweet, I won.

334
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,070
My work experience.

335
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,870
I'm so glad I chose this place.

336
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,370
Can I even go back for it now?

337
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
Bro, what's up?

338
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,990
Oh.

339
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,550
You won something.

340
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,810
Give it here.

341
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,920
No way, it's mine.

342
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,270
Why not?

343
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,830
It's not like you're gonna use it.

344
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,410
That's not it.

345
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,310
He won't be there next week.

346
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,830
I'll go redeem it then.

347
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,510
What are you talking about?

348
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,910
Nothing.

349
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,210
Hey, don't hide it.

350
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Give it to me.

351
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,200
No way.

352
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,020
I said give it to me!

353
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,110
Man.

354
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,930
I can't believe I raised a flag in a place like this.

355
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,320
I'll have to be more careful from now on.

356
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Later.

357
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,220
(Next Episode)
Next time on A Man Who Defies the World of BL...

358
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,540
Normally, I don't think much of it,

359
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,130
but when a guy takes off his shirt and he's ripped,

360
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,520
I can't help but feel a little thrilled.

361
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,480
Next time, on "A Man Who Defies the World of BL".

362
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,020
VS The Fight.

363
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,600
VS The Pairing.

364
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,070
We're bringing you two stories.

365
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Don't miss it.
