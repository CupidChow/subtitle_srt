1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I can do it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The doctor-specialized agent,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Kanenari Nalki,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is the one who sells the drugs to the hospital

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and gets the money.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
At the same time,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
he's been following the truth of the medical care

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that his father had three years ago.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I want to know the truth.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What happened at that oboe?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why did his father kill himself?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The monitoring was done properly.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
As planned,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Dr. Kuramochi performed the opal surgery.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What are you saying?

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Obviously, it's an emergency.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We'll continue as it is.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Dr. Kuramochi gave us the image of the record of the nurse.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm really sorry for being silent until now.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The truth that he used both money and people to get close to.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All that's left is to get him to take revenge.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He's going to face the cold iron.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The doctor-specialized agent,

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Kanenari Nalki,

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is the one who sells the drugs to the hospital

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and gets the money.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I want to know the truth.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to know the truth.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The doctor-specialized agent,

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Kanenari Nalki,

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
is the one who sells the drugs to the hospital

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and gets the money.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm really sorry for being silent until now.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The truth that he used both money and people to get close to.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He'll cut the white cloth and run away.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you need evidence to prove your innocence?

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But the electronic cartels

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and all the documents left by him

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
are all evidence that his father was jealous.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
On that day,

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
there are no records of the truth that happened in the extreme east.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then what should we do?

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well,

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we've come this far.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There's no need to panic.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I wrote a letter to the blood test doctor.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please forgive me tomorrow

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and take the examination.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thank you.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Take care.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Dr. Makiara.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Where are you going?

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
To the lab.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Before your personal research,

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
prepare the materials for tomorrow's meeting

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and the preparation of the image of the rent.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Will you take it?

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then I'll announce it.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is an important job for the medical department.

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
One for all.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm worried about the picture.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the coffee maker in my room is out of order.

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Will you take a look?

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's...

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Would you like this?

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What would you like to drink?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll have anything.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Then I'll have the rapsun tea.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Rapsun?

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It has a strong aroma and you can choose.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I didn't put it in the menu.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But if you get addicted to it,

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you may not be satisfied with it.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll have the regular tea.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll have the dajirin.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll have the rapsun.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If possible, please unify.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll have the dajirin.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I heard from Yorioka

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
that you are an excellent internal affairs officer.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I also heard about Mr. Naruki.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He's an agent who has good skills.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Two years ago, he was transferred to a university hospital.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
His performance in the military was good.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why do you want to change jobs?

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Actually,

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
he hates me,

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the general secretary of the military.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Tsukada?

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What kind of person is he?

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When I was there,

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:12,820
he was called the momentary

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was denied the thesis that Professor Tsukada had published in the past.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I was displeased.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Since then, I've been forced to leave the company

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
in one song, as if I were disrupting my research.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's a small person.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's small in his mind,

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but he's got a big attitude.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I came to the Far East in search of a good research environment.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I thought it would be meaningless to stay there.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Salary is the ideal position at the moment,

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
but more than that,

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I hope that the hospital has a good human relationship

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and a well-organized research environment.

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Is it difficult for me to get a job?

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can do it.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No.

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's possible even if it's not me.

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
First, these three.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Meisei University Hospital

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It is the largest hospital in the city

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and has a wide range of medical care centered on internal medicine.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Keisen General Hospital

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Research centers are established

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and doctors who are interested in research are popular.

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Showae General Hospital

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There is a proposal for the care of the after-exertion after surgery

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
with Keiretsu Hospital in Kyushu.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Wow, you got three NITs.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's really good.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If you think about his career, it's a good place.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It was a good proposal for the cost.

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There is no reckless mission.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
After all, the one who should have is an excellent after-exertion.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
After that, where do you choose yourself?

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, it's Dr. Connection.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Dr. Makihara?

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm talking about you right now.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What?

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Mr. Narukita, Dr. Makihara said he would quit the after-exertion.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So he's here.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What do you mean?

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
After-exertion hindrance.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is the melon I got the other day.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What?

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So, let's hear the reason.

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I told Professor Tsukada that I would quit the after-exertion.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then...

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You were hindered.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What?

149
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't think you should lose to that.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, it's not.

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Professor showed me his true self.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
To be honest,

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I would be in trouble if you quit.

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No, no, no.

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're good at communicating with patients.

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I'm the one who's counting on you.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry to burden you with your medical care.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm so sorry.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I've been too naive to you.

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Actually, I'm talking to the director about your after-exertion.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The director?

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're the star of the team.

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's the first time he's appreciated me so much.

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm thinking of working hard in the extreme.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think there's only one reason why a boss can stop you from after-exertion.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Because I'm a necessary person?

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Because you don't want to be underrated.

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What?

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll tell you.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is not only about your will.

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But for the management, you may be underrated.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I often say good things and try to make you stop working.

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But the professor said that you would evaluate me and think about the prize money.

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's just a matter of saying it.

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If you say after-exertion, you shouldn't be fired.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Do you know why?

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think it's because you're underrated.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And I don't think you should put a person who's underrated in an important position.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Especially in extreme situations, only those who swear loyalty to the master are elected.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's like a war-torn department.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You can't get a job with a sword.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can't leave such a thing with you.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No way.

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Please take the melon.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You started working after-exertion without much preparation.

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You made your boss say that you were underrated.

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then you were praised and you stopped working after-exertion.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're really underrated.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm underrated.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Anyway, if you don't change jobs, there's no choice.

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yoroka, please give me a break.

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes, sir.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll be bothering you in advance, but I won't be underrated.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll put it in.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm waiting.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Please wait.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What should I do?

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's the only answer in you.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Is there a hospital that can't decide its own path and wants to leave the diagnosis to a doctor?

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, I'll give you three days.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Until then, I want to see if you really need Professor Tsukada.

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Melon.

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I see.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You made it in time.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's a good start.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You know Tsukada's personality.

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Dr. Makiwara is a rare person in the research field.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But in this day and age, it's hard to be evaluated.

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Now, every university hospital is being cut off from female funds and falling into the fund.

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The university hospital has to take care of more patients to get the funds.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
As a result, the time for research is being reduced.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come on.

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes.

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Can you go to the foundation?

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes.

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Come on.

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I can't leave an important seat to a person who's not prepared.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I hope you notice that.

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll talk to you.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I wonder if you'll talk to me.

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
My father didn't leave the seat to me.

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry to leave the team with a broken heart.

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm sure you were frustrated.

228
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What do you mean?

229
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Three years ago, I was a doctor.

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I was not a father, but a blacksmith.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Blacksmith?

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Is that what Mr. Andos was talking about?

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
In fact, Kuramochi was practicing topology.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's why it was completely hidden.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You didn't report the lie by denying the OPE members and collecting the evidence?

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Of course Kuramochi deleted it right after the OPE.

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And you told your father all the responsibility.

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
How do you prove that?

240
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't burden Mr. Andos anymore.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There are only a few hospitals where you can see the after-mortem after you return.

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Kuramochi can't be an enemy of the OPE.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't think the testimony alone is enough.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Please thoroughly investigate Kuramochi.

245
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Investigate?

246
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He's a man who can do this.

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He's also likely to have other means.

248
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I want to find Topako.

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Topako?

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, I'm curious.

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:26,460
After I got out of that medical care, Kuramochi rushed to the director of Tendo and went into a

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How do you find out?

253
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Mr. Makiwara?

254
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I can take the time tonight, so the director wants to talk to you.

256
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Director Tendo?

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Today, I would like to introduce you to the ace of the general internal affairs, Makiwara.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm Makiwara.

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I know you well.

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You seem to be working hard on your research.

261
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes.

262
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You have a lot of will to go to war, and you are very dedicated to your research.

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Please sit down.

264
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Excuse me.

265
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It seems that Kuramochi is also writing a thesis on the Stift.

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, it's like a duty to be an OPE in the first round.

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I will read it in history.

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's about time for the director to vote.

269
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There is no doubt that the re-election of Director Tendo will be held again.

270
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is the election just a form?

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's not just a form.

272
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's a re-election because Director Tendo has continued to gain trust.

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Of course.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's a matter of thought that the organization will be established, but I'm still not confident.

275
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
If you support me, I will be very happy.

276
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I will also support the current system.

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Please.

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Excuse me, I'm about to go around here.

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, you're still here.

280
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Please take care of the draft of the draft.

281
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll talk about it now.

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's go home.

283
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Excuse me.

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Come on.

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm sorry, I'm a man who is not good at it.

286
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I wanted to prevent the flow of human resources.

287
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You can get out of what you want to get out.

288
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That will be the result for the medical industry.

289
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's what I think.

290
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Think about what you want.

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
By the way, Director Tendo, please be careful.

292
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Among young people, it seems that Professor Amino is being called Director of the next term.

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He's not the type to come out.

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
These days, the young people seem to like such people.

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm going to go home and sleep now.

296
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I respect Professor Amino.

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I wish for the development of medical technology.

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I also think about social contribution.

299
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Can I say it's a doctor's ideal?

300
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Of course.

301
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I agree, but he got hurt in his career with the case of Nalchi Masanari.

302
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's right.

303
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Nalchi Masanari was his punishment.

304
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Please be careful.

305
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Please give the right care to your subordinates.

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And one mistake.

307
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please give the right care to your subordinates.

308
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Please give the right care to your subordinates.

309
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Mai.

311
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mai.

312
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Mai.

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Mai.

314
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Mai.

315
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What's going on?

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Doctor.

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Doctor.

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Please calm down.

319
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Doctor.

320
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Please calm down.

321
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll take care of this.

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You go.

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Please go.

324
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I feel responsible.

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll sort out the facts immediately.

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You are ...

327
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What are you doing here?

328
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Please go home.

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Please go home.

330
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Calm down.

331
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Please go home.

332
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He is not guilty.

333
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Isn't that right?

334
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I have something to tell you.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I've heard that you are here to see me.

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You must have been hard.

337
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Your father did that.

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No.

339
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I still think that if topology was implemented at that time,

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
if the excellent Dr. Clampage had operated ...

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
As I said before, Mai's age is strong and suitable for topology.

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Please leave it to me.

343
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You are very enthusiastic.

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Thank you.

345
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Thank you.

346
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Thank you.

347
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Topology was performed as it was.

348
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It was later.

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I stopped because I was not satisfied with the standards.

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In that sense,

351
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I have a point to sympathize with your father.

352
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But after the surgery,

353
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Dr. Naruki was clearly in a bad mood.

354
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He seemed to be hiding something from us.

355
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I will tell you that there was no mistake in Dr. Naruki's surgery.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Dr. Naruki,

357
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
there is no doubt.

358
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes.

359
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The stift is used in this hand.

360
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Even though I was later accused,

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I ...

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We ...

363
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I can't forgive your father.

364
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I will forgive you.

365
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I will forgive you.

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I will forgive you.

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I will call you.

368
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Dr. Karamachi.

369
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Can you set up the dinner with the stifan?

371
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I will adjust.

372
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm glad to hear that.

373
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,840
In the future, the expansion of the stift is indispensable for the

374
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
operation of the member.

375
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Please.

376
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I understand.

377
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you for today.

378
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Do you always do that?

379
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Thank you for your work is important.

380
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Did you stop?

381
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes.

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm grateful if you put a lot of Lapsan numbers in the tea.

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If you put a lot, you won't be satisfied with the rest.

384
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I may not be able to get out anymore.

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Did you have any trouble?

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I was collecting information about the opening of the store.

387
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The evidence using his stift is in the paper, so it's easy to understand.

388
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
After all, it's the first person.

389
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's Tetsuya?

390
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Is that the kind of person who erases data?

391
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
At that time, topology was a valuable machine.

392
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Even if you failed.

393
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No, I want to keep the log data because I failed.

394
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's what an expert Saga is.

395
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Then...

396
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll call you.

397
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Please come in.

398
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Mr. Wasawa, please come out.

399
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Please sit down.

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You must be busy, and I wanted to change my mood.

401
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So, what's the conclusion?

402
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I checked the supply again from that day.

403
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I felt like I was being demoted.

404
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But I still have no evidence.

405
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What do you want to do?

406
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You decide for yourself.

407
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No...

408
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You can change your job.

409
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What?

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll give you a special conclusion.

411
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You should change your job.

412
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
However, when you quit, you should tell the professor honestly and honestly.

413
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll tell you the truth.

414
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You won't regret it.

415
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I won't let you.

416
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's rare to say that.

417
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Why are you here?

418
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hello, Mr. Kuramochi.

419
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Kuramochi?

420
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Are you changing your job in the hospital?

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're changing your job in the hospital?

422
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You're a good doctor.

423
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No way.

424
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
We came here for a different reason.

425
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Different reason?

426
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You'll see.

427
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I think Mr. Makiwara is okay with changing his job.

428
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But if I'm right, this road is a dead end.

429
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Are you going to sleep?

430
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm going to sleep.

431
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
A dead end?

432
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Wake me up when you're done.

433
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll let you sleep for an hour.

434
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But don't trust me.

435
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
He's asleep.

436
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Is he okay?

437
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I see.

438
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'll stop.

439
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes.

440
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
A dead end is...

441
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
...a normal thing.

442
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You do it after you've done one of the rites.

443
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I wonder if he forgot the favor he was given.

444
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
As I told you, the internal court has already decided.

445
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The feeling of going to the rites...

446
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm asking you to get rid of him.

447
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't think you can make a decent career without a dead end.

448
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Get out.

449
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Excuse me.

450
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Where are you changing your job?

451
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That's...

452
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You're going to leave with your back to the sand.

453
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
At least you should be honest with yourself.

454
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
When you quit, tell everything to Professor Nitsukada.

455
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Wait a minute. What's going on?

456
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I got a call from the Showa General Hospital.

457
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I want to get rid of Professor Makiwara.

458
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I can't tell you why.

459
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Is that true?

460
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The reason is definitely the job loss caused by Tsukada.

461
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You told him the truth, didn't you?

462
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yes.

463
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That was bad.

464
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But Mr. Naruki said it was a fair and honest decision.

465
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's not my fault. It's Tsukada's.

466
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I want you to be sure.

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's a good thing that you're a criminal.

468
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I think you wouldn't have been allowed to work without a death sentence.

469
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Death sentence?

470
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You have to work for two years before you change jobs.

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You have to work at a nearby hospital.

472
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That's a very polite habit.

473
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What are you going to do?

474
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I can't believe I'm going back to the theater.

475
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is a death sentence for harassment and bribes.

476
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You're going to change jobs.

477
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's not realistic to go back to the theater after you get Tsukada angry.

478
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But the other detectives...

479
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You refused.

480
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Isn't this a violation of the law?

481
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Violation of the law...

482
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What is appropriate to describe the current situation...

483
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Your change of job is a desperate situation.

484
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
No way.

485
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But I can do it.

486
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's not a question. It's a calculation.

487
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What do you mean?

488
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
First of all, you saw the real face of Professor Tsukada.

489
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You must have lost your desire to see the theater.

490
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's true.

491
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Then you just have to break the wall in front of you.

492
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Break the wall?

493
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't want to give up on putting a decent costume in the right environment.

494
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But how?

495
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yonaga.

496
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yes.

497
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Call your friend if you're going now.

498
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Friend?

499
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
What do you want?

500
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Information.

501
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The head of the Gokutou University Hospital is in a job loss.

502
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What?

503
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
He's working on the inside and outside of the department to get his subordinates to quit their job.

504
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
He trusts his right to change jobs.

505
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's reasonable.

506
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's reasonable.

507
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Really?

508
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
We'll continue to investigate, but if we take the right to the Gokutou University Hospital, it's a one-off.

509
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
If you don't move and don't get anything, it's a problem.

510
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I've already taken the right to the hospital.

511
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Are you fighting?

512
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
No way.

513
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Well, I'd like to thank you.

514
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
The jobless person in charge of the hospital is in trouble.

515
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I can't forgive the way you're not doing it.

516
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
If you're going to say that, bring me some evidence.

517
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I got it.

518
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
What?

519
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Let's go to the hospital.

520
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Thank you.

521
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The Gokutou University Hospital

522
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You were talking about the Gokutou University Hospital, weren't you?

523
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yes, but I can't trust the information provider.

524
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That hospital is known for its clean management under the Tendo Incha.

525
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It has a strong influence in the industry.

526
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What?

527
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm sorry if it's Isamiashi.

528
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I know.

529
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
What are you going to do?

530
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You're going to get a close look because you don't have any evidence.

531
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
There's only one way to break through.

532
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yonaga, it's a mission.

533
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Director Kazama.

534
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Mr. Naruki?

535
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's about Mr. Makiara's internal investigation.

536
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm sure I'll make this appointment.

537
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
What do you want this time?

538
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm fine with it, but I can't convince Mr. Makiara.

539
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm going to ask a well-known lawyer.

540
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
What?

541
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I think he'll be here soon.

542
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I can't believe you're leaving it to a lawyer.

543
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm Yonaga from SADA Law.

544
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Director Kazama, please.

545
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Here he comes.

546
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
If you're a lawyer, you can't arrest Izuwaru.

547
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm not lying.

548
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I just need to make the other person feel better.

549
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
This is...

550
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
a gold badge.

551
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's yellow.

552
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Are you a lawyer?

553
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Do you have any points?

554
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
No.

555
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Then...

556
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Please tell the director.

557
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Let's meet at court next time.

558
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
This is bad.

559
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm not bad.

560
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Please tell me the reason.

561
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:37,640
Are you a victim of a

562
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
In other words, you had the pressure to get rid of your opponent.

563
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's right.

564
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'll convince her.

565
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm sorry.

566
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'll talk to her.

567
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
What?

568
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What?

569
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What?

570
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What is it?

571
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Enough.

572
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You're not a lawyer.

573
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm just saying I came from the Law Office.

574
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The law is the government.

575
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I said I'd meet you at court.

576
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You'll meet me at court by chance.

577
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The judge is not in a hurry.

578
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I got the director's statement.

579
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Please do the rest.

580
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I understand.

581
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This was a very unreasonable mission.

582
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Please give me an additional reward.

583
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I did a great job.

584
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You can expect it.

585
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm waiting for the person I expect.

586
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What are you going to do after this?

587
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm going to put the last piece on.

588
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Is Mr. Kuramochi really the one?

589
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
All the documents for that operation were improved.

590
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
We were all deceived by Kuramochi.

591
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But you hid everything.

592
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Because of that, you were punished unfairly.

593
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I don't care about me.

594
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
My father was forgotten for his unfair responsibility.

595
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I couldn't protect it.

596
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Everything was written by Kuramochi.

597
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I still can't believe it.

598
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Please cooperate.

599
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
To atone for his sins.

600
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
He's going to the court.

601
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
His voice is loud.

602
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
He's small.

603
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Don't be like him.

604
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
He always does it for his own profit.

605
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
There must be something behind it.

606
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Don't look down on me.

607
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm a old man.

608
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm based on my faith.

609
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't care who the provider is.

610
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I think so.

611
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I won't forgive you for this.

612
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Kuramochi.

613
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
What?

614
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I hate to hide things.

615
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I heard that we'll be investigating this place.

616
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's go.

617
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'm Tendo.

618
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm Kitami.

619
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm the director of the Labor Standards Department.

620
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm here as a consultant based on Labor Standards Law 5.

621
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'll start now.

622
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'll report on the unauthorized work.

623
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
What kind of violation was there?

624
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You can follow the instructions.

625
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm sorry.

626
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm sorry.

627
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm sorry.

628
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's starting.

629
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I hope she's safe.

630
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
She's a very serious person.

631
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
She won't miss out on anything.

632
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You said you were under the influence of the Labor Standards Department.

633
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I was also under the influence.

634
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
When you quit the theater?

635
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yes.

636
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll report on it.

637
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Excuse me.

638
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Who are you?

639
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
We're the Labor Standards Department.

640
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
A consultant?

641
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Please leave the computer.

642
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
After the medical care three years ago,

643
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I tried to find out the truth.

644
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I searched the theater.

645
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But the opera members didn't open their mouths.

646
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I was the son of a doctor who dropped the reputation of the theater.

647
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I was treated coldly.

648
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
They said my father was trying to push the crimes he had committed to the surrounding.

649
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I contacted the parents of Mr. Mae Dousaka.

650
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But I couldn't face the son of Mr. Masanari.

651
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I thought I should go out and gather information.

652
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So I started the transfer.

653
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You were the agent in charge of the transfer, right?

654
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yes.

655
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But someone who was removed from the court for some reason was in charge of my transfer.

656
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Interference?

657
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I don't know who did it.

658
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But it's not unusual for a transfer to be interrupted by a theater.

659
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I was somehow stopped.

660
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You quit and became an agent?

661
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
To catch a transfer,

662
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
this job is more attractive and more expensive.

663
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You need military funds for any battle.

664
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yes.

665
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
A direct link?

666
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
What did he do?

667
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
He was trying to suppress the transfer.

668
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Suppress?

669
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
As far as I know, that hospital is clean.

670
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
No transfer or interruption.

671
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

672
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I see.

673
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Maybe I'm the investigation team leader?

674
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I don't have any bad points.

675
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Please withdraw.

676
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The software.

677
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yes.

678
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I will restore the mail that was deleted directly.

679
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Stop the business.

680
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'll finish it soon.

681
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm sorry.

682
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I found it.

683
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Three emails were deleted from the mobile terminal four minutes ago.

684
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
This is...

685
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
If you can use the Makiwara Shunichi, a member of the party,

686
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I will restore the way you and the party work together.

687
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Thank you.

688
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You're a genius.

689
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
This one too.

690
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You know the information of the transfer of Makiwara's staff.

691
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You put pressure on them and eliminated the internal court.

692
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
In addition, you also instructed your colleagues to increase Makiwara's workload.

693
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You are working to force labor in this hospital, aren't you?

694
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's...

695
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This is against the fifth rule of labor standards.

696
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I didn't mean to force labor.

697
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Makiwara, I'm glad you're here.

698
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
If I'm not a human being, I'll have to talk to you.

699
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It's a mistake to interfere.

700
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Mistake?

701
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's your fault.

702
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You threatened me.

703
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You put pressure on me.

704
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't want you to interfere with my career again.

705
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I...

706
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I've been working for you for so long.

707
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You don't have to say that.

708
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Director.

709
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Director.

710
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I have evidence.

711
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's impossible to escape.

712
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
For the sake of your pride and self-esteem,

713
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I will not allow you to interfere with your career.

714
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I...

715
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I will...

716
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I will fire you.

717
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I apologize as the person in charge of the hospital.

718
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I will take the blame and make a quick improvement.

719
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I promise.

720
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I will...

721
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I will report the punishment.

722
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I got the data from Director Tendo.

723
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
There is no problem with adopting Dr. Makiara.

724
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Thank you.

725
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
For the sake of the Showa Association Hospital,

726
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I've been able to increase the amount of fees to 9 million yen.

727
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
By the way,

728
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I have a favor to ask.

729
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Thanks to you, the surgery was successful.

730
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Thank you very much.

731
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Congratulations.

732
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
This is from Mr. Naruki.

733
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
The Showa Association Hospital in Fukuoka is a care center.

734
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You can also take care of the surgery in the storage room.

735
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
If you leave it to me,

736
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I will not borrow your hand.

737
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Now...

738
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I can leave the theater.

739
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You don't have to worry anymore.

740
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm sorry.

741
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I didn't say anything.

742
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm worried about Lin Ken.

743
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What do you mean?

744
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What should I do?

745
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Please inform Kuramochi that Lin Ken's information is leaked

746
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and that the data is being searched.

747
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
After that, he will hide something.

748
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Can you watch over him?

749
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
My father trusted you.

750
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I want to borrow your power.

751
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I want to borrow your power.

752
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You can't understand what happened.

753
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The contents are already taken.

754
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Three years ago,

755
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
you performed topology on Dr. Dousaka.

756
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And the data remains in the details.

757
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I can't escape anymore.

758
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You stopped topology because you didn't meet the criteria.

759
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You lied to me.

760
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You pushed everything on my father.

761
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I agree.

762
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Agree?

763
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Topology is a hope that saves patients in the future.

764
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
If the failure of the technology was discovered,

765
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
the development of medical care would be closed.

766
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Your father protected the medical care of the future.

767
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Are you going to tell me?

768
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
If you do that, his sacrifice will be in vain.

769
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Do you want to waste your father's life

770
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
with your cheap sense of justice?

771
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
What do you know about your father's suffering?

772
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Not only your father,

773
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
but also your family.

774
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I will never forgive you.

775
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The judgment is made at the meeting.

776
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I will make your sin clear.

777
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Wait.

778
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I think I was wrong.

779
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm sorry.

780
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But I could only follow your advice.

781
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
This is Yonaga.

782
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Mr. Ando has given more testimony.

783
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The failure occurred during the operation.

784
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Mr. Kuramochi tried to quit topology.

785
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
But...

786
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Mr. Kuramochi's words were not true.

787
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
He said he followed his advice.

788
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I thought I should stop using the stick

789
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and make sure everything is perfect.

790
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Mr. Kuramochi, you should be released.

791
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
But...

792
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I couldn't forgive you.

793
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The secret that followed...

794
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and the fact that you made your father sin...

795
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Who did you trust?

796
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Who?

797
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Tell me!

798
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I will tell you why I fired Professor Tsukada.

799
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I will explain it at the press conference tomorrow.

800
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You are late.

801
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Don't blame me.

802
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I was talking to you.

803
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You are rude.

804
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
This is not a case of Narukin Masanari,

805
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
but of Mr. Kuramochi.

806
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Please change the agenda.

807
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
About the person who gave Mr. Kuramochi instructions during the operation.

808
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Who is the person who put the blame on my father

809
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
and left the truth behind?

810
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I will put the blame on him.

811
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
You are being blamed.

812
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I will take care of the case.

813
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I will help you.

814
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I think there are more things I want to tell Mr. Naruki.

815
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I have found out.

816
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Finally.

817
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I will reveal all your sins to the truth.
