1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,200
A long time ago, back in the
village when I was a small boy,

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,240
a fire was eating the forest.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,600
People running and screaming.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,000
But me, I ran to the river
with my little cup to get water.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,896
They laughed at me.
"What are you doing?"

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,040
"What I can!" I shouted and
ran back to pour it on the fire.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,320
Suddenly, a blue box appeared
in the skies over the fire.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,016
And a man stood at
the door with a hosepipe.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,080
Spraying and spraying

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,400
until all the fires went out.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,976
He landed the box in the
middle of the burnt forest

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,600
and started scattering fresh seeds.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,936
I went over to thank him.

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,320
"Are you a farmer?" I asked.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,600
"No. I am the doctor."

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,960
We shook hands.
And that's how we met.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,616
Nice. Good. Great… great story.

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,176
And you're sure that
this doctor will come?

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Yes.

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,376
He always comes when needed.

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,040
- Hey!
- Walahi!

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,360
The doctor… we need
him now. It needs feeding.

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,736
You need to get me home.

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
I promise I am doing everything I can to

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
wait.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,440
Why did I not think of this before?

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,160
We can boost the vindicator if we go to…

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,736
- Of course!
- Go where?

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,040
Lagos, Nigeria.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,376
It has the largest communications
technology market in Africa.

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,720
And it's near omo's palace.

32
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,736
- Omo's palace?
- My favourite barbershop.

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,640
Omo, the owner, is a friend
of mine. We met in a fire.

34
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
Barbershop? But the
tardis does your hair.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,856
It does. It does.

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,040
I don't go there for
cuts. It's hard to explain.

37
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,496
Okay… try explaining.

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,720
2019. A great year.

39
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm not human.

40
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,560
I am an evolved life-form.

41
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
And

42
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,440
my body changes a lot.

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,120
It's the first time I've
had this black body.

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,160
In some parts of the earth
I'm now treated differently.

45
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,440
But here, in Africa, in that
barbershop, I'm accepted.

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,360
I'm able to forget.

47
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
We…

48
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,280
Boy, we…

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,440
We laugh. We tell stories. They…

50
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,480
Treat you like one of their own?

51
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Yeah.

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,280
My nan took me to India whenever
she could for the same reason.

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,320
You say you're not human, but that's
the most human thing ever, doctor.

54
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,880
Go on then. Take as long as you need.

55
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,120
This is gonna look so
nice on you. So nice.

56
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,336
Auntie!

57
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,256
I'm good, my guy.

58
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,040
Brother!

59
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,536
- Hey!
- Hey! How are you?

60
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Uncle.

61
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,216
- How far, now?
- How far, now? You're good?

62
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Yeah.

63
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,896
And that is why the
tortoise has a cracked shell.

64
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,376
- Omo?
- Doctor.

65
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,800
- Hey!
- Come in.

66
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I told you he would come.

67
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,296
You! You ruined the end now.

68
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,560
- It might not be enough.
- Excuse you?

69
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,456
Omo, who does he think he's talking to?

70
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,680
Wait. You're on the missing posters.

71
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,896
All of you. They're on the walls outside.

72
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,296
Rashid, tunde, obioma.

73
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,416
Doctor, you haven't come in years.

74
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,296
And standards have slipped. Damp
and misty outside, dusty in here.

75
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,480
It's not me.

76
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,160
New management.

77
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,816
Welcome.

78
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,240
I've been expecting you.

79
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,536
Welcome to my establishment.

80
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,040
Your establishment?
Why's the street deserted?

81
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,880
Why isn't obioma leaving?

82
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,456
Why are they on all the missing posters?

83
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
They cannot leave.

84
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,176
No one can.

85
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,256
You are the all-knowing doctor
who is supposed to save us

86
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,920
and you don't know anything?

87
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,736
Save you from what?

88
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,936
Rest… …obioma. He
hasn't been in years.

89
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,896
He doesn't know. He
never makes appointments.

90
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,776
Yes. Besides, appointments
never work in Africa.

91
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,496
What are you talking about?

92
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,280
Who's next?

93
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,240
Your hair.

94
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,296
We're running out of stories!

95
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,256
Look at his hair.

96
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Me. I've got this.

97
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,256
Once upon a time, a
great musician yo-yo ma,

98
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,536
was travelling through
Botswana collecting local music,

99
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,720
when he heard a shaman singing.

100
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,176
Yo-yo ma said, "stop. Wow.
I have to write this down."

101
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,320
He wrote a bit, then said, "carry on."

102
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,760
But the shaman sang a
completely different song.

103
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,016
Yo-yo ma said, "no. Sing the first one."

104
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,696
The shaman said, "I cannot.

105
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,456
The first time, an antelope
was in the distance.

106
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,536
Clouds covered the sun.

107
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,040
The second time, clouds had gone,
antelope disappear, so the song changed."

108
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,856
You see, in the old days,
music was a live thing.

109
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,976
But after industrial revolution,

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,856
people became obsessed with
producing identical things to package time.

111
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,896
But not in Africa.

112
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,016
That is why we say we will come
at 1:00 but won't arrive till 3:00.

113
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,880
So, appointments, bad idea.

114
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,496
I don't know how much more I can
take. The tension is getting unbearab

115
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,920
wow. Wow.

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,160
Incredible.

117
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,016
The drawings in the window are
a visual interpretation of his story.

118
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
Cool, right?

119
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,376
Dalek. Cybermen. Weeping angels.

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,416
You need to be getting
a cut for that to work.

121
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,280
They're all connected. The
windows, chairs, his clippers.

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,536
And you must tell a story, doctor.

123
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
We must feed it. It is always hungry.

124
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,400
What is hungry, omo?

125
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,720
The barber controls it. Him and Abby.

126
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,256
Are we under attack? Tardis? Hello?

127
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,016
Thank you again, Abby.

128
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,336
Abby?

129
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,880
Every day she brings us
food. We'd be lost without her.

130
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,040
I know that face.

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,520
Why do I know your face?

132
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,136
What have I done to...
we know who you are.

133
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,736
Intergalactic busybody time lord.

134
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,376
Last of his kind and so on.

135
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,656
So you told them, omo?

136
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,336
How could I not? You're
the greatest story I know.

137
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,856
Well, if you put it like that.

138
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,736
But why do I know her face? Abby.

139
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,920
The barber's assistant?

140
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,176
She told me that they both
used to work for her father,

141
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,416
but he was mean, so they left.

142
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,520
Her father?

143
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,736
And they're keeping you here?

144
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,320
Until we reach their destination.

145
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,520
We're travelling?

146
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,520
This is… omo, what is going on?

147
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
It's the barber.

148
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,080
He turned up one day and offered
to give me a haircut in my own shop.

149
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,936
I thought it was a nice
thing. I said, "okay."

150
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,640
He brought out his own clippers.

151
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,696
And as soon as they touched me, a sort
of current just ran through the whole shop.

152
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,360
And like magic, like witchcraft, it
seemed to transfer itself, its soul to him.

153
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,056
I tried to open the door.
My keys didn't work.

154
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,216
Tried to stop my clients, but
the shop demanded a select few.

155
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,800
The ones who love this
place. They pushed in.

156
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,280
These are men I've known for years.

157
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,400
Decades. They're like sons to me.

158
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,960
I came to get a trim for my
child's naming ceremony.

159
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,400
My wife…

160
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,656
We'd been married for less than a year.

161
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,696
I'm an athlete. Relay, 100 metres.

162
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,216
I came to get a cut for the championship.

163
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,560
I miss my team and my
big sister. She trained me.

164
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,560
My mother is in hospital.

165
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,376
Omo was lending me
money for her medicine.

166
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
I wanted a fresh cut to see her.

167
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,840
There's someone
waiting for me too, doctor.

168
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,096
The girl with the blue
earrings the day we met.

169
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,720
We both came to the city together,

170
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,280
but I spent most of my time in here

171
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,456
and not enough with her.

172
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,536
So, whose story will enchant us now?

173
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,321
- I don't... I don't have anything.
- You don't have to say anything.

174
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
I'll speak.

175
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,680
Let me out.

176
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,880
Tell a story.

177
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,576
- It's the only way.
- I changed my mind.

178
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,616
Doctor, tell it for us. It will
be easier for you. A big story.

179
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,896
Okay. You want a story about
weeping angels and ice warriors,

180
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,840
but nothing is more
vivid than an ordinary life.

181
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,896
One person. Belinda.

182
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,456
On any given day, nurses are knackered,
and after a 13-hour shift, she was done.

183
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,176
His pictures are alive.

184
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,416
She was going home,
but she heard something.

185
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,056
Belinda, could you take her obs?

186
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,880
We need bloods, X-ray
for her chest and iv fluids.

187
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,336
Hypotensive, systolic's at 89.

188
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,736
Tachycardic is under
100. Vomited a few times.

189
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,816
It's okay.

190
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Infection? Maybe gastroenteritis.

191
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,800
Have you considered steroids?

192
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,096
What, for a chest infection?

193
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,320
No, her fingers. She's
got rheumatoid arthritis.

194
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,976
Might have put herself
in an addisonian crisis.

195
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
Here. Hyperpigmentation.

196
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,376
No, it's too subtle. It's barely there.

197
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,416
Dehydration, nausea, vomiting.

198
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,736
An addisonian crisis
can present like this.

199
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,200
It happened to my nan.
Without steroids she could die.

200
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
You're right. She's yours.

201
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,840
It's my nan's birthday.

202
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,160
All night, she guarded that frail life.

203
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,056
Sacrificing her own joy…

204
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,880
We're speeding up?

205
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,680
…fighting her tiredness.

206
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,520
Until the doctors wheeled her away.

207
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,816
Two weeks later,
belinda was leaving work.

208
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,920
- Hi, belinda. Just picking up my pills.
- Hi.

209
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,320
Don't be silly. I'll be there
around 7:00. Love you, nan.

210
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,496
It's you. Up on your feet. Wow.

211
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,600
I know what you did for me.

212
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,096
Well, the doctors took
over, but you saved my life.

213
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,200
Thank you.

214
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,120
The batteries are full. Fullest
they've been since the early days.

215
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,816
First time is the hardest.

216
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,856
From now, it will be as
easy as getting a haircut.

217
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,040
What is happening?

218
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,680
You were right, omo.

219
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,776
His stories alone can
super-power the engine.

220
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,816
You see? Look.

221
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,000
Look how much his hair has
grown. You can let us go now.

222
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,120
This changes everything.

223
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,056
We'll get there sooner.

224
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,600
You can finally take the
throne and rule fairly. Justly.

225
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
I must recalibrate the engine.

226
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,696
Such raw power.

227
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,960
Check the stasis field
for structural damage.

228
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,440
Then let's meet in the engine room.

229
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,480
It's okay. Just relax, okay?

230
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,920
Tardis, locate origin! Show source!

231
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
The barbershop?

232
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,096
- …now, look at this.
- No. I don't want any. Thank you.

233
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,296
I'm in a rush. Sorry.

234
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,816
I will give you discount.

235
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,496
Madam, you must pay for this.

236
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Sorry, I.

237
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,936
I have no money.

238
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,520
Who they cause trouble?

239
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,880
You planned this, omo?

240
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,616
I have to get these men home.

241
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,536
And because I have no home,
I'm what? I'm expendable?

242
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,760
Their families need them.

243
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,536
And I have none, so I don't matter?

244
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,536
No. No, doctor. Doctor, you have
stories. That's all I was thinking.

245
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,096
I love this shop.

246
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,360
I loved you, omo.

247
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,280
I thought it was a home for me.

248
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
I was safe.

249
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,536
So, he's not here now.
Open the door and go.

250
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,736
- We can't.
- You can.

251
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,696
- There's nowhere to go.
- I opened it from the outside.

252
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,616
It's different from inside.

253
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,656
- Doctor, doctor, doctor...
- do not talk to me ever again.

254
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,680
I trusted you with both of my
hearts, with everything that I am.

255
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,320
How could you?

256
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,296
Look, it doesn't matter. If he opens
that door, none of us are getting out

257
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,936
- got it.
- No!

258
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,096
No!

259
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,000
What the hell is this?

260
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,320
You are confused, aren't you, doctor?

261
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,680
The shop is in outer space
and in Lagos at the same time.

262
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
How?

263
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,296
And that… that structure that I saw?

264
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,440
The nexus.

265
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,040
I used to call it the world wide web

266
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:57,240
until the humans named
something far uglier after that.

267
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,240
There is a time-space
compressor that goes between,

268
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,200
that is built into the door frame.

269
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,800
That only lets her and myself out.

270
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,440
We control it.

271
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,016
And we're travelling on a spider?

272
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,840
Wait, you saw the beast?

273
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,520
Impossible, but true.

274
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,920
A spider that they control.

275
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,120
Where are we going?

276
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,720
You'll find out soon enough.

277
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,456
Doctor.

278
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,816
Wait, is that… it took you long enough.

279
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,616
Alarms on the tardis
must have been going off.

280
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,136
Yeah. Nearly blew my ears off.

281
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,800
You're the nurse from his story.

282
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Your companion?

283
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,896
So where have you been?
Did he leave you behind?

284
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,216
Tell you to wait?

285
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,200
No. I told him to go actually.

286
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,200
Wait. You're all missing.

287
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,360
Doctor, what's going on?

288
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,120
- And who is that?
- I'm still figuring that one out.

289
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,280
All he has done is stomp around,
giving people awful haircuts.

290
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,720
And… and they are all scared of him.

291
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
He…

292
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,736
Who hides his identity like a coward.

293
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,160
A troll on the web.

294
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,960
Don't be scared.

295
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,160
We will leave here.

296
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
There is nothing that he can do.

297
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,480
He has no real power.

298
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,960
You want to know who I am?

299
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,880
I go by many names.

300
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,720
Anansi, the man-spider.

301
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Saga, the norse goddess.

302
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,616
Bastet.

303
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,656
Dionysus, the Greek god of theatre.

304
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,760
Even loki, god of mischief.

305
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,720
I have been them all.

306
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,456
In many cultures, in many
worlds, in many incarnations.

307
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,816
It does not matter what I am called.

308
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,136
It matters who I am, what I do.

309
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,096
- And what is it that you do?
- I begin all things!

310
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,776
I am the voice in the empty void.

311
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,816
I am the spark.

312
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,296
The seed. The dark nucleus.

313
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,696
The lie that tells the truth.

314
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
The well of words.

315
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,056
The godfather griot.

316
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,656
The djeli before.

317
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,960
The tall tale itself.

318
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
And this, doctor…

319
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,320
This…

320
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,256
Is my domain.

321
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,560
This barbershop?

322
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,376
Our barbershop?

323
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,056
- Yes.
- And you were all those story lords?

324
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,216
Yes.

325
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,560
All those gods. You?

326
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Are you sure?

327
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Yes.

328
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,776
Why are you laughing?
What's so funny?

329
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
I don't know.

330
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,800
He's lying to you. He's lying.

331
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,200
I met dionysus.

332
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,416
We drank so much wine, we
caused a drought in Athens.

333
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,176
Saga and I watched marvel
movies up until endgame.

334
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,976
She didn't like Thor.
Muscles were too small.

335
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,176
I played chess with bastet.

336
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,416
I let her think that
she let me let her win.

337
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,920
She kicked my ass thoroughly.

338
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:08,536
And anansi purposely lost a bet to
make me marry one of his daughters.

339
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,040
I know the gods.

340
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,176
You are not them.

341
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,280
Tell the truth.

342
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,440
Who are you?

343
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,856
You don't have to answer them.

344
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,936
Look at me. Don't let him get to you.

345
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,320
Who are you?

346
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,040
I was the one behind them all.

347
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
It was me.

348
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,480
I was once human.

349
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,320
Whenever we told stories, the
storytelling gods would grow in power.

350
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,056
The gods needed to strengthen
their bonds with humanity.

351
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,856
Wherever they told stories, I went.

352
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,936
I told their myths, their legends.

353
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,256
Cleaned them up, printed them in books
so that the gods could be worshipped.

354
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,360
That was my job.

355
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,840
They only exist now…

356
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,080
Because of me.

357
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,240
My work.

358
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,256
- And the nexus?
- He built that too.

359
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,936
I wanted something like the brain.

360
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,976
Flexible, strong, that could expand
and make connections between ideas.

361
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,576
So I took a strand of their gods'
blood and essence, and built a model.

362
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,176
A web-like structure that they
expanded to what you saw now,

363
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,336
cross-connecting
concepts, cultures and ideas.

364
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,896
The nexus.

365
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,576
How did you collect the stories?

366
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,176
I started small.

367
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,616
A pub lit by candles, a
catholic church confession box,

368
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,336
a coal-powered theatre,

369
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,896
an electric cinema, a space opera.

370
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,096
Until I had the idea to power
the vehicle with stories itself.

371
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,696
I worked for centuries,

372
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,880
and all I wanted was to be recognised.

373
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,320
They told me that I
should know my place.

374
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,656
I primed the nexus so well
that it worked without me.

375
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,176
So they threw me out.
Out of my life's work.

376
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,776
All I salvaged was my story engine.

377
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:53,280
We will have vengeance, doctor.

378
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,856
We have stopped moving.

379
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,456
The engine burned too much energy holding
us together when he forced the door open.

380
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,976
Typical doctor. Irresponsible.

381
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,800
I have never… wait.

382
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,216
That's it.

383
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,536
Abby, the daughter of anansi.

384
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,296
Abena. That is your full name, isn't it?

385
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,456
Don't you dare speak it.

386
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,456
You are not worthy.

387
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,416
I grew up trapped with anansi,

388
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,416
terrified someone would win me in a bet.

389
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,976
I'd heard about you
travelling through time.

390
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,016
I had faith you would help.

391
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,840
Instead, you left me.

392
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
I'm here because of you.

393
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,440
You humiliated me, doctor.

394
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,120
You look so different now.

395
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,640
I am sorry that I
couldn't take you with me.

396
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,776
I was a fugitive back then.

397
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,416
Anansi was wrong to offer that bet.

398
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,976
And, frankly, darling,

399
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,400
I was busy in a different story
that might be finished one day.

400
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,040
- You actually took that bet?
- I tried to lose.

401
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,080
Sit, doctor. Talk now.

402
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,040
Where are we going?

403
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,696
- To the heart of the nexus.
- To do what?

404
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,520
To install the shop there

405
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,720
and make him storyteller supreme,

406
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,896
a trustworthy and careful god.

407
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,336
That is what he's told you?

408
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,416
That he's gonna become everything
that he hates and despises?

409
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,976
And you believe him?

410
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,280
He would not lie to me.

411
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,776
We need a story, now!

412
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,736
I know vengeance, and I can taste his.

413
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,696
It is bile black and bitter.

414
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,216
You are planning something.

415
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,600
What? What? There's nothing I can do.

416
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm trapped here. Tell me.

417
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,696
Tell me!

418
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,496
To cut them out of memory!

419
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,240
The gods. All of them.

420
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,376
Severing the gods from the story web,

421
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,440
cutting them from their
essence will destroy them.

422
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,216
Destroy?

423
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,376
As in kill, die, dead as a doornail.

424
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,456
Done. All the gods, gone.

425
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,936
That would destroy your father.

426
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,616
This is my gift to you.

427
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,776
Abena, remember what he did to you.

428
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,880
Betting you. His own child.

429
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,856
Humans are tied to the gods.

430
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,776
Destroying them would harm
the very essence of humanity.

431
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,776
A world without stories. How
would they pass on tradition?

432
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,416
- You knew about this plan?
- No, no.

433
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,840
Is this what you want, abena?

434
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,376
We need power. Now!

435
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,816
Doctor, you need to sit and talk.

436
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,736
Doctor, please. Okay,
do what he says, okay?

437
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,616
We have to get back home. Our families.

438
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,216
- I can't help him do this.
- Please.

439
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,976
Abena, hurt people hurt people.

440
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,416
Your father hurt you.

441
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,920
The difference between good
and evil is what we do with that pain.

442
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,216
- Enough. Put him in the chair.
- With pleasure.

443
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,896
- Rashid, come.
- No, no, no, no, no. Wait.

444
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,896
- No. Rashid, please, wait!
- I promise I will get you home.

445
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,416
- Please, doctor.
- I will get you home.

446
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,736
You do not want to do this!

447
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,216
- Doctor!
- Hold him down. Hold him down.

448
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,720
We have to get back
home. Okay? I'm sorry!

449
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,976
Stop! Stop! Stop!

450
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,080
I will talk. I will tell a story.

451
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,760
Please, doctor.

452
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Trust me.

453
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,160
In a time of slavery and deep suffering,

454
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,360
the slaves who broke
their chains and escaped

455
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,600
would return to try to free others.

456
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,280
Slaves were not allowed to carry paper.

457
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
They were always
stopped and searched.

458
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,520
But the women were very clever.

459
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,376
They could make their hair
into many shapes and patterns,

460
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,496
and in one style, hair could
be braided to the scalp,

461
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,000
bending and curling like roads or paths.

462
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,760
So the women would weave
maps into their hair and pass it on.

463
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Mothers to daughters.

464
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,880
Slave to slave.

465
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,656
Plantation to plantation.

466
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,936
And the slave masters
never checked their hair,

467
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,280
so they shared routes like
this and escaped to freedom.

468
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,120
Exactly.

469
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,440
There. All done.

470
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,520
And battery levels are good.

471
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,016
For now.

472
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
You look good.

473
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,120
So good I could kiss myself.

474
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,176
It's a shame I might have to ruin it.

475
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,136
- Why?
- You'll find out soon enough.

476
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,536
Belinda, now.

477
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,656
Took you long enough.

478
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,120
Oi! Just trying to concentrate.

479
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,800
Abena gave me the map to freedom.

480
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,520
This way. Come on.

481
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,840
Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

482
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,960
This way. Run.

483
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,600
You did this?

484
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,776
I'm revoking your access.

485
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,600
No!

486
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,400
You lied to me for all these years.

487
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
I will handle the others.

488
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,280
The map leads to here.

489
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,800
The story engine.

490
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,296
A beating heart inside a brain?

491
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,640
Brilliant. What else is a story?

492
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,520
What else could hold all stories?

493
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,656
Quick. Quick. That control desk.

494
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,136
Start ripping out all of the wires, yeah?

495
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,600
I need to disrupt the flow of power.

496
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,160
Get away from my heart.

497
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,080
You have done nothing. Nothing!

498
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,896
We are still on track,
and then I will cut them off.

499
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,656
All the gods! They will shrivel up and die!

500
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,736
You did all this to kill them?

501
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,160
Of course. They deserve it.

502
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,816
Rubbish! This is your ego.

503
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,176
- Wanna hear a story?
- No,

504
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,640
- don't give him any more power.
- Really short! Really short.

505
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,936
You know Hemingway?

506
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,976
I saw some of his books
back there. I met him.

507
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,176
I wanted to see how good
he was, so I challenged him.

508
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,976
"Hemmy, baby, write me
the shortest story you can."

509
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,920
He wrote it in six words. Short
as hell. Do you wanna hear mine?

510
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,880
I'm born.

511
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,240
I die.

512
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,856
I am born!

513
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,576
You are giving me power? But how?

514
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,336
I am not connected to you!

515
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,616
No. The engine is connected to me,

516
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,056
my stories, my voice.

517
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,296
Look. On!

518
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,416
…universe can do what we're doing.

519
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,720
Just this once!

520
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,896
I'm the doctor. I'm a time lord.

521
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,216
When you fire that first shot,
no matter how right you feel,

522
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,256
you have no idea who's going to die.

523
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,416
When people need help, I never refuse.

524
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,856
I am definitely not the man I was.

525
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,056
My body is like a barbershop.

526
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:00,056
All of them inside, telling
their stories, bickering.

527
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,856
I will not fail them.

528
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,816
You told a never-ending story?

529
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,336
And gave me never-ending power?

530
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,096
He's taken out a third of the engine.

531
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,376
You can't process that power.

532
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,136
Your engine could overload and explode!

533
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,240
We'll all be sucked into space!

534
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,560
You will not do that?

535
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,720
You will not!

536
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
No! No!

537
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Would you?

538
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,976
The stories say you protect life

539
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,416
that is what I am doing.

540
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,056
You destroy the gods, you
wreck seven billion lives!

541
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,880
- Seven billion, or us!
- No. No!

542
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,296
I control the engine,
you control the doors.

543
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,920
Let them out.

544
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,400
You were once mortal.

545
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:09,560
Their lives and their stories
will end because of you.

546
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,536
Do you want that?

547
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,160
Do you?

548
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,936
The shop is compressing. The
corridor is now a straight line.

549
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,896
Go. You go.

550
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,376
I will be right behind you. Yeah?

551
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,416
Belinda, I will be right behind you.

552
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,240
- Okay? Okay?
- Okay.

553
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,080
I'll wait for you!

554
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,400
- Go!
- Go!

555
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,736
What are you doing?

556
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,256
Listen to me.

557
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,616
What would your six-word story be?

558
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,360
What would the essence of your life be?

559
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,120
I want you to live long enough to write it.

560
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,760
Don't let this be how your story ends.

561
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
- Doctor! Doctor!
- Go back! Go back!

562
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,480
- No! Where is he?
- He'll make it. He'll make it.

563
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,176
- There they are!
- Come, come, come quick! Come!

564
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,976
Doctor! Doctor!

565
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,120
Okay. All right.

566
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,440
Thank you for keeping
your promise, doctor.

567
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,560
Abby, he rescued us,
but you… you kept us alive.

568
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,520
Rise.

569
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,696
And, little brother, run, like the wind.

570
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,080
Go, go, go.

571
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,496
Run. Greet your families for me.

572
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,736
I'll win all the races!

573
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,896
I'm going to find my wife
and child! And my mother!

574
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,240
All I wanted was to
be credited for my work.

575
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,320
I've spent my entire
existence serving the gods.

576
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,480
What will I do now?

577
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,856
What you do best.
Keep collecting stories.

578
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,816
Start your own barbershop.

579
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,080
No need. I'm retiring.

580
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,000
I shouldn't have… I thought
you could handle anything.

581
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,536
I can because you look after me too.

582
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,360
But you are part of my community.
I should have protected you.

583
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,520
I'm sorry.

584
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,720
I'm sorry too.

585
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Yeah.

586
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,880
Take care.

587
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,760
Let all this settle and continue.

588
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,640
Me? I don't belong here.

589
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,680
I don't even have a
name for people to trust.

590
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,736
Try "adétòkundbo."

591
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,800
My father's name.

592
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Thank you.

593
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,640
I don't deserve this kindness.

594
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,560
So what will you do now?

595
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,480
Anything I want.

596
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,320
I understand if you hate him.

597
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,400
I won't have that in my heart.

598
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,056
What did you say?

599
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,720
"Hurt people hurt people."

600
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,936
Imagine. A mortal
teaching a god life lessons?

601
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,496
Thank you, doctor.

602
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,000
I will be back for a haircut

603
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,880
and for that six-word story.

604
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
Good luck.

605
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,040
Did you see a child?

606
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,416
A child?

607
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,000
Yeah. I saw a spooky kid back there.

608
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,640
I didn't see anything.

609
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,520
But the stories were
leaking out, getting mixed up.

610
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,856
Okay. Well, you have
to tell me about omo.

611
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,680
Omo!

612
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,600
It's a long story, but…

613
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,800
Once upon a time…

614
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,200
Welcome to the 803rd
interstellar song contest.

615
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,576
- At arms.
- I will survive. I will find you.

616
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,336
You can still help those people.

617
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,400
Pop.

618
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,576
Can't we call for rescue?

619
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,776
Doctor!
