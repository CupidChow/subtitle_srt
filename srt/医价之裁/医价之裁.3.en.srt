No! No, no, no.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,640
So, if we can't get home,

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,000
and if the TARDIS isn't broken,
then it means what?

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,080
Planet Earth is broken or 2025 is broken?

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,000
Have we been invaded or hit by
a meteor or swatted by a giant moth?

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,040
Oh.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,840
Imagine a moth that big!

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,080
But really?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
'Cause my parents are back home.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,280
And if this is Friday,
then they go to this bar with their mates

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,520
and my dad sings and everyone laughs
and then the whole room ends up singing.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,040
Is that still happening, Doctor?

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Are they safe?

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,400
I hope so.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,400
You hope?

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,080
Come here.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,760
I will meet your mum and dad.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,480
And I will make your dad laugh.

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,360
And your mum can whistle at my behind.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,880
And I will sing. I will do the singing.

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,280
That is a promise.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,040
You can't promise.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
Look at me.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
I can.

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
I will.

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,400
I do.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,400
Oh. [chuckles]

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,720
Right. Right.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,600
Belinda Chandra, we go out there,
we take another Vindicator reading,

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,120
because each single reading
brings us closer to home.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,480
Where have we landed?

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Uh…

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,440
Oh.

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,400
500,000 years in the future.
We have jumped, baby.

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,480
But that's massive.

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,520
Do we still exist?

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,880
I mean… I mean me, I mean human beings.

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,040
Is there still a human race
in 500,000 years?

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,840
There is always a human race.

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,520
You voyage out there and own it.

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,680
Far and wide, across the stars.

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,640
-Come and see?
-W-Wait.

43
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
Do they still speak English?

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,600
The TARDIS translates.

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Try it.

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,960
Do we get to change our clothes?

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,880
Girl, you are beginning to enjoy this!

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,280
At last. Come on!

76
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,560
Explain yourselves.

77
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Immediately.

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,920
My name is the Doctor.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,360
This is Nurse Belinda Chandra.

80
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,160
Who's your commanding
officer back at base?

81
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,760
Squadron Leader Chinchappa.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,480
Well, I'm higher than Chinchappa.

83
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
See?

84
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,960
Apologies.

85
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,720
I am Platoon Leader Shaya Costallion.

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,560
I was not informed of your presence.

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,880
Well, that's the point.

88
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,920
We're like mystery shoppers.

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,240
Now, we just need to vindicate--

90
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Done. Babes, we're vindicated.

91
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,240
And now you can return us to our blue box

92
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,440
which is in your ship thing in the sky.

93
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,480
-Immediately.
-But how do we do that?

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,200
This is a test?

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
-Yes.
-Yes.

96
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,920
-Yes. Yes.
-[Belinda] Yes.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,480
This is Planet 6-7-6-7 and the atmosphere
is charged with Galvanic Radiation.

98
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,240
It would strip the engines bare.

99
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,400
The ship needs to
slide down at retrograde velocity.

100
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,000
Which will take how long?

101
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Five hours.

102
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,440
So,

103
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,520
we've got five hours?

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
Can we breathe for five hours?

105
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,280
You can breathe in
that suit for five months.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,080
Correct answer. Good.

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,320
So, imagine I don't know
anything about this mission.

108
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,320
Tell me, from scratch,

109
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,520
what the hell are you doing here?

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Because Galvanic Radiation is tough.

111
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,320
Nothing can live on a rock like this,
but you've travelled all this way.

112
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,960
What for?

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,600
Colony Base 15.

114
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,280
Basic mining operation with
a mercury drop-line,

115
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,120
stripping a layer of Carbon 46.

116
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,720
Fifteen days ago all contact was lost.

117
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
Base went silent.

118
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,280
-How many colonists?
-Thirty-five.

119
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,960
Trooper 3, any signs of life?

120
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,360
Nothing. No movement.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,160
No damage to the dome.

122
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,440
We can't scan for heartbeats because
of the radiation, so there's still hope.

123
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,760
Hope is irrelevant.

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,400
Thank you.

125
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120

126
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,680
The airlock only takes six.

plus Troopers 1 to 3.

128
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,720
Troopers 4 to 9, follow us in.

129
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,840

you have permission, shoot to kill.

I keep thinking,

135
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,240
this planet's uninhabited,
but they're mining.

136
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,760
-Could something live underground?
-Impossible.

137
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,440
That radiation,
it soaks through everything.

138
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,080
Right down to the core.

139
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,400
This whole world is cold,
lifeless and dead.

140
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,840
You should stay suited.

141
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,600
Oh, I'm just not loving the look, babes.

142
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,040
I come in peace.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,160
It's not appropriate to call me babes.

144
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,920
Okay, hon.

145
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,640
We have a body.

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,200
-Don't touch them!
-No, but they might still be alive.

Okay, no. Sorry, that's…
They've been dead for a while.

half of them have been assaulted.

-It could be the killer.

178
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,360
It could be both.

00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,960
I have a daughter on Monpasso.

185
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
And she's with her grandad
and she's two years old.

186
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,200
And I just want to see her.

187
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,640
That's Sal.
I shot her, all right. I did it.

188
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,240
But she were gonna kill me.

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
You, do not move.

190
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,640
Eyes on me at all times.
Do you understand?

191
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes.

192
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Who are you?

193
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,200
My name is Aliss Fenly
and I just want to go home.

194
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,640
Confirmed on the manifest.

195
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,520
Aliss Pabba Fenly, 28.
Citizen of Monpasso.

196
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,840
One daughter, Pelody.

197
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,400
I need you to keep everything audible.
No private conversations.

198
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,320
-[Doctor] Okay. Gotcha.
-Yes.

199
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,840
It doesn't matter the year.

200
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,880
Signing still makes some people paranoid.

201
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,520
Hi. My name is the Doctor.

202
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,560
I don't need a doctor.
I just want to go home.

203
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,840
Aliss, tell us exactly what happened.
Why did you kill this woman?

204
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,400
But they all…

205
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,640
They all went mad.

206
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,000
Every single person
just went mad and it all happened so fast.

207
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,560
But not you?

208
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,160
But that's Sal and she was my friend.

209
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,720
But she was gonna kill me
with her bare hands.

210
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,640
I have never fired a gun in my life,
but what else could I do?

211
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
I'm just a cook.

212
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,520
I've been here for 12 months
and I cooked for them and that's all.

213
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,600
But it's not even cooking.

214
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,680
I just open a flat-pack protein
and add some salt.

215
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,560
And that's what I do every single day.

216
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,480
But I had to kill my best friend.

217
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,080
Are you hurt?

218
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,080
I'm sorry, I don't know how to sign.

219
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,800
But your arm, does it hurt?

220
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
I ran and I fell.

221
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,080
Everyone was panicking.

222
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,280
-Can I--
-Do not approach.

223
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,400
Oh, come on.

224
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,960
Do I just clip it on?

225
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,520
Yeah. Just… There you go.

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,640
Just talk.

227
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,560
Hi.

228
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,120
It's okay.

229
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm a nurse.

230
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,520
A nurse who can't sign?

231
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,320
That's against the law.

232
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,960
Well, we have different laws.

233
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,360
But you're right, it should be the law.

234
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,000
Aliss. Can I ask?

235
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,760
You've been on your own for a long time?

236
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,480
Fifteen days.

237
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,840
[Doctor] Hmm.

238
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,000
What happened? Do you know?

239
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,920
They all went crazy.

240
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,160
Was there noise?

241
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480
A gas?

242
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,400
This mineshaft operates as a mercury drop.

243
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,440
Was there any mercury that escaped?

244
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,720
-I don't know.
-Why did they smash all the mirrors?

245
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,480
It's okay. It's okay.

246
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,560
Is there a medical pack or something?

247
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,720
So we just abandon all protocol,
is that it, ma'am?

248
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,600
Well, she doesn't look like she could
break the necks of half the crew.

249
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,880
You hope. And hope is irrelevant.

250
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,600
Okay.

251
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,880
Doctor, we need to get to Central Control.
Stay here if you want--

252
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Oh, I gotta see that.

253
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,640
I won't be long. Belinda's got you. Yeah?

254
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,920
Bel, be careful of her.

255
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,200
I can still lip-read.

256
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,040
Troopers, 2 to 6, stay on guard.

257
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,000
Clear the body.

258
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,200
Fifteen foot radius round
Aliss Fenly at all times.

259
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,200
Any sign of trouble, shoot to kill.

260
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,680
Sorry it's only a basic pack.

261
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,560
Um, thanks, but I don't know
what any of this is.

262
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,640
You're a funny sort of nurse.

263
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,720
Well, that has been said.

264
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,120
I suppose it's common sense.

265
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,160
Bandages, swabs.

266
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,280
Simolin!

267
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,760
It's just a graze.

268
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,480
I'm gonna clean it
and then it will stop stinging.

269
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
I know you've had a terrible time.

270
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
But we're gonna do
everything we can to help.

271
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,960
That's so kind.

272
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,640
All clear, safe to proceed.

273
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
No bodies.

274
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,560
Maybe they ran from this place first.
That's a nice thought.

275
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,320
So, what? This is the seed-well, yeah?

276
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,640
This is where they first dropped
the mercury-lines and drilled down.

277
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,840
Capable of hauling up two
blades of Carbon 46 every day.

278
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,640
[Doctor] Hello!

279
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
No one home.

280
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,880
A well that runs five miles deep
beneath the planet's crust.

281
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,560
Where light has never been before.

282
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Nothing's responding.

283
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,520
Someone's put a good old-fashioned
restraining bolt on the system.

284
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
There.

285
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,120
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Don't hit the roof.

286
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,040
Careful, boss.

287
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,840
Good shot.

288
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,360
I was brought up in the wildlands.

289
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,240
Shooting drought-sharks
from the age of six.

290
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,400
I could run faster than a snake-lighter.
That's how I got into the forces.

291
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,120
Fourteen years old.

292
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
That's a bit young.

293
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,920
The fight began the day I was born.

294
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,120
I'm a citizen of Lombardo.

295
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,680
Oh.

296
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Tough.

297
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,480
Brutal.

298
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,560
So in this century Lombardo's
a joint foundation with Planet Earth.

299
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,280
-Belinda's from Earth.
-From where?

300
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,520
Planet Earth.

301
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,440
-Never heard of it.
-Stupid name for a planet.

302
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
But the human race, you've heard of that?

303
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,120
Not in these parts.

304
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
But Earth is part of
the foundation right now, that's a fact.

305
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
Your tests are very strange.

306
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,280
Now, see if you can revive
the Base Log Stats and Index File.

307
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,640
Let's find out what happened here.

308
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,680
[Belinda] It's bad luck,
me and the Doctor coming along.

309
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,520
'Cause you were a squad of 11
and we made it 13.

310
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,800
[chuckles] You both say funny things.

311
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,680
What does that mean?

312
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,800
Oh, has that gone?

313
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,640
Thirteen is unlucky,
is that an old Earth thing?

314
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
An old what thing?

315
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,720
Earth.

316
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
The human race?

317
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,880
What's that then?

318
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,480
Have you ever heard of--

319
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,480
[gasps]

320
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,880
What?

321
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,640
-[Trooper 3] What is it?
-What is it? What happened?

322
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,360
I thought I saw…

323
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
[sighs]

324
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm getting paranoid.

325
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,160
-What did you see?
-I didn't.

326
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,440
Anyone there?

327
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,120
Honestly, there's nothing.

328
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,520
It's just me.

329
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,760
Sorry, Aliss.

330
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,400
I want to go home.

331
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Is it ready?

332
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
Yeah.

333
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,080
Just paste that on.
Here I am, teaching the nursing staff.

334
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,280
You're amazing. Thanks, Mo.

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,240
Okay.

336
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,160
I'm just going to paste this
onto the wound.

337
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,680
I was saying,
traditions of the human race.

338
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,000
Have you ever met any? Humans, I mean.

339
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,560
I never heard of you.

340
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,360
They've wiped all the video chains.

341
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,520
Why would they do that?

342
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,800
Everything's been erased.

343
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,800
Everything…

344
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,560
has been restored.

345
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,400
-What's that thing?
-Magic.

346
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,800
Can you find the last entry?

347
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,240
Troop Leader,
does this doctor have authority over me?

348
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,920
Right now, he does. Yes.

349
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,880
[Trooper 1] It's still corrupted.

350
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,520
-We have fragments, hold on.
-[distorted shouting]

351
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,360
Base Commander's final statement.

352
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,960
<i>It came from the well.</i>

353
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,640
<i>It came out of the well</i>
<i>and we don't know how to stop it!</i>

354
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,520
[Trooper 8] Ma'am.

355
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,720
-Not now. Thank you.
-[Trooper 8] It's just…

356
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,600
We checked the walkways.

357
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,480
We found the rest of them dead.

358
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,840
Which confirms,
Aliss Fenly is the only one left alive.

359
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,840
[Belinda] It's so strange.

360
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,240
'Cause the Doctor said,
and I should mention, I hardly know him.

361
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,360
Isn't that strange?

362
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,720
But he's the expert

363
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
and he said to me that everyone--

364
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,360
[screams]

365
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,360
What? What is it? What's…

366
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
-What's happened?
-What is it? What did she do?

367
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,360
No, she didn't do anything.

368
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,840
Um…

369
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,280
I'm st… I'm stupid.

370
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,360
There's nothing there.

371
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,640
-Sorry.
-Yeah, but that's twice now.

372
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,760
What did you see?

373
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,920
Please, can you tell me
what you're saying?

374
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,440
I'm sorry, Aliss.
I… I didn't mean to scare you.

375
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,360
I just…

376
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,000
I thought I saw something behind you.

377
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,520
But there isn't, isn't there?

378
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,920
Look at me.

379
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,240
I'm all clean.

380
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,160
It's just me.

381
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,280
-What did it look like?
-Well, it didn't.

382
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,640
It's an empty room, there's no one there.

383
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,280
You thought you saw a person?

384
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,840
Well, I… I didn't, did I?

385
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,080
Now, I-I've got this dirty.

386
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,200
All the same.

387
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,600
-Stay where you are, Aliss Fenly.
-Where exactly am I gonna go?

388
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,320
[Trooper 2] Keep it calm, thank you.

389
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,920
What?

390
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
Nothing.

391
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,880
-Did you see something?
-No.

392
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,240
Then what was that?

393
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Nothing.

394
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,560
It's a great big empty room.
There can't be anything, can there?

395
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Aliss.

396
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,000
Sorry. Cast to Trooper 2.

397
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,080
Aliss, turn to your right.

398
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,400
I don't know what you're trying to prove.

399
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,680
[sighs] Leave her alone, Mo.

400
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,040
-Come on.
-No, but…

401
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
Whoa!

402
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,560
There's nothing there. Look.

403
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,960
I can see there's not anything.
There's literally nothing.

404
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,320
I saw something.

405
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
And you saw it before,
you did, you saw it.

406
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
-But there's nothing there.
-Yeah, but I saw something.

407
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,960
[stammers] I know what you're saying.

408
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,120
And I've seen it before.
This is how it started.

409
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
This is how I ended up killing my friend
before she killed me.

410
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,200
There is absolutely nothing behind me.

411
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,800
There's nothing there. Nothing.

412
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Okay.

413
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
Let's prove it.

414
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
Hanno, I'll keep guard.

415
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,520
I want you to correspond.

416
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,680
Establish Aliss Fenly as a centre point
and execute a full circle.

417
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,920
Ple… Please, leave me alone.

418
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,640
Look, she's terrified.

419
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,600
You will be quiet or you will be
considered a threat to life.

420
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,440
You will stay looking at me.

421
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,360
Do not look away.

422
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,560
Hanno, execute the move.

423
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Yes, sir.

424
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,040
Him. Isolate him.

425
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,080
Can you isolate his sound?

426
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,840
There's no coverage, he's too deep.

427
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
<i>We don't know what it is!</i>

428
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,200
<i>We don't know what it is!</i>

429
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,880
<i>We don't know what it is.</i>

430
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,640
We don't know what it is.

431
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,840
We don't know what it is.

432
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Like…

433
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,040
Like… [stammers, groans]

434
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,840
Oh, my old, old head.

435
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,320
This planet is flooded
with Galvanic Radiation.

436
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,960
Where does it come from?

437
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,280
The sun. But it's just a Grey Star now.
Nothing special.

438
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,040
But a Grey Star is
a star that's collapsed.

439
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,720
-What was it before?
-It was an Xtonic star.

440
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,240
But that's ancient history,
400,000 years ago.

441
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,680
The sun burnt out, the wars came,

442
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,840
they stripped all the carbon
off the surface and left it ruined.

443
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,120
When you say Carbon…

444
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,040
Carbon 46.

445
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,400
And the definition of that is?

446
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,040
Diamonds. This is a diamond mine.

447
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,960
The entire surface of this planet
was once made out of diamonds.

448
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
What?

449
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,040
Please stop.

450
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,160
Or what?

451
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
What is this planet called?

452
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,080
6-7-6-7.

453
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
The old name.

454
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,880
400,000 years ago,
what was the planet called?

455
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,720
It was called Midnight.

456
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,560
I've been here before.

457
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,760
[shrieks]

458
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,880
[shrieks]

459
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,120
[gasps]

460
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,400
[shrieks]

461
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,960
-What did you do?
-It wasn't me.

462
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,520
-I didn't do anything!
-She was just standing there!

463
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,360
Stop, stop, stop. Get back! Get back.

464
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,040
-What happened?
-She threw her across the room.

465
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,040
[Belinda] She did not.

466
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,440
[breathes heavily]

467
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,800
No, Mo, don't!

468
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Come back!

469
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,560
-What did you do?
-It wasn't me.

470
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,560
It wasn't her. Mo, come back!

471
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,600
Just listen to me. Come back here!

472
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,840
-She's dead.
-Mo, don't go behind Aliss!

473
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,480
Don't go anywhere behind her!

474
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,280
Come here! Don't you see?

475
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
[stammers] What do you mean?

476
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,560
There is something behind her.

477
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Hold your positions. What happened?
Everyone, stay where you are.

478
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,120
-Report, Trooper 2.
-Is she dead?

479
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,560
-I don't know, ma'am.
-She's dead.

480
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,680
-I trained with her brother.
-[Mo] It was so fast.

481
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,160
-Did you do this?
-Just try and stay calm.

482
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,720
I do not take orders from you!

483
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,920
-Did you kill her?
-No!

484
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,040
Then who did?

485
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,280
There's something behind me.

486
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,800
All right?

487
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,640
There's something behind me!

488
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
I don't know what it is.

489
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,120
No one knows what it is.

490
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,200
But it can't be seen
and it can't be stopped.

491
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,760
There's something behind me all the time.

492
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,480
Now please, help me.

493
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,560
Aliss…

494
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,280
explain what you mean.

495
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,960
Something came out of the well.

496
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
That's what they said.

497
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,200
It came out the well,
and they said it was laughing.

498
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,320
Now it's behind me.

499
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,560
Just look. Look, behind her.

500
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,160
Please, all of you, look!

501
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,160
[stammers] It doesn't make sense,
there can't be something behind her,

502
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,760
not from every angle.

503
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,920
Try telling it that.

504
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Look.

505
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
No!

506
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,440
This is just an illusion or a trick.

507
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,120
We saw what happened to the base,
they all went mad.

508
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,000
No! Hold on! Listen--

509
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,640
Permission to override
the orders of this civilian, ma'am.

510
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,600
-Permission not given.
-Hanno was my friend.

511
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Permission not given.

512
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,200
-Now listen to the Doctor.
-No, no.

513
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,880
Listen to Belinda.

514
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,280
Bel, what do you mean?

515
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,760
Why can't we go behind Aliss?

516
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,280
It's like…

517
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,480
It's like this.

518
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,840
If this is Aliss,

519
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,200
and this is us facing her now,

520
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,200
there is something behind her.

521
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,280
And if you go behind it,

522
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,680
you die.

523
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,600
If it was a clock-face,

524
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,120
you die at midnight.

525
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,880
[Belinda] That's what happened.
That is what I saw.

526
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,160
That's why I keep telling you stand back.

527
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,120
Don't go behind her.

528
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,280
Don't go directly behind her
or you're dead.

529
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,440
[Trooper 1] In that case…

530
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,520
if something is standing behind,

531
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,040
then why don't we get rid of you?

532
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,640
Because if you kill me,

533
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
it goes behind you.

534
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,640
What?

535
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,160
You think it went for me first?

536
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,640
You think it crawled its way
out of hell to get to me?

537
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,200
You idiot.

538
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,360
I'm nothing.

539
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,520
I'm just the only one left.

540
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,080
Half of them broken, half of them shot.

541
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,320
They killed each other to get rid of it.

542
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,760
But if you kill the host,
it jumps over to you.

543
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,080
It hides behind your back
and it stays there forever.

544
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,320
Cassio, step away.

545
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,440
Cassio, that's an order.

546
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,320
Doctor, you said you'd been here before.
When was that?

547
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
A different life.

548
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,360
Back when the world was made of diamonds.

549
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,360
[chuckles]

550
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,960
And I met something…

551
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,000
so vile.

552
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,120
It had no face.

553
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
No name.

554
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,080
No self.

555
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,000
I had never been so scared in my life.

556
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,560
-What did it do?
-It had fun.

557
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,160
Oh. [chuckles]

558
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,280
It played games.

559
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,840
Uh-huh.

560
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,200
[Doctor] I think it was learning.

561
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,040
[Cassio] You saw this 400,000 years ago?

562
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,560
And you're listening to him?

563
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,240
He might have information.

564
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,480
-[scoffs] Then I'm declaring a Red Code.
-Wait, you can't do that.

565
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,680
This is exactly what a Red Code is for.

566
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,320
When the leader is incompetent.

567
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,800
Am I seconded?

568
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,080
Am I seconded?

569
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,560
Yes, sir.

570
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,800
[Cassio] Then it's done.

571
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,920
Until such time as we reach
a disciplinary court,

572
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,480
the Red Code stands.

573
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,880
You will stand down,
Shaya Costallion, right now.

574
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,640
I think that we should all just calm down.

575
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,920
And you will be silent
or you will be shot!

576
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,760
Clearly, there is something at work here.

577
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,600
Clearly, bodies have been broken

578
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,000
by some kinetic force
manipulated either by Fenly,

579
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,560
or by something in collusion with,
or in control of her.

580
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,880
-And I maintain--
-No, don't.

581
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,360
If it exists,

582
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,600
we will bring this entity into the open.

583
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,080
We will examine it.

584
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,920
And if necessary, we will destroy it.

585
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,520
Trooper 2?

586
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,720
-Yes, sir?
-[Cassio] Do you volunteer to engage?

587
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,960
-Yes, sir.
-I'm telling you.

588
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,840
-Do not--
-One more word.

589
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,960
Either we disprove this story
or we meet the enemy.

590
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,080
Prepare to engage.

591
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,320
-Don't look. Don't look!
-Shut up!

592
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Please.

593
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,160

-[gasps]

594
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,040

595
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,480
[both gasp]

596
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,280
Cassio, stop!

597
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,800
-Don't move! No, no!
-[screams]

598
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,400
[Belinda] No! No!

599
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,680
Don't move!

600
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,680
[Doctor] Stop! Do not move! Stop!

601
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,960
[screams]

602
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,760
-[screams]
-[Cassio pants]

603
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,120
-No way.
-[Doctor] All of you, look down!

604
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Do not move!

605
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,240

-[shrieks]
-[whimpers]

607
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,840
[Doctor] Cassio, stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

608
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,280
Cassio, turn away!

609
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,800
-[Trooper 7] Cassio, no!
-Cast to Trooper 1.

610
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,080
Aliss…

611
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,000
-turn 180.
-Mm-hmm.

612
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,880
[Cassio shrieks]

613
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,360
-[gasps]
-[both scream]

614
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
[Belinda gasps]

615
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
I had to.

616
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,480
-I had to. He was out of control.
-That's what it turns us into.

617
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,920
Shaya, gun down.

618
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,040
But it's not my fault.

619
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,600
I know.

620
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,400
I really know.

621
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,880
What do we do?

622
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,440
We leave this place.

623
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,160
The mission has failed. We retreat.

624
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,160
I'm sorry.

625
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,480
You're contaminated.

626
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,560
[whimpering] But…

627
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,200
my daughter. [sobbing]

628
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
We can't leave Aliss behind.

629
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,680
Can't we move her?

630
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,680
Okay, we can't step behind her,
but can't we manoeuvre her?

631
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,880
Somehow? Back to the ship?

632
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,200
She's not leaving this planet.

633
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,560
Not with that thing.

634
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
That's what it wants.

635
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,720
To get out.

636
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,640
-But we can't abandon her.
-That's not what I said.

637
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,560
Don't turn your back on me.

638
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,000
Please, don't turn your back on me.

639
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,040
Doctor, stay where you are.

640
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,680
Too many people have died.

641
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,360
And now it stops.

642
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,000
I am now addressing
the thing behind Aliss Fenly.

643
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,840
What?

644
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,880
My old friend.

645
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,320
You have waited 400,000 years.

646
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,880
But who are you?

647
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,560
Are you there?

648
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,480
What are you?

649
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,400
[distorted whispering]

650
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,520
-What was that?
-Did it say something?

651
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Oh.

652
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,640
Aliss.

653
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,840
Maybe that's how you survived.

654
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,440
You can't hear it.

655
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,560
[whispering continues]

656
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,440
[stammers] What is it saying?

657
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,720
What is it? What's it saying?

658
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,000
[inhales shakily]

659
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,600
It knows my name.

660
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
[breathing shakily]

661
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
Oh, yes.

662
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,720
What?

663
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,520
There it is.

664
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,360
What?

665
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,760
[Doctor gasps, chuckles]

666
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,720
It's behind you.

667
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,960
I know.

668
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,240
No, no.

669
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,720
I'm talking to the thing behind you.

670
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,640
And behind that…

671
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,320
What is… What did you see?

672
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,160
The way out.

673
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,080
[chuckles]

674
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,000
Oh, and I'm an idiot, because I forgot
what type of mine this is. Oh!

675
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,600
Everybody, get ready to run.
And I mean run!

676
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
Belinda, we should have
never unsuited, babes.

677
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,520
We are gonna have to work really,
really fast.

678
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,040
Shaya, how many in the airlock at once?

679
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,720
-Six.
-Six?

680
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,040
Okay, there's seven of us.

681
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,400
-Shaya, get ready with that pistol.
-For what?

682
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,960
'Cause you are the best shot in the land,
yeah?

683
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,840
And I need you to fire twice.

684
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,440
Aliss Fenly, get ready.

685
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,720
And now I am talking to
that thing behind Aliss Fenly.

686
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,040
You stone-cold murderer.

687
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,960
If the thing behind you
always gets destroyed,

688
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,680
what if the thing behind you is you?

689
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,880
Shaya, left hand pipe vent.

690
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,240
Right hand pipe vent.

691
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,200
Mercury.

692
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,360
This mine operates
a line drop of Mercury 16.

693
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,040
It's going to reflect it.

694
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,720
It broke all the mirrors.

695
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,160
[Shaya] It will see itself.

696
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,600
What will it do to me?

697
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,920
Aliss, whatever it does to you, yeah,
you have got us, okay?

698
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,720
We are with you, okay?

699
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,680
Everybody, eyes on Aliss. Yeah.

700
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Are we gonna see it?

701
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,280
Do we look?

702
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,680
-Do we look away?
-I don't know.

703
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,480
[shrieks]

704
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,400
[grunts]

705
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
Okay, run.

706
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,760
Run, run, run, run.

707
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,280
[Belinda] We can't stop.

708
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,280
[Doctor] I wanna see it.

709
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,000
[gasps]

710
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,640
[Shaya] Troopers 7 and 9, you go first.

711
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,600
Get Aliss out.

712
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,120
-Come on.
-You should've got out.

713
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,240
I'm not leaving you behind.

714
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,520
Your flight packs are dead.
Just run as far as you can.

715
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,920
Hurry up. Hurry up!

716
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,120

-Is the torso constructed the same?
