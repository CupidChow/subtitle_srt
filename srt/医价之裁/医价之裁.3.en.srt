1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
If you don't know, you'll be eaten.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's what this world is all about.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The doctor-specialized shift agent,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Naruki Kanenari,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is the one who makes the price of the doctors,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
sells them to the hospital,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and gets the money.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's go back to the general hospital.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We can't let anyone who's been transferred to another hospital

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
be transferred to another hospital again in two years.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We will return all the money we have earned.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
With the way you break the law,

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you can fulfill the hope of the jobless.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Naruki's father

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
died himself.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's the burden he's been carrying.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What he's carrying is the truth of the medical care he had three years ago.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And the reason his father committed suicide.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The information can only be collected by the staff at Aisaki Medical Hospital.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In other words,

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the staff who are going to quit this job are the ones who can do it.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
For that, even the jobless are used to approach the truth.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The miracle is different.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Someone has blamed his father.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go deeper into the mystery.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's not that I don't trust you,

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but the money is up to the individual.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I want to ask someone who can trust me to follow me.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Of course.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I will definitely answer the director's request,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
so please leave it to me.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you for your hard work.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I hate the smell of the hospital.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A 30-year-old woman, Hiroe Washimi.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:46,120
Her diagnosis is a

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,120
How is it?

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,120
At this age, there will be no problem with physical strength.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
And Dr. Kuramochi,

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,120
the results of the operation using stiffs are

40
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,120
the top class in the country.

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Thank you.

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Yes.

43
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Doctor,

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
I'm Steve.

45
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Thank you again this time.

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
Thank you as always.

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,120
I've been taking care of this from the publisher.

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Thanks to your help,

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,120
our company's products are also widely introduced.

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
I'm very grateful.

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
This is also

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
a relationship that will continue to be maintained.

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Thank you.

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
I'm a little sick.

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,120
What is that?

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Is that a gift?

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
I'll give it to you.

58
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Yay!

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
What is this?

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
As you can see.

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
I don't like it.

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
I haven't said anything yet.

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
I don't like it.

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
You're going to say it anyway.

65
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,120
This weekend, a symposium for medical practitioners will be held in the Tokyo Central Hall.

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
I see.

67
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
The theme is medical business.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Businessmen and business owners will gather together.

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,120
I have no material.

70
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,120
You're good at smelling money, aren't you?

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
What's the special reward?

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
I'm a medical professional agent.

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm Dr. Connection.

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Thank you.

75
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
I'm Dr. Connection.

76
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Thank you.

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm Dr. Connection.

78
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Please feel free to consult me.

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm Dr. Connection.

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Please feel free to consult me.

81
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
I'm Dr. Connection.

82
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
Please feel free to consult me.

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
Please be careful of your feet.

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
I'm Dr. Connection.

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Is there anything I can help you with?

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,120
I'm introducing the best person for medical practitioners.

87
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
Please stop.

88
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Please.

89
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Please.

90
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
I'm Dr. Connection.

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm Dr. Connection.

92
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,120
I have a question for you.

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Where is that?

94
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Oh!

95
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:53,120
The World Economic Forum announced in 2024 that Japan was ranked 118th among 146 countries in the gender gap ranking.

96
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,120
This is the lowest level among the advanced countries.

97
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,120
I was very disappointed to face the wall of my faith because I am a woman.

98
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
You have a lot of experience.

99
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,120
You have a lot of experience.

100
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,120
What is the secret to success?

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Believe in your own power.

102
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,120
It doesn't matter if you have a good or bad ability.

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:32,120
That's why I want to work as hard as I can to become the power of women who feel difficult in a male-dominated society.

104
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
M&A?

105
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Yes.

106
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm trying to buy this clinic.

107
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
It's a wonderful clinic at home.

108
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
The first one you bought was a beauty salon.

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Next is a visit clinic.

110
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
It's a field where the country is making money now.

111
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
As expected, the name of the vanguard is over.

112
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,120
What is necessary for a consult is the power to read the times.

113
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,120
I'm looking for a position to be the head of this clinic.

114
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm the management.

115
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
I want to focus on business with the new head.

116
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,120
It's a high-level certificate for a man who is not good at management.

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
There is another condition.

118
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I want to ask for a female-only.

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,120
I can't include a question that only limits gender on the old list except for the legal case.

120
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Unfortunately, the medical industry also has gender discrimination.

121
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,120
I can't make a perfect equalization.

122
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,120
That's why I'm working with the society to make women.

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
It's a wonderful belief.

124
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
There is no problem.

125
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,120
There are cases where it is actually limited just by not writing on the table.

126
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
It seems to change with you.

127
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,120
What is the name of the main group?

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
The annual salary for the city is 30 million.

130
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,120
The introduction fee for you is 6 million.

131
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
600?

132
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Yonaga, the contract.

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Yes.

134
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Yodan.

135
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
What happened?

136
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,120
It seems that the doctor has forgotten the car.

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Would you like to come with me?

138
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,120
This car is a limited model.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
It's a place called 20 million.

140
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
20 million?

141
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,120
I'll call other introduction companies, but you're the one I'm looking forward to the most.

142
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Please leave it to me.

143
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Thank you.

144
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
I can trust your plan as usual.

145
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Do dogs have a nose?

146
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
But it's a little annoying.

147
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
After all?

148
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:04,240
I forgot the

149
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
car.

150
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
It's to show the car, right?

151
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,240
The person behind it wants to appeal to the money.

152
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Do you want to say that you're doing something bad?

153
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Well, it doesn't matter whether it's a good person or a bad person.

154
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,240
If you can bring me the money.

155
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
If you can bring me the money.

156
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,360
It means that this property is not owned by any of the OPE members.

157
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
It means that there are other people involved.

158
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Did the third car change the name later?

159
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Or was it in another public office?

160
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
So, did you investigate?

161
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,360
There were 40 staff around the house three years ago.

162
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
But I couldn't find any similar evidence.

163
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
I've been looking into it and I've been curious about one thing.

164
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,480
There's a nurse who disappeared from the extreme right after that OPE.

165
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
She's gone?

166
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
And her resume was somehow disposed of.

167
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,480
It should be stored for five years under the extreme rule.

168
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Tell me the information about that nurse.

169
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
I'll look for it later.

170
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
No, you don't have to.

171
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,480
She's been going out of town again recently.

172
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
This person is hot even in the middle of summer.

173
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
She wants to enjoy the depth of the car.

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
She's very particular.

175
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
You've been a member of the general internal medicine for a long time.

176
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Yes.

177
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I wanted to help the whole internal medicine.

178
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
The general internal medicine requires a lot of knowledge of various diseases.

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
We have to consider the life habits and background of patients

180
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,600
and connect them to the right treatment.

181
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Is that so?

182
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
And that power works well with other medicine.

183
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,720
This year, the generation of the party is over 75 years old.

184
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,720
One of the four people has entered the ultra-old society of high-end old people.

185
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,720
What do you think is the best treatment for the future needs?

186
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Well, is it a visitation treatment?

187
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
That's right.

188
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
A visitation treatment that requires seeing patients alone

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,720
is a great experience for the general internal medicine.

190
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,720
I hope you can consider this opportunity.

191
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Actually, I've been interested in it for a long time.

192
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I wanted people with difficult hospitalization

193
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,840
to receive more appropriate medical care.

194
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,840
But there are some conditions.

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,840
I can only work for a year.

196
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Next year, I will be able to be a member of the local clinic

197
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,960
and I will be the director of the clinic.

198
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,960
But I've only worked under my father.

199
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,960
My father told me that I should get experience

200
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
as a general medical doctor in a hospital.

201
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
In other words, I want you to introduce me to a hospital

202
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,960
that will hire me as a general medical doctor for a year.

203
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I understand that it's an absurd hope.

204
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I can quit my job after a year,

205
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,080
but I haven't hired a full-time employee.

206
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
It's a great story.

207
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,080
I thought you should get a job without telling the president

208
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,080
that you would retire a year later.

209
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Why did you know?

210
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,080
All the emotions have come out of your face.

211
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,080
The Mitsuba Hormone Clinic and this Narazaki Clinic are in the same area.

212
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
It would be terrible if you spread bad rumors

213
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,080
that you were taken to the patient on the Mitsuba side.

214
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,080
It looks strict.

215
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
That's the general theory.

216
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
There is no other way.

217
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,200
But I can do it.

218
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Hiroe?

219
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Doctor, is your wife okay?

220
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,200
She was successful.

221
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I'm glad.

222
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Thank you.

223
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,320
I saw it on the monitor.

224
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
It's a great dream.

225
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Thank you.

226
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Then, what about the matter you discussed?

227
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Of course.

228
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I'll finish it later.

229
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
I'll go.

230
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,320
You came to the parking lot to show your car.

231
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,320
You think so, right?

232
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,320
That's okay.

233
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,320
It's important to motivate women to improve their social skills.

234
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,320
It's important to motivate women to improve their social skills.

235
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Motivation.

236
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
If someone wants to be like me,

237
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,320
they will work hard to achieve it.

238
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,320
That's why I deliberately live a luxurious life.

239
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Even if some men say that I'm a woman,

240
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I will not give up.

241
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,320
I will not give up.

242
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,320
I will keep chasing my goal.

243
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I understand.

245
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Don't worry.

246
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,440
I will help you to realize your goal.

247
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,440
I will help you to realize your goal.

248
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Thank you.

249
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
What is possible if I am?

250
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,440
I haven't found a year-long limit.

251
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I haven't found a year-long limit.

252
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,560
About the push and pull team.

253
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,560
She is a fraud.

254
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,560
The purpose of the push and pull team is

255
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,560
to collect the money from the bank.

256
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Money?

257
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,560
If you have a one-year-long limit,

258
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,560
you can get this much.

259
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,560
100,000 yen.

260
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,560
100 million yen?

261
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Where is the flow?

262
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,680
To the company you are running.

263
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,680
I was afraid.

264
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,680
Even in a small clinic,

265
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,680
it is a tool to pull money.

266
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,680
It's a lot of money to make money.

267
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,680
It's a lot of money to make money.

268
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,680
The hospital is a money box.

269
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,680
But this is a credit card for the chairman.

270
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,800
I can't use it freely.

271
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I will tell the chairman.

272
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I will take responsibility for the management of the bank.

273
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Bank?

274
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Before being registered in the bank,

275
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,800
I will take away all the cards.

276
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Then the chairman will not be able to check the cash flow.

277
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Then the chairman will not be able to check the cash flow.

278
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,800
I don't usually give it to you.

279
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
There is a case that goes well.

280
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,800
If you are persuaded to buy a contract that is

281
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
a burden on your company even if you have a red blood,

282
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
you will be trusted.

283
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,800
You are a man.

284
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
You can show your stance to women in the media.

285
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
You can show your stance to women in the media.

286
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Why are you so familiar with her exit?

287
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
I heard the situation from the first victim.

288
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
At first, I was working hard for management.

289
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
At first, I was working hard for management.

290
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I can't get in touch with you.

291
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
What about the bank?

292
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,800
I asked many times.

293
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I feel like I can send you the minimum amount of money.

294
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,800
It's a teacher's lecture.

295
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
If you have a document, you can stop the card and passbook that you have.

296
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,800
But I'm a patient named by the owner.

297
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,800
But I'm a patient named by the owner.

298
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
I'm in a state of holding back.

299
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
If you leave her,

300
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm suspicious.

301
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I can't get her out of the game unless I get a fraud.

302
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
I can't get her out of the game unless I get a fraud.

303
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Is that the face of the Oshikiri team?

304
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
But it's working as if it's a success.

305
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
All the top players are rejected.

306
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Her company probably has a red blood.

307
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,800
In order to fill it,

308
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I'm trying to get a bribe by deceiving the owner and the owner.

309
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Let's get off this case.

310
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
I just got a license.

311
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
I don't want to get involved with such a dangerous person.

312
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
No, I have a reason.

313
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
When I get off, someone else will be hurt.

314
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
I can't find the person who's responsible for it that easily.

315
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
I'm here sometimes.

316
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I'm angry at the cost-effectiveness of the customer.

317
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
I'm sorry to call you all of a sudden.

318
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm sorry to call you all of a sudden.

319
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Actually, I have a case that I would like to show you.

320
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Actually, I have a case that I would like to show you.

321
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
The president has been calling me since morning.

322
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I don't have to work anymore.

323
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,800
I want to say that I'll show my back to my subordinates.

324
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I want to say that I'll show my back to my subordinates.

325
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
I've known you since you left the bank.

326
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I've known you since you left the bank.

327
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,800
You've been like that for a long time.

328
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Really? Thank you very much.

329
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
I'll talk to the owner right away.

330
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,800
If you buy Mitsuba, you'll get another cent.

331
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,800
If you buy Mitsuba, you'll get another cent.

332
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Who will find the person responsible for it?

333
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,800
I think you're already in the middle of the night.

334
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Hello?

335
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
I see.

336
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Thank you for your hard work.

337
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
I thought it was you.

338
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
It's a miracle that I met Dr. Narasaki.

339
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I'm sorry for my experience and achievements.

340
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,800
But why is that person in my house?

341
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,800
I was going to be a dean a year later.

342
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
What do you mean?

343
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
I was supposed to go to my father's hospital.

344
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Suddenly another male doctor was appointed.

345
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
My father told me that I should marry you and get the happiness of a woman.

346
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
My father told me that I should marry you and get the happiness of a woman.

347
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,800
What a time-worn strategy.

348
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
I was going to be a dean, but suddenly I was told that I should marry you.

349
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
I was going to be a dean, but suddenly I was told that I should marry you.

350
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I had a similar experience when I was a company employee.

351
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,800
I was the one who was getting the results.

352
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Other male employees were the first to go.

353
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,800
So I know your frustration.

354
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
It's rare to match up to this point.

355
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,800
It's rare to match up to this point.

356
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,800
It's because you have the ability, timing, and compatibility.

357
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Mr. Narasaki was originally a fan of Mr. Oshikiri.

358
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Really?

359
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
He will definitely show you the work of a captain.

360
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Honestly, more people will not appear.

361
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
I was also looking for someone like Mr. Narasaki.

362
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,800
I was also looking for someone like Mr. Narasaki.

363
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Then it's okay to decide.

364
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Yonan-kun.

365
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
This is the contract.

366
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Wait a minute.

367
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
The elevator is over there.

368
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Thank you.

369
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Are you nervous?

370
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,800
It's okay. I'm here.

371
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Don't rely on me.

372
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Naruki.

373
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Why are you here?

374
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I introduced you to Mr. Oshikiri earlier.

375
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
What?

376
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
But I was told to wait for your reply.

377
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,800
I thought I wouldn't be able to share the interview with you because I didn't have time.

378
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I was surprised.

379
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
So what do you want?

380
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
I'll be honest with you.

381
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Mr. Oshikiri is probably a fraud.

382
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
What?

383
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
You should withdraw from this matter.

384
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I don't want your client to be a burden.

385
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Don't say anything appropriate.

386
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,800
You're going to kick me out and take advantage of my profit.

387
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Mr. Ishigami.

388
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm not lying.

389
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Why did you introduce me to the candidate?

390
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,800
You can also end the fraud by receiving the amount of introduction.

391
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
You just have to watch the ending quietly.

392
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Are you okay?

393
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I'm okay.

394
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
What you just said...

395
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,800
If you want to reconsider, I won't force you.

396
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I'll cancel today.

397
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Please contact me again.

398
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
No.

400
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Excuse me.

401
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,800
So you've been pulling back.

402
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
I'm worried about you.

403
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I can't force you.

404
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
I know.

405
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Have you ever heard of Oshikiri?

406
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Not at all.

407
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I can't pretend not to see it if it's true.

408
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
But it's obvious.

409
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
You're a fraud.

410
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
You're so annoying.

411
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Do you think I'm a fraud?

412
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm not your ally or a enemy of you.

413
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
I just judge the situation fairly.

414
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Is that why you called me?

415
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
You should have told me.

416
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Mitsuba Hospital.

417
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,800
The patient-staff relationship is important.

418
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
The atmosphere is friendly and warm.

419
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,800
The director is not a guest, but the staff continue to support the clinic.

420
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm the new nurse, Narazaki.

421
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Nice to meet you.

422
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Nice to meet you.

423
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:18,800
I'll ask the staff to go around the clinic with you.

424
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,800
If there's no problem, I'll recommend you to Oshikiri.

425
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
I see.

426
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Excuse me.

427
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Ando, the nurse who goes around the clinic with you.

428
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Nice to meet you. I'm Narazaki.

429
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm Yonaga, a small company.

430
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm Ando.

431
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Nice to meet you.

432
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I'll do my best.

433
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I'm back.

434
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Good news.

435
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,800
6 million yen was transferred from Oshikiri.

436
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
As promised, there's a special reward.

437
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Thank you.

438
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
What are you going to do?

439
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
You said you'd stop Oshikiri's fraud.

440
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I'm sorry.

441
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
It's about time.

442
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
What?

443
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Yonaga, it's a mission.

444
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Are you going to change it again?

445
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,800
No, I'm going to be the leader this time.

446
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Yes.

447
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm sorry.

448
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm counting on you.

449
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,800
But I don't know if he'll cooperate with us.

450
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
You have to use that sense of justice.

451
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I heard you.

452
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
The interview was going well.

453
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
I'm glad the sale has been successful.

454
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
I just got married to the director.

455
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Thanks to Narazaki.

456
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Thanks to you.

457
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I'd like to start preparing for the bank's post-mendage.

458
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm sorry.

459
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I'll call you back.

460
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Yes.

461
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Hello.

462
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,800
I haven't been paid yet.

463
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm sorry.

464
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
I'll be right there.

465
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,800
I'm at my limit.

466
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,800
The payment for this month is in a bad situation.

467
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
This is bad.

468
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Let's get through this together.

469
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
You always do that.

470
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
You won't answer me.

471
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:50,800
You're not using my knowledge for another purpose, are you?

472
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
That's not possible.

473
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm in a meeting right now.

474
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I'll do it again later.

475
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
I don't have to panic.

476
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
I'll get the money right away.

477
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
That's great.

478
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Thank you.

479
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,800
You'll get an extra reward for this, right?

480
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
It depends on tomorrow's show.

481
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Yes.

482
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
I'm home.

483
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Can you make some time for me?

484
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Please.

485
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,800
I need you to manage the course.

486
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I have the experience.

487
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Don't you have any intention of becoming the director?

488
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
No.

489
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
I'll take the position.

490
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,800
But I don't think I need to give you the information.

491
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Speed is important for money exchange.

492
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Please explain to him.

493
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,800
You're right.

494
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,800
If you want to move the money, you can contact me.

495
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,800
That'll be a good deal.

496
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
What do you mean?

497
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,800
It'll take time to get the money.

498
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,800
If you don't want to take the responsibility, I'll make it clear.

499
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
I understand.

500
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,800
But you don't mind, right?

501
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
No.

502
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,800
You must have been admiring me.

503
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Why don't you trust me?

504
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,800
That's a story.

505
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,800
I'm not your fan.

506
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,800
I'm also working on another man's hospital.

507
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,800
I asked you to do it.

508
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
What's that?

509
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,800
I'll do it a year later.

510
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,800
You're going to take the money from me?

511
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,800
The director of the hospital won't sell you the hospital.

512
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
What?

513
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:36,800
The hospital is going to sell the hospital.

514
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,800
What are you talking about?

515
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Explain.

516
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,800
I'm going to sell this hospital?

517
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:56,800
You said you wanted a doctor who had difficulty in getting a doctor's appointment.

518
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Yes.

519
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,800
If you work with me, you can continue to treat patients who can't come to the Narazaki Clinic.

520
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
But even if you say that suddenly...

521
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Tell your father.

522
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,800
If you're going to expand your business, you shouldn't miss this opportunity.

523
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:20,800
But that means you're cheating on the person who's pushing you.

524
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:26,800
If someone doesn't do it, it's going to be a secret.

525
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,800
But if you fail, it's dangerous for the Narazaki teacher.

526
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,800
I won't fail.

527
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
I'm sure to be punished.

528
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:46,800
I found out that the hospital was very good when I looked into Mitsuba.

529
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,800
The staff's quality is high and the trust in patients is hot.

530
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,800
So I thought I shouldn't hand it over to someone like you.

531
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,800
I also got the both of the Narazaki teacher's father and the director of Mitsuba.

532
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,800
The auction is over.

533
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
I can't forgive you for this.

534
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,800
But if you're being honest, you can cancel the contract.

535
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,800
Even if we don't notice.

536
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:28,800
You're in charge of the red paper of your company at the Takemura's

537
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
What's the point of that?

538
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:38,800
The fact that I'm the owner of the business is not a fraud.

539
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Is that so?

540
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,800
The warning of the 253rd case of fraud in the office.

541
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,800
The person who frauds the person who is the owner of the office is a person who has been in the office for more than 10 years.

542
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:58,800
The director's lecture doesn't correspond to this person.

543
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,800
As expected, you're studying well.

544
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:08,800
As you said, you can't ask for a crime against the Takemura teacher.

545
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,800
But the fraud of the bank is different.

546
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:22,800
The bank is the one who is cheating on Mitsuba's visit clinic with the money received for the management of Shirayuri Clinic.

547
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,800
What's the evidence that I did it?

548
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
That's where you're at.

549
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,800
We can't prove it to you because you're in charge of the Takemura teacher's lecture.

550
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,800
So it's just a scam.

551
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,800
So I turned to the bank to move.

552
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:52,800
The other day, Mr. Oshikiri called Mr. Takemura and Mr. Narazaki.

553
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,800
We were together at that time.

554
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,800
I'm also able to sell it safely.

555
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,800
I'm glad I got a job at the bank.

556
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,800
I want to start preparing for the post-mortem meeting with the bank.

557
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,800
I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

558
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Hello

559
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I'm sorry. I haven't been paid yet.

560
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,800
I'm sorry. I'll call you back right away.

561
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,800
What's the reason you three are together?

562
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Who said three?

563
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
There was another person.

564
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
You don't know.

565
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Maybe you're not using my knowledge for another purpose.

566
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
That's not true.

567
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm in the middle of a meeting right now, so I'll do it again later.

568
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I was cut off.

569
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,800
As of now, the bank's savings have not been used properly on the Shiraeri Clinic.

570
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
I see.

571
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Maybe the money was used to buy the honeybees.

572
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
That's not all.

573
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Mr. Oshikiri may be using that money to pay for the company's red.

574
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
There's a problem.

575
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
The non-savings of the savings.

576
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Yes, the Shiraeri Clinic is even paying for the employees' pay.

577
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
This is a dead end.

578
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I can't miss it.

579
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,800
So I'm going to use the savings correctly.

580
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm going to find out if the bank is investigating it.

581
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Please help me.

582
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,800
The previous case was scary.

583
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,800
I've been getting involved in it.

584
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,800
I don't have a story to tell.

585
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Hello.

586
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
What's going on?

587
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,800
The bank has been investigating it, and it's been determined that the savings are being used in a wrong way.

588
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
The police will be moving after this.

589
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Thank you.

590
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,800
It's a matter of time before you're arrested.

591
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,800
You're not going to get a single penny.

592
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,800
It's finally time to end it.

593
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Don't mess with me.

594
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,800
You don't see anything but a woman's fraud.

595
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:12,800
You don't know what I've been doing for a woman's future.

596
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Mr. Narazaki.

597
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,800
It's a shame that men are so good.

598
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,800
What are we going to do if we kill each other?

599
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,800
We should cooperate.

600
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,800
But you were pretending to be a woman's ally and you were cheating on Mr. Takemura.

601
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Yes, I was.

602
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,800
But I was going to put my power in Mr. Takemura's hospital.

603
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,800
First of all, I had to rebuild my company.

604
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Otherwise, I wouldn't have the influence of the world.

605
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
You know that, right?

606
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Is that why Mr. Takemura's hospital is so broken?

607
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,800
I can't help it.

608
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,800
To change a society where women are evaluated by their own power.

609
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:30,800
I've been determined to succeed more than any man.

610
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,800
I've been determined to succeed more than any man.

611
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,800
I don't regret it anymore.

612
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,800
You have a great faith.

613
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Does it have anything to do with men or women?

614
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,800
You were disappointed when you were a company employee.

615
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,800
That's why you don't want to regret it anymore.

616
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,800
That's not the reason why this case is fair.

617
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Mr. Narazaki is a very good person regardless of gender.

618
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
The Mitsuba Hospital will surely be reborn.

619
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Mr. Oshikiri had a chance to be reborn, right?

620
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
If you just want to succeed, there should have been many ways.

621
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,800
But you took the wrong path.

622
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,800
As you said, it has nothing to do with gender.

623
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:40,800
There is only the quality of the person you are.

624
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
An autopsy?

625
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Did you understand that Mr. Naraki was telling the truth?

626
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Did you come here to tell me that?

627
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Did you decide to change your job?

628
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Not yet.

629
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I want you to be the director of Mitsuba Hospital.

630
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
What?

631
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,800
I will take care of your father's hospital.

632
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
How about it?

633
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I'm sure he will be happy.

634
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
The introduction fee is 3 million yen.

635
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Mr. Naraki said that the introduction fee was 3 million yen.

636
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Mr. Naraki?

637
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,800
I was going to do this from the beginning.

638
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:48,800
I don't think Mr. Naraki is a bad person like Mr. Ishigami said.

639
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Why do you have to do this?

640
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,800
You shouldn't trust him.

641
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Mr. Ishigami, did you agree to the deal?

642
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Sometimes that kind of thing is useful.

643
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Where did you calculate this?

644
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Did you read from the beginning that if you give this to that symposium, the cut will be eaten?

645
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
I wonder.

646
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,800
You want to know about this?

647
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,800
There is a nurse who disappeared from the extreme east.

648
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Tell me about that nurse.

649
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
I'll look for her.

650
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
No, I don't need that.

651
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,800
She's been going to the extreme east again.

652
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,800
My son has a long-term near-death condition and has been hospitalized for three months.

653
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
She's going to make her debut.

654
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
She's going to be able to do it.

655
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
She can only do heart transplantation.

656
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,800
What kind of condition is she in now?

657
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,800
The nurse whose mother wrote this.

658
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,800
She got the emergency seat without any trouble and was able to get it.

659
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
You found her, right?

660
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Yes.

661
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:44,800
The other person involved in the operation was Ando Yoshieda.

662
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Mr. Narasaki, thank you very much.

663
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
What is it?

664
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm a single mother, so I can't lose my job.

665
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,800
I'm really glad I didn't meet Mr. Oshikiri's expectations.

666
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,800
I just did what he told me to do.

667
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Who did you do it to?

668
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
The person who introduced me to the company.

669
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,800
He was the one who saw through Mr. Oshikiri's flaws.

670
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Mr. Yonaga?

671
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,800
No, Mr. Naruki, the representative.

672
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Naruki?

673
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
It's amazing.

674
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Everything he said came true.

675
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
So I'm not the one to thank you.

676
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
I'm the one to thank you.

677
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Isn't he a former doctor?

678
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Is that so?

679
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,800
I'm Naruki, a doctor at Connection.

680
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Hello.

681
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,800
You know me, right?

682
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:12,800
You're Mr. Masanari's son, right?

683
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,800
You quit the club, right?

684
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,800
I'm a transfer agent for medical experts.

685
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,800
I heard that Mr. Naruki helped me this time.

686
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,800
Thank you very much.

687
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Why did Mr. Ando quit the club?

688
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,800
You were involved in the operation of Maizan Dousaka.

689
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,800
The operating members don't have your name, but the seal is yours.

690
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:54,800
It's hard to think that you were in charge of that operation alone in the career of this outside nurse.

691
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,800
You were also on the scene, weren't you?

692
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Did someone order you to rewrite your nursing record?

693
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Mr. Ando, I want to know the truth.

694
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,800
What happened at that operating room?

695
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Why did my father kill himself?

696
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
You should know that.

697
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,800
I'm not going to tell you.

698
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
I'm not going to tell you.

699
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
I'm not going to tell you.

700
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
I'm not going to tell you.

701
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,800
You should know that.

702
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
Please tell me the truth.

703
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,800
Excuse me.

704
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Excuse me.

705
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
Excuse me.

706
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
Yes.

707
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Naruki Kanenari may come to you soon.

708
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
I just came.

709
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
You haven't told me anything, have you?

710
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Yes.

711
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Mr. Ando, we are a team of fate.

712
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Are you going to rewrite your nursing record?

713
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,800
