1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,440
If you travelled to that
star, it's four quadrillion miles away.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,640
I know girls aren't good at maths,
but that's a long way.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,680
'Cause the thing is, Belinda,

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,719
I look up at the night sky,
and it is so beautiful,

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,880
and I think, "How
can I capture this?

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,720
How can I celebrate your birthday
and treasure this moment forever?"

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,400
So I bought you...

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
this.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Happy birthday.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
Thank you.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,240
You could fold the paper and save
it for later, but never mind.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,200
Oh, wow.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,200
So, what it means is, uh,
that star, that's yours.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,840
That star right there.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,160
Shining down upon us.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
- Does it have to say "Miss"?
- Are you married?

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,480
- No.
- Then it's "Miss".

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,399
- Do you like it, or...
- Yes.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,559
I'm sorry, Alan.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
Yes. This is the nicest thing

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,399
anyone has ever done for me.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,560
Thank you.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,120
Just gonna kiss you.

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
So who bit you?

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,080
Was it a dog?

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Was it a man?

27
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
Was it your wife?

28
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,879
She's tachy at
120, systolic at 70.

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,879
She's had one gram of TXA,

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,959
five milligrams of morphine, and
she's got a gram of IV paraceta...

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,799
So sorry, but I phoned your
daughter and she's on her way.

32
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,479
Is there anything
else I can get you?

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
How about a nice cup
of tea and a sandwich?

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,039
There's a doctor
looking for you.

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,119
Tell me about it.
See you tomorrow.

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,079
- No.
- Just one little name.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,639
I can't give out home
addresses. It's not allowed.

38
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,760
- Look over there!
- What?

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,720
Oops. Sorry. Sorry.

40
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,039
Linda! Don't touch the granola.

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,279
- It's mine.
- It's Belinda.

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,039
And that was Kristine, not me.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,120
She said it was you.

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,239
Will you
two keep it down?

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,320
Some of us have got
work in the morning.

46
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
What the...

47
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,519
Is this some kind of joke? You're
not real, actual robots, are you?

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,519
'Cause that is just ridiculous.

49
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,040
Oi! You're wrecking the
place! And my landlord is...

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
not a nice man.

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,240
Where do you think you're going?

52
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,000
Residents will
stay in their rooms.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,759
Don't tell me he
needs the toilet.

54
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,919
Missbelindachandra?

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,079
- What?
- You are Missbelindachandra?

56
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,639
- How do you know my name?
- Name confirmed.

57
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,079
- Your Majesty.
- Your what now?

58
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,679
You will come with us.

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,240
And what if I don't?

60
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,239
You killed the cat.

61
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,999
- The cat is irrelevant.
- It wasn't my cat.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,719
The cat is still irrelevant.

63
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,399
What do you want me for?

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,439
We come from the star Missbelindachandra.
We need you as our queen.

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,040
What do you mean
the star Belinda?

66
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,040
Missbelindachandra.

67
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,640
Oh, you are kidding me.

68
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,679
Belinda, what's going on?

69
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,239
- Do you know Lucy at number seven?
- Yes.

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,200
Tell her her cat's
gone to live on a farm.

71
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,561
Apparently I'm the queen of outer
space, if you could tell the police.

72
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,360
And my mum and dad.

73
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,359
Oh, my poor mum
and dad.

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,960
Tell them robots
are kidnapping me.

75
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,359
Tell them I love them.

76
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,680
Oh, take care, Belinda.

77
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,400
Bye-bye.

78
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,960
Transmat initiated.

79
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
They're beaming me...
...up!

80
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,960
Belinda!

81
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,720
Belinda!

82
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,999
You ain't seen me.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,520
Belinda!

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,560
You haven't even got the right person!
It's Alan that bought this thing.

85
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,920
{\an8}Mr Alan Daniel Budd.
Go and get him!

86
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,359
{\an8}I haven't seen him in 16 years.

87
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,840
{\an8}I think he moved to Margate.

88
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,960
Tell him he owes me 50 quid.

89
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,559
And what's that thing?

90
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
<i>Descent in 500 cycles.</i>

91
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,479
Can someone tell me what
the hell is going on?

92
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,879
It was Alan. A-A-Alan
Daniel Bu-Bu-Budd.

93
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,079
Six-fi-fi-Sixteen
years. Fifty qui-quid.

94
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,799
Go and get him. Da-a-aniel Budd.

95
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
What was tha-that thing?

96
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,040
Wha-Wha-What?

97
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Okay.

98
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
Oh, that's complicated things.

99
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,040
<i>Entering orbit
of Missbelindachandra One.</i>

100
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,760
A planet called Belinda?

101
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,680
Oh, thank God,
someone to talk to.

102
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,719
Do me a favour and ask your
robots to lay off, will you?

103
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,639
- Welcome to Missbelindachandraville.
- Don't you start.

104
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,599
I stand as People's Representative.
My name is Sasha 55.

105
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,039
And on behalf of all
Missbelindachandrakind,

106
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,879
- I bid welcome to our one true queen.
- Yes, sure.

107
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,399
But could you just
tell these goons...

108
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,719
And we obey our Robot
Overlords in all things.

109
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,320
- What?
- Our Robot Overlords.

110
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
The Missbelindachandrabots.

111
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,240
So they're in charge?

112
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,799
All praise the Robots.

113
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,999
Is that...

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,919
What's happening?

115
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,480
Rebels in the North Zone started a riot.

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,479
So the Robots are unleashing
Missbelindachandrabombs.

117
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,200
- They're killing them?
- The Robots must be obeyed.

118
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,720
Please help us.

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,999
- Polish, polish.
- The pathway for Missbelindachandra

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,079
must be cleaned and polished.

121
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Right. Thanks.

122
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,960
Polish, polish.

123
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,399
- Right.
- Polish, polish.

124
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,480
Missbelindachandra, proceed
towards the Throne of the Queen.

125
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,399
Polish, polish. Polish, polish.

126
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,520
Polish, polish.

127
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,959
And what happens now?

128
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,920
The planet Missbelindachandra One
will celebrate your royal wedding.

129
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,519
Congratulations
to Your Majesty!

130
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,880
What do you mean wedding?

131
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,959
Who am I marrying?

132
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,959
A spark plug?

133
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,319
The Great AI Generator.

134
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,000
Behold!

135
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,439
<i>Attention, citizens
of Missbelindachandra One.</i>

136
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,199
Be warned, no help is coming.

137
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,120
You will surrender
and genuflect to me.

138
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,319
<i>The AI
Generator knows no pity.</i>

139
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,839
<i>No kindness.</i>

140
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,479
No mercy.

141
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,319
And you want me to marry it?

142
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,519
It demands union.

143
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,599
Behold!

144
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,120
<i>The Binding Contract
of the Stars may yet save the people.</i>

145
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,399
{\an8}<i>The Robots will bring her to me,</i>

146
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,999
<i>so metal and skin...</i>

147
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,600
...may weld within
Miss Belinda Chandra.

148
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,399
Weld?

149
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,799
Queen and Machine combined!

150
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,040
Behold!

151
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
<i>I obey the Machine.</i>

152
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,399
I'm saying no.

153
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,759
With regret, your
powers are only nominal.

154
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,479
- Enforced wedlock will commence.
- Why is it all so mad?

155
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Why is everything on
this planet so stupid?

156
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,359
If I may, I think our Designated
Historian might explain.

157
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,920
He may speak.

158
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,759
Once upon a time, the
planet was united.

159
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,999
Listen.

160
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,759
The Robots and people
lived together in peace.

161
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,079
To.

162
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,039
But then, ten years
ago, it all changed.

163
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,280
Me.

164
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,199
Because on that day, the
Robot Revolution arose.

165
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,640
Please.

166
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
What?

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,720
Thank you for listening
attentively to my story.

168
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,799
- Careful.
- Okay.

169
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,959
The AI Generator
evolved and achieved perfection.

170
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,079
Robots.

171
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,439
It told its soldiers
to conquer all life.

172
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Faulty.

173
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,359
No one knows why. It
remains a mystery.

174
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,399
Cannot.

175
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,079
So the mighty Robots
marched across the world.

176
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,159
Hear.

177
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,999
People fought back, but
they are weak flesh.

178
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,959
Every.

179
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,759
They begged for kindness
and hoped for peace.

180
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,919
Ninth.

181
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,440
But then the AI
Generator conquered them.

182
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Word.

183
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,880
Robots. Faulty. Cannot.
Hear. Every. Ninth. Word.

184
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,360
So, thank you very much.

185
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,000
Very, very much.

186
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Gotcha.

187
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,320
I am very grateful for
your infinite wisdom.

188
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Good.

189
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,999
With the people subjugated,
the Generator looked out.

190
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,639
- Rebels. It sought for...
- Rebels

191
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,359
...the original Miss
Belinda Chandra.

192
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,479
Fight.

193
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,679
And so it looked to
the planet Earth.

194
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,879
Back.

195
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,159
It beheld the creator
and brought you here.

196
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,600
Very.

197
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,439
It knew metal and flesh
must finally unite.

198
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,520
Soon.

199
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,440
This is a fact, and
then another fact.

200
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,400
- When?
- I can confirm, your highness, the time...

201
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,400
is now!

202
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,639
Oh, my God.

203
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,320
Eliminate all rebels.

204
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,359
Destroy!

205
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,840
Vaporise.

206
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,960
Concentrate your fire!

207
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
Destroy.

208
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,400
Vaporise.

209
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,880
Vap...

210
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,360
Destroy.

211
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Come on!

212
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,280
Have to run. Now!

213
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,519
- Fall back!
- Vaporise.

214
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,120
Belinda. Belinda, my name is the
Doctor, and I will get you out of here.

215
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,479
- No!
- You're not doing a very good job!

216
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,959
I swear you can trust this man.

217
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,719
He came to us as a stranger,

218
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,479
and in just six months, I have
learnt to trust him with my life.

219
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,359
Take her home, Doctor.

220
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,919
Then take me to the stars.

221
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,279
That is a date.

222
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,359
The Delta Exit. I'll cover you,
Doctor. Now take her and run!

223
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,960
Okay. Okay.

224
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,400
No!

225
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,919
Queen
Belinda will surrender to us.

226
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,600
Doctor, we have to get out of here!

227
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,880
- But we're trapped!
- Come on! We're charging up!

228
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,319
They've all gone. All of 'em.

229
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,400
I'm sorry, Doctor.

230
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
We lost them.

231
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Doctor!

232
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,720
Polish, polish.

233
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,919
But... What is it?

234
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Come on. All right. Eyes!

235
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,799
Stops them following.

236
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,199
You'd better be worth it.

237
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,119
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

238
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,039
That's not my fault.

239
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,239
- O-Okay. Okay!
- None of this is my fault, mate.

240
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,520
Don't shush me.

241
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,239
I'm sorry about your friend.

242
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Sasha.

243
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,720
Sasha 55.

244
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
She was nice to me.

245
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
She was lovely.

246
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
She's dead.

247
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,479
Right.

248
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,839
Polish, polish.

249
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,679
- Polish, polish.
- Oh, no. Oh, oh, oh.

250
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,760
Little fella.

251
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,799
I'm sorry, babes, the Robots
could track you down and find us.

252
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,919
You have gotta go...

253
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,640
...off.

254
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Sorry.

255
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,720
Now, then, Miss Belinda Chandra,
we have got a world to overthrow.

256
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,840
Welcome to the North Zone.

257
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,359
It's interesting, that diploma
from the Star Register.

258
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,839
If I'm right, that
thing is dangerous.

259
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,879
Excuse me, is this IV?

260
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,319
Do you have basic IV?

261
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,559
- Is it fluids or medicine?
- That's simolin.

262
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,959
- It's fluid.
- Okay.

263
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,719
Um, it's empty.
Can I replace it?

264
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,879
Help yourself.

265
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,400
Simolin, IV kits,
sanferric, over there.

266
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,320
Disinfect with
mylos, Your Majesty.

267
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,200
Simolin, mylos. Got it.

268
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,959
I'm supposed to be starting
a new shift on Monday.

269
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,599
<i>Mundy Flynn.</i>

270
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,160
I'm an ordained Anglican Marine.

271
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,880
What? Happy watching?

272
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,999
Some things don't change.

273
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,880
There's always a doctor standing back
while the nurses do all the hard work.

274
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,599
So what's your
name? Doctor what?

275
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,919
Just the Doctor.

276
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,680
What?

277
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,559
- You're actually called "the Doctor"?
- Yeah.

278
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,959
All right,
then. I'm called the Nurse.

279
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,760
Doctor and Nurse, good team.

280
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,160
Now let's take a look at you, sweetheart.

281
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,239
How about you, darling? Has anyone
had a chance to look at you?

282
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,599
I'm okay. They said it's
a dislocated shoulder.

283
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Oh, yeah?

284
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,999
Doctor, are shoulders
on this planet

285
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,639
- the same as back on Earth?
- More or less.

286
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,759
It doesn't matter.

287
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,079
There's people in a worse state
than...

288
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,119
Just, uh, give it a good
rest for a couple of hours, okay?

289
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,160
Thanks.

290
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,159
Oh, my God!

291
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
It's like...

292
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,199
- X-ray blankets.
- X-ray blankets?

293
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,720
Radiation-free. And look.

294
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,519
The main difference between humans
and Missbelindachandrakind...

295
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,119
instead of the kidneys and the liver,
all the detox is carried out here,

296
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,839
in an organ called the pasculum.

297
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,279
- It's like a second diaphragm.
- Exactly.

298
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,680
The diaphragm kind of
protects it like a sheath.

299
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,519
Is that better or
worse than humans?

300
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,719
If you start deciding which body is best,
you're going down a very dangerous path.

301
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,319
That's the truest
thing I've heard all day.

302
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,960
And hey...

303
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,240
{\an8}Ta-da.

304
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,999
{\an8}Have you got two hearts?

305
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,519
{\an8}Padam, padam.

306
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,600
No way.

307
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,960
Can I... Do you mind if I...

308
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,760
Wow!

309
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,199
That's... That's so weird.

310
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,319
But the pasculum man,

311
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,319
- he hasn't got two hearts.
- No, no, no.

312
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm not Missbelindachandrakind.

313
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm from a different planet.

314
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Okay.

315
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,200
Another alien.

316
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,720
Add it to the list.

317
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,320
- So what are you doing here?
- I came for you.

318
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,759
- Why?
- I was told about you by someone.

319
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,240
It's kind of a long story, and I've
got to be careful about timelines.

320
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,199
But he told me your name
like you would be important.

321
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,120
But I'm not. I'm really not.

322
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,840
I just don't get it.

323
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,560
Why me?

324
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,599
You see, the problem is that.

325
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,960
The diploma. Have you got yours?

326
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,680
- The original?
- Uh-huh.

327
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,600
{\an8}But the AI Generator
has got the same thing.

328
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,919
- Yeah, so it's got a copy.
- It's not a copy.

329
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,080
{\an8}It is the exact
same diploma. Look.

330
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,999
{\an8}It's older, obviously,
because it's been here longer

331
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,279
{\an8}but it's got the same
exact tear. Do you see?

332
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,560
- Just like mine.
- Uh-huh. It's the same object twice.

333
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,479
{\an8}You mean it's literally the same
diploma, like in a time-travel way?

334
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,559
{\an8}- Timey-wimey.
- Timey-wimey?

335
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,719
{\an8}- Yep.
- Am I six?

336
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,879
{\an8}But it's fascinating.

337
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,919
'Cause I have waited for you
for a long time, Belinda.

338
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,199
And yet, when you were taken by
the Robots, I was at your house.

339
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
When was that for you?

340
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,319
Uh, I don't know.

341
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,399
It's been...

342
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,919
- two hours?
- It was six months ago for me.

343
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,759
I saw the rocket. I
was in your garden.

344
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,279
- Wait, you were at my house?
- Yes, and I chased you.

345
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,359
I followed you.

346
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,439
But when you were on board the
rocket, did you have a blip?

347
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,479
Did you feel a "schwup"?

348
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,719
Six-Six-Six-Sixteen years.

349
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,079
No, I-I-I did, yes.

350
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,239
It-It all went "schwup".

351
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,480
- We "schwupped".
- That... It was the fracture. In time.

352
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,799
- Which means?
- Everything is out of sync.

353
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,279
The border between this world and
Earth keeps jumping about in time.

354
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,599
So you left Earth
May the 24th 2025.

355
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,840
I followed you, but
when I landed...

356
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
{\an8}Hello, robots.

357
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,000
The Robots impounded
my spaceship.

358
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,839
No!

359
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,119
Please! Don't! I can help!

360
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,240
So I've been living down here
in the Undercity for six months.

361
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,079
Then I met Sasha.

362
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,600
And she
looked after me.

363
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,399
Yeah, she was, uh...

365
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,800
Sasha was the best.

366
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,040
And she died helping you.

367
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,799
It is not Belinda's fault.

368
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,560
Hey, I don't need you to
fight my battles. Thank you.

369
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,280
And it's not my fault.

370
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,879
Okay?

371
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,200
Is that an order from the queen?

372
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,960
Is that a royal decree?

373
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,680
- You're as bad as the Robots.
- Okay.

374
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,560
That's Manny.

375
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,599
He's good. I swear.

376
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm sorry.

377
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,479
So, I have been living here
with the rebels trying to help.

378
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,879
It's taken me a long
time to get promoted to Historian

379
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,920
so that I could finally be let into the
throne room for the day of your arrival.

380
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,919
At least someone's
glad to see me.

381
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,040
Worth the wait.

382
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,240
And the problem isn't you.

383
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,359
It is that diploma.

384
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,399
Because you've always
had that, yeah?

385
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,039
Yeah, it was on the wall.

386
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,320
I mean, it didn't mean anything.

387
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,240
The Robots must have
got it from the future.

388
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,360
But when they brought it
back to this planet...

389
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,759
- It went "schwup".
- Uh-huh.

390
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,919
- Back to the past.
- Gotcha.

391
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,799
But it travelled
further than six months.

392
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,159
It went back 5,000 years and
became a foundation myth.

393
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,239
I've seen films.

394
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,559
When you get two versions
of the same thing

395
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,799
crossing over in time,
don't they explode?

396
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,599
Yes. Yes!

397
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,439
If you get the same atoms in the same
space twice, the Laws of Time say no.

398
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,520
Kaboom.

399
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,280
I think I'll take this.

400
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,280
And I'll keep it very safe.

401
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,439
So is this, like, your job?

402
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,879
Are you some sort
of Time Detective?

403
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,959
No. Uh...

404
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,119
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

405
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,119
Take cover!

406
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,319
Manny!

407
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,200
Hold the roof!

408
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,439
This is all your
fault, Queen Belinda.

409
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,520
No, no, no.

410
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,360
Stay there.

411
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,360
Polish, polish. Polish, polish.

412
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,039
I need to get to
the memory banks.

413
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,239
I told Sasha that
that's the key.

414
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,800
That's... That's top security.

415
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,799
It's guarded by a
full Robot phalanx.

416
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,599
It'll have a record
of what went wrong.

417
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,639
Because the people and the Robots
have a great, big, long history.

418
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,399
You have been friends
for centuries.

419
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,959
And then it all changed.

420
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,439
In one night, ten years ago.

421
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,319
- But why?
- Wait.

422
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,080
Wait a minute.

423
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,680
They've found us.

424
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,639
Belinda, we need to get you out.

425
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,159
- I did this.
- Manny!

426
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,439
Manny, grab the documents.
Belinda, go with Shago.

427
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,480
- This way.
- No! I'm telling you, I did this!

428
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,840
Rebels,
you will surrender.

429
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,760
Everyone, guns down.

430
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,080
They've come for me.

431
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,799
Manny, put your gun down.

432
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,080
- Right now.
- You betrayed us.

433
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,840
- I'm saving you.
- Bel.

434
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,160
What have you done?

435
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,040
I'm sorry.

436
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,440
But people are dying.

437
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,360
And it is my fault.

438
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,920
Because my name is
Miss Belinda Chandra.

439
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,880
And it's about time I owned it.

440
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,480
- Belinda.
- Silence. Let her speak.

441
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,080
Robot, now listen to
the words of your queen.

442
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,560
Leave these people alone.

443
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,720
Take me.

444
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,159
Queen of our great
planet, your heart may beg and weep,

445
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,279
but I will bring
elevation to you.

446
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,399
But, hold on, can I just say?

447
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,760
Boss, if you leave Belinda
alone and you weld with me,

448
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,439
you will get a
much better result.

449
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,879
You are the Historian. You
will witness events. Not participate.

450
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,679
But she won't
survive the process.

451
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,520
You will be silent.

452
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
It's okay.

453
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,600
'Cause once I'm part of the
machine, I can talk to it.

454
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,239
Maybe I can lead
it towards peace.

455
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,159
The ceremony will begin.

456
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,080
Polish, polish. Polish, polish.

457
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,040
Polish, polish. Polish, polish.

458
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,000
Hi, little fella.

459
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,680
I don't think you want
to be a part of this.

460
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,760
But thank you.

461
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,200
Off you go.

462
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,879
Polish,
polish. Polish, polish.

463
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,999
Polish, polish.

464
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,800
Conversion will be
a world without sadness or pity.

465
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,679
You will achieve
serenity, peace and joy.

466
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,760
With me.

467
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,159
Serenity, peace and joy.

468
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,240
What do I do?

469
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,640
Approach the Great AI Generator.

470
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
I'm doing this
for you, remember?

471
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,079
Once I'm gone, stop the war.

472
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,759
We will honour you and remember
your sacrifice, Missbelindachandra.

473
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,560
Okay.

474
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,520
Just remember me as Belinda.

475
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
You can drop the miss.

476
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,560
Never liked it anyway.

477
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,080
I said to Alan that
night, "Who says miss?"

478
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,280
Are you married?

479
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,920
- What?
- What?

480
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,880
Are you married?

481
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,120
- But that's what he said.
- Who did?

482
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,280
Those were his exact words.

483
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,600
Hold on.

484
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,320
Are you...

485
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,640
At last.

486
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,760
{\an8}You know me.

487
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,439
Belinda, beloved.

488
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,520
Behold!

489
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,400
Alan?

490
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,760
It's not AI.

491
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
It's Al.

492
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Alan Budd?

493
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Belinda.

494
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,720
Oh, my God.

495
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,640
Alan, are you all right?

496
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I am supreme.

497
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,599
That must hurt.

498
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,280
I am beyond pain.

499
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,159
I don't understand.

500
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,560
For God's sake, Alan.

501
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,480
What are you doing here?

502
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,639
I thought you moved to Margate.

503
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,959
Stargate.

504
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,840
- But how did you end up...
- They came for me in the night.

505
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
You are Alan Budd?

506
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
What the hell?

507
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,640
Oh, my God.

508
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,600
It's my fault.

509
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,800
I told them about Alan.

510
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,519
I told them to...

511
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,319
Alan Daniel Budd.

512
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,520
Go get him!

513
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,359
Okay.

514
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,520
So the Robots went to get Alan.

515
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,640
But to do that, they went
through the Time Fracture.

516
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,639
- They went "schwup".
- So they went back...

517
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,360
Ten long years ago.

518
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,760
He landed before the
Robot Revolution.

519
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,159
I find happiness beyond pain.

520
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,760
But you've been killing people.

521
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,680
Because he loved it.

522
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,480
You mean,
it's like a game?

523
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,119
With robots and
cities and lasers.

524
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,800
And you're saying this is mine?

525
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,520
I can make up the rules and win.

526
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,479
Oh, give it to me.

527
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,040
I feel strong.

528
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Like never before.

529
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,119
I feel power.

530
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,639
We
welcome you to this world, Earthman.

531
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,520
But, I must confess,

532
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,080
this Robot technology seems in
advance of ours by a good ten years.

533
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,439
- Do you mind if I ask you...
- I mind.

534
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,520
Very much.

535
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Destroy him.

536
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,319
You started the Revolution.

537
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,079
But what for?

538
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,200
Bel, why did you
finish with him?

539
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,999
Because...

540
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,199
And when we're married,

541
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,879
I really don't think you should
wear clothes that tight anymore.

542
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,160
Plus, no more texting
after 8:00 p.m.

543
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,800
- Okay?
- Alan, sweetheart, no.

544
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,840
'Cause all you ever
did was correct me.

545
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,080
And tut and huff
and roll your eyes.

546
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,880
And tell me off!

547
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,439
Oh, my God.

548
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,320
You've taken coercive control and made
it complete control of the whole planet.

549
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,920
How can you live with yourself?

550
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,720
That's the point.

551
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,800
He can't.

552
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,080
- He's the king of the world!
- No. No.

553
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,359
Every ninth word.

554
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,560
Your brain interfaces with the
machine on an eight-part loop.

555
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,239
So every speech, every ninth
word, your mind is free.

556
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,759
Every ninth word is
telling us the truth.

557
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,120
Help me. Save me. Pain.

558
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,560
You were born to travel.

559
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,639
Destined for me, Belinda.

560
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,999
To the perfect wedding.

561
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,600
Your mind subsumed within mine.

562
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,239
Planet of the incels.

563
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,440
Say yes, Belinda.

564
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,319
Or the violence
will rage forever.

565
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,759
Alan, I can help you.

566
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,959
I can separate the bio-links.

567
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,640
No more words!

568
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm sorry.

569
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,199
I've got no choice.

570
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,680
Belinda, he won't stop.

571
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,279
His anger will go on and on.

572
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,560
Face me!

573
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,039
You will obey me, Belinda.

574
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,880
Now hold the diploma.

575
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,040
My bride.

576
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,200
Join with me in
ecstasy and freedom.

577
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,439
Polish, polish.

578
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,880
Polish, polish.

579
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,880
Polish, polish. Polish, polish.

580
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,880
I'm sorry.

581
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,640
Bel!

582
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,720
- What happened?
- Ouch.

583
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,720
You needed a Time Lord
to take the kaboom.

584
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Wow!

585
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,679
Oh, Bel, baby! Ha!

586
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,959
I just went through your
entire life like a bullet!

587
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,279
The Time Fracture
sent me like whoosh!

588
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,680
And, Bel!

589
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,359
You are amazing,
Belinda Chandra.

590
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,560
You and me, we go back years.

591
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,360
But where's Alan?
Where did he go?

592
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,280
Uh...

593
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
I...

594
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
think...

595
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,400
he's microscopic.

596
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,840
- Do you mean he...
- He's a sperm and an egg.

597
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,320
- Polish, polish. Polish, polish.
- Oh.

598
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,120
- Polish, polish.
- Oh.

599
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,520
Goodbye, Alan.

600
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,559
- This place is nuts!
- Ah! Yas Queen!

601
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,599
Robots, rejoice!

602
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,279
Free from Alan Budd Generator,

603
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,439
we will make reparations

604
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,000
and live in harmony with the
people to rebuild this world.

605
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,920
Now, Doctor, behold.

606
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,199
Oh! Oh. Baby!

607
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,520
- Give me some!
- I saw that box in space.

608
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,039
- Is that your TARDIS?
- Isn't she everything?

609
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,319
Well, I mean, it's gonna be
a tight fit with both of us.

610
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,119
Babes, there's still a little
bit of mystery left. Huh?

611
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,680
Like how do the Robots get a
hold of this in the future?

612
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,440
You solve your mystery

613
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,400
after you've taken me home.

614
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,879
Okay.

615
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,039
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
- Okay, okay, okay.

616
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,599
You lot. Forgive. Rebuild.

617
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,799
Maybe change the name
of the solar system.

618
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,760
Well, we thought we'd start with
renaming this building, Doctor.

619
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,280
In honour of those that we lost.

620
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,120
This will now be the
Citadel of Sasha 55.

621
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,839
- Thank you.
- And I've got to say.

622
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,959
All praise to you, Queen
Belinda of planet Earth.

623
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,359
All hail Belinda,
queen of planet Earth.

624
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,839
All hail Belinda,
queen of planet Earth.

625
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,960
Thank you.

626
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
And good luck.

627
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,440
Lovely. Let's go. Okay?

628
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,799
Let's go, let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go,

629
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,760
let's go, let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

630
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,440
Oh, now this is ridiculous.

631
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,079
If you thought this
was mad, that is mad.

632
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,880
It is bigger on the inside
than it is on the outside.

633
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,919
Yeah. I-I know.

634
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
Now get me home.

635
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,679
24th of May 2025.

636
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
My shift starts at 7:30 a.m.

637
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,319
Thank you very much.

638
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,999
Yeah, but we don't need
to rush 'cause Time Lord.

639
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,080
Time machine.

640
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,760
- This is a-a time machine?
- Boom.

641
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,439
Because there is something
already connecting us, Belinda.

642
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,720
Way beyond robots.

643
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,519
I have been to the future,

644
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,280
and I have met your descendant
on a planet far away,

645
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,519
in the 51st century.

646
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,560
Her name was Mundy Flynn.

647
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,079
- Did she look like me?
- Absolute match.

648
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,000
The 51st century?

649
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
You're saying...

650
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,800
3,000 years' time?

651
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,400
Is that supposed to
be a coincidence?

652
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,640
Now, that is what
I am worried about.

653
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,880
'Cause the genetic
link is amazing.

654
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,639
Is that just chance or
something more?

655
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,799
I can't
help thinking,

656
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,399
Bel, that maybe we are
meant to be connected.

657
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,959
Like, this is destiny?

658
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,919
Is that what you say
to all the girls?

659
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,640
Is that what you said to Sasha?

660
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,360
She trusted you, and she died.

661
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,799
You tested my DNA without
even asking my permission.

662
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
God.

663
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,799
You're dangerous.

664
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,880
I'm sorry.

665
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,440
Inexcusable.

666
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,599
With both hearts, I apologise.

667
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,000
I am not one of your adventures.

668
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,680
Now, I'm asking you, Doctor,
to do the right thing.

669
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,040
I will take you home.

670
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Thank you.

671
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,680
That was quick.

672
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,999
Are we there?

673
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,880
No, no. Uh, we're...

674
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,680
Is this how it works?

675
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,919
Do we just kind of
bounce our way home?

676
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,399
Something is wrong.

677
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,919
Like we are being repelled.

678
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,000
We are bouncing off May
the 24th, and that...

679
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,520
is impossible.

680
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,919
That is all wrong.

681
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,719
Oh, my God. We're in space.

682
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,120
Halfway between Missbelindachandra
and planet Earth.

683
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,119
- Is that 'cause of the Time Fracture?
- No.

684
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,199
No, no, no, no, no.

685
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,759
No, no, no. I closed
that. This is...

686
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,720
This is... This...

687
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
This is...

688
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,439
I don't know what this is.

689
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,519
Okay. Let's see.

690
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,959
Right now, it is not working.

691
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,840
Right.

692
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,959
Something is stopping us.

693
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,319
Something is bouncing us off planet
Earth on the day that we left.

694
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,920
- But why?
- Doctor, I told you. Get me home!

695
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,919
- I am.
- You are not.

696
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,519
This might be the long
way round, Miss Belinda Chandra,

697
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,400
but hold on tight because
this is gonna be quite a ride.

698
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,039
{\an8}- <i>We're in actual 1952?</i>
<i>- Miami, Florida.</i>

699
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,999
<i>Fifteen people went missing.</i>

700
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,559
The movies keep playing to an empty
house. Gives you the chills, don't it?

701
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,999
<i>Get ready.</i>

702
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,559
<i>'Cause here I come.</i>

703
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,679
Ta-da!
