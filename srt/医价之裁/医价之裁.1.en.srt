00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Some people use their talents.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Some people work hard.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Eventually, they turn their time into money.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
NARUKI!

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What's important is to know which path you're going to take.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But what awaits you after you've taken that path?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No one knows.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The End

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
As the chairman of the family, I would like to express my heartfelt condolences for the misfortune of this trip.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Did you actually have a medical mistake?

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Please explain it to me.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not good at technology.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The End

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why didn't you do the route capture and the recovery first?

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry. I'll go get the lunch box first.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What did I do?

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry. I don't need a doctor!

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Are you okay?

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Pick it up.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know if it's a temporary recovery.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm in trouble if I'm sent to a jobless amateur.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If I was a kid, I wouldn't be able to finish my job.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you listening?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What are you doing?

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What are you ignoring?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The swing isn't dull.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Um, NARUKI.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Huh?

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't mean to help you.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then why?

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I found a way to make more money.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So I decided to quit this hospital.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But you didn't do anything that would hurt your neck.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No, it won't hurt my neck.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What?

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The End

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The Toin Second Division, NARUKI KANINARI,

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
ordered Professor Shuhei Baba, a Toin professor, to be sent to the hospital.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He was injured for two weeks.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He will be punished with the above facts.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Director, is that okay?

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hey, hey, don't you have any shame?

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You don't want to lose your position, do you?

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What's with that attitude?

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Say something!

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Dr. Baba.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, that's all.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
My neck...

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
might be in a bad shape.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're finally going to die.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If I get arrested, I will report to the Labor Standards Director as a failure.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Failure?

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Then I won't be able to report about the power of Dr. Baba's eyes.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What do you mean?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It seems that he was talking to Kuzuha.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But he was recording.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Here are the evidence of violence and violence.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No, no, that's...

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wait.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He didn't really record it.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Right?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Did you find out?

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's right.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That Kuzuha has no point in asking that.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He was just being beaten up.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What are you talking about?

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What?

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He just recorded it.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's a self-proclaimed confession.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
By the way, I also got the doctor's diagnosis.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will report it as evidence.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What do you want?

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What do you want?

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey, Ruki.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's going on?

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You got paid to go to the self-proclaimed school.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is that okay?

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The school doesn't pay the school fees at the elementary school.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm glad that you understand that you can get an additional bonus called the salary.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There's nothing more to do in this hospital.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's a plan.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm going home to change my job.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
See you.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm waiting for you.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Please come in.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Welcome to my office.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's been a while.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What about the bullying in the training room?

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The director's voice is gone.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The power-hungry doctor is doing well somewhere.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You two know each other.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Please.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Mr. Naruki, when you were in the Kyokuto University Hospital.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't remember taking care of you.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You were a shift agent to earn more than a doctor.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm doing a shift support for the profession introduction class.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm doing a shift support for the profession introduction class.

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So you're exactly like me.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, the guest is the hospital.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You are the product.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Product?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I sell the product called the doctor at the hospital.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you introduce a doctor and make him sign a contract, you'll get a total of 3 million yen.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
3 million?

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The annual sales are slightly more than the previous year.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The company's president and I are making a lot of money.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I didn't get anything.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yonaga Aki is an honest and excellent staff.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't have much money.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You don't have to worry.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Money?

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You don't have to worry.

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The company doesn't charge you money.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's a system that pays money from the hospital.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So the request for the shift is the same as money.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I want to hope for 20 million yen a year.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
20 million?

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's the third year since I got the certificate.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can trust me honestly.

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But...

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have a debt on a certain issue.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You don't understand how high the annual salary is.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
For reference, the average annual salary of university hospital doctors at the age of Kuzuha is 3.2 million yen.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Even the hospital doctors have an average salary of 8 million yen.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But you...

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You don't want to be 5 million or 10 million yen.

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You want 20 million yen.

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I wonder.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You still have a shallow career.

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You don't have any outstanding achievements.

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You don't have any special skills.

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You don't have any skills.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You don't have any skills.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's how much you can afford.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But I can afford it.

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Really?

143
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll make it happen.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll get it back.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll pay you right after this.

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You don't have to do it now.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Then...

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have one condition to accept.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

150
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You must not interfere with my way of doing things.

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You just have to keep quiet and not interfere with me.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, please.

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
20 million.

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you okay?

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You were just a young man.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're a bad mouth, Enuga.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're right.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're a great teacher.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're a good teacher.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm just a normal person.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But I have a good chance of getting a job at another hospital.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll start with a relatively easy job.

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What?

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're a junior.

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I thought you were going to say, wash your face and come back.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If you have good pay, you'll get paid.

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm getting a good pay.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well...

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How do I start this?

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We have a heart attack that has been going on since 9 a.m.

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We have a heart attack that has been going on since 9 a.m.

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What's the result?

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Blood pressure is 150 to 90, heart rate 110, and oxygen is 5 liters, and saturation is 98.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes?

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Are you sleeping?

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You look like you're in a bad mood.

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What?

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're so busy that you're going to get a debt.

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's a problem with gambling.

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What? Why?

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're going to get a job that doesn't have a way to relieve stress.

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I put a bet on it.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I see.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So...

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Your job will be decided.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm going to get a job that doesn't have a way to relieve stress.

187
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Your job will be decided.

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Really?

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hiragisougou Hospital.

190
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hiragisougou Hospital.

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Established in 1976.

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It aims to improve medical care in the area, and recently it's also working on emergency medical care.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
One of the problems is that the staff is getting more and more efficient.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Really?

195
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Huh?

196
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Kuzuha?

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Arai?

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Long time no see.

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're here since the first-term examination, right?

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Arai is in this hospital right now.

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I see.

203
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Kuzuha, what are you doing here?

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Actually, I came to get an interview.

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
A job?

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I see.

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Then you should work hard to be adopted and get a job instead of me.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't think you can do that.

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What do you mean?

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I recently got a divorce, and my children are small, and my family is strict without a job.

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm still not good at law, so I don't really want to work outside of Masuika.

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I see.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

214
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're late.

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You have a long way to go.

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry. I happened to meet my colleague.

217
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I met my colleague.

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're going to be my colleague at times like this?

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The interview is usually about colleagues.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
90% of the doctors are liars, and the rest are weirdos.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll check again, but I don't need to do it anymore.

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You just have to give me the minimum response.

223
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Is that really okay?

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You're just a product. I'm the one who sells it.

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's good to decide that way.

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I won't talk to you.

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,140
I'd be happy if a young

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm sure it's a loss of opportunity for you to drop out here.

229
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're in a position to ask for it, but it looks like you're great.

230
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm not asking for it. I'm recommending it.

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Unfortunately, it's enough for people.

232
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't intend to hire you until I'm free.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, it's true that it may or may not be 60 points.

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Young, young, manual-type stones

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
There may be no need to hire.

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
By the way, do you know the local medical system?

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What's the sudden?

238
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Local medical system is a system that adds medical benefits to hospitals that have received more than 2,000 emergency deliveries a year.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
In short, it is a bonus from the country for hospitals that have received a lot of emergency.

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I know that.

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's wonderful. There is also a very unobtrusive director.

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So?

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Do you know the number of people who receive emergency deliveries at the Hiragi General Hospital?

244
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
About 1,600 per year.

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Last year was 1,800 per year.

246
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
In other words, if you can receive an emergency delivery of 200 more, you will meet the conditions of the reward.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The bonus was rolling in.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The reward is 6,200 yen per person.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The average number of hospitalization patients is about 7,000.

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
In total, you will receive 4,340,000 yen.

251
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If you hire him, you can achieve this.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The budget is ...

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's your point?

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm disappointed.

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What?

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If you hire one doctor, the number of medical staff will increase, and the number of patients will increase.

257
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The budget will not match.

258
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes.

259
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So instead of increasing the number of doctors, you should hire one person instead.

260
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you talking about?

261
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is the data of the number of emergency recipients per day on the day of the appointment.

262
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What can you read from that data?

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The number of people who receive on Thursdays is small.

264
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's right. It's clearly different from other days.

265
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If you do something on Thursday, you can achieve 2,000 orders a year.

266
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
In other words, you can't get a job.

267
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You can achieve this.

268
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
In other words, you can replace the number of people who receive on Thursdays with the number of people who receive on Thursdays.

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If you refuse to receive an emergency, you will not be able to enter my ears.

270
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The number of people who receive on Thursdays remains as a record.

271
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So why is the number of people who receive on Thursdays small?

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That means that the emergency team is intentionally avoiding the spread of this disease.

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
After all, on Thursdays, the number of people who receive on Thursdays is not easy to achieve.

274
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm still not good at getting a job, so I don't really want to do anything other than the mass-e-culture world.

275
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
In other words, you should just keep a low profile.

276
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Um, Mr. Maruki.

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What's wrong?

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Nothing.

279
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He's good at that.

280
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He's not bad, but he's not bad.

281
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He's a good guy.

282
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He's good at it.

283
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's what trust is.

284
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What should I do?

285
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Ms. Arai, Ms. Hirani has an important message for you.

287
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Congratulations on your marriage.

288
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Thank you.

289
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
At your age, 20 million yen a year is a great deal.

290
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You might even be able to stand up for yourself in debt.

291
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're worried about Ms. Arai's job.

292
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm going to push her away and prioritize myself.

293
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If you think so, you can introduce me to her.

294
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Maybe you should start over.

296
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll tell you this.

297
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you don't know, you'll be eaten.

298
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's the world.

299
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I've checked the 4 million yen deposit.

300
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What's the special reward for you?

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll read it.

302
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Please read it.

303
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's a good deal.

304
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I guess that's about it.

305
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Thank you.

306
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But you have to be careful not to buy too much.

307
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You'll be sued by the labor union.

308
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He doesn't have that idea.

309
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You'll make a jobless job eaters.

310
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's true that there are many agents like that.

311
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's all thanks to you.

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I found a job that I expected.

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
If you need anything, please tell me.

314
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll be with you from now on.

315
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Thank you.

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Boss, I think it was a perfect job change.

318
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We'll find out later.

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You have to follow up.

320
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Excuse me.

321
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Boss, the next client.

322
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
To be honest,

323
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
with the conditions and the current situation of Mr. Arai,

324
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
it will be difficult to change jobs.

325
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's right.

326
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But if you add time and passion,

327
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
it will not be impossible.

328
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm coming with you.

329
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hello.

330
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm Kuzuha.

331
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So this time, the labor union was NARUKI's doing?

332
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I just answered his request.

333
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, I can't say it's the right thing to continue in our hospital.

334
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The extreme power of the army is still the same?

335
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes.

336
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Now, the influence of the head of the Tendo branch is great.

337
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Mr. Kuramochi is the only one who can take advantage of it.

338
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If I could be the only head of the branch,

339
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I would be a teacher of the army.

340
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But he has no spirit of hunger.

341
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He can't be the top just because he's good.

342
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Well, I don't think he's trying to be the best.

343
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
How is Professor Tsukada in the army?

344
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Are you regretting quitting the house?

345
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't think so.

346
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I can't compare to the time.

347
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's not it.

348
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It was easier to investigate our hospital, right?

349
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Mr. Oaizu's medical care.

350
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Mai.

352
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Mai!

353
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Mai!

354
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Mai!

355
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Mr. Oaizu was just put on the spot.

356
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's your fault, right?

357
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What about the staff at the time?

360
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Including the nurse,

361
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
all the members who participated in the operation,

362
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
including Mr. Kuramochi, were all in the operation.

363
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's so unnatural.

364
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Shouldn't they have stayed in the hospital?

365
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There's a limit to what you can find out from the inside.

366
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You don't know, but

367
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
if you do this job, you'll get all the information from the medical industry.

368
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't want to give up.

369
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Dad!

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Watch me!

371
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll keep looking from the position of a personnel.

372
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But what will come out of here?

373
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What's wrong?

374
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I got it.

375
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Sorry, but

376
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
an important product has arrived.

377
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Product?

378
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You came.

379
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You're worried about losing your job.

380
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I heard the cause was Mr. Naruki.

381
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's my fault.

382
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's a matter of recognition.

383
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I heard everything from Mr. Kuzuha.

384
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Then why are you here?

385
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If you're an agent, you have another one.

386
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
If you're jealous of me, why don't you get another one?

387
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I couldn't get you to introduce me to work.

388
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
From any company.

389
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That's why I came here.

390
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's all your fault.

391
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Is it really just Mr. Naruki's fault?

392
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What do you mean?

393
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Even if it's Mr. Naruki's fault,

394
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
it's not worth it for Mr. Arai to introduce me to work.

395
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't understand.

396
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yoraka,

397
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
why don't you wrap it up a little more?

398
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But it's true that you can't do any more work.

399
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You can't get a job.

400
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You're a bad guy who got fired from his job.

401
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's natural that you don't want anything.

402
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I can do it.

403
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But I can do it.

404
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm different from the second-rate agents around there.

405
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
There are agents who are just good at talking,

406
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
but I can give you a product value.

407
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
How?

408
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's sort it out.

409
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
There are two reasons why your job transfer conditions are strict.

410
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:30,860
First, it's difficult to get a job in the

411
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I can't say I'm going home on stage.

412
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's...

413
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That's where I propose a single-cell hospital for plastic surgery.

414
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I recommend you to transfer here.

415
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Kasumi Plastic Surgery Hospital

416
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It sells a high-end, clean image as a large-scale specialized hospital.

417
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
According to the administration's policy,

418
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
there are many new facilities and testing devices.

419
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Why plastic surgery?

420
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's easy to die from a broken bone.

421
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So, most of the plastic surgery is done.

422
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That means it's easy to control time.

423
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's also possible to do a job without a job.

424
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The problem is that Kasumi doesn't have a job in the right-hand sector.

425
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But a good-looking man will do the job for you.

426
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Mr. Naruki, why?

427
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That's my line.

428
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Why do you still have a very hard job after this Kasumi?

429
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
That's...

430
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I just started.

431
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You're working hard to get a job,

432
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
but the Hiiragi Plastic Surgery Hospital you entered is closed.

433
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
If you're forced to stay in the country, you won't be able to work there.

434
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Fortunately, I don't do that to my cute juniors.

435
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I just want to help Mr. Arai Natsuki.

436
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But...

437
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'll tell you this.

438
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You have no right to refuse.

439
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So, Mr. Kuzaha...

440
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
He's going to connect you and Kasumi to the Plastic Surgery Hospital.

441
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You should have a partner.

442
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I understand.

443
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Thank you.

444
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Mom, do you think I'll find a job?

445
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah, you might.

446
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
If you get a job, you'll be late for the night again.

447
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'll work hard to get a job so you don't have to.

448
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Go.

449
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I see.

450
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,640
I was listing a hospital that could be in a

451
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,000
good situation, but I'm glad it went well.

452
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Thank you for your concern.

453
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You met a good agent.

454
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
He seems to be a good person, but he seems to be an excellent person.

455
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Can I ask your name?

456
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
He's Mr. Naruki from a company called Dr. Connection.

457
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Naruki...

458
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Excuse me.

460
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I've decided to interview Kasumi at the Plastic Surgery Hospital.

461
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I see.

462
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Then, Yonaga, it's a mission.

463
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I understand.

464
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I want to know the truth of the rumor.

465
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Thank you for your hard work.

466
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Is the surgery successful?

467
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's tough.

468
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm not good at working.

469
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I see.

470
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Thank you for your hard work.

471
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Are you a new employee?

472
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I joined last week.

473
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You're Mr. Takagi, right?

474
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yes, I'm Takagi.

475
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Is the surgery here tough?

476
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think most plastic surgeons have a scheduled surgery.

477
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's true, but...

478
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Especially the plastic surgery department...

479
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Is the plastic surgery department here the same as the rumor?

480
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes, it is.

481
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
What?

482
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I mean...

483
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Right?

484
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yes, it is.

485
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I knew it.

486
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Mr. Takagi.

487
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm going.

488
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Mr. Takagi, are you there?

489
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Mr. Takagi?

490
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What?

491
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'll call him.

492
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Mr. Takagi.

493
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What?

494
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What?

495
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Kasumi's surgery at the Plastic Surgery Hospital is very tough.

496
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Nanami Ryuki, who joined the office two years ago,

497
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
has been a management consultant

498
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and has been in charge of various hospital management and risk management.

499
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He's been in charge of the University Hospital in Kyokuto.

500
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I heard he's been there.

501
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yes.

502
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So?

503
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
From his soft looks and his softness,

504
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Nanami Ryuki is loved by patients,

505
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,960
but he's feared by the staff for being mercilessly

506
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,000
and being a scum.

507
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
He's the first-ever salesman to be a scum.

508
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
He's been in charge of the power supply,

509
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
the demand for dumping for MRs,

510
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
and increasing the frequency of the rent.

511
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
He's been in charge of the over-the-counter treatment.

512
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What about the rumors about the patients?

513
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The over-the-counter treatment.

514
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's the truth.

515
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Then we'll just have to wait for Kuzawa's investigation report.

516
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You can go home now.

517
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Um, why are you here for Ms. Arai?

518
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Huh?

519
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Because her introduction fee is at least 2 million yen.

520
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Isn't it a bad cost?

521
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I thought I was working for the introduction fee,

522
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
but I was wrong.

523
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You were wrong?

524
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Really?

525
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh, it's you, Kuzawa.

526
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I see.

527
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Then I have all the cards.

528
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's here.

529
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Let's go.

530
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I've been waiting.

531
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Where did you get the information?

532
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
The agent has a lot of information.

533
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Do you know him?

534
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He's my former benefactor.

535
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Does he have a family?

536
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Are you really recommending Kasumi's plastic surgery hospital to Ms. Arai?

537
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What's that?

538
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You know the problem with that hospital, don't you?

539
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
If you know and are trying to involve her in the anesthesia, then you...

540
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
This is my job.

541
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So you want to introduce the anesthesia to the head of the department of the Department of Remuneration?

542
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes, I thought it wasn't a bad idea.

543
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But if you don't bring her, I don't think she'll be enthusiastic enough.

544
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The hospital needs more anesthetists, right?

545
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Necessary?

546
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What for?

547
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I can't say it out loud, but the hospital needs a series of anesthetics.

548
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yonaka, do you know what a series of anesthetics is?

549
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
One anesthetist will do an operation of two or more opiates at the same time.

550
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Yes, because the anesthesia will inevitably be created by the time the opiates disappear from the opiates.

551
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Do you know that?

552
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Of course.

553
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Good.

554
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
There are hospitals in the world where people with no knowledge from consults can make a difference.

555
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
We do leave a small number of anesthetists to the best of our ability, so there are cases where we perform a series of anesthetics.

556
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And what are they?

557
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I see.

558
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
A series of anesthetics is only prohibited.

559
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It doesn't violate the law, and we're the only ones who do it.

560
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But it would be better if there were more anesthetics.

561
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
There's no room for unnecessary human rights.

562
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Well, if you hire someone, you can get 8 million yen a year.

563
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
In that case, the amount of the fee is 1.6 million yen.

564
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
If you can lower this a lot, you can move.

565
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Then the fee is 10 million yen.

566
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
What?

567
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's a joke.

568
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's a joke, too. 10 million is 10 million.

569
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
What are you talking about?

570
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I said to lower it.

571
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The fee is free to be determined by us, so we're lowering it to a large extent, even if it's a million yen.

572
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I understand.

573
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Now is the time.

574
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't have time to joke around.

575
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I made time because Mr. Kuzuhara said so.

576
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Then, since it's a big deal, I'll look at this document and judge.

577
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's an internal report on the death of the owner.

578
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Death?

579
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Why is this?

580
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
There are cases where it disappears during surgery, but Kasumino is a strange thing than the Tanka disease of the Holy Spirit.

581
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Even though the bones are broken, they will not die soon.

582
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The cause is a death.

583
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
According to the data, it seems that the Tanka that supplies oxygen during surgery has fallen.

584
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
If the anesthesia was looking at the SPO2 on the biological monitoring monitor, it should have been prevented, but no one noticed.

585
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Why?

586
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Because there was no anesthesia on the spot.

587
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
In other words, it will be a medical accident caused by a series of anesthesia.

588
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Why?

589
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Why is the internal report leaking to you?

590
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Then I'll just wait for the investigation report from Mr. Kuzuhara.

591
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Don't worry.

592
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
This information is not leaked to the board of directors yet.

593
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I haven't received it yet.

594
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
By the way, I wonder if this is still 10 million yen expensive.

595
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:09,000
By the way, about Hawahara, illegal dumping, and over-medication of crime, and about this case, I'm blind.

596
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The one who gave me a full price is the one who gave me a full price.

597
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Where is this information?

598
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
If you don't find it, I promise you that this information will not leak from our company.

599
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So now, let's sign a contract for each other's rights and duties.

600
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm sorry.

601
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Let's have an interview the day after tomorrow.

602
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The End

603
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yes.

604
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm so grateful to Mr. Naruki for giving me such a quick interview.

605
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Thank you very much.

606
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Excuse me.

607
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Mom, have you decided on your job?

608
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yes.

609
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Mom will be back soon. I don't think it will be late.

610
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Really?

611
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yes!

612
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Let's go home and cook.

613
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'll help you.

614
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Thank you.

615
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I can't believe that the rich teacher is so good at this.

616
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Mr. Naruki, please tell me about the medical care.

617
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I was worried about what you were going to do.

618
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You will be in trouble.

619
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You will be in trouble.

620
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Please trust me more.

621
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I know your abilities.

622
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
What's the bonus you will get this time?

623
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm going to investigate the details.

624
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It was hard to find it.

625
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's quite risky.

626
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's a special bonus.

627
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yay!

628
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Thank you for the food.

629
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But I don't know Mr. Naruki.

630
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
He's a good student.

631
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Mr. Naruki, you don't have to work anymore.

632
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You will have more time with your daughter.

633
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's ideal to stay where you should be.

634
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Is Nanami's office okay?

635
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
As the old benefactor said,

636
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Mr. Naruki will be involved in the problem.

637
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Last year, a man in surgery died at the hospital in Kasumi.

638
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
The hospital is suspected of being responsible for the medical accident.

639
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That's why the head of Nanami's office is dead.

640
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That hospital will be reborn in a clean state.

641
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Arai got the ideal environment at the real hospital.

642
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Could it be that Mr. Naruki is...

643
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But he had a contract for the medical care.

644
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Kuzuha woke up and leaked it.

645
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'll send you an email.

646
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Maybe the first one he sent was a special bonus.

647
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
First, a relatively easy one.

648
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's Kasumi.

649
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
He sent Mr. Kuzuha as a special bonus.

650
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Everything is calculated.

651
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
If you put Arai Natsuki on your head,

652
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'll prioritize myself.

653
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
If you introduce me to her,

654
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I recommend you to transfer to the Tanka Hospital in the lower-class department.

655
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Where did you calculate it?

656
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I don't know.

657
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But...

658
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm sure it's not going to work.

659
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Excuse me.

660
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm Mamori Kitami, the director of labor standards.

661
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I don't want to be hard on you.

662
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What do you want to talk about?

663
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Mamori.

664
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm looking at the doctor's connection.

665
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It smells like a defect.

666
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
What's that?

667
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
He has to be crushed.

668
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Who are you?

669
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
You are...

670
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
The Tanka Hospital

671
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The Tanka Hospital has overcome many difficulties

672
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and reached the 70th anniversary of its founding.

673
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But there are still many challenges.

674
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
First, we need to build a healthy medical system for patients.

675
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I think this will still improve.

676
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
We will be the teachers of what happened three years ago.

677
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
We will teach patients and their families how to deal with it without worrying.

678
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
We have to make sure that this never happens again.

679
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
As the director of labor standards,

680
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I ask all of you to be honest with yourselves.

681
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Did you actually have a medical mistake?

682
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm not good at it.

683
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Dr. Naruki.

684
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm sorry.

685
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
The Tanka Hospital

686
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
That's all for today.

687
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Who are you?

688
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You are...

689
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You leaked the information.

690
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's a misunderstanding.

691
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's just a big lesson.

692
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You can't hide your mistakes.

693
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
If you want to hold a trial, you shouldn't do unnecessary research.

694
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Just like in the last three years of the war,

695
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
it won't go as you wrote in the script.

696
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Naruki.

697
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You are...

698
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
The one who was in charge of the trial...

699
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
There was a man who put his father's sins on the line during that trial.

700
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Who was that?

701
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I don't know anything about that.

702
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You were the one who coordinated that trial.

703
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You shouldn't know anything.

704
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You didn't plan to apologize to that court.

705
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You didn't have to apologize to anyone.

706
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Thank you for your attention.

707
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Kanenari.

708
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Please...

709
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
believe in your father.

710
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Professor Amino.

711
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I read the paper the other day.

712
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm sorry.

713
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You don't say anything.

714
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm sorry.

715
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I have a question.

716
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I need to use the bathroom.

717
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Naruki.

718
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Long time no see.

719
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm sorry to see you.

720
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
How did you get in?

721
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm Mr. Kuzusa, who was in charge of the trial.

722
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Today is my retirement day.

723
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm here to return this.

724
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You should know.

725
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You're not welcome here.

726
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You have your father's name.

727
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I want to find him.

728
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The culprit who put my father's death on the line.

729
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
The culprit who put my father's death on the line.

730
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Someone put his father's death on the line.

731
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Naruki is investigating.

732
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
He took his own life.

733
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
He was in the hospital right after that.

734
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
He was transferred to a nursing hospital.

735
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
What the consul needs is the power to read the times.

736
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Whether you're a job seeker or not, you can use what you can.
