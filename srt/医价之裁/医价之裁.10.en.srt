1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The true true of the medical care that his father had been responsible for.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The black curtain is the shadow of Ami, whom his father respected.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But he never showed his tail.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Naruki finally starts the last battle.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's a bribe from the Stifas.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If we take the company's entire company, we can prevent the evidence of his connection with Amino.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And the result of the negotiations, we were able to get a backup of the large-scale fund.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Amino is moving.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It seems that he is collecting the Stifas' stock.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thanks to him, I was able to get a hold of it.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The doctor connection is over.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Will I be swallowed by the darkness or cut off the darkness?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The Stifas' stock is moving.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Is it true that the information that the Stifas' stock is moving is true?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It is said that it already owns more than 15 percent.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Some say that there is a problem with the connection with Amino, but what is the relationship with that?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The cause of Amino's death is to protect the Stifas.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Protect?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That company is currently in a crisis of random sales.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
As you can see, there is also information that the doctor connection is pulling his hand.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That is...

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Stifas are the future of heart disease treatment.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I will not forgive the fact that such a company is being taken over by a man with a purpose to make a profit.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Every media is just a theory that orders Amino side.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a bit like the other.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is a company that is in a bad position.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is a team that is in a bad position.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It seems that there is a need to think about changing jobs.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Amino has already acquired more than 15 percent of shares.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is only 10 percent.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is there a winner?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Tendo is fighting with the fans.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We are pursuing the conspiracy against the Stifas and Amino.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We will measure the transparency of the company.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We are the ones who are trying to protect the future of medical care.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Please understand.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Leave the air battle to her. We will go to the ground battle.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ground battle?

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What are you going to do?

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yonaga-kun.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's the final mission.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Roger.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Peel off Amino's mask.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The final mission.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The final mission.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The final mission.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The final mission.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The final mission.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The final mission.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The final mission.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yonaga-san, you have experience in the cleaning company.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes. I worked at the hospital.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
At the current office, you are in charge of the entire office alone.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to take advantage of that experience and hope for the management part.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What we should do now is to break Amino's trust.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
In order to do that, we need to find the truth of the conflict between Amino and Stifas.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It must be difficult for you to do that.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But I'm a middle-class doctor.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If I'm a normal person, I might be able to do it.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Normal person?

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's a cleaning company specialized in medical care.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Then, please tell us the reason why you are going to kill our company.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Before my mother died, she often said that she was going to be healed by the smell of the freshly washed sheets at the hospital.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
She wanted to work at a company that can give patients healing and hope.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So, the cleaning company that was in charge of your mother's hospitalization was your mother's?

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes. That's right.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I love cleaning.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Really?

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes. I used to do it in the morning.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So, you are a girl who does it in the morning.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are a girl who does it in the morning.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Chief Homasaki?

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I saw a girl picking up garbage in front of the company when I left the office this morning.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What should I do? Was she watching me?

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Here it comes.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a candy.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, it was you.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry for doing something selfish.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My mother said that cleaning is good for your luck.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I really wanted to work here.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry. It's not a good reason.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I got a call from the company.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I heard the president's departure time.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Good job.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where are you now?

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll hang up.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I listed the company that I could be a partner with.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As expected.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have a request.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I want to spread the surgery of the stift to the inner part of the body.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I need a high-tech stone that can perform topal surgery.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes. It would be helpful if you introduce me a good person.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Of course.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is that in the place of Mr. Kuramochi?

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I won't abandon him.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mr. Kuramochi, I see your relatives.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I understand.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You've worked well.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There is a patient waiting for my surgery.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Your operation is a log data.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can punish you at any time.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you talking about?

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Your father was the one who caused the surgery.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mr. Masanori Naruki was the one who interfered with my operation.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm tired of hearing that lie.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's the truth.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Can you tell me in front of your parents?

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Do you live your life with the consciousness of sin and the spirit of Amino?

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I have decided to have a special observation of the doctor connection.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I will confirm the number of illegal suspicions.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
From now on, Kitami and I will be in charge.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If you have any complaints, you can leave.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm fine.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Is there anything you can't do if I'm here?

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What do you mean?

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will participate.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can't forgive the illegal suspicions.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is the list of contracts for the normal clean.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It seems that it was a contract with the head of the department and Aisaki.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So you're switching to another cleaning company now.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
For some reason, the contract was cut seven years ago.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I see.

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What?

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Seven years ago, the company was successful in developing the company.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And at that time, Amino was the one who was in charge of the entire department.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Amino cut the contract?

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But why?

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Amino was convinced that the company would be a money.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
First, he cut the relationship between the normal clean and himself.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Then he gave the normal clean the share of the Stifascia company.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He turned his hand to the world to spread the Stift.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Then...

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The Stifascia company's share rose and the normal clean gained profit.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The normal clean with a 7% share actually gained a lot of profit.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And if Amino took the money from the normal clean in some way,

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
the indirect relationship would be completed.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is the scheme that Amino drew.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Even now, if the normal clean doesn't cut the share of the Stifascia company,

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
when the tax is paid,

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
the money will be left to the Stifascia company.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then, if we dig deeper into this line...

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Who is it?

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's probably the press. Leave it.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But it's the jobless company.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Mr. Naruki.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Wow, what a fancy office.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I haven't made a reservation, but it's okay.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm glad that the president has been able to help me.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sure I can secure half of the shares with this.

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, I think it's good.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think it's good.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I heard that you can make tea here.

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm not good enough. I don't deal with people who don't make money.

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't make money.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Anyone can sell the will, but you will soon be disqualified from the will.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why?

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Water.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yonaga, squeeze the lemon.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I hate lemon water.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I thought I could ask you about Mr. Kendo's transfer.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Her recent behavior has been a problem in the committee.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
She seems to be in a bad mood.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And Yorioka too.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you're so bad, you're throwing it away.

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're a good staff.

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I understand how you feel.

173
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to blame someone to protect your father's honor.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What?

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I found a note that your father wrote in pain, so I can't give up.

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But I didn't do anything wrong.

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So there's no evidence.

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If you stop suspecting me,

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll try to make everything work, including Mr. Kendo and Yorioka.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm not your enemy.

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is the money you gave to silence your father.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
My father didn't help me.

183
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I refused to be swallowed up by you.

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Remember this.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The dissatisfaction with money and power will eventually overflow.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's overflowing.

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Discontinuation?

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I can't help it.

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm glad you're a great person.

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Your father must be happy.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Bye.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's hot.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Was it Shoma at this time?

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Is it okay to be sugar?

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Is it the head of the department?

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
President of the City Farsha, Seichiro Shibaura.

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He still holds 17% of the shares.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is the battle.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Can you do it?

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I just want to make money.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Go home.

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You can heal your heart with technology.

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's the money the president's proposal was made.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But the City Farsha is now doing a business that is far from his thoughts.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If you were at the top, there might not have been a medical security secret.

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
My company is involved in the secret?

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't know.

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But at least you shouldn't have left the conspiracy.

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What do you know about me?

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I know.

212
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then, based on the regulations, we will hold a meeting to decide the position of the former president.

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Get ready immediately.

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Please ask the fair.

215
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I understand.

216
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yorioka.

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Is this the right way to do it?

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What?

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Can you really say that her proposal is wrong?

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yorioka.

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The patients are worried about the cancellation of the treatment reservation by Dr. Kendo's words.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But...

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You have to take responsibility for your words.

224
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This is the law of the universe.

225
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes.

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I understand.

227
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll call you.

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Amino is taking a reporter to explain to Mr. Mae Dousaka's parents.

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I apologize for the confusion caused by various obsessions.

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I did not lie to explain at that time.

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
However...

233
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
However?

234
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Please.

235
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Excuse me.

236
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It is true that the explanation of this Kura mochi was insufficient and caused confusion.

237
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That day, the topology was implemented.

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I apologize?

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Since the confusion has been so far, no one can be honest.

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I think the president's feelings are not organized.

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I need to explain to your family.

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I want to put it in the form of a emergency treatment.

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's okay.

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Believe me.

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The president's words are not the only thing that can be said.

246
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He really writes good articles.

247
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Mr. Kendo, I'm sorry.

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Please stop.

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's an insult to him.

251
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He is a high-ranking reporter.

252
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He was about to step on the stage.

253
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Please come in.

255
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Excuse me.

256
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It seems that the president of the city is on the other side.

257
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I was influenced by Mr. Kendo's feelings.

258
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I also aimed to form an organization that would face the heart of the patient.

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I have been aiming for an organization that does not have any secret.

260
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If you are still in time now,

261
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If you are ready to face the truth.

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I also think that I should face the new.

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
To be honest, it's a disadvantageous situation.

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The president is on the other side.

266
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
There is also a shareholder who is feeling down.

267
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The next move is as long as the lower half is obtained.

268
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes.

269
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Excuse me.

270
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm Kendo.

271
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Thank you.

272
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
A few days later

273
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It is decided to have a joint consultation with the pharmaceutical company.

274
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The head of the hospital of the university of the Far East, Amino, has received support from the head of the company.

275
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The head of the company has acquired the lower half of the company and has stopped the sale of the enemy.

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The head of the company has again shown his displeasure with the forced sale of the company.

277
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Mr. Naruki, this is...

278
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's over.

279
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The head of the company has acquired the lower half of the company and has stopped the sale of the enemy.

280
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Director Amino, thank you for making the Stift bigger.

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
As a medical counselor, you have to contribute to the progress of technology.

282
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Even when I was in that case three years ago.

283
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm sorry to hear that. I didn't do anything.

284
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Excuse me.

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I brought you a champagne to celebrate.

286
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Thank you.

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm Yoshizumi, a special inspection team of the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

288
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I will now perform a special inspection of the numerous illegal drugs of the company.

289
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Today, for the sake of the important business, I will be responsible for Mr. Naruki's absence.

290
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Then let's get started.

291
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Director Amino, please.

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes.

293
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Director Amino

294
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What?

295
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is...

296
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
...an illegal evidence.

297
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Please explain.

298
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We will now begin the subcommittee.

299
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The head of the company, Tendo Maho, has spread the information that the company has lost its reputation and caused a lot of damage.

300
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
In particular, we cannot allow the head of Amino to be punished without a reason.

301
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
We will consider the punishment.

302
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Ms. Tendo, do you have a statement?

303
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I would like to ask for a clarification of the truth.

304
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
We should investigate the involvement of Director Amino in the medical care of three years ago.

305
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The order is different.

306
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It is a problem that he has left the bad reputation without a reason.

307
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,740
There are already some statements and the

308
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
testimony of Mr. Naruki Naki.

309
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It is a problem that should not be overlooked.

310
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There is no evidence.

311
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Isn't that the answer?

312
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Mr. Kuramochi, you were hiding the fact that you and Topalzutzu were involved in the medical care of three years ago.

313
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Please be careful with the irregular statement.

314
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Director, as a medical officer, the confirmation of the truth is important.

315
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You were not hiding the fact under the guidance of Director Amino, were you?

316
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I do not have such a fact.

317
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It is all my judgment.

318
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well then.

319
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Since Mr. Kuramochi does not speak of the truth, I have to prove the past of Director Amino.

320
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Prove?

321
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Director, please allow him to speak.

322
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I do not think it's time to talk about me now.

323
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What are you talking about?

324
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Your past is the cornerstone of the problem.

325
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Then, I will ask you the conclusion.

326
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
In conclusion, Director Amino is a member of a legal company called Seijou Clean.

327
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
He is closely related to Stiffer.

328
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Legal company?

329
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I read the interview article of Director Hamasaki of Seijou Clean.

330
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I found it interesting.

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I found it interesting.

332
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He and Director Amino are in the same lab in the same lab in this extreme area during the time of the training camp.

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It seems that you have been together for a long time.

334
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's an old story.

335
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes. What I wanted to know is the current connection, but you have been standing in the way of the contact with Seijou Clean.

336
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Why is that?

337
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Because I'm afraid of the discovery of Stiffer.

338
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So I decided to implement this operation.

339
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What is the operation?

340
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's the collection of Stiffer.

341
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You have a bad point.

342
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You are afraid that Stiffer will be naked and will definitely be on the shelf.

343
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And if the situation is good, you will definitely contact Seijou Clean, which owns 7% of Stiffer's stock.

344
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's as you read.

345
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
To be honest, it's a disadvantageous situation.

346
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Director Amino contacted President Hamasaki of Seijou Clean and moved immediately.

347
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Hey, Gumo. I want you to make some time.

348
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yorioka, who felt an unnatural movement, seems to have left a mark.

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
As a result, I was able to put the 3rd floor in the photo.

350
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I've been with him for a long time, but what is it?

351
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's just like what you said.

352
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I wanted to give up the stock of that company and negotiated.

353
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Why is that a false evidence?

354
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I know you want to put me in, but I think you're a little bit forced.

355
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I think you're acting.

356
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I think you should be more focused on your company than me.

357
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What's important is not this photo.

358
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
What I wanted to know was the flow of money.

359
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll sell a lot of stocks to Amino.

360
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
What will happen then?

361
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
A huge management work will be carried out at Seijou Clean, which sold stocks.

362
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The company has new employees and they manage all the money.

363
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Among them, there is a friend of ours who just joined the company.

364
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
He was happy that the important secrets were investigated.

365
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
As a result, he caught the flow of money.

366
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Seijou Clean is regularly sending money to KL Assets from May 7 years ago.

368
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
If this is Amino's director's money,

369
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
he will be receiving the credit of the city's stock price rise.

370
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Wait a minute.

371
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You said May 7 years ago, right?

372
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes.

373
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That is, a month before the world announced the shift.

374
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
This is not just a financial fraud, but also evidence of insider trading.

375
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You really like to make decisions.

376
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Hello, Mr. Ishigami?

377
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
What happened to the survey?

378
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I got all the information about the survey.

379
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
KL Assets, which received the money from Seijou Clean,

380
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
represents Amino Kagehito.

381
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This is the so-called asset management company he owns.

382
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
In other words, the relationship between Stiffer and Seijou Clean and Amino,

383
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the three companies, has been established.

384
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
As you can see, this is illegal.

385
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's illegal.

386
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Thank you.

387
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That's what he said.

388
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Why did he do that?

389
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Mr. Naruki sent Mr. Ishigami to you.

390
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You rode this stock trading ship with Manma,

391
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and moved a lot of stocks and money.

392
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Mr. Naruki, is this...

393
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's over.

394
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's over.

395
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Thanks to you, I was able to get enough information to end you.

396
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
By the way, Mr. Yonaga,

397
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I heard that the audit team from the Kosei Labor Association came to our company.

398
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That's right.

399
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I found a copy of this document.

400
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Is this...

401
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
an illegal evidence?

402
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Please explain.

403
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Then I will explain.

404
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I cut off our audit and headed to Seijou Clean.

405
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
What did you go to do?

406
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It seems that I will be doing a survey on time.

407
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Oh, it's from Mr. Kitami, the director of labor standards.

408
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yes.

409
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I see.

410
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Mr. Hamasaki just told me that the chairman of Amino

411
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:56,780
had a skimmed out of his

412
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
There are too many words from the company.

413
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This survey committee is not working well.

414
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The main point is from here, Mr. Amino.

415
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The skimmed out of this is the case of the medical care three years ago.

416
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's a motive that you ordered the secret service.

417
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
That's exactly what Mr. Kuramochi just said.

418
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Are you feeling unwell?

419
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I will correct my words.

420
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That day, I was told by the director of Amino

421
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
that I had failed the operation at Stift.

422
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The director of Amino told Mr. Masanari Naruki that he would cover up all his crimes.

423
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Hey, hey.

424
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's the truth.

425
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It seems that you don't understand the situation.

426
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You threatened Kuramochi with that power.

427
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You followed him with that power.

428
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But now that the problem is clear,

429
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
the power to shut his mouth is no longer there.

430
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
There is a voice data that shows the truth of that day.

431
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Voice data?

432
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The one that you ordered Mr. Masanari Naruki to cover up all his crimes.

433
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Right after the operation.

434
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
At that time, I was recording.

435
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
If you play this, you will be able to see the truth.

436
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
What's wrong?

437
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
If you play this, you will be able to see the truth.

438
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's a theft.

439
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's a crime.

440
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Everyone, you don't need to ask such a thing.

441
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You just admitted that you had a secret conversation right after the operation.

442
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I just recorded it.

443
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You will turn away from the consciousness of sin for a lifetime and live according to Amino's spirit.

444
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You will turn away from the consciousness of sin for a lifetime and live according to Amino's spirit.

445
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The chance of turning away will definitely come.

446
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's take advantage of my strategy.

447
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Strategy?

448
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
This is what you have seen.

449
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It's a fragile thing.

450
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Those who are scared of being stripped of their rights will be easily thrown out.

451
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Let's present this recorder as evidence.

452
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I will withdraw.

453
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I made a mistake in choosing the words.

454
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
The record is deleted.

455
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Delete?

456
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There is no way to do that.

457
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I want you to take responsibility for your words and chopsticks.

458
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It's the law of the universe.

459
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I will teach you what will happen from now on.

460
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You will be arrested and completely washed out of that illegal act.

461
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Since you lost your right, those who were afraid of you will raise their voices one after another.

462
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'll take you to the law of the universe.

463
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I wanted you to tell me the truth.

465
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And I wanted you to apologize.

466
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Apologize?

467
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Ms. Masanari Naruki.

468
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And Mr. Mai Dousaka.

469
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And his family.

470
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I want you to apologize to everyone who believed in you, manipulated you, and betrayed you.

471
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You really don't know anything.

472
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm sick of it.

473
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm always thinking about the future of medicine.

475
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
There is money in the progress of medicine and saving people.

476
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What's important is to pass on technology to the future.

477
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
One patient was sacrificed.

478
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The technology is being used to kill people.

479
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Because of that, the technology is being used to kill people.

480
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That's not going to be allowed.

481
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So you don't care about the privacy?

482
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
That's what's important.

483
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The progress of medicine is the history of sacrifice.

484
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
All medical history has been built on sacrifice.

485
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The technology called STIFT will save many people.

486
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It was supposed to prove that I was not wrong.

487
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's going to be a waste of your stupid sense of justice.

488
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Certainly.

489
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What you say is true.

490
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Medical history is a fragile thing that stands on top of sacrifice.

491
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
That's right.

492
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It's a job of a doctor to connect the sacrifice to the future.

493
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That's why we shouldn't be in hiding.

494
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
If we can't save all the patients, we should face the facts and explain them to the public.

495
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
That way, we can gain trust.

496
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's a responsibility as a person who saves lives.

497
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You are not looking at the pain and suffering of the patient with the intention of seeing the future.

498
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
One person's sacrifice.

499
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What kind of future did that one person draw?

500
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You are not going to tell me.

501
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Have you ever imagined what kind of future you were drawing?

502
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
She was hoping to save many people.

503
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I heard that this is a place where people connect heart patients and Japanese medical care.

504
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I thought I could do something.

505
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That's good.

506
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's why I'm going to be fine.

507
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yes.

508
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
That feeling is not something that can be cleared with one sacrifice.

509
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's not a thing.

510
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
How much suffering did the doctor who was responsible for the medical care suffer?

511
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
How much regret was there when the doctor who was trusted was betrayed?

512
00:36:48,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't accept people who don't understand the pain and suffering of others.

513
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You don't have the right to decorate the future of medical care.

514
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I don't want to see you.

515
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Excuse me.

516
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
This is from the financial department.

517
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Mr. Kagehito of Amino.

518
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yes.

519
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
This is the chief of police.

520
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I would like to ask you about some of the problems such as financial products and trade violations.

521
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Would you like to join us?

522
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Mr. Naruki, it's finally over.

523
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It was just that we were exposed to the injustice.

524
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Is your information about the injustice true?

525
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Please answer.

526
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Do you have any words of apology for the doctor who was responsible for the medical care three years ago?

527
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Please say a word.

528
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Chief Amino.

529
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Chief.

530
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Mr. Kuramoshi.

531
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Mr. Kuramoshi.

532
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Mr. Kuramoshi, how much did you know about this case?

533
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Please say a word about the chief.

534
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Please tell me if you know anything.

535
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The chief of the Kyokutou University Hospital, Kagehito Amino, was arrested for financial products and trade violations.

536
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
The police are looking for other grounds and are proceeding with the situation of the relevant person.

537
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
On the other hand, the next chief was re-elected by the former head of the Tendo Magic.

538
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I just came to the interview.

539
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:24,000
We will carefully verify that the Stift product of Steve Asha is not used for once and that it has no problem with its safety and that it does not cause anxiety to the patient.

540
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
We will do our best to recover the trust that has been lost.

541
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Mr. Naruki Masanari worked hard to recover.

542
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I saw the article of Mr. Kuramoshi's confession.

543
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
We did terrible things to him and you.

544
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
No.

545
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
My father wanted to help Mr. Mai seriously.

546
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So I think he apologized from the bottom of his heart at that meeting.

547
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Thanks to your father, I am really grateful to you for connecting my life.

548
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Then I still have something to do.

549
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
The next day, the next day.

550
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I will do research, clinical research, conference, and guidance to remember the faces of patients.

551
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That is the job of a doctor.

552
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You are a telegrapher, so you can't look at the patient's eyes and talk.

553
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
That's not true.

554
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But you have to face your heart.

555
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm not sure if there is any problem with Dr. Connection, but it's not a cancer.

556
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You can be listed.

557
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't need to be listed or be noticed, so I don't need to be inspected or inspected.

558
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Please be peaceful.

559
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I misunderstood you.

560
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I was wrong.

561
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You are already involved in the tea party.

562
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Are you listening?

563
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

564
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You are a great person.

565
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You are a great person.

566
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But you really helped me.

567
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Cheers.

568
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
One tea party.

569
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Cheers.

570
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Cheers.

571
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Everyone changes their time into money.

572
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
What is important is to see which way to go.

573
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I thought about it, but I don't think it's going to come back.

574
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Come back?

575
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I?

576
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You've achieved your goal.

577
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You have a mysterious skill that children like.

578
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You can save a lot of patients.

579
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I don't think my current job is bad.

580
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Sending the body to the right place leads to the activation of the hospital and the release of the sea.

581
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It's a job worth doing to treat this country's hospital.

582
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Is that so?

583
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Dad, I'll try to be a professional baseball player.

584
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
What?

585
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm kidding.

586
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'll support you in any future.

587
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Is it difficult to be a baseball player?

588
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'll do my best.

589
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm glad you're back.

590
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You're always saying one word.

591
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
What about the special reward for this time?

592
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I made a lot of money.

593
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I was also very hard.

594
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I didn't get a penny from this time.

595
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
What?

596
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I got zero savings.

597
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Zero? Why?

598
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm glad I'm back to work.

599
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
This job will be money.

600
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
The product came right away.

601
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yonaga, it's work.

602
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'll do my best.

603
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yes.

604
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
She'll tell Roychikawa woman...

605
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Please come in.

606
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Tell me all about your thoughts.

607
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I work side by side.

608
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
What is it that I history?

609
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,700
Are all female parents the same level?

610
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,720
He must be the most bitter compare to them all.

611
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,560
Mr. Naruki, don't say that.

612
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,760
This is serious.

613
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,840
We can't

614
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,160
Let's just put everything aside for now.

615
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,460
But...
