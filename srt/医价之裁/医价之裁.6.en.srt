1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's a transfer obstacle.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The transfer agent for the medical profession,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Kanenari Naluki,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is the one who gives the doctors a price,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
sells them to the hospital,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and gets a loan.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
At the same time,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
three years ago,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
his father was accused of being responsible for the medical care.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He found out that the responsibility

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
was on another doctor.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I will make all your sins come to light.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I could only obey.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That will, Kuramochi,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
confessed that everything was under the command of the above.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Whose command?

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Rie!

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He was trying to face the truth.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please change the agenda of the meeting.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Who is the person who put the responsibility on my father

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and left the truth behind in the dark?

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The further darkness was waiting.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The transfer agent for the medical profession,

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Kanenari Naluki,

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
was not the one who gave the doctors a price,

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but Kuramochi.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He was the one who gave the doctors a price,

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and ordered the transfer of the money.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Kuramochi,

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is that the truth?

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Please answer.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He was the one who put the responsibility on my father

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and ordered the transfer of the money.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He was not the one who gave the doctors a price.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But,

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the information is clear.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Can you tell me the name of the person?

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I understand your point,

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but I will take the responsibility.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Take the responsibility?

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can see that Kuramochi is in a state of panic.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't think that a normal judgment can be made here.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will ask him again.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's all for today's meeting.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The confirmation of the truth should be done from a objective point of view.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Of course,

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will also consider the establishment of a third party committee according to the needs.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Can I trust you?

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will go to Kuramochi's office later.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Please come in.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Excuse me.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please come in.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry for the trouble.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Welcome.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Uncle.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You invited me from the guard.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hi, Michinori.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Brother.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You look well.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I really want you to meet my father.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't mind.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Can you give me advice?

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Advice?

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
To be honest,

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I want to borrow your power.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
My power?

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can you introduce me to a restaurant?

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to go back to the spirit world.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's drink.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Uncle, let's drink in the building.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry, but I still have work to do.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Uncle.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I can't help you.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Wait.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I know.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I borrowed your power.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm fine.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll do something.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What?

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I didn't expect you to cry.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I didn't cry.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I just came to introduce you to a restaurant.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's cooperate.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you cooperate, you will be suspected of being a fraud.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's a different story.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Why did you refuse your uncle's advice?

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My father and my uncle have never been in a good relationship.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I thought it was difficult to change jobs because of my career.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Your career is really short.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
My father has experienced hell many times.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hell?

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,680
He was killed by a

96
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
man named Meigi.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Meigi?

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He was deceived by a bad agent.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He was transferred to another hospital and was qualified as a specialist.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I thought he was on the road again as a psychiatrist.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This time, he was caught by a man named Li Fu Jin.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He lost his job.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Li Fu Jin?

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He had a career as a beauty dermatologist.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The other day, the committee lost his job.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Lost?

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I think my father is cursed.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't think I'm cursed.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not asking you to pay me.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I want you to introduce me to a reliable hospital.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm a little bit old, but I don't mind.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
First of all, you lost your qualification from the country.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I was a victim of a large-scale trial of death.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Large-scale death?

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It was about 10 years ago.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
At the hospital in Kibounosato,

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
we were assigned to several doctors.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Why didn't we do anything?

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,180
We were in a mess after being accused of being a

121
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,000
100-person trial in the country.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It was reported that it was a copy-paste spirit society at the time.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Copy-paste?

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The state is a qualification to have a stronger authority in the spirit world.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's a qualification that can determine the hospitalization of patients.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We submit reports of cases of murder and take the trial.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We were judged to have copied the reports of patients who had not been killed.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We were then removed from the qualification.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is that what a copy-paste is?

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But that's a mistake.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The spirit world is involved in treating patients as a team.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Each of the patients involved in the treatment is only submitted as a case report.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If that is denied, team treatment will not be possible.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The Ministry of Health did not understand the reality of the scene and

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
gave the punishment on the one hand.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We were judged to be wrong and even announced our mission.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
In fact, we were no longer able to work as a spirit world.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We are nothing but a mere name.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So that's what happened.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I should have listened to my father and known the situation sooner.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't want to involve you and your mother.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But if you talk to me properly, I'll divorce you.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Anyway, I was fired again.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was then in the beauty department and was employed in the field of technical needs.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But I was also fired.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think you should go pay the fine.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm thinking of going to the spirit world again.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think I can get it back in five years.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You know how much my father is passionate.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll do something.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a hurdle to get a second qualification at your age.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's more valuable to have a qualification for the death penalty.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's not a matter of money.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I want to face the patient again as a death penalty.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mr. Naruki?

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then one condition.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hitomi, please remove your seat.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I want to talk to him.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm here as a watchman.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What will you do if you and your father are alone?

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There is no hospital that can be introduced without a trust relationship.

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If it's impossible, it's up to that.

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mamori, it's okay.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll wait here.

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't think you have to worry.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I won't leave my father who is in a bad way.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So what are you talking about?

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I thought I said what I wanted to say.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I see.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I thought there were some difficult things to say in front of my daughter.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then I'll hear you in detail about your special skills.

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I was also impressed.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Impressed?

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You were talking about a lie that you could see.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What do you mean I'm a lie?

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You should try to hit your own chest.

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I see.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You don't have the confidence to sell me.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So you're trying to catch up with me.

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're trying to catch up with me.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're not good at psychological analysis.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's a hot day.

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You don't have to talk to me.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm not talking to you for no reason.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Mamori, I'm going home.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What's wrong?

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Can you leave it to that guy?

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Wait a minute.

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Why?

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I was told that guy.

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why?

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Isn't it a chance to sell Mr. Hitomi?

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's not that easy.

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Certainly, I haven't found a good career.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The current market value is low.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I felt a little sad.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
As expected, you have a good intuition.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I feel sorry for him.

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
His real problem is that he has too much pride.

200
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why?

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That small dragon is a big wall.

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's fatal.

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But it's not good for you.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's enough.

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't have time to care about him.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm grateful to you for moving to the truth.

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Your testimony is true.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm not sure.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The fact that you used topal to do the surgery was confirmed by the log data you collected.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
However, the cause of the current condition of Mr. Dousaka is not known.

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Why can't I accept it?

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Mr. Kuramochi tried to do topal surgery to the end.

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Mr. Masanari Nari was forced to change the surgery.

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I will move to the blood test.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
After that, there was a confusion in the blood system.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
At one point, the brain was affected by the operation.

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is the testimony of Mr. Kuramochi.

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It is not consistent with the log data you collected.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Is it my responsibility?

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Of course.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I will continue to investigate.

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Next, Mr. Kuramochi is the one who gave instructions to continue the operation.

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But it seems that all of this is not Mr. Kuramochi's decision.

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I tried to make it someone else's fault by accepting the same operation from you.

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But in fact, I did it without anyone's instructions.

226
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That is the final testimony of Mr. Kuramochi.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Did you succeed in stopping it?

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I just asked.

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Of course, I will continue to investigate.

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's all for the report.

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank you for your time.

232
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Finally, I would like to warn you that you are not allowed to make any more decisions.

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The decisions you make without a basis are against the order of the party.

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then I will make one last point.

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I am no longer your subordinate.

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You should not think of following the order.

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's bad.

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Kuramochi is going abroad.

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Abroad?

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He will be in Germany until the fire is put out.

241
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He will be a researcher.

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is he on the run?

243
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The official punishment has not been decided yet.

244
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Besides, it's a case that can't be put forward.

245
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I will let him go abroad until the truth is confirmed.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If he stands on the other side, it will be a big trouble.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What will happen if I run away?

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This time, instead of my father, you may be responsible for everything.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Is that okay?

250
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If you are going to fight, you don't need to defend anymore.

251
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Are you so scared of Tendo?

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's not true.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Then tell me everything.

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't go against it.

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Prepare an evacuation point like this.

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The neck is connected with one piece.

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But if you cut that connection, it's over as a will.

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What you can do is to make everything clear.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Kuramochi.

260
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm not stupid.

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I left the records of that operation for the sake of something.

262
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Video and audio.

263
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But I was overlooked.

264
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I was rejected.

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm not a fighter.

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I have no choice but to obey.

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes.

268
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I want you to move the Earth.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
All in secret.

270
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I was robbed of evidence and had no proof.

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's tough.

272
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But Kuromochi's existence became clear.

273
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
All I have to do is make him admit it.

274
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What can you do after you've lost your offense?

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Search for Stifascia.

276
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Stifascia is the one from Topal Jutsu?

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That day, I ordered the training of Topal Jutsu.

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I was confused by the fact that it was a failure.

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why did you have to risk it so much?

280
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
At least not to protect Kuramochi.

281
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
To protect Topal Jutsu?

282
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Maybe there was a special connection.

283
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
For example, money.

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The understanding of the entrapment.

285
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
By spreading that Jutsu system, you're getting personal profit.

286
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yes.

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't know how Kuramochi got to the extreme.

288
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Maybe that's where the Tendo Director's conspiracy is hidden.

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Can I ask you to do that?

290
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay.

291
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I want to get out of the extreme sea, too.

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll try to move.

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Sorry.

294
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Please.

295
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Thank you.

296
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Mr. Naruki.

297
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Sorry, but I'm not free either.

298
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
How about relying on the agent you're working with?

299
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I've been reflecting on myself since then.

300
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I wanted to be a little more humble.

301
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Humble?

302
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Even though I was deceived, it's true that I was down.

303
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I tried to contact other agents, but they didn't respond well.

304
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm going to change my mind and obey your advice.

305
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'd like to ask you one thing.

306
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why do you want to return to the spirit world?

307
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If it's just a job, the beauty world will be more profitable.

308
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I can't explain it well, but I...

309
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I want to be proud of my daughter.

310
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm as serious as a fool like my father.

311
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Mamori respects me.

312
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't want to betray that expectation.

313
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
For your daughter?

314
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes.

315
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I want to face my original career seriously again.

316
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I understand.

317
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Then I'll introduce this hospital.

318
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Toyama Kureha Hospital.

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's a mental hospital with a high reputation for psychiatry,

320
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
with a small population and a large number of famous psychiatrists.

321
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can introduce you as the first patient here.

322
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
First patient?

323
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
In other words, a trainee.

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
A trainee?

325
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If you do a training with a young doctor,

326
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
you can get a certificate and a certificate of appointment.

327
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Are you kidding me?

328
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Can you work with a young doctor at this age?

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You can earn more if you work part-time.

330
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's right. You have two options.

331
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Do you want to start over from a trainee or work alone?

332
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Stop making fun of me.

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I forgot to say something important, but that pride is only an obstacle to the job.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What you need now is to face your own value.

335
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What are you going to do?

336
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I've made up my mind.

337
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I won't rely on agents.

338
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'll find a job with my own power.

339
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's enough.

340
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
There's something else.

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't want Mr. Kitami to know about this.

342
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Leave it alone.

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Leave it alone?

344
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll leave it alone.

345
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I have something to ask you.

346
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Is it a mission?

347
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's a personal request.

348
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Topal surgery is a short-term procedure in almost all cases.

349
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Do you have any questions?

350
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Then, the lady over there.

351
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm Dr. Justice Yamada.

352
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Currently, the topal surgery is being performed at the Kyokutou University Hospital.

353
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Is there anything like a gold wire?

354
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What do you mean by gold wire?

355
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Adhesive, wire, kickback.

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If you're a loser, get out.

357
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's a rejection of answers.

358
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Then, I'll write it as I like.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm the director of that press.

360
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Dr. Justice.

361
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No, no.

362
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Why?

363
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't know.

364
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Excuse me.

365
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I have other questions.

366
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Then, the lady over there.

367
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm Dr. Ogawara, a medical student.

368
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You're the reporter from earlier.

369
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm talking about the relationship between the Kyokutou University and the previous one.

370
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Please don't touch me.

371
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Wait, wait.

372
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't touch me.

373
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wait, wait.

374
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No, no.

375
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Is it okay?

376
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I hope it doesn't cause any trouble.

377
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You're always so stubborn.

378
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Stubborn? What do you mean?

379
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Dr. Ogawara.

380
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No, no.

381
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Is it a secret?

382
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
No.

383
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Then, there must be something wrong.

384
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Then, I'll put it in the article as a cover.

385
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Wait, wait.

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Don't say that.

387
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Like the new drug of MR,

388
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
new technology is being integrated and taken over.

389
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Mr. Hirono did it.

390
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's not like he's been falsely accused.

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
No, no.

392
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Who did he tell the truth to?

393
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The director.

394
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's you again.

395
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Excuse me.

396
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I was asking about the connection with Kyokutou.

397
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hi, Hikitori.

398
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But it's tough.

399
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Dr. Kuramochi quit.

400
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He quit?

401
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Huh? You didn't know?

402
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Kyokutou may be trying to cut ties with the company.

403
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Excuse me.

404
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hello, it's Hirono.

405
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Sorry for the sudden visit.

406
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's about Dr. Kuramochi.

407
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes, I understand.

408
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yes.

409
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Then, tomorrow night at 8 o'clock.

410
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yes.

411
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He's here.

412
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
A three-day promise?

413
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Who is he?

414
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't know, but tomorrow night at 8 o'clock.

415
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
This may be a decisive moment.

416
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What are you looking at?

417
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm looking into the capital relationship of the Stiffa Company.

418
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Is it the flow of money?

419
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Can you put in Assam tea?

420
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes.

421
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Hey, hey, hey.

422
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Here he comes.

423
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Mr. Hitomi.

424
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Don't you know that you're going to take the APO?

425
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What do you mean?

426
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I told my father to start over from the prefectural committee.

427
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, what if you calm down?

428
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Can I have a cup of chamomile tea with a relaxing effect?

429
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No.

430
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You don't want it?

431
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I understand.

432
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't want it.

433
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Answer me.

434
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What do you mean?

435
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I can't help him with his current job.

436
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If I introduce him poorly, it won't be a problem for my credit.

437
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What do you mean?

438
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Why don't you ask him directly?

439
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Fine.

440
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I was stupid to expect you to do it.

441
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Next time you come to this office, I will completely stop your corruption.

442
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm sorry for today.

443
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I can't help you with anything.

444
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't you think he has a fire?

445
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Do you think he's just a victim of a trick?

446
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I know my father well.

447
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
He's honest.

448
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
He's not a fool.

449
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
He doesn't cheat on people.

450
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I believe in my father.

451
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's over.

452
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The APO will kill me.

453
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You believe in your father?

454
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You believe in your father?

455
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I can't believe what the company says.

456
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Can you just interview me?

457
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Hello?

458
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Hello?

459
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Sorry to call.

460
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Is this Satoshi Ishigami?

461
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yes.

462
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I've heard a lot about you.

463
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You can't help me.

464
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm sorry, but I've decided.

465
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm counting on other companies, but I'm not counting on you.

466
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You're counting on me?

467
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I can't help it.

468
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I can't change my mind.

469
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Then I heard from him.

470
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What?

471
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
About your brother?

472
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
He's not going to be careful.

473
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I heard everything.

474
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I couldn't tell you.

475
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He's a doctor who causes impunity.

476
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What do you mean?

477
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What?

478
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What kind of impunity did you do?

479
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I heard from Naruki.

480
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Let go of me.

481
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Hurry up.

482
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Director Tendo.

483
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm sorry about Dr. Kuramochi.

484
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm sorry about him, too.

485
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm sorry about him, too.

486
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'll take care of the staff.

487
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The boss?

488
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I got a direct call from the hospital.

489
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I knew it wouldn't work if the agent didn't help.

490
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I thought I'd report it to you.

491
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Congratulations.

492
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You'd better stop.

493
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I've heard bad rumors about the Kosei Hospital.

494
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The aim is to borrow your reputation.

495
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What?

496
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You know your past.

497
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You're a moralist doctor who makes a name for himself.

498
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I've heard a lot about you.

499
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You still don't know what you've done?

500
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Your information has been spread to hospitals.

501
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It must have had a big impact on the removal of the dead.

502
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's not fair.

503
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The doctors who were removed from the hospital were then tried to prove that they had a good relationship with the court.

504
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
There is a strong evidence that the treatment was cancelled.

505
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Really?

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Then why didn't you call the court?

507
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Isn't it because you submitted an unfair report?

508
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's not that simple.

509
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's not that difficult to fight against a doctor.

510
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Most of the people who were removed from the hospital were people.

511
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But the people from the hospital must have been in a team.

512
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
What?

513
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
When I saw your profile, I was immediately attracted to the hospital.

514
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The doctors who were removed from the hospital were very careful.

515
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You couldn't be a part of the investigation.

516
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Because you were the only one who had a false qualification.

517
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Don't worry.

518
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
We've been working hard for the patients.

519
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's okay if you're in the process of negotiation.

520
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Can you stop it?

521
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What?

522
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You didn't do anything.

523
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You just reported the case we handled.

524
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We can't protect you.

525
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We were misunderstood because of someone like you.

526
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That negotiation may have been a problem for the public.

527
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But you're a black man.

528
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I knew it from the beginning.

529
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
After that, you decided to make a living.

530
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You chose a good cause to make a living.

531
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You were fired because you didn't want to lose your career.

532
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's not because you're cursed.

533
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's because you're a liar.

534
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I knew it.

535
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Mamori, I...

536
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I heard everything from the old man.

537
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You knew the truth about it.

538
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That's why you were disappointed and kept a distance from me.

539
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You underestimated our intelligence.

540
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It was the right thing to choose a good cause.

541
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I was an impotent liar.

542
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I respected my father.

543
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I believed that he was a sincere doctor.

544
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Why?

545
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I think it was true that you were deceived and made a false claim.

546
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But you stepped out of the way.

547
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You were in a hurry to return to the rail.

548
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You were in a state of injustice.

549
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's a common pattern of corruption.

550
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's a common pattern of corruption.

551
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's right.

552
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I wanted to be a good doctor.

553
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I didn't want to be in front of my family.

554
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You were saying this.

555
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Pride is in the way.

556
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's right.

557
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You lied to your family.

558
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You don't want that.

559
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
If it was me, if it was my parents,

560
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I wouldn't want to do anything.

561
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You should be honest with me.

562
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You shouldn't be alone.

563
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You shouldn't be alone.

564
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Let's start over from the first place.

565
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's start over from the first place.

566
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Even if you introduce me as a guard,

567
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't think I can get in.

568
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Why for me?

569
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I thought it was a waste of time to deal with you.

570
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
There was only one truth in your lies.

571
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
There was only one truth in your lies.

572
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
That's your love for your daughter.

573
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I want to be a good doctor for my daughter.

574
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I want to be a good doctor for my daughter.

575
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You're not stupid.

576
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Why did she lie to you?

577
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Because the love you poured on her

578
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
was real.

579
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
If you really love your daughter,

580
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
you have no choice but to change.

581
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's impossible.

582
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I can't change

583
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
no matter how much I practice.

584
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
No.

585
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I can do it.

586
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm sorry for raising my hand.

587
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
No, it's my fault.

588
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
This is my true self.

589
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But

590
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I want to face the patient again.

591
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I want to face the patient again.

592
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'll start over from zero at Toyama Hospital.

593
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Bye.

594
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Papa!

595
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
When I become a doctor

596
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
at a new hospital,

597
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
let's have dinner together.

598
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'll be a good doctor.

599
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'll be a good doctor.

600
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'll be back.

601
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You helped him with the sales.

602
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Toyama Hospital gave him 5 million yen.

603
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
5 million?

604
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
The head of the department was worried.

605
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
He said that the professor was different.

606
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
He said he would move to another hospital.

607
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
He said he would be a person who would never wish for

608
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
a doctor who had experience.

609
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm disappointed.

610
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm disappointed.

611
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm disappointed.

612
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Do you have a special reward for me?

613
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You didn't do anything special for the transfer.

614
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But you accepted my personal request.

615
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That was risky.

616
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'll take it.

617
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I found out.

618
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I found out that Kuramochi was using the water surface.

619
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I found out.

620
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I found out.

621
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
What happened?

622
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It's time.

623
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'll get a kick.

624
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'll get a kick.

625
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'll get a kick.

626
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'll get a kick.

627
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'll get a kick.

628
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'll get a kick.

629
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'll get a kick.

630
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'll get a kick.

631
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I was surprised by Kuramochi.

632
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I was relieved that he didn't change.

633
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I look forward to working with you.

634
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That's what it was.

635
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You are?

636
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You are the one who ordered the operation of the topology

637
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and then removed the hidden disease.

638
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You are the one who ordered the operation of the topology and then removed the hidden disease.

639
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What's wrong, Naru?

640
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You have committed all sins to your father.

641
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Are you serious?

642
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'll have this today.

643
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
No.

644
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'll have dinner next time.

645
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Excuse me.

646
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I believed in my father too much.

647
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So I believed in you, who my father respected.

648
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So I believed in you, who my father respected.

649
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Father, I will be in the topology from tomorrow.

650
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
If you have any problems, you can rely on Professor Amino.

651
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I have a strong will to trust and respect you.

652
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's been strange.

653
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Why did my father, who was a strong judge,

654
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
go to the secret police that day?

655
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It was a request from a respected superior.

656
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
What are you talking about?

657
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I said I was in your favor.

658
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You said that you couldn't hide the fact that Kuramochi was a thief.

659
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You said that you couldn't hide the fact that Kuramochi was a thief.

660
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
What should I do?

661
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You need to find out what happened to your medical record.

662
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You need to find out what happened to your medical record.

663
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
You confirmed Kuramochi's hiding the evidence

664
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and took the evidence that connected you.

665
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But you were exposed.

666
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You were taken away.

667
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The director asked Kuramochi to come back

668
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and he stopped him.

669
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Then he was sent to Germany.

670
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
There is no reason to defend Kuramochi.

671
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
There is no reason to defend Kuramochi.

672
00:39:45,000 --> 00:40:05,080
You are the one who invited Kuramochi to the

673
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,160
I found out that you were involved in the cleaning company

674
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,160
that owns 7% of the staff of the Stifas company.

675
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,160
I found out that you were involved in the cleaning company

676
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,160
that owns 7% of the staff of the Stifas company.

677
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
I knew it.

678
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,160
You were also taken away from the Stifas company.

679
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,160
You were also taken away from the Stifas company.

680
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Everyone knew about Kuramochi and Director Tendo

681
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,240
but no one knew about your relationship with Kuramochi.

682
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:49,240
That's the evidence that you were involved in the cleaning company.

683
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:57,240
You sacrificed your father for your own good.

684
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,320
I will reveal all your sins to the world.

685
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,320
I will reveal all your sins to the world.

686
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,320
I will make you apologize.

687
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,320
I don't think I should say anything.

688
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,320
I don't think I should say anything.

689
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,400
Let's talk about it later.

690
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,400
You are strange today.

691
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,400
See you again.

692
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Take all the baths and 10 bottles of soap and lotion.

693
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Yes.

694
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,480
I should remove the blood and blood blood.

695
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,480
No.

696
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
I won't remove it.

697
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,480
I want a success rate of topology.

698
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,480
I will recover with artificial blood vessels and continue.

699
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
Prepare artificial blood vessels.

700
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Yes.

701
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
The damage is not big.

702
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,480
It is best to transfer to artificial blood vessels and blood vessels treatment at Stifas.

703
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,480
I will do it.

704
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,480
I have confirmed the investigation report.

705
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Please investigate the cleaning company with the walls of Stifas.

706
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
I'm sorry.

707
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,480
I had no choice but to do so.

708
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,480
I have to protect the future of Swift and Topar Jutsu.

709
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
I know.

710
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Please.

711
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,560
What is going on?

712
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Calm down.

713
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,560
Please calm down.

714
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,640
Please.

715
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
I'm sorry.

716
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
Please rest assured.

717
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,640
I will do something.

718
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,640
Thank you.

719
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
Excuse me.

720
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Please transfer to the white one.

721
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,720
Please.

722
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Please.

723
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,720
I will reveal all your sins to the white one.

724
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,720
And I will make you apologize.

725
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,720
I will make you apologize.

726
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,720
I will make you apologize.

727
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,720
Amino?

728
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,720
Yes.

729
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:43,720
I didn't expect that Professor Amino would be elected to the board of directors.

730
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Thank you.

731
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Please do your best.

732
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,720
Thank you.

733
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,720
Good morning.

734
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:13,720
If Professor Amino becomes the director, everything will be covered in darkness.

735
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,720
I will reveal everything.

736
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,720
I'm happy when I don't know.

737
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,720
I thought this day would come.

738
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,720
I'm sure.

739
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,720
If I don't stop here, I won't get anything back.

740
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,720
It's so hard to be betrayed.
