1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The customer is the hospital, you are the product.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,680
I am the

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,000
medical professional agent,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Kanenari Naluki.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I want to hope for 20 million yen a year.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
20 million?

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
He is responsible for

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
making a fortune for the doctors,

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
selling them to the hospital, and getting a loan.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So instead of increasing the number of doctors,

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I should just hire one person instead.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is all your fault.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's a medical accident caused by a series of anesthesia.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Even this is still expensive, 10 million yen.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He is trying to help the poor,

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and he is hoping for a job.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Kanenari, believe in your father.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He is the one who is going after the truth of the medical care

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that his father was responsible for three years ago.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
At that time,

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
there was a man who put his father to death.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who was that?

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I didn't plan to apologize to that person.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to find him.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I made my father die.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The culprit.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
All the keys are in the hospital in the Far East.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The culprit who made him die?

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Your father, Mr. Masanori Nalki,

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
was very responsible for the results of the surgery.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's why he apologized at the meeting.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
After that, he took his own life.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Mr. Kuramochi.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's go to the room.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We can talk there.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Professor Amino.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are currently working at the Aisaki Medical Hospital in Keirei.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I might introduce you to some young and excellent doctors soon.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Is that okay?

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Of course.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm very welcome.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Follow me.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm leaving.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Happy 70th anniversary.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The vital is one stent.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The dosage is less than 50.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I understand.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Doctor.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Where is my wife?

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She was successfully removed from the hospital.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There is no problem with the doctor, but let's continue to see the results.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The patient is in the hospital.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Dr. Anzai, I'm on leave.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Please go to the room.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm on my way.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is the assam tea from a 1,200 yen hotel.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The elegant fragrance that makes you want to take a breath.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is...

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Good tea.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let me focus on the taste.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Please focus on your work.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I wanted to take care of the first bite.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Please enjoy.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So, did you hear about the story the other day?

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
NARUKI, I want you to transfer me to a nursing hospital.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nursing hospital?

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
YONOGA, please explain the nursing hospital from the beginning.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
From the beginning?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He is my friend from KUSAYAKYU.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He is reliable, but he can't see the future.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He doesn't understand this.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It may be a trick.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The general purpose is to make the nursing hospital a better place.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
General purpose is to provide emergency medical care to patients who are injured or sick.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It is a hospital that is generally imagined.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The nursing hospital provides emergency medical care to patients who are injured or sick.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It is a place where patients with chronic diseases are stable and need long-term care.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In terms of working methods, the nursing hospital is stable and the work-life balance of the doctor is easy to maintain.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
However, if young doctors can't feel the change, they will avoid it.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It is difficult to achieve the sense of achievement of saving patients without an operation.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Do you understand so far?

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Of course. I hope for a nursing hospital on top of that.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
May I ask why?

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I've been looking at my life again.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The other day was the first wedding anniversary with my wife.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry I fell asleep before you.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't worry about the wedding anniversary.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm more worried about your health.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Take care of yourself.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
At this rate, I don't think I can make my wife happy.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So I consulted with the manager.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'd be happy if I could stay with you more.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll give you a tour.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
See you.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll see you.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So don't hesitate.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're very thoughtful.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't like it.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Isn't it nice?

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're hiding something.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Really?

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm done.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You said nursing hospitals are easy to earn.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What?

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Nursing hospitals have a high level of pay.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Because the medical treatment is paid.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's what I meant.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I thought it was a good story.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, let's try to move for you.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Thank you.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
By the way, why is this place not my office?

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's delicious.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Actually, I have plans to meet with another company.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll be here in a little while.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm coming.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I was surprised.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're like a thief.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not a thief.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm a street thief.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm Michinori Ishigami, the representative of the Mediate Management.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Nelukki, you're the worst agent.

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're a good guy.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You didn't tell him what to say.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What to say?

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're going to destroy his future for money.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Destroy?

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Please.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Listen.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're not a good agent.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're not a good agent.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I have my own agent.

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You don't have to rely on Nelukki.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You don't have to make a decision.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're not a good agent.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're not a good agent.

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're not a good agent.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I need you to judge.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What's wrong with moving to the hospital you want?

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If it's this case, I'm going to recommend Care Mix Hospital.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Care Mix is a hybrid hospital that has both general and medical conditions.

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That alone can improve the work-life balance and also help with the aftermath.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Nevertheless, there is one reason why you want to move to a medical hospital.

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You want to get a higher amount of money.

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is that so?

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Who do you think I am?

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're the one who loves money.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's right.

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, my time is over.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can persuade me as you like.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What I can say is...

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't try to measure people's happiness with your own hands.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Are you okay?

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I forgot to pay for the tea, but I can pay for it.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't think so.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I didn't understand Mr. Ishigami's point of view.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you keep doing that, you'll be arrested.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No, I won't be arrested.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why can you live?

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is a priority issue.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That person doesn't understand that.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll be honest.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Ms. Anzai, your choice is not right.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Damn it.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Did you explain to that old man that his career would be closed?

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Of course I did.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But...

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Once you get a job as a nurse, your skills will be poor.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You won't be able to go back to the hospital.

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If you keep doing what you want,

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you'll lose the happiness as a doctor.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll be your career partner.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Mr. Ishigami.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes?

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I want to be happy as a doctor,

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
not as a doctor.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This time, I'll be your career partner.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Doctor Connection.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I've heard a lot about it.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But he's got a friend's life ahead of him.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He's just thinking about his own profit.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
His case is not about friendship.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's about money and the village.

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mamori.

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You should be a colleague.

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can't do anything without a legal violation.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But I'll gather some information.

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Good.

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's my girl.

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's not for you.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I can't let you cheat on people for money.

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Aisaki Hospital.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Ten years ago, I joined the University Hospital.

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Now, it's a popular hospital.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm a professor of the common name of Kagehito Amino.

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm a patient with a strong heart.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Please.

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Congratulations.

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I didn't expect to get such a light offer.

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm proud of my previous success.

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But if a young and talented person dies in a hospital,

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
it's a shame.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't recommend it,

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
but Aisaki Hospital is not a bad place.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's good.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank you.

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Work hard and take good care of your wife.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Sir, is something wrong?

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, nothing.

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The recruitment of the staff is still difficult.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's hard to become an excellent experienced person.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Experienced person?

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The staff?

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Congratulations.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you.

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
From now on, I'll be more careful about my family.

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't push yourself.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's celebrate our wedding next year together.

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes.

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Excuse me.

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Please.

231
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Please.

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm sorry to call you.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Mr. Takeru Yoriyoka.

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He was a classmate of Mr. Kanenari Nalki

235
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
in the baseball circle when he was in college.

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He still has a deep faith.

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Excuse me.

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What do you need?

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The police in Aisaki Hospital

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
has information that Mr. Kanenari Nalki was in the hospital.

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He was involved in a party the other day.

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The director is worried that he is planning something.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Do you know anything about it?

244
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Planning?

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You know about his father.

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Before he quit the hospital,

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:57,600
he was spreading the spread of the

248
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
I'm...

249
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Please report to me again.

250
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,600
My husband is such a young and wonderful teacher.

251
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm happy that I have a son.

252
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Please think of me as your son

253
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
and listen to my treatment.

254
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Yes.

255
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Of course,

256
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
but there are many patients who can't get a heart transplant.

257
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,600
There are only patients who can't recover.

258
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Mr. Manzai.

259
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Mr. Fukuhara's family is here.

260
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Is that so?

261
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,600
My father is six months away.

262
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
From now on,

263
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,600
please make the remaining time a good one.

264
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Yes.

265
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,600
I have to make good memories for my father's birthday.

266
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Can I have my father eat Dora-yaki?

267
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,600
If you can eat it on a special day.

268
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Thank you.

269
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Mr. Manzai, are you doing well?

270
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
It's not easy to work in a nursing hospital.

271
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Unlike general hospitals,

272
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,600
care is not the key.

273
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,600
He will hit a big wall soon.

274
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
What?

275
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I told you that my husband is six months away.

276
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I can celebrate his birthday.

277
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,600
I understand that you are a woman.

278
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I will tell you about the risk of a heart transplant.

279
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Liar.

280
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Liar.

281
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Liar.

282
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Mr. Manzai.

283
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Professor Amino, you are here today.

284
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Are you used to this place?

285
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Yes.

286
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,600
This place is not as remote as a nursing hospital.

287
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
But it's close to the patients.

288
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
It's a good place.

289
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Yes.

290
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
I heard from Mr. Naruki.

291
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Your weakness is that you are too serious and work too hard.

292
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
It's a long way.

293
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Don't push yourself too hard.

294
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Thank you for your concern.

295
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Excuse me.

296
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
I will tell you directly.

298
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
As a part of our company...

299
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I refuse.

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
You are fast.

301
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I don't want to change jobs.

302
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Then I will not pay you.

303
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I know.

304
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
You can eat what you like.

305
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Yes.

306
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
You shouldn't be under Naruki.

307
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
He will be destroyed one day.

308
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
You will be involved.

309
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I have a place to go if I don't have a fortune.

310
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Why are you in his office?

311
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Well...

312
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
There are many things in Nari Station.

313
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Mr. Naruki is a strange person.

314
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I trust people who value money.

315
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I wrote a message before.

316
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I want to hear this.

317
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Are you interested in his past?

318
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I can negotiate with him.

319
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
How much do you know?

320
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I don't know anything.

321
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,600
About the medical care my father gave me.

322
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I want to know.

323
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,600
My father was a doctor at that hospital.

324
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
He was a good doctor.

325
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,600
He was trusted by his boss.

326
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
So...

327
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I decided to leave him to him.

328
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
That...

329
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Mai...

330
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Mai!

331
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Mai!

332
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,600
The operation didn't go well.

333
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,600
The operation was to solve the problem.

334
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
But...

335
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
My family didn't agree.

336
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,600
The chief of staff took the issue and the meeting was held.

337
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
There was no question.

338
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
That's what I was supposed to explain.

339
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
But...

340
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Mr. Naruki...

342
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
After a while...

344
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Naruki's father died.

345
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Wait.

346
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,600
You don't mean anything bad?

347
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I sympathize with that.

348
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
But...

349
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
He was working in the military.

350
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,600
He tried to make his father's sins known to his colleagues.

351
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,600
He lost his job in the military.

352
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,600
He worked as a boss and was sent to the hospital.

353
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,600
I was working for him at that time.

354
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Really?

355
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
But...

356
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Naruki's story spread.

357
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,600
He was fired.

358
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I tried to get close to him.

359
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
But he...

360
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
He used me.

361
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,600
He used you.

362
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,600
He did it for the sake of the family.

363
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Is it related to your father?

364
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,600
For example, he paid the compensation.

365
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,600
His hospital bill is going to be extremely high.

366
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
What?

367
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
What about him?

368
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,600
He was unconscious before he started working.

369
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:38,600
He's in the hospital now.

370
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,600
In the hospital?

371
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
I'm so pissed.

372
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,600
If I tell the director, he'll blow me away.

373
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
So?

374
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
What are you going to tell him?

375
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
I'm worried about him.

376
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Don't worry.

377
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Naruki is fine.

378
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
That's all.

379
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
So?

380
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
What's the truth?

381
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Isaki is the one who's in the hospital.

382
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
It's a different story.

383
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
You're not serious.

384
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,600
You think I'm a good informer.

385
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,600
I'll tell you whatever you want.

386
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Did you forget something?

387
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I heard a little about your father from Ishigami.

388
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Really?

389
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:43,600
You're investigating the case.

390
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,600
You're suspicious.

391
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,600
I just want to know.

392
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Did you transfer Anzai to Aisaki Hospital?

393
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Is it related to the hospital?

394
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:11,600
You're trying to use Anzai.

395
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
You're thinking too much.

396
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
I'm sorry.

397
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,600
You still misunderstand me.

398
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,600
I'm trying to use him.

399
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,600
I started this job to know the truth.

400
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I can use anyone who is an employee.

401
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:47,600
What's going to happen to Anzai's life?

402
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
What do you mean?

403
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
I'm thinking about you.

404
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,600
I didn't want that.

405
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:19,600
I just want you to be with me.

406
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Yes?

407
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Anzai, Yoneshima...

408
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Please.

409
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Yoneshima.

410
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Thank you.

411
00:24:47,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I'll go check on your family.

412
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
It's easy to take care of a sick person.

413
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,600
It's a good thing, isn't it?

414
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,600
It's not like that.

415
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:30,600
I was thinking about how many years I'd be working at this job.

416
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Are you regretting your transfer?

417
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Regret?

418
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,600
No, I'm not.

419
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I didn't have a choice to continue acting.

420
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,600
I didn't have a life to take care of my wife.

421
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,600
You did everything for your wife.

422
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,600
I made up my mind.

423
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I wanted to be like my father.

424
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,060
My father was a

425
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,600
business man.

426
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,600
He was in the business of a

427
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,600
bank to pay off his debt.

428
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I was a director at the time.

429
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,600
I still remember that day vividly.

430
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
You're late.

431
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
You called me to go to the hospital.

432
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
I think I read it.

433
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I thought you'd come back early today.

434
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:57,600
I'm going to the hospital.

435
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Father?

436
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Father!

437
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
It was a brain hemorrhage caused by a

438
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
brain hemorrhage.

439
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Someone bring an AED.

440
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Number 119, please.

441
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Why?

442
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,600
I was looking forward to my father's return.

443
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Why?

444
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,600
I was working hard for the sake of it.

445
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I swore at that time.

446
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I never wanted to make my father's family miserable.

447
00:27:50,600 --> 00:28:02,600
But when I realized it, I was doing the same thing as my father at that time.

448
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,600
I finally heard my true feelings.

449
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,600
So now I can make my wife happy.

450
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,600
My wife told me.

451
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,600
I don't want to see me with such a miserable face.

452
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I can't be happy with this kind of change.

453
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Let's go back to the general hospital.

454
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
What?

455
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,600
If we keep going like this, we can't make your wife happy.

456
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
It's impossible.

457
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,600
I left the scene and got sick at the ophthalmologist.

458
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
I can't go back to the general hospital.

459
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I was prepared.

460
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Yes.

461
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Once you go to the hospital, you can't change your job.

462
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Normally.

463
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,600
But I can.

464
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,600
If you want, you can help me change my job again.

465
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
That's...

466
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,600
If you change your job, I'll get another hospital's introduction fee.

467
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,600
No problem.

468
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Wait a minute.

469
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Is it too much to change jobs at a general hospital?

470
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Let's sort out the problems.

471
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
First of all, it's a medical fund for the Aisaki Hospital.

472
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,600
If you change your job again after six months, you have to change your salary.

473
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
You can throw that away.

474
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
You can just change your job.

475
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
What else?

476
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
It's a blank.

477
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Isn't this what Ishigami said?

478
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
He said it right from the beginning.

479
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
That's not it.

480
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Anzai needed to hit the wall.

481
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to live his life.

482
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,600
This is the necessary remuneration.

483
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,600
It's a short-term change of job, so it's going to be a huge disadvantage in the changing market.

484
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,600
It's a problem, but I'll give you a hit.

485
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Is it already changing jobs?

486
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Yeah.

487
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Yonaga-kun, it's a mission.

488
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Futaba Memorial Hospital.

489
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:34,600
As a care mix hospital, it is also involved in chronic medical treatment, but it is concerned about youth shortage and the decline in population.

490
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Dr. Kosugi!

491
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
You?

492
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,600
I can't accept it.

493
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Why do you stop?

494
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
You are...

495
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,600
I've been talking about you from the shadows.

496
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,600
I'm a researcher.

497
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Don't lie to me.

498
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Why do you stop?

499
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,600
If you don't tell me the truth, I...

500
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
I know.

501
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I'll tell you.

502
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I heard the real reason for the decline in population from Dr. Kosugi.

503
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
It's a lie that you want to do research.

504
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
It's a painful thing to have a hospital with a shortage of people.

505
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Is that so?

506
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,600
The problem is that the people are not enough, so the will stops.

507
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
You don't have to hit me so suddenly.

508
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,600
But there are no good people.

509
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I can't wait anymore.

510
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,600
I will recommend our scout service.

511
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Scout?

512
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
First, receive the payment.

513
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Then, you can use the payment to headhunt the hospital.

514
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,600
It's a system that invites the ideal partner.

515
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,600
How much is the payment?

516
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
The payment is 5 million yen.

517
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,600
In addition, the success rate is 35% per year.

518
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
5 million yen for anything?

519
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,600
The doctor is a luxury.

520
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,600
You have to pay a lot of money to get a good hotel.

521
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,600
You have to pay a lot of money to get a good hotel.

522
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,600
The doctor sells 80 million yen a year.

523
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,600
It's a good investment.

524
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,600
So, you will be transferred to the hospital.

525
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
It's strange.

526
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,600
It's a good investment.

527
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,600
If you get a good salary, you will be able to pay the medical bills.

528
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,600
If you are a scout, you will be transferred to a small restaurant.

529
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
I see.

530
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,600
It's a good way to get out of the hospital.

531
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
What about the situation in the hotel?

532
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm doing it now.

533
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Hey, eat more.

534
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Thank you.

535
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Can you keep the evidence?

536
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,600
I have a plan.

537
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,600
I want to ask for permission to have a doctor's connection.

538
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,600
I'll try to meet with Ueto.

539
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
Thank you.

540
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Yes, this is Dr. Connection.

541
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
What?

542
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
A ghost?

543
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
A connection?

544
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
What should I do?

545
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,600
There should be no problem with our work.

546
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,600
But, if you find out about Dr. Anzai, it will be a problem.

547
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
You should answer.

548
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
I have Anzai's right.

549
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
No, I can't.

550
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
I can't do that.

551
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,600
You can say that you don't have a president.

552
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
I can't say that.

553
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
It's okay.

554
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,600
The fact that you have a pre-prediction is not a bad thing.

555
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
It's just a small job.

556
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Don't worry.

557
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,600
I'm Kitami Mamori, director of labor standards.

558
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
I will now perform the inspection.

559
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,600
It doesn't look like it's the only way.

560
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
You look worried.

561
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
But, the problem is still there.

562
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,600
If you say so, leave it to me.

563
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,600
This is Dr. Anzai, who I headhunted.

564
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,600
He has many achievements as a fire extinguisher.

565
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Wait a minute.

566
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,600
He is currently working at a hospital.

567
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Naruki, you can't hire him in this career.

568
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Why?

569
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Because he has a high rank in the industry.

570
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
He can't be compared to the stock market.

571
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
I understand.

572
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
I understand.

573
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Show me your passport.

574
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
You are a good director.

575
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
You have a lot of knowledge.

576
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Don't look down on me.

577
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,600
But, you can understand.

578
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,600
He is a good director because he has a branch.

579
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
What?

580
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,600
He is a top-level doctor.

581
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,600
He is a good director because he has a branch.

582
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
That's...

583
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Dr. Anzai is currently working at a hospital.

584
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,600
That's why he is a salesman at Caremix Hospital.

585
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Salesman?

586
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,600
He has not only general diseases, but also medical conditions.

587
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,600
He can manage artificial respiration, which requires some experience,

588
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,600
in addition to his skills as a fire extinguisher.

589
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,600
He is also a fire extinguisher.

590
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,600
He can do anything to improve his health.

591
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,600
In other words, he is an all-rounder who can be used in any position of the royal family.

592
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
He is a must-have.

593
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,600
But, he can't play the role of a fire extinguisher.

594
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,600
He will do his best to regain his skills.

595
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
There is no problem.

596
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,600
It's not a good foundation to work hard.

597
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
I have checked the documents.

598
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,600
There are various legal items in the documents.

599
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
There is no problem.

600
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:46,600
However, there is a suspicion that the fire extinguisher was re-ignited during the termination of the fire.

601
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
What?

602
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,600
It has been re-ignited once, but it will not be re-ignited again within two years.

603
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
You know that, right?

604
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,600
That's another story.

605
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,600
We are a sub-organization of the Kosei Labor Association.

606
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
We cannot overlook the evidence.

607
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Evidence?

608
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Please show us the documents of the person who was the fire extinguisher at that time.

609
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
It's a pretty stand-up play.

610
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,600
I don't think it's fair, but let's cooperate to clear the air.

611
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
It's Mr. Naruki, right?

612
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Yes.

613
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:32,600
He is the person who was the fire extinguisher.

614
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,600
If you want, you can help me re-ignite the hospital.

615
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
What is this?

616
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
What?

617
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,600
You are recommending re-ignitioning the hospital, right?

618
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
I just got on the sedan.

619
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
You said you wanted to do it, right?

620
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,600
This is evidence that he brought up.

621
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,600
In the first place, the head of the department is the problem.

622
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,600
You decided to re-ignite the hospital twice because of him, right?

623
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,600
You were hurt by your career and felt uncomfortable, right?

624
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:18,600
I don't think so.

625
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
What?

626
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,600
He helped me with my career so that I wouldn't regret it.

627
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Otherwise, I might have been living a life of silence.

628
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Besides, I can't help but feel that effort is so vague.

629
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Then let's do this.

630
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
One year.

631
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,600
If you can't get your skills back in one year,

632
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,600
or if you re-ignite the office,

633
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,600
I will return all the rewards for this case.

634
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
All of them?

635
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Naruki.

636
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,600
I have been confident in my ability to see through his abilities.

637
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,600
You said you couldn't find a good person,

638
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,600
but you weren't ready to decide with your eyes.

639
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Naruki took my potential and led me to the right path.

640
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Did he say that?

641
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
He is a hard worker.

642
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,600
He is also responsible and never gives up halfway.

643
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Why are you so angry?

644
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Because he is my friend.

645
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
The End

646
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
You're crying?

647
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I'm glad.

648
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,600
It's been a while since Yuto has a bright face.

649
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
You know,

650
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
I was thinking that I should calm down.

651
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
I...

652
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
I'm pregnant.

653
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Really?

654
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Yes.

655
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm so happy.

656
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
I will definitely make you two happy.

657
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Not just the two of us,

658
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,600
but the three of us will make you happy.

659
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Yes.

660
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
That's right.

661
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
Yes.

662
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Is it possible to quit Aisaki without any problems?

663
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Professor Amino was aware that I wasn't right for him.

664
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,600
He was kind enough to send me out.

665
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
I guess so.

666
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
He is a good see-through person.

667
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
I think I understand now.

668
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
My father was a hard worker,

669
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,600
but my mother was happy with that.

670
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Thank you, NARUKI.

671
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
By the way, Anzai,

672
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
I have a favor to ask you.

673
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
What is it?

674
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
I have a favor to ask you.

675
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
An electronic credit card?

676
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
I want you to look at the documents

677
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
for electronic credit cards before the operation.

678
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,600
The documents can only be collected by the staff at Aisaki Hospital.

679
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,600
But if you look at it, you will find that the records remain.

680
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
You will find that you are looking for past medical care.

681
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
You will feel a little bit of regret.

682
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
In other words,

683
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,600
the only staff who can ask for this job is the one who is about to quit.

684
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Only he can do it.

685
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
You are so sure?

686
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
It's just as you said.

687
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I was going to use you from the beginning.

688
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Did you feel disappointed?

689
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,600
But there are some things like the results are like a line.

690
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Besides,

691
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,600
I was a little relieved to know that NARUKI's goal was achieved.

692
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,600
This time, the special report that has successfully passed the test is...

693
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
I was so nervous.

694
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
The life expectancy has been reduced by two years.

695
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,600
I will believe in NARUKI a little more.

696
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
I will believe in him.

697
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
I have found NARUKI.

698
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,600
He is currently busy with the job of an agent.

699
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
There seems to be no problem.

700
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Thank you for your cooperation.

701
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Excuse me.

702
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,600
I'm sorry that I couldn't get the connection of the doctor even though I got the information.

703
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
I'm sorry.

704
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Is that so?

705
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
I'll contact you when I get something wrong again.

706
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
If you resign,

707
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,600
I will be given another dose of introduction from another hospital.

708
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
I'm sorry.

709
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
I'm sorry.

710
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
I'm sorry.

711
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
I'm sorry.

712
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
I'm sorry.

713
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
I will be given another dose of introduction from another hospital.

714
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
There is no problem.

715
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,600
NARUKI

716
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,600
The electronic card that the criminal obtained does not have any error in the patient record during the operation.

717
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,600
It is a change in the condition of NARUKI MASANARI's body during the operation.

718
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
Is it really a mistake?

719
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,600
In the first place, the fact that Mr. Kuramochi is on my father's side...

720
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
The miracle is different.

721
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,600
This record should be written by a woman outside.

722
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,600
The members who participated in the operation are not a miracle to anyone.

723
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,600
This record is someone else's person.

724
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Something is hidden here.

725
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,600
The truth of the accident is hidden.

726
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,600
If so, someone has sinned against my father.

727
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,600
The seniors have to pseudonym to press it and relax.

728
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Obtained the main part of concentration of information.

729
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:30,040
W

730
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Iwatch

731
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,760
