1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,720
The eyes of
the world are on Nevada

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,120
to witness, at short range, the
world's most powerful atom bomb.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,440
And this is it.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,640
Illuminating the Earth with
the glare of a hundred suns

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,920
seen 75 miles away even
in brilliant sunshine.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,200
The vacuum created by the terrific
blast sucks up the sand like a cyclone,

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,680
creating a sandstorm that
envelops the dazed GIAs

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,280
as they emerge
from their shelter.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,680
And the world must ask,

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,240
is this the pinnacle of
man's creative genius?

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,080
In England,

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,960
Queen Elizabeth II continues to
observe the 16 week period of mourning…

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,160
Oh, it's such a beautiful day.

14
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,800
I think I'll go to town.

15
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,160
Yes, sirree.

16
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,640
Well, me, oh, my.
Who might you be?

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,680
Don't make me laugh.

18
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,880
But I declare,
you're a stranger in these parts.

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,200
Who are you, sir?

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,720
Don't
make me laugh. Because…

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,640
♪ I'm Mr Ring-a-Ding I'll
make your heart bells sing ♪

22
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,120
♪ Please don't make me laugh
Just take my autograph ♪

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,920
♪ Now don't be crazy, pretty

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
♪ For I am he Oh, yes,

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,800
♪ Jump and talk and

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,160

♪ I'm Mr Ring-a-Ding Oh, my ♪

28
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,680
And what's your
name, sweetie pie?

29
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,920
They call me Sunshine Sally.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,400
No! Don't give me sunshine.

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
Because I'm more
interested in moonlight.

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,000
That icy cold beam of heaven.

33
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,480
Touching my soul and
bringing me life.

34
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,200
What do you think?

35
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,400
I asked you. Yes, you.

36
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,160
Sitting there drooling with your buckets
of popped corn and caramel water.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,080
I asked you, what do you think?

38
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,120
This one's kind of
silly, isn't it?

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,240
What did you say?

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
I'm looking at you
with the glasses.

41
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,600
What did you say?

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,040
Who? Me?

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,280
Don't make me laugh. Yes, you.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,120
How are they doing this?

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,640
If you won't tell me, then I'll
have to find out for myself.

46
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,960
Get ready,

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,200
'cause here I come!

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,280
We're going 3D.

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,800
And remember, whatever you do,

50
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,520
don't make me laugh!

51
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,600
So, you left Earth

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,200
May the 24th, 2025.

53
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,360
And the one place the TARDIS
cannot reach is May the 24th.

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,080
We bounce off.

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,120
Can't you get
this box of yours fixed?

56
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,640
You're a Time Lord.

57
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,840
Take it back to
planet Timelordia.

58
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,280
Oh, I wish it was called that.

59
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,240
The name is Gallifrey.

60
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,160
Well, then let's go
home to Gallifrey.

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
They must have garages.

62
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
Maybe not today. Yeah?

63
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,680
But I never asked.
What about you?

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,080
Who have you got? Girlfriend,
boyfriend, other friend?

65
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,920
- No, but there is Mum and Dad.
- Ah.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,920
He works in tax.
She's a violinist.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,280
Oh, no way.

68
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,280
She's in the London Regency
Orchestra. She's amazing.

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,120
- Oh.
- My dad's kind of musical.

70
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,360
Well, he sings. Well, he
loves grabbing the microphone.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440
He's awful.

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
And he makes me laugh so much.

73
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,040
And I would really, really
like to see them again.

74
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,440
Please.

75
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,040
This should get you home.

76
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,960
It is a vortex indicator,

77
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,960
which I am going to
call a vindicator, yeah?

78
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,720
So, what does it do?

79
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,160
We land anywhere.

80
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,360
And the vindicator casts out a
signal, like a fishing line...

81
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
whoosh...

82
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,360
to May 24th 2025.

83
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,480
And we use it to pull the
TARDIS in, like a hook.

84
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,840
So we must land.

85
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
We're on Earth.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,280
We bounced all the
way back to 1952.

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
- It's 1952 out there?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
- We're in actual 1952?
- Except you wanna go home.

89
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,480
- So, I'm gonna pop out on my own and...
- Not a chance! Out of my way.

90
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,160
- I went to sleep in this.
- Mmm.

91
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,360
- Could it get me arrested in 1952?
- No.

92
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,040
Belinda Chandra,

93
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,920
this is the fun bit, honey.

94
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
The clothes.

95
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,840
It helps if you run!

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,200
Whoo-hoo!

97
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,600
Get in there!

98
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,600
This bit I like.

99
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,040
Mmm.

100
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,840
And it's really 1952 out there?

101
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,360
- It really is?
- It really, really is.

102
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,880
Oh, my God.

103
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,400
We moved.

104
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,240
The box moved.

105
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,040
We're actually here.

106
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,320
- Wherever we are.
- Miami, Florida.

107
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,640
We're in Miami?

108
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,200
At 4:00 a.m.

109
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
We got dressed up
for no one to see.

110
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,640
1952, that might be wise.

111
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Rock Hudson.

112
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,720
Good name. Rock.

113
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,840
He took it from the
Rock of Gibraltar.

114
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,480
The most beautiful man.

115
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
We did him on our
HIV training course.

116
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,240
And here he is.

117
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,080
Big movie star.

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,120
This time travel
thing is so strange.

119
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,760
'Cause we know what
happens to him.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Poor soul.

121
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Oh.

122
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,640
Do your thing, baby.

123
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,440
Question is,

124
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,200
who chains up a cinema?

125
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Hmm?

126
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,560
Mmm.

127
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,120
Those chains are strong.

128
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,000
Like they are locking
up a wild beast.

129
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,360
Hey, look.

130
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,320
I think someone's died.

131
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,520
Oh.

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,040
"Come back, Tommy
Lee." Come back?

133
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,080
It says, "Closed by city ordinance
of the Dade Police Department."

134
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,440
Uh,

135
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,320
"I love you, Christine."

136
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,080
More than one person.

137
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,680
What happened?

138
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,280
Is that it? Is it done?

139
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,600
Yeah, that is a direct
line back to 2025.

140
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,920
We might need to land
a couple more times.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,480
Triangulate the signal.

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,160
Then we'd better go.

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,400
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,560
We can go now.

145
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,880
Suppose.

146
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,600
We need to get inside
that TARDIS thing

147
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,840
and leave.

148
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,040
- Yes?
- Except…

149
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Oh, my God!

150
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,920
You actually want to investigate
that spooky old cinema.

151
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,480
You're Scooby-Doo.

152
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,800
Honey, I'm Velma.

153
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,720
And I'm just wondering,

154
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,920
1952,

155
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,840
we could risk a coffee?

156
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,440
Some people say a boat came
in and took them to Cuba.

157
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,680
Recruiting for Batista.

158
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,000
But the fact is 15 people went
missing, sir, all in one night.

159
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,400
Three months ago,
just disappeared.

160
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,080
Actually from the cinema?

161
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,400
Oh, I like your English cinema.

162
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,520
But the picture house, yeah.

163
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,680
Mrs Lowenstein, these folks
been asking about the Palazzo.

164
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
This lady, her
son went in there.

165
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,720
Tommy Lee. Never seen again.

166
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,040
I'll talk to anyone
about that boy of mine.

167
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,200
If you'll bend the rules?

168
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,320
I got no problem.

169
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
This time of night,
who's looking?

170
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,680
- Bend the rules?
- 1952, Miami. The diner is segregated.

171
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
No Blacks, which includes you.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,280
We're breaking the law
just by being in here.

173
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
But that's…

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,216
- Oh, my God. They can't...
- Save it for later, Belinda.

175
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,960
Right now, we are busy.

176
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,200
How can you say that?

177
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,680
I have toppled worlds.

178
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,520
Sometimes I wait for
people to topple the world.

179
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,440
Until then, I live
in it, and I shine.

180
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,480
Sixteen years old.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
The kindest boy.

182
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
He'd go to the pictures
every night if he could.

183
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,280
Stay and watch a movie
three times over.

184
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,240
He liked those tales
of outer space.

185
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Did he?

186
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,321
I said,
"Concentrate on your schoolwork,"

187
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,320
but he'd smile that smile
of his, and off he'd go.

188
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,560
So, what did they
do, the police?

189
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,320
Did they search the place?

190
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,760
Turned it upside down.

191
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,400
Came back and searched it
again and again and again.

192
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,080
Not a damn thing.

193
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,400
Pardon my language.

194
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,800
Did they search at night?

195
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,920
Don't think so. Why do you ask?

196
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,200
Things are different at night.

197
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,280
How often do you come here?

198
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
All the time.

199
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,600
I will sit and wait
for that boy forever.

200
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,560
I thought they'd given up till
someone delivered that thing tonight.

201
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,680
It says "police box."

202
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,120
- Does that give you hope?
- It does, sir.

203
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,160
Well, let me tell you,

204
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,200
hope can change the
world, Mrs Lowenstein.

205
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,840
My name is the Doctor.

206
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,680
And I will try to find your son.

207
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,240
Gives you
the chills, don't it?

208
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,520
Can still hear those old
movies late at night.

209
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,680
You're not saying it's haunted?

210
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,800
Pardon me, missy. That's crazy
talk. I mean, he's still in there.

211
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,560
Mr Pye. The old
projectionist. Reginald Pye.

212
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,200
He got arrested, but they
had no evidence or nothing.

213
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,360
So they closed the Palazzo.
He stayed on as caretaker.

214
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,440
And every night, the movies
keep playing to an empty house.

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,480
There is literally an old
caretaker in a haunted cinema.

216
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,080
- Come on, Velma.
- Okay, Fred.

217
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,600
Okay, stand back.

218
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,680
Hello?

219
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
Mr Pye?

220
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,040
Are you there?

221
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,440
Mr Pye, I know this
is a segregated space.

222
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,480
But we just…

223
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,040
We wanted to say…

224
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Hello.

225
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,920
Go away.

226
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,280
Oh, no, no, no.

227
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,920
Mr Pye,

228
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,280
Logan from the diner
told us your name.

229
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm Belinda and
this is the Doctor.

230
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,760
Really? Just the Doctor, always?

231
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,240
- Yeah.
- Ridiculous.

232
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,680
Mr Pye, can we have a word?

233
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,800
No, no, no.

234
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,040
Please, please don't hurt them.

235
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,760
What was that?

236
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,520
- Hello?
- Is someone there?

237
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,880
Is that tap dancing?

238
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,320
Is someone tap dancing at us?

239
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,480
Reggie.

240
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,520
Reggie, is that you?

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,680
Ta-da!

242
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,880
I mean, you're a cartoon.

Don't make me laugh.

256
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,880
You are a living cartoon.

257
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,680
With a happy hello to you too.

258
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,840
How's it done?

259
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,000
That technology is

260
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,120
- way beyond anything in 1952.
- Yoo-hoo!

261
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,600
- They didn't have holograms.
- He's not a hologram.

262
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,440
Hello. Yes, he is.

263
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,920
Look at him.

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,080
Take a good gander, folks.
Ain't got no surprises.

265
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,760
You're not celluloid.
You're made of light.

266
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
- Light come to life.
- I'm beaming at ya!

267
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
- This is impossible.
- How do you exist?

268
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,560
I wish I knew.

269
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,040
I'm all alone.

270
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,240
Ain't nobody else in this
whole wide world like me.

271
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,000
Does nobody care
about Mr Ring-a-Ding?

272
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,800
You got your own soundtrack.

273
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,960
Fifteen people went missing.

274
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,320
They vanished in this building.

275
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,160
Do you know what
happened to them?

276
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,200
I appeared, they disappeared.

277
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,680
If you solve that mystery, those
poor lost souls might come back.

278
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,400
What are you a cartoon of?

279
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,280
- Are you supposed to be a man?
- Don't make me laugh!

280
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,000
- You've got a nose like a pig.
- Don't make me laugh!

281
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,440
And why are you blue?

282
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,720
Don't make me laugh!

283
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,040
Wait a minute.

284
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,520
Is there a reason we
shouldn't be making you laugh?

285
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,760
And what could that be, sir?

286
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,240
Belinda, get back.

287
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,720
Trust me, get back.
Get away from him.

288
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,000
Gee willikers, you're
a clever old coot.

289
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,800
Don't spoil my surprise.

290
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,480
Tell me, who are you?

291
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,320
Don't make me laugh.

292
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,560
Because it sounds like this.

293
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,560
"Harbinger".

294
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,360
What does that mean? Who is he?

295
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,320
The gods of chaos
have harbingers.

296
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,880
And I am Lux.

297
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,760
Lux Imperator.

298
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,520
The god of light.

299
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,800
I am the dazzle at the
heart of the Pantheon.

300
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,120
And the glint in
the eyes of the mad.

301
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,560
I am the last thing you see
before you fall into the abyss.

302
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Run, run!

303
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,240
Do you think you
can escape from me?

304
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,720
You think you can escape
from light itself?

305
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,880
Because…

Reginald Pye, thank you for the
song. How long does it last?

316
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,880
One minute, 36 seconds. But
you were supposed to get out.

317
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,120
Reggie, babes, please,
we haven't got long.

318
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
What happened?

319
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,360
I couldn't stop it.

320
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,760
I'm not blaming you.

321
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,800
But you play him
movies in the dark.

322
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,440
He says it feeds him.

323
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,720
Mr Pye, he's 2 foot tall.

324
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,080
Why don't you just run away?

325
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,080
Because he showed me…

326
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,640
so much joy.

327
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,000
I was married for 20 years.

328
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,160
And I'm telling you, sir,
you never saw such a girl.

329
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I was the luckiest fellow
in the whole wide world.

330
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,480
And then one spring day,

331
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,520
she went to cross the road.

332
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,960
And I've been alone ever since.

333
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,000
Until he came.

334
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,600
What did he do?

335
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,200
He brought her back.

336
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,240
And don't tell me

337
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,240
she's not really there.

338
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,520
Because if that thing is real,

339
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,640
then so is she.

340
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,560
The song has stopped.

341
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,760
Well, I wouldn't worry.

342
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,520
It's really not much of a chase.

343
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,000
Darn it. I was so
big when I arrived.

344
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,800
I should never have
learnt perspective.

345
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
Are you saying that's a god?

346
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,520
It's all a game to them.

347
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,360
But the games are deadly.

348
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,240
But tell me, how, sir?

349
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,720
Did you say doctor?

350
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,680
What gods are these, doc?

351
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,280
There are forces
beyond this universe.

352
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,960
And we think we are so clever, but
we're like children. We are children.

353
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,640
And when these vast creatures
deign to look down on us,

354
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,800
our entire reality is in danger.

355
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,800
Fifteen people.

356
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,360
Thirteen, 14, 15.

357
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,120
The police searched the building,
but they didn't look in here.

358
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,600
- What, he photographed them?
- No.

359
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,760
No, that's them.

360
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,400
He's trapped them on the film.

361
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,600
The god of light has
turned them into an image.

362
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,160
Oh, my God.

363
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,280
Let me in, let me in.

364
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,680
By the hair on my chinny chin chin.
Or is that a different cartoon?

365
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,680
Reggie, how did he enter this
world? Was it on the big screen?

366
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Yes.

367
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,440
Mr Reginald Pye, are you
giving away my secrets?

368
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,520
'Cause you know how
flammable old film stock is.

369
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
What if your poor
lady wife just burned?

370
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,440
No! Please, please.
Don't do that.

371
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,080
You will talk to me.

372
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,120
And tell me, how did
you enter this world?

373
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,400
I'm a two-dimensional character.
You can't expect backstory.

374
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,840
I know how the gods work. You
are honour-bound to tell me.

375
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Light.

376
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,960
The chance of moonlight with
reflection and electricity.

377
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,360
But if you know so much,
you must be the one.

378
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,120
Enemy of the Toymaker,

379
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,920
decomposer of Maestro, the
killer of the god of death.

380
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Absolutely.

381
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,520
So, how do I stop you?

382
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,920
- He's not gonna tell you that.
- He is bound by the rules.

383
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,320
If I must, then,

384
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,560
Doctor, just think,
what have I not done?

385
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,160
That is a riddle.
It is not an answer.

386
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,200
I'll tell you what you can do.
Those 15 people, let them go!

387
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,920
But I've
immortalised them on film.

388
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,800
I can do the same for you.

389
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,040
No. No, don't.

390
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,600
Go get 'em, girls.

391
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,840
My lovely ladies of the light.

392
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,640
Lux. Lux, you want me.

393
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,136
- Don't take Belinda. You want me.
- No.

394
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Roll 'em.

395
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,920
Doctor,
what's he doing?

396
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I think we're being

397
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,040
animated.

398
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Gosh!

399
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,880
I'm all flat and this
waistline is impossible.

400
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,200
We gotta get out of here.

401
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,600
But what do we do, doc?

402
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,880
I don't know.

403
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,200
I've got a
two-dimensional brain.

404
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,840
Gosh, I get so scared
being with you, Doctor.

405
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,440
Your life is terrifying.

406
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,760
I don't think you'll
ever get me home.

407
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,240
What just happened?

408
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,720
You were sad, and you became
more three-dimensional.

409
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,160
Oh, that's it!

410
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,080
You acquired depth!

411
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,880
Wait a minute. Let me try.

412
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720
I didn't
tell you everything

413
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,840
back in the TARDIS.

414
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,560
We can't
ever go back to my planet

415
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
because Gallifrey is a ruin.

416
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,000
My people are dead.

417
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,480
I'm the last of the Time Lords.

418
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,240
It's working. I'm more rounded.

419
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,760
But what you're saying is,
there are no other Time Lords.

420
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,240
No one's coming to help.

421
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,720
- That's it!
- Keep going.

422
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,800
And I'm terrified, Belinda,
'cause I can't get you home.

423
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,880
And I'm scared in case that means
something really bad has happened in 2025.

424
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,280
I'm scared too.

425
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,960
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We did it!

426
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,480
Okay.

427
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,880
But we're still
inside a cartoon.

428
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,720
How do we get out?

429
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,040
We're being framed.

430
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,040
Which means…

431
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,960
if we break the frame…

432
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,520
…and get faster. Yeah?

433
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,440
And we get fast enough…

434
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,760
- Oh, my God. We're back!
- We did it.

435
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,200
- We stopped the film.
- All right, both of you, don't move!

436
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,680
Just stay where you are!

437
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
He's the one. That's
the man, officer.

438
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,960
I told you, I said he was
acting all suspicious.

439
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,520
Called himself a doctor,
but I don't trust him.

440
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,680
Just raise your hands where
I can see 'em. Both of you!

441
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,080
Don't you dare point a gun at
us. We've done nothing wrong.

442
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,640
You're inside a space
reserved for white folk.

443
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,576
Now, I don't know how things are done in
the Caribbean, but they're different here.

444
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm not Caribbean.

445
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,080
He's the one. He's
the troublemaker.

446
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,320
He was asking all
about Tommy Lee.

447
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,680
I'm telling you,
he knows something.

448
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,360
He offered to help you.

449
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,680
I'll give you ten seconds
to explain yourself.

450
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,360
This fine lady's son,
he went and disappeared.

451
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,320
What do you know about it?

452
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,200
Seriously?

453
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,120
Your continuity is terrible.

454
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,320
This is Miami-Dade County, and
that is the uniform of the NYPD.

455
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,520
Try harder.

456
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,560
We're still inside
a bloody film.

457
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,040
- I hate it when they do that.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

458
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,760
This is never gonna work.

459
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,560
Scrolling up and
down does not work.

460
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,760
We need to go…

461
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
out.

462
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,800
If we're the film…

463
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,680
and that's the screen…

464
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,240
- what happens if we…
- Push.

465
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
That's it. I've got you.

466
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,120
Oh, my God. It happened.

467
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,400
Doctor, is that you?

468
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,280
- Uh…
- Belinda.

469
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,760
Belinda Chandra.

470
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,080
Like, Miss Belinda Chandra.

471
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,600
- How do you know that?
- Who are you?

472
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,320
We're your biggest fans.

473
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,000
Oh, my God. You're real.
You're really real.

474
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,080
Oh, this is so Galaxy Quest.

475
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,320
I knew it. I always knew.

476
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,720
Well, I knew this would happen
because it was leaked online.

477
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,840
Hashtag RIP Doctor Who.

478
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,160
Let me get this right.

479
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
I am not real.

480
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,040
My life is fictional,

481
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,120
and you sit and you
watch me on the TV.

482
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,120
- I've seen every single episode.
- But I'm so real.

483
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,200
I'm completely real. I mean, I…

484
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
I can taste this cup of tea.

485
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,480
And my mum and dad. I remember
them. They're absolutely real.

486
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,760
- Your mum who plays the violin?
- How do you know that?

487
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
We were watching.

488
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,440
Oh, my God. I'm on TV.

489
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,760
Go on then. What's your
favourite adventure?

490
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,560
- "Blink".
- Definitely "Blink".

491
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,800
"Blink". Every time.

492
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,840
Uh, not the one
with the Goblins?

493
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,600
- "Blink".
- I met The Beatles.

494
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,840
"Blink".

495
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,480
Not the one where I am
standing on a land mine?

496
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,840
- That was brilliant.
- "Blink".

497
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
What happens in "Blink"?

498
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,760
It's the story where you're
not allowed to blink.

499
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Well, that sounds
like an absolute epic.

500
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,120
Gotta say, though, this
one, this story right now,

501
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,640
Mr Ring-a-Ding,
it's a bit obvious.

502
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
The ending.

503
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,880
Telling us out loud that
old film stock is explosive.

504
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,000
I mean, okay. I get it.

505
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,360
No, but that doesn't work.

506
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,240
We can't blow up Lux
because he's made of light.

507
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah, but what does he not do?

508
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,360
Well, we don't know. Tell us.

509
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
- No, we can't.
- I'm sorry.

510
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,160
Oh, my God. You're so annoying.

511
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,640
Lots of people say
that.

512
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,760
But we don't care. Um…

513
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,280
'Cause the thing is…

514
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,120
- Are you okay?
- I didn't mean it.

515
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
No, we are a bit
annoying. I know that.

516
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,800
I'm wasting your time because

517
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,720
the truth is we…

518
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,960
Oh, Lizzie.

519
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,280
I'm okay.

520
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,680
- It's all right. We don't mind.
- What?

521
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
You're not fictional.

522
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,680
It's us, Belinda.
We're not real.

523
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
What do you mean?

524
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,480
We don't exist.

525
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
But…

526
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
You do.

527
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
No.

528
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,440
We're the sort of characters
who don't have surnames.

529
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,000
We're just part of the trap, so that
creature can play with your minds.

530
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,720
But we're cleverer than him.

531
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
We learnt from the Doctor,
so we worked it out.

532
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,800
We can set you free.

533
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,720
It's time for you to go back and
fight him, and beat him for us.

534
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,561
- I'm sure that there is something that we…
- No, off you go. Come on.

535
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,176
'Cause you better be
quick. Up, up. Come on.

536
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,280
You're 30 minutes in.
Time for the third act.

537
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,560
Thanks. Keep watching.

538
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
- You don't get it, do you?
- What?

539
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,880
What don't I get?

540
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,680
They are not real.

541
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,960
Once we move on,

542
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,600
Lizzie, Hassan and Robyn will
all blink out of existence.

543
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
You mean

544
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
you'll die?

545
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,600
It's not death.

546
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,840
We just end.

547
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,440
But that is death.

548
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Yeah.

549
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,600
But we're not important. It
doesn't matter what happens to us.

550
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,880
And it's been so worth
it just to meet you.

551
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,480
We had so much fun.

552
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,120
And thanks to you, I
met my two best friends.

553
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,240
We'll be gone any second.

554
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,280
Oh, my goodness.

555
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,960
But maybe just now and
then you can think of us.

556
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,120
Then we might live
on just a little bit.

557
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,240
Now, go and save
the world, Doctor.

558
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,840
I wish that there was
something we could...

559
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,720
We love you so much.

560
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,440
They're gone.

561
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,160
Hey, hey. Hey.

562
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,000
And they're right.

563
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,120
We have to go back
and fight that thing.

564
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
'Cause maybe your life
isn't so mad after all.

565
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
- Mmm.
- Okay?

566
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,400
But how do we do it?

567
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,320
There is only one more
thing that we can do.

568
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
We stop.

569
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,720
- Unpack that for me.
- We stop the film itself.

570
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,400
'Cause celluloid, when
it stops, it burns.

571
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,320
The heat from the projector is so
strong that the reel catches fire.

572
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,040
So, it sets us free.

573
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,840
Or burns us to death.

574
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Okay.

575
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,280
Right, right,
right, right there.

576
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
- Okay.
- And then?

577
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
I think…

578
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
this.

579
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,720
Oh, my God.

580
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
We did it. We're back.

581
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,320
Wait, is it real this time?

582
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,600
- Is this real?
- Oh, it's real.

583
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,400
Babes, look, my hand got burned.

584
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,240
You all right? Come
here. Let me have a look.

585
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,640
- I'm all right.
- I know, I know.

586
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Doctors always make the
worst patients, but trust me.

587
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,920
I know what I'm doing.

588
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm okay, Belinda. Okay?

589
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,120
Time Lords have
their own medicine.

590
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,720
Bi-generation.

591
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,640
It's left me with a little
extra pocket of energy

592
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,440
I've been saving just for this.

593
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,600
My hospital could do with you.

594
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,760
I like it.

595
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,960
Whatever you have planned,

596
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,120
Lux, I've matched you.

597
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,760
Now, let Belinda
and Reginald go.

598
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,560
But you're the most amazing
creation, my Doctor, sir.

599
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,680
You have light within
you that builds a body.

600
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,160
No wonder the gods
of the Pantheon fell.

601
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,280
Because they were
saving you for me.

602
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Get him, girls.

603
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,840
The Doctor. Light him up.

604
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,960
Reel him in, ladies.

605
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,480
Let me go!

606
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,000
No!

607
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,600
The greatest story ever told.

608
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,800
Doctor!

609
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,240
Belinda.

610
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,640
Get off him!

611
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,040
Belinda, get back!

612
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,360
What's he doing?

613
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,920
What's the one thing I never do?

614
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Let the light of a Time
Lord build me a body.

615
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,600
Doesn't every cartoon
want to be a man?

616
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,680
'Cause that's what I never
do, my lovely friends.

617
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,520
I never go outside.

618
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,840
Trapped in the dark.

619
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,080
But the great out there
holds such promise.

620
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,480
I've seen it.

621
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,440
The most savage light of all.

622
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,320
The glow of the atom.

623
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,080
Think of all
the fun I will have.

624
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,640
The blossom of nuclear light unfurling
all over this tiny little world.

625
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,600
Bel, remember them.

626
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,520
Lizzie, Hassan. They told
us. They told us what to do.

627
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
They told us the plot.

628
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,200
But how does that help?

629
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,600
Do you trust me?

630
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,080
Yes! I'm sorry if I didn't before,
but, oh, my God, I trust you. Yes.

631
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,000
Then trust me now more than
ever because I am a Time Lord.

632
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,640
But what does that mean?

633
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,360
It means I know what time it is.

634
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Now, run! Run!

635
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,240
Behold!

636
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,480
He means daylight.

637
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,880
Ooh.

638
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,600
Oh. Oh.

639
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,560
Oh, the detail.

640
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,360
Mr Pye, I need matches. This
whole thing has got to burn.

641
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,000
Mr Pye, I've seen your fingers, mate.
That's nicotine. I know you smoke.

642
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,160
Give me your matches right now.

643
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,240
I am real.

644
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,400
Mr Pye, I need those matches.

645
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,120
I love you, Reginald.

646
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Oh.

647
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,040
I miss you so much.

648
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Find me.

649
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,960
Pardon me, ma'am,
but I think you'd better run.

650
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,600
- No, I know what I'm doing.
- I said run!

651
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,640
Give me true life.

652
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
No!

653
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,000
Sunlight.

654
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Doctor!

655
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,960
What have we done?

656
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,640
He feeds off light.

657
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,976
But the
light of the sun.

658
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,400
Two billion times more energy than the
biggest nuclear bomb on planet Earth.

659
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,960
And it is all yours,
Mr Ring-a-Ding.

660
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,440
It is all yours!

661
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,280
I am light.

662
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,080
Did you see? There
was this explosion.

663
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,496
I was shaken right down to my
boots. It was like an almighty…

664
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,160
What the flip is that?

665
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,880
But he's never gonna stop.

666
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,080
That's the point.

667
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,560
The light of creation.

668
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
I am everything…

669
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,320
and I am nothing.

670
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,760
Goodbye.

671
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,960
Am I going crazy or was
that Mr Ring-a-Ding?

672
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,280
But he was made of light.

673
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,080
We're 60% water and
we can still drown.

674
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,240
It's why Lux stayed inside.

675
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,080
And we gave him all the
light in the universe.

676
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,360
And that's what he
became. Light without end.

677
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,800
So, he's actually a god now.

678
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,800
Infinite. Invisible. Intangible.

679
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Amen.

680
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,520
But that's… that's…

681
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Is that…

682
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,480
Come back, Tommy Lee.

683
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,120
I swear it's them.

684
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,720
It's the 15. Oh,
gosh! It's all 15.

685
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,560
Welcome back. Welcome back,
everyone. We missed you so much.

686
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,920
- Hello, sir.
- It's good to see you.

687
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,840
Tommy.

688
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,840
Tommy Lee.

689
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,080
Mom.

690
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,200
You came back.

691
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,880
I had faith and you came back.

692
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,200
Oh, my boy.

693
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,560
According to the laws of the land,
babe, sunlight doesn't suit us.

694
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,840
Goodbye to you, '52.

695
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,120
Mmm.

696
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
And, hey,

697
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,080
those things we said
when we were scared,

698
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,000
they're still true.

699
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
So, let's go out and
face them together, okay?

700
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,320
Hey, I don't understand.
What happened? It was night.

701
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,400
That was three months ago, Tommy.
You've been gone for three months.

702
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,400
If you want to see a good show,
darling, I can recommend this one.

703
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,680
Better warn you though.

704
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,560
Limited run only.

705
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,720
Show ends May the 24th.

706
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,640
But… How did they…

707
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,400
That was like a special effect.

708
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,640
Like from the movies.
How did they do that?

709
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,720
Trick of the light.

710
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,680
Well, I
really, really loved it.

711
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,240
Though, I'd mark it down
to a seven out of ten

712
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,976
'cause it gave away the
ending in the middle.

713
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,680
And the villain's
motivation changed.

714
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,000
And, technically, it's puppets
that wanna be boys, not cartoons.

715
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Oh, my God.

716
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,560
We're still here.

717
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,520
This whole world
is cold, lifeless and dead.

718
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,400
We have a body.

719
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,760
What are you?
