1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It doesn't matter if you're a good or bad person.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Just bring me the money.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The doctor's agent,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Kanenari Naluki.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He sells the money to the hospital

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and gets the money.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's his job.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sometimes he meets the client

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
who is suspicious.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He gets closer to the truth of the medical care

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
he was hiding 3 years ago.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
One of the other patients

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
who wrote the medical records

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is Ando Yoshie.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
His son has a long-term cancer

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and has been hospitalized for 3 months.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why did Ando quit the theater?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But as he gets closer to the truth...

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You haven't told him anything, have you?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You want to help him, don't you?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The darkness will grow darker.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll help him.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How much do you earn?

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have two of your income

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in the annual income.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Take it.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Income?

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Seriously?

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't think I have a dream

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
about my basic wage.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is Yonaga from the gym staff.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes?

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Huh?

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Was it hot?

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll get you a new one.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Please give me a bonus.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
As you can see,

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
he's a very calculating and hardworking man.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He's the main character of the movie.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll start over.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You two are a great match.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So,

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
did something happen?

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh,

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't care.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Continue.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ando Yoshie's son's heart disease

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
makes Kuramochi jealous.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Did he find a donor?

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Normally, it's about jealousy.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But,

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
only Sokun Ando

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
is in charge of Kuramochi.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So, you made Ando stop the story.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What do you mean?

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Probably,

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Kuramochi is

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
trying to keep the secret.

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He changed the donor's standard

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and instead of saving his son's life,

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
he told Ando not to ruin his past.

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's a lot of trouble.

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He's being taken over by the people.

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What are you going to do?

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
As Yorioka said,

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
it's impossible to ask Ando about something.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you for always cleaning up the office.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're welcome.

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have a mission

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
for Yonaga.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yonaga

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
50 students completed.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We have a request to communicate at home.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Blood pressure is 110.70.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Heart rate is 78.

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
SPO2 is 97%.

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's been an hour since the start.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Understood.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We'll do the route and the blood transfusion,

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and then prepare for the new baby and put in the CG.

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Shall I contact Moriya?

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please.

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes.

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's okay.

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We're here.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you, Mom.

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The rapid blood pressure is one minute and one second.

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you're so impatient,

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you'll save your life.

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Are you okay?

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go back to the patient.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No.

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What?

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm busy.

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My senior told me that if I do it again,

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll be fired.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If I lose this job,

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't live anymore.

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you know?

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This hospital is on sale.

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This hospital is on sale.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No way.

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The cleaning company will decide the next one.

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Really?

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So I think it's better to find a new job.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Is the director looking for a job?

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well...

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm not sure.

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This one.

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Code Blue. Code Blue.

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Please wait for the first blood transfusion.

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Code Blue. Code Blue.

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Please wait for the first blood transfusion.

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll move the body.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Please contact the clinic.

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Doctor.

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you still there?

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Doctor.

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Doctor.

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you here?

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm here.

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm here.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Please stand up.

135
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll move you.

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
One, two, three.

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry, Kawa.

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Please let me go.

139
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm not strong enough.

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are you going to do after this place is sold?

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll transfer to another hospital and train my skills in the circulation department.

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What do you think?

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I hope you live the way you want.

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So what's Dr. Moriya's condition?

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He needs to rest, but he's not dying.

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I see.

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's the situation at the hospital?

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The Shinkai Hospital was originally a management hospital.

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But the head of the hospital, Moriya Shoko, was patient and charismatic.

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But a year ago, the head of the hospital was hospitalized for a long time.

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So his son, who was in another hospital, was transferred to the hospital.

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
His son is a good person, but he has no management experience and is not skilled.

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So he decided to leave the hospital.

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The head of the hospital has returned to normal, but this time the disease has deteriorated.

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What about the sales?

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The head of the hospital will decide from now on.

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And his son seems to be working as a transfer because he doesn't seem to be in the new hospital.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I see.

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mr. Naruki, did you know about the head of the hospital?

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, Dr. Moriya is a doctor of the medical department.

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, my.

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Even if the owner changes, there are many cases where he continues as the hired director.

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I didn't think I could stop the agent from leaving the hospital.

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I want to find a choice that Dr. Moriya can really agree with.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're kind.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Everyone was like that.

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No one tried to blame me for leaving the hospital because of me.

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is the head of the hospital okay?

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I feel responsible for making my mother's hospital a mess.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The head of the hospital is poor.

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
People have their own direction.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I see.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So I thought I'd give it my all other than that hospital.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I want everyone to be recognized by their mother.

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I want to be active in the first round.

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is that so?

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I've fully understood the feeling of the teacher.

179
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Mom.

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm late.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Were you doing the drill?

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah.

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're so good.

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm an elementary school student next year.

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I see.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ando, can I come in?

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Please wait a moment.

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
NARUKI will definitely appear in front of you again.

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll be careful.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You can keep your promise, right?

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've already told her.

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
All I have to do is wait for the donor to be applied.

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Please take care of her.

196
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have nothing to say.

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I have nothing to say.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're making a promise to Mr. Kuramotsu to prioritize the donor?

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Mae Dosaka had a heart disease since she was young, just like you.

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're trying to help your young child by making him suffer.

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's not my fault.

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't have a child.

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What's wrong with you trying to protect your child's life?

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Dosaka has a father.

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sayori, the mother, goes to the Aisaki Hospital every day and keeps wiping her daughter's body.

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
For three years.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Forever.

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ando.

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Please don't come.

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The End

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How was the interview?

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It didn't go well this time.

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I got 10 questions, but it didn't go well.

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It seems that you're looking for quick strategy.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It seems that you have a blank in your extracurricular work.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Is that so?

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll definitely find a hospital that fits Moriya.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's not give up and do our best.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Excuse me.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The other day.

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Thank you for teaching me a lot the other day.

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thanks to you, I was able to get a job.

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Really?

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
How is the director?

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It didn't work out at all.

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If you don't mind, would you like to use my house?

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Doctor Connection?

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll work there next time.

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I have something to consult.

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm serious.

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Everyone is involved in the agent.

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Is that so?

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Everyone.

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes.

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm the representative, NARUKI.

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm Moriya. Thank you.

237
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But it's the first time.

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The job seeker who brought an agent from another company to the interview.

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Excuse me.

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you have a sense of self-awareness, you should be able to resist.

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
DOKU.

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He's a road-taker.

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't make me say it again and again.

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Mr. Ishigami has been working hard, so I thought it would be bad to talk to him without a reason.

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But you two already knew each other.

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Moriya is a very honest and righteous person.

247
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's a hassle to be so tough.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Mr. Mareki.

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I hope you don't get hurt by your rude attitude.

250
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And I'll be a colleague so that you don't get guided away from the truth.

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So you're a good guide.

252
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Of course.

253
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then you should tell me properly.

254
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What?

255
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think you should see the reality a little.

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The circulation is not good, but the pressure is effective.

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Nevertheless, the job seeker is not decided because there is a blank.

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Your hope is not in your hands.

259
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What?

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
High level.

261
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The best.

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Where is the reason for choosing a top-class hospital with a great performance and a low level of skills like you?

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's too sudden.

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Moriya.

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's okay.

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You were taking care of me so that I wouldn't get depressed.

267
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't go back.

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sure you'll be fine.

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Haruki.

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What do you want to be in the first place?

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What do you want to achieve with your next job?

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I just don't want to worry about the surroundings.

273
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a straight thing.

274
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So you're the second-class.

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Stop it!

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Please calm down.

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm sorry that Doutoku doesn't understand what he needs.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm just guiding him instead of him.

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What do you need?

280
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Just telling him the answer and making a round of it won't make you feel bad.

281
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I was once guided by the chairman's teacher, Moriya.

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Mr. Naruki is the chairman's teacher.

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is that so?

285
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Your mother is probably trying to make you aware of something.

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If she doesn't, she won't let you go to the hospital.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I remember well what kind of person your mother was.

288
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What kind of influence she had on you.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've been guiding my son.

290
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Just like I was guided by the old teacher.

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You were a good doctor.

292
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You were a good doctor.

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You were a bad doctor, but you were popular with your children.

294
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But you quit.

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll take responsibility for your support.

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm the chief of the expansion near-death hospital, So-kun Ando.

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm considering a home-based tele-surgery using STIFT.

298
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't know when the donor will be available.

299
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
While I'm doing this, So-kun's heart is getting weaker.

300
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But there are no actual examples of STIFT's surgery.

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The adult patients have already had sufficient tests.

302
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Safety is also guaranteed.

303
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We should aim for the next stage.

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Since the body is small, the difficulty of the surgery will increase.

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's why you didn't do anything.

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We can't take any steps without a challenge.

307
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Shouldn't we cut through the future?

308
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What do you think, Professor Amino?

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There are no actual examples, but in theory, there are many benefits than the traditional home-based tele-surgery.

310
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I think it's a meaningful challenge with future-oriented.

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Doctor.

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
How was it?

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The use of STIFT for the patient should be judged more carefully.

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is that so?

315
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We will improve the heart transplant of So-kun by doing the traditional home-based tele-surgery.

316
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I pray for success.

317
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There are only a few heart transplant surgeries in Japan.

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The reputation of the doctor will be improved.

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes.

320
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry for not calling you.

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
No, I'll try to find another chance.

322
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Professor Amino.

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So-kun.

325
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You became friends with Marin?

326
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes, I was taught.

327
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You are the same age as Marin.

328
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes.

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's good.

330
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He really came.

332
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The second generation is worried about the task and will come to our house today.

333
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I was told by Mr. Naruki to listen to the story.

334
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Please.

335
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I can answer immediately what kind of person my mother was.

336
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's perfect.

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm completely opposite to myself.

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I passed the medical school in the current period and also experienced overseas study.

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The instructions are always correct and strict, but everyone respected me.

340
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I was a senior in the third grade.

341
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I finally entered the third grade of the series.

342
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I was not good at handling the situation.

343
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I was afraid of being disappointed in my mother.

344
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I was in another hospital.

345
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But you became a midwife because of your mother.

346
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The most important reason is that I wanted to change my inner self.

347
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What is the image of a midwife?

348
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I feel proud and great.

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You are honest.

350
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I am often told.

351
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think it's a sign of confidence that you are the best in the inner medicine field.

352
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I wanted to be strong like that.

353
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I was in the previous hospital.

354
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I was in the hospital.

355
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't be stupid.

356
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't need a spoiled child like you.

359
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The number of people who came to me from that day was very low.

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
My mother collapsed.

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I was in the hospital because I didn't have a place to go.

362
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But I destroyed my mother's hospital.

363
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I've been betraying the people around me.

364
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Kurama is with Steve.

365
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But Director Tendo didn't allow it.

366
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Even if it's the same thing, you have to be calm.

367
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I think I just avoided hurting the name of the extreme.

368
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Not for the sake of the patient.

369
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We are being watched by the director who hates such risks.

370
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Don't be too much.

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll contact you again.

372
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Sayori's mother goes to the Aisaki Hospital every day.

373
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
She keeps wiping her daughter's body.

374
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The weather is nice today.

375
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Are you cold?

376
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It will end soon.

377
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Next week is your 22nd birthday.

378
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What present do you want?

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I wonder what I'm happy about.

380
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I knew you would come.

381
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
After that operation, their time has stopped.

382
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Do you know that Dr. Kuramosu suggested to the director to use Steve for the surgery?

383
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes.

384
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He wanted to be the first successful person.

385
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But in the end, Director Tendo didn't allow it.

386
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You know what this means, right?

387
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Dr. Kuramosu is trying to use Steve.

388
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Ando, you've been worried all this time.

389
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You're worried about whether you can really leave your son's life to him.

390
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If you let him in, he can't do anything.

391
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No matter how terrible it is,

392
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
he can't ask for your help.

393
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Please don't regret it.

394
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

395
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry.

396
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If you don't understand me,

400
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
please don't leave.

401
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The End

404
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The End

405
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's so comfortable without that monster.

406
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You'll get scolded for calling me out in secret.

407
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's not something I know.

408
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So?

409
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What's the answer?

410
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't think my mother is trying to make me feel anything.

411
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
When I told her I was going to quit the medical school,

412
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
or that I was going to transfer to another hospital,

413
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
she just told me to say something to make me feel better.

414
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
She told me to live the way I want to.

415
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I've never been interested in my mother.

416
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Think harder.

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Or you'll be a complete loser.

418
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't understand her.

419
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Her thoughts.

420
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And what she wants to do.

421
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I was in the bathroom.

423
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Is this because of your mother?

424
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let me give you a hand.

426
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Thank you.

427
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You're worried about me?

428
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Why?

429
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I used to tell you that you can rest your mind

430
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
when you see the animals that are free.

431
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Your mother is not a perfect person.

432
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
She has been going through a lot of pain.

433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You think you're the opposite of your mother.

434
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But you may have the same foundation.

435
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's not the same.

436
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The staff told me that I'm not like my mother.

437
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You're the one who's telling me that.

438
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You're not the one who's right for what you do.

439
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
That's a false word.

440
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's what your mother wanted to tell you.

441
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You're a perfect person.

442
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Perfect person?

443
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You're trying to show your true abilities.

444
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That's what I'm capable of.

445
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Exactly.

446
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You're not perfect.

447
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
What a nice person.

448
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's my job to think about your career together.

449
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Let's go to the hospital where I'll meet you.

450
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Is this really the place?

451
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes.

452
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It looks like a very nice hospital.

453
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
This place used to be a very successful hospital.

454
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I understand why this hospital survived.

455
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Because I understood the country's will.

456
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The country's will?

457
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The tea is not bad.

458
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The ice cream is good.

459
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So what's the country's will?

460
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yonaga.

461
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Until a few years ago, this hospital was run by the local care unit.

462
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But as you know, the country's medical costs have changed every two years.

463
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The medical costs have been greatly reduced and the country has suffered a major blow.

464
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I was the same.

465
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So we took a measure here.

466
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We changed the function of the hospital.

467
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Changed function?

468
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Specifically, we switched to the rehabilitation hospital that aims to recover function in intensive rehab.

469
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Because the country is at the crossroads of the next money.

470
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And this is the result.

471
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Such a decision.

472
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Of course it's not easy.

473
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But if you have this kind of resilience, it's also a right to live without leaving the hospital.

474
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Then why is this place right for me?

475
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I asked the staff of the New Japan Association about the teacher.

476
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What is that compass?

477
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Worst.

478
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I don't think there's a good doctor for a good old single person.

479
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What about the director?

480
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I can't rely on it.

481
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But it's kind and serious.

482
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Well, sometimes I think it's a good thing.

483
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
When I was studying medical score, I was studying all the changes.

484
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What went up and what went down.

485
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Is that amazing?

486
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's a lot.

487
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
When I said I was great, I wanted to know the price of the medical supplies we provide.

488
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It was cool at that time.

489
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I said I couldn't meet the expectations of others before.

490
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
There are some things that have been evaluated.

491
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
There are many medical expenses that are not consistent.

492
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You have a good sense of economy.

493
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So why don't you study business here?

494
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That's what I and Dr. Moriya think.

495
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's your aptitude.

496
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Even if I do that, my hospital won't come back.

497
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I just regret that I should have been there at that time.

498
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I can't stand that.

499
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You don't know anything.

500
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The hospital is a big company.

501
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I don't know anything.

502
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I can buy back the hospital.

503
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Rather, it is a premise to sell again.

504
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What do you mean?

505
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Your mother sold the hospital to the fund.

506
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Fund?

507
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Fund is a company that invests.

508
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It builds a hospital with a good income and sells it again to make profit.

509
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There was a choice to sell to medical law.

510
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Your mother took a method that could help your son to get back into the hospital business.

511
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Because you were looking through the situation as an administrator.

512
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But I failed once.

513
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If you are an office worker or an owner who can concentrate on management,

514
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I think you will be exhausted.

515
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I never said that your mother should live as you like.

517
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't just want to follow my own back.

518
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I want you to do what you want.

519
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I want you to do what you are good at.

520
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
By the way, I think it will take about five years to get back to the hospital.

521
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's like your mother is giving her son time to learn.

522
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
For that, I have to get a patient from this hospital.

523
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
No problem.

524
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I can do it.

525
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'll talk to my mother.

526
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We are both clumsy parents. We should be careful.

527
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Mom, I'm going to quit being a doctor and concentrate on management.

529
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I want to get a good brain in five years and buy this place again.

530
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's good, isn't it?

531
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Live as you like.

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Thank you.

533
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What's wrong?

535
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm sure he's been pulled out by NARUKI again.

536
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The president is also in trouble.

537
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I checked the income of the hospital.

538
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's a good thing that you're a regular employee.

539
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'll take that.

540
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
What's the special reward for this time?

541
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm tired of cleaning.

542
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm tired.

543
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
How about this?

544
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'll take it.

545
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'll put it in the kitchen.

546
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Please tell me the truth.

547
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
NARUKI told the president's mother to sell the band.

548
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Did you have any plans to approach your mother?

549
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I told you not to come.

551
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Professor Eric Spencer of the Crestmont University Hospital in America will take care of the surgery.

552
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What?

553
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I have a request instead of leaving the job of a fan and son to you.

554
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You used to study at Crestmont University Hospital, right?

555
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yes.

556
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I want you to introduce Professor Eric Spencer, the world-renowned surgeon of heart transplantation.

557
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
How many billion do you think it will cost?

558
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
There is no burden on Mr. Ando by being a monitor for the creation of the thesis.

559
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm sorry.

560
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Besides, you've been trying to keep it from happening, haven't you?

561
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
If you're going to take the donor's medical expenses into account, it means that the patient who received the surgery will be turned into a ghost.

562
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The donor may disappear without appearing.

563
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If that happens, you will have to bear the burden of a cross for the rest of your life.

564
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You don't have to suffer anymore.

565
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You should have been attacking yourself.

566
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
However, I think that the fact that the general was the same heart disease as Mr. Osaka was a punishment.

567
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's not your fault.

568
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
However, you can't get real happiness from someone's sacrifice.

569
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You and Mr. Sōkun should choose a path to live with a strong heart.

570
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm the one who made Mr. Osaka look like that.

572
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You want to save your son, don't you?

573
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Because I'm an elementary school student next year.

574
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You and Mr. Sōkun should choose a path to live with a strong heart.

575
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Read this.

576
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It's beautiful.

577
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Rainbow-colored fish.

578
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Sō.

579
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Mom.

580
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Are you Mr. Sōkun's mother?

581
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Yes.

582
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm the mother of Asomari who is hospitalized with the same disease.

583
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Recently, I've been getting along with Mr. Sōkun.

584
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Well, what kind of match is Mr. Sōkun's heart?

585
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
What do you think?

586
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Well, Mr. Sōkun said something like that.

587
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Mr. Asomari too?

588
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I've been waiting for more than three years.

589
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But I decided to spend time with my daughter with a smile.

590
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm glad.

591
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Thanks to Mr. Sōkun, I had a lot of fun.

592
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But...

593
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Aren't you worried?

594
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That's...

595
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But...

596
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm sure it'll help.

597
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
No, I'm sure.

598
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Let's do our best.

599
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
How was it?

600
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I want to go to the sea too.

601
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Marima, let's swim together when you get better.

602
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah.

603
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Where do you want to go?

604
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I want to go to the sea too.

605
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Marima, let's swim together when you get better.

606
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah.

607
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Marima, let's swim together when you get better.

608
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yes.

609
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I understand.

610
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm sorry for everything.

611
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Mari, say hello.

612
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Let's go to the sea. It's a promise.

613
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yeah.

614
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The next fake show

615
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The lies and the truth are all in your taste

616
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Mr. Sōkun Ando transferred to Crestmont University Hospital.

617
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I wonder why it went so smoothly.

618
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Mr. Yorioka, do you know anything?

619
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
No, I don't.

620
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I understand.

621
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Thank you.

622
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Mr. Naruki, thank you.

623
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You too.

624
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The end of the world

625
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'll do my best.

626
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Was it really okay?

627
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah.

628
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I finally understood.

629
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I was going to do a topar technique using Mr. Kura's stiff.

630
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I would like to recommend topar technique to you.

631
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
This is the pamphlet.

632
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Stift?

633
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It's a new home-tel technique that can be used remotely.

634
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But that means it's still a long way from history.

635
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But there are several home-tel techniques that can be used remotely.

636
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
You can use them for emergency or emergency hospitalization.

637
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You don't need to do any more surgery.

638
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Is that so?

639
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Compared to the traditional home-tel technique, it's less burdensome.

640
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And the scar is minimal.

641
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The scar?

642
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Considering your life after retirement, you should have a bigger scar on your chest.

643
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Isn't this better?

644
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
At the press conference, the hospital did not fulfill the base of topar technique with the monitoring after the anesthesia.

645
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So Mr. Naruki explained that he had done a surgery to open the chest.

646
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yes.

647
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
That's not true.

648
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yes.

649
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Monitoring is normal, and as planned, Mr. Kura performed topar technique.

650
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
He performed the surgery.

651
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The blood pressure is low.

652
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,520
I'll put in some

653
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'll do the hyaluronic acid first and then do the blood transfusion.

654
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Take all the blood and the blood pressure test in 10 units.

655
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yes.

656
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'll take all the blood.

657
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Dr. Kurama, there is a high possibility of bleeding.

658
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You should open the chest and do the blood transfusion.

659
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Prepare the artificial blood vessels.

660
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Doctor.

661
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yes.

662
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The damage is not big.

663
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It is best to transfer the artificial blood flow to the stithes while bleeding.

664
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It is 60 units even if you open it fully.

665
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
After all, it is better to open and blood transfusion.

666
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Dr. Naruki.

667
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Please set the artificial blood vessels to the stithes.

668
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'll do the hyaluronic acid first.

669
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'll do the hyaluronic acid first.

670
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'll do the hyaluronic acid first.

671
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'll do the hyaluronic acid first.

672
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'll do the hyaluronic acid first.

673
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'll do the hyaluronic acid first.

674
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Blood pressure 50 units.

675
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Dr. Kurama, let's do the blood transfusion.

676
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't need it.

677
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
What are you saying?

678
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Obviously, you are an emergency.

679
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'll continue.

680
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The artificial blood vessel transfusion is possible.

681
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
If you continue like this, your life will be in danger.

682
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Dr. Naruki.

683
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I'll open it and transfer it to the stithes.

684
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yes.

685
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Prepare the opening set.

686
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Yes.

687
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'll open it and transfer it to the stithes.

688
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'll open it.

689
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Dr. Kurama, please stand up.

690
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Dr. Kurama.

691
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I'll transfer it to the stithes.

692
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yes.

693
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'll transfer it to the stithes.

694
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yes.

695
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'll transfer it to the stithes.

696
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Yes.

697
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'll transfer it to the stithes.

698
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yes.

699
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
This is it.

700
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
The Hali-640 Pro-0.

701
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yes.

702
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't know the answer.

703
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Raise the volume.

704
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It's VF.

705
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Bring the PC.

706
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yes.

707
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'll walk on the adrenaline.

708
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I was ordered to follow the record of the nurse's record from Dr. Kuramochi.

709
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I will definitely pay this.

710
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You don't need to.

711
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I will not regret this.

712
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I will not regret this.

713
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I will not regret this.

714
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I will not regret this.

715
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
The war is far away from the end.

716
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So, please let me be free of any involvement.

717
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I understand.

718
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I ran away.

719
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I tried to do what I couldn't do.

720
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I tried to be comfortable.

721
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Mr. Naruki.

722
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I've been quiet all this time.

724
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm really sorry.

725
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's rather cheap shopping.

726
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:27,000
If you know the truth, you will be rewarded.

727
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I need evidence to prove my innocence.

728
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I can't forgive your father.

729
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Mr. Naruki was his punishment.

730
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I can't do what I want to do.

731
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I've been trying to do it.

732
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I've been feeling the hell.

733
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm not the one to fight.

734
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'll do something.

735
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm the one to order you.

736
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Rie!
