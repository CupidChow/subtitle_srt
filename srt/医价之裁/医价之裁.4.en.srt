1
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,720
[chuckles] Okay.

2
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,000
Did we make it?

3
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,800
Definitely Earth. [sniffs]

4
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,280
Definitely London.

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
Yeah, got that. But definitely when?

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,840
I am working it out, Bel.

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,680
Look, look, I have found 50p.

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,520
-We are winning! [chuckles]
-Can you try and focus, please?

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,080
We need to get home.

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,360
Oh, hello.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
What is your name?

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
Conrad.

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,480
Conrad, I am the Doctor.
And this is Belinda Chandra. [chuckles]

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,320
Um, weird question, what year is this?

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,560
Please say it's 2025.

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,280
2024?

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,600
Does the year start with a 20?

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,320
It's 2007.

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,560
[device beeps, dings]

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, New Year's.

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,440
Oh, I love it.

22
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,280
All those hopes and possibilities, huh?

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,400
Conrad, I think this is meant for you.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,560
Why?

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,040
'Cause it is your lucky day! [chuckles]

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,720
Hey, where are your parents?

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,960
Mum's watching the fireworks.

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,080
[Belinda] Should we get you to...

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Or not.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Happy New Year.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,600
Mum! Mum! Mum! Come and see.

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,040
There's a box, a blue box
that came out of nowhere,

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,720
with a doctor and a Belinda Chandra.

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,360
How many times, Conrad?
Enough with the lies.

35
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,960
It's not a lie. Look.

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
You're spoiling my night.

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,160
[Conrad] <i>I was eight years old
when I first saw that police box,</i>

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,920
<i>and I've followed stories
of that box ever since.</i>

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
<i>Interviewed eyewitnesses
right across the globe.</i>

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,720
But this week, I've found someone
who knows its secrets.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
In fact, she's even been inside it.

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,480
And I'm gonna ask her
to introduce herself.

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,880
Hello, everyone. My name is Ruby Sunday.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720
[♪ theme song playing]

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,960
[Conrad] <i>2007 was the first time
I saw that blue box.</i>

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,680
<i>But fast forward 17 years and
it happened again, last year.</i>

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,680
<i>Only this time...</i>

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,840
[creature roaring]

49
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,880
<i>...things got crazier.</i>

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,800
[sizzling]

51
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,120

[sniffs]

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,440
[snarling]

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,360
-[pants]
-[Ruby] Where's the Shreek?

62
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,000
[Doctor] Zapped it back into its hive.

63
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,360
-Man, that was lucky.
-No, disgusting is what it was.

64
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,640
Please, please, tell me
I wasn't just peed on.

65
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,120
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

66
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
Don't worry. It's, uh...
It's more like vomit.

67
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,240
The pheromone gets absorbed
into your blood

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,800
-and marks you as future prey.
-[gasps] Wait, what?

69
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,560
-Cool, right?
-Mmm.

70
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,080
But this neutralises the pheromone.

71
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,040
-[Ruby] Oh. Do I drink it? [chuckles]
-[Doctor] Tastes like candy floss.

72
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,080
-[gags, coughs]
-[laughs]

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,120
[Ruby] You are such a liar. [groans]

74
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,000
But at least you can't get tracked
by the Shreek anymore.

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,640
[Ruby] Yeah, but anyone else
can track me. This green stuff stinks.

76
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,120
[Doctor] You are reeking.
You are Shreeking!

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,440
[Ruby laughs]

78
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
[gasps]

79
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,880
[laughs, groans]

80
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,160
-Don't look.
-Oh, babes, take a lie down.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,640
That antidote is gonna knock you out
for about eight hours.

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,880
Yeah, I could do with a rest
'cause life with you is mad.

83
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
Half an hour ago
we were hanging out with The Beatles.

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
-I know, right? [laughs]
-Oh, I miss them.

85
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,680
[phone camera clicks]

86
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Hello?

87
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,160
Oh, and John Lennon
owes me a piano lesson.

88
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,040
[TARDIS warbles]

89
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,680
[Conrad] <i>And I've been looking for you
ever since, for a whole year.</i>

90
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,520
<i>So, the last thing I expected was
to land you on my podcast this morning.</i>

91
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,400
<i>I have so many questions.</i>

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,080
Well, I'm 20 years old.
I'm from Manchester.

93
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,200
<i>I live in London with my mum and gran.</i>

94
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,440
<i>And I've got another mum now, Louise,
but that's a long story.</i>

95
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,600
<i>And also a new dad,
but that's an even longer one.</i>

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,240
<i>Christmas just gone,
that was mad. That was a lot.</i>

97
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,760
[Conrad] <i>So, how did you end up
in that shop last year,</i>

98
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,960
<i>with this doctor and his police box?</i>

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,880
<i>'Cause I am such a fan.</i>

100
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,480
-[Ruby chuckles]
-I mean, who is he?

101
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,200
Look, I can't go into specifics...

102
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,200
Oh.

103
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,960
...but the Doctor's my best friend.

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
We used to travel together,

105
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,680
and that day in the shop, we were
looking for... [stammers] ...something.

106
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,320
-Yes, aliens... Oh.
-[Ruby] Oh.

107
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,360
-<i>Sorry.</i> [chuckles, stammers]
-[chuckles] <i>No, it's...</i>

108
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,120
[groans] <i>Um, but, uh...</i>

109
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,400
-Yes, uh, aliens, right?
-[Ruby chuckles]

110
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,360
Aliens are real. We all know that.

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,160
But some trolls online say UNIT,

112
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,280
all this talk of monsters is just
a cover story for something else.

113
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,440
[stammers] Well, maybe
they're afraid of the truth.

114
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,240
-[chuckles]
-And there's no reason to be scared.

115
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,800
I mean, the people at UNIT
are amazing, doing good work.

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,040
Keeping us safe.

117
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,880
Like the Doctor?

118
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,880
Like the Doctor.

119
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,360
Been trying to get UNIT
on the podcast for years.

120
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,920
No one ever returns my calls.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,920
Oh, look, it's not you.
They're just busy. [chuckles]

122
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,400
So, do you live around here or...

123
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,080
[stammers] West. Notting Hill.

124
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
'Cause there's a great little café
around the corner

125
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,520
if you have time for a quick one.

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,840
-Oh. [stammers] Now?
-I mean... [stammers] ...coffee obviously,

127
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,520
-or-or tea or just...
-[stammers] Oh.

128
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,160
[chuckles] Coffee sounds great.

129
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
[chuckles]

130
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,320
[alien growls, snarls]

131
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
The teeth on that.

132
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Mm-hmm.

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,640
Shreek live in a pocket dimension

134
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,000
and once a year
they leave the hive to hunt,

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,320
and somehow one of them made it to Earth.

136
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,080
That day I first saw you.

137
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,120
Yeah, but this is the footage
from last night.

138
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,640
So, it came back to the same location
one year later.

139
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,960
Which means, a year ago
it marked its prey.

140
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,480
[Shreek snarls]

141
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,400
And now, it's hunting you.

142
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,040
And if UNIT hadn't captured it,
it'd be here by now.

143
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,960
And then what?

144
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
[Ruby] It'd wait till night.

145
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
First thing you'd notice is the lights.

146
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,880
The Shreek's background radiation
messes with electricity.

147
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,080
Then it'd show itself,

148
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,160
just a glimpse,

149
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,120
just enough to get your heart racing.

150
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,680
It'd have you trapped.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,880
It'd take its time breaking in,
enjoys the hunt.

152
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,880
Feeds off fear.

153
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,520
Wants you scared and running,

154
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,040
pumping with adrenaline.

155
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Why?

156
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,920
Because it likes the taste.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,400
[Shreek snarling]

158
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,400
[bell on door jingles]

159
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,240
[exhales sharply] You tell a good story.

160
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,160
Yeah, well, lucky for you
there's a happy ending.

161
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,880
This is the antidote.

162
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,400
Drink it tonight and it blocks
the Shreek from tracking you.

163
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,760
So, that day I saw you
the Doctor saved your life?

164
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Yeah. Well, he did that a lot.

165
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,120
To be fair, I saved his a few times.

166
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,560
When I was a kid,

167
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
meeting him is what got me
into strange tech and UFOs.

168
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,800
[chuckles] Inspired the podcast.

169
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
Aw.

170
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
Oh, and he gave me this.

171
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,480
I've kept it all these years.

172
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,120
Oh, wow.

173
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,120
He said it was my lucky day.

174
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
I think he was wrong.

175
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,400
I think that's today.

176
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,240
Um... [chuckles]

177
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,640
...take the antidote before bed
because it'll make you sleepy. [chuckles]

178
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,120
On one condition.

179
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,080
-You let me buy you dinner. [chuckles]
-Aw.

180
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,920
-Or we both buy dinner.
-[stammers] I wasn't...

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,320
If that's too old-fashioned, just we...
we, you know... we eat it.

182
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
-Okay, cool. Right.
-Together.

183
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,520
[chuckles] Yeah. Okay.

184
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,040
Ta-ra then.

185
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,120
-Hold on, I promised Louise a photo.
-Why?

186
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,240
Let me be excited.

187
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,640
You haven't had a boyfriend for ages.
Smile.

188
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,360
Okay, just not the... flash.

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,560
Yeah, maybe not. Let's try again.

190
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,520
And he's not my boyfriend,
it's just a date.

191
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
[Carla] Smile.

192
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,280
Yeah, but you're getting on
with your life.

193
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
That's what's important. Moving on.

194
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,520
[Cherry] Conrad Clark.

195
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,840
How unuh spell him name?

196
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
Conrad Clark.
I wonder if him on the Instagram.

197
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,840
Gran, he's nice. And he's normal.
And it's no big deal. Okay?

198
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Clark with no "E". And if you
scroll down, he's got his shirt off.

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,920
-Mum.
-Oh, don't pretend you haven't looked.

200
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
[chuckles]

201
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,760
[exhales sharply] Okay.
I'm gonna be late. Bye.

202
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,960
[Carla chuckles]

203
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,080
[chuckles]

204
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,920
Your gran sounds hilarious.

205
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,360
Oh, my family is mad. [chuckles]

206
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,800
I asked you about yours last week,

207
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,360
and you changed the subject.

208
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,480
Um, it was just me and my mum growing up.

209
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,240
She died. Liver cancer.

210
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,840
I've never really talked about it.

211
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,600
You could talk to me. [chuckles]

212
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,840
Sorry.

213
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,680
No.

214
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm sorry I'm not as cool as the Doctor.

215
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,880
No, no. [stammers] You're nice.
You're lovely. [chuckles]

216
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,680
And that's what I need right now.

217
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,520
Was he your boyfriend?

218
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,080
No. God, no. [chuckles]

219
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,720
If he was here, he'd be flirting with you.

220
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,200
[chuckles] Don't think I'd notice.

221
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,440
[chuckles]

222
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,480
You know, I was eight
when I first saw that police box.

223
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
-The TARDIS.
-TARDIS?

224
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,600
Oh, it's the most incredible thing
you'll ever see in your entire life.

225
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,240
And I've seen incredible things, but
stuff I never really get to talk about,

226
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
so sometimes I feel like
I'm about to explode.

227
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,120
Well, plea-please don't.
I'm-I'm enjoying this. [chuckles]

228
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,440
-[passenger 1 chuckles]
-[passenger 2] Bye.

229
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,400
You know, I've told you things
that I haven't told anyone.

230
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,680
I mean, I've tried. [chuckles]
But my friends all think I'm mad.

231
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,560
[chuckles] Like,
properly having a breakdown.

232
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,840
Well, I don't think that.

233
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,600
I think you're amazing.

234
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,880
Rubes, how many dates is this now?

235
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,760
-[Ruby] I'm not counting.
-[chuckles]

236
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,040
-Five. It's five.
-Is it?

237
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,840
Why are you making such a fuss?

238
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,680
We're just pleased.
We think you need this.

239
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,600
Okay, right. I will see you...
[kisses] ...Monday. [chuckles]

240
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,880
[kisses] Have a lovely weekend,
sweetheart.

241
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,600
Uh-huh. [kisses, chuckles]

242
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,240
And be very careful.

243
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,600
I have been to English villages.

244
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,000
I got looks.

245
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,960
[clicks tongue] I don't think
Conrad's friends are like that, Gran.

246
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,120
She just watched <i>The Wicker Man</i>.

247
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,640
Okay, I can't be doing this right now.
I love you.

248
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,160
-Bye. [chuckles]
-Love you.

249
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,400
Do you know, she's not mentioned
the Doctor in weeks.

250
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Not for weeks.

251
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,040
[chuckles]

252
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,520
[groans] I tell you what,

253
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,000
you'd think I'd never had a relationship,
the way they're carrying on. [chuckles]

254
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,080
What?

255
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,680
You said relationship.

256
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,680
Am I your boyfriend?

257
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,320
Well, let's just see
how this weekend goes. [chuckles]

258
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,680
[chuckles] I'm your boyfriend.

259
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,400
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles]

260
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,080
Come on. We'll miss happy hour.

261
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,920
And I am happy.

262
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,960
[chuckles] Are you now?

263
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,000
[Conrad]
I met Sparky when he rewired my kitchen.

264
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,920
[Jack]
Before he moved to the middle of nowhere.

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,320
[Ruby] Aw, but it's gorgeous. [chuckles]

266
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,840
[friends laughing]

267
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,400
The best thing about this village,
Alfie's home brew.

268
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,760
-Your round, Rubes.
-Oh, no. I'll, um...

269
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,800
-No, no, no. It's fine. I'll get it.
-I'll give you a hand.

270
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,200
Aw, thanks. [chuckles, sighs]

271
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,760
Conrad's been keeping us apart.
Didn't want us to embarrass him?

272
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,120
-[chuckles]
-That means he really likes ya.

273
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,760
-Talks about you all the time. [chuckles]
-Really?

274
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,200
-Tell me everything.
-[chuckles]

275
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,840
Uh, what you having, girls?

276
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,200
Uh, hiya.
Yeah, just the same again, please.

277
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,960
[electricity crackles]

278
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
[groans] Not again.

279
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,480
This happened at the bus stop.

280
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,000
The generator's supposed
to kick in. That's weird.

281
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,320
[chuckles] Uh, I'm just gonna
make a quick call. Okay?

282
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,560
Well, there's no quantum echo
at that location.

283
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,680
Hang on, I'll check the national grid.

284
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,240
Sorry, Kate. I didn't even mean
to bother you. I was after Mel.

285
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,640
Oh, no bother. Always got time for you.

286
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,640
Mel's on her way to Sydney.

287
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,520
<i>There's something strange
happening in the harbour.</i>

288
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,840
Oh, you're on your own?

289
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,920
Yeah.

290
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,040
I like working late.

291
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,160
Have you... [sighs]
...heard from him recently?

292
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,760
The Doctor? No, not for ages.

293
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,400
<i>Okay, there's no faults showing.</i>

294
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,320
Must be a localised issue.

295
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,360
If you're still worried, I can
have a team there in 30 minutes.

296
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,080
No, no. It's okay.

297
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,360
Ruby, we've got the Shreek locked away,

298
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,760
and if your friend took the antidote,
he's fine.

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,160
Do you think, maybe with
everything you've been through...

300
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,360
That I'm paranoid?

301
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,480
That you're on alert all the time.

302
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,920
Trust me, I know what that's like.

303
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,200
[sighs] Yeah.
[chuckles] Maybe you're right.

304
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,360
Try and relax. Enjoy your night.

305
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,920
[Ruby, distorted] <i>Okay. Thanks, Kate.
And sorry again.</i>

306
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,160
Bye.

307
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,520
Just checking you're still with us.

308
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,240
Hello?

309
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,200
[shrieking, growling]

310
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,040
[sighs]

311
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,320
[sighs]

312
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,640
[exhales sharply]

313
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,800
-Hi.
-Everything okay?

314
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,280
Yeah, yeah. All good.

315
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Hey.

316
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,840
Boyfriend, remember?

317
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,160
[sighs]

318
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,000
I think I'm in shock.

319
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,200
Like... [sighs] ...PTSD. [chuckles]

320
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,520
Because what happened last year
was just not normal.

321
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,680
I mean, I fought gods.

322
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,840
-Like, actual gods. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

323
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,560
And I was eaten by a double bass,
and kidnapped by Goblins.

324
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,280
I dangled on a rope ladder above London,

325
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,920
and I watched the world turn to dust.

326
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,440
[sighs] And it's just, like,
every day is like fight or flight,

327
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,280
and I'm just w... waiting
for something to go wrong.

328
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,640
Nothing's going wrong
while I'm here. All right?

329
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Mm-hmm.

330
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,360
-Thanks.
-Okay. [sniffles]

331
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,840
So, tell us about UNIT. All the stuff
you couldn't say on the podcast.

332
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,800
Just leave it, Elsa.

333
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,680
[sighs] Alfie.

334
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,280
[Alfie groans] Sorry.
Don't know what's going on.

335
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,200
[patron] Free drinks till they're back on.

336
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,960
-[patron 2] Yay!
-[Alfie sighs] Not my fault.

337
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,880
-Where Sparky?
-I think he's in the loo.

338
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
I'll, um... I'll check.

339
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,360
Uh... [breathes shakily]

340
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,040
[sighs]

341
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,360
[Audrey screams]

342
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,800
-[pub patrons clamouring]
-What the hell was that?

343
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,960
Lock the door. Lock the door!

344
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,080
There's something out there.
Like the devil himself.

345
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,880
Oh, the teeth.
Biscuit got the fright of his life.

346
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,960
[creature roars]

347
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,960

-[pub patrons clamour]

349
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,120
Oh, my God.

350
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,640
-There's another one.
-[roaring]

351
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,800
-[pub patrons screaming]
-I'll call the police.

352
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,520
-Sparky's not there.
-So, where is he?

353
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,960
I don't know.

354
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,000
Ruby, I didn't take the antidote.

355
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,480
I'm so sorry.

356
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,440
I wanted to be brave like the Doctor.

357
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,920
[chuckles] You have no idea
what you've done.

358
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,280
Look, everything he was, I can be.
I'm not afraid.

359
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,800
You should be.

360
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,960
-[sighs]
-[pub patrons chattering]

361
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,320
-But the Shreek's here.
-[Ruby] <i>Well, then there's more of them.</i>

362
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,520
-<i>They're in the village right now.</i>
-We're on our way.

363
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,840
Divert the nearest ground crew to
Colson Village. We'll take the helicopter.

364
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,520
I need an analyst. Jordan, with me.

365
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,320
Everyone, just stay inside.

366
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
Call your friends, your family and just
tell them to stay indoors, all right?

367
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,680
Sorry, love, who put you in charge?

368
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,000
Or go and get some fresh air, big man.
See what happens.

369
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,720
Sparky's not answering.
What if he was out there?

370
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,160
What if that thing's got him?

371
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,520
Lock the door behind me.

372
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,880
-I'm coming. This is my fault.
-No, they're after you.

373
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,560
Once they're done tearing you to pieces,

374
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,400
the Shreek will wipe out
this entire village.

375
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,520
Just stay here.

376
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,440

[groans, gasps]

378
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,840
Okay. Just me this time.
Talking to myself.

379
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,080
That's very Doctor.

380
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,080
[creature growls]

381

[panting]

382
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,600
Oh, and right about now,
I'd be telling him to shut up.

383
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,880
[exhales heavily] Okay.

384
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,680
[panting]

385
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,560
-Ruby. [gasps]
-[gasps] Sh... [groans]

386
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,280
Get back inside. [breathes heavily]

387
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
No. It's gone wrong, and it's my fault.

388
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,120
I don't want you dealing with this
on your own.

389
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,520
No, no, no. This isn't a game, Conrad.
We're in serious danger.

390
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,720
You are in danger.

391
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,720
Look, we're a team,
like you and the Doctor.

392
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,600
We can fix this.

393
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,280
[sighs]

394
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,200
How do we find Sparky?

395
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,840

[groans]

398
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,280
[Conrad] We're too late.

399
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,920
This is all because of me.

400
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,200
[hissing, growling]

401
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,680
Run! Come on, come on.
Run, run, run, run, run, run!

402
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,240
[soldiers shouting]

403
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,480
Where are they?

404
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,120
I don't know. Their readings are cloaked.

405
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,480
Get those civilians inside.

406
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,320
Kate, there's two of them, at least.

407
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
They've got my friend.

408
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,600
I want the Shreek alive.
We need to understand how they got here.

409
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,440
Quantum ghosting's at zero.
None of this makes sense.

410
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,960
Oh, just give me that.

411
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,440
Eyes on.

412
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,520
Set weapons to stun.

413
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,920
Get behind us. Now!

414
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,680
Prepare to fire.

415
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,520
Wait a minute.

416
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,560
They're not Shreek.

417
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,840
[chuckles]

418
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Got ya.

419
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,400
[roaring, on recording]

420
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,560
You idiots.

421
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,560
How'd we do, boss?

422
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Nailed it.

423
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,280
-Conrad, what's he talking about?
-[chuckles]

424
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,720
Conrad, what are they talking about?

425
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,200
What the hell is going on?

426
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,720
We are Think Tank,

427
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,560
exposing the lies perpetuated by UNIT.

428
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,840
By you.

429
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,480
And we're live-streaming.
So, don't get trigger happy.

430
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
This isn't funny.

431
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,800
[chuckles]

432
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,120
I've had to listen to your stories
for weeks now.

433
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Put up with your insecurity, and vanity,

434
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,320
listen to your tedious piano solos,
and get smothered in lip gloss.

435
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,240
It has been a chore getting to know you.

436
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,360
But now it's all worth it.

437
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,080
<i>Put that phone down.</i>

438
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,960
Or what? Gonna arrest me, yeah?

439
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,120
<i>This is censorship.</i>

440
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,480
Touch us, and we'll sue.
We will bankrupt you.

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560

[Elsa giggles]

443
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,560
You made a very big, very dangerous
mistake tonight, Conrad.

444
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,520
You don't even remember me, do you?

445
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,040
The only monsters out here are UNIT.

446
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,520
Lying to the public, spending our money,

447
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,760
hiding in your tower, and doing what, huh?

448
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,880
-Doing what?
-Protecting people like you.

449
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,720
Oh, they can't stop lying!

450
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,640
There are no Shreek, no Cybermen,

451
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,400
no Sycorax, no Yetis in the underground.

452
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,000
-Hey, look. Look!
-[scoffs]

453
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,520
They're stooges, and actors,
and special effects

454
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,360
paid for using taxpayers' money

455
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,040
to keep us scared,
to hide their real agenda.

456
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,560
The threat to this planet is real.

457
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,080
If you want evidence,
I've got plenty of it, so you could...

458
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,720
This one's collecting benefits,
stealing our taxes while she lies to us.

459
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,960
But the lies stop today.

460
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,280
There are people all over the world
watching this.

461
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,160
Sharing, reposting, demanding the truth.

462
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,040
They're using you. All of you.

463
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,920
For her dirty work.

464
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,120
Do you think UNIT can't handle
a few reject cosplays?

465
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Because that's what you are, Conrad.

466
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,600
You've gifted me this moment, Ruby Sunday.

467
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,320
Is that even your name, by the way?
'Cause it's ridiculous.

468
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,960
-Arrest them.
-All right, let's go. Move them out.

469
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,640
-[protester] Don't touch me!
-[radio chatter]

470
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,320
[protester] They're spying on us
and lying about it.

471
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,680
-[protesters laughing]
-[Elsa] Yeah, go on. Arrest us, cowards.

472
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,440
[protester]
Are you getting this on camera?

473
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,840
See you around, Ruby.

474
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,280
Fascism on the streets of Britain tonight.

An innocent podcaster is in custody

476
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,880

Uh, I mean, who's next? Jonathan Ross?

480
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,720
-[crowd laughs]
-Apparently, that is not a mask.

481
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,080
You took a big risk.

482
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,600
We can see on the video

483
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,280
there are soldiers literally
pointing their guns at you.

484
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,160
That's how they suppress us. With fear.
Meanwhile, they're working against us.

491
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,440

[Trinity Wells]
<i>Conrad Clark has hit a nerve.</i>

495
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,240
He's appealing to the disaffected youth,
and they are listening.

496
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,880
-<i>Guys, they are wasting our taxes...
-Have you seen this?</i>

497
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,040
<i>Conrad Clark takes down the establishment
using a plot twist from</i> Scooby-Doo.

-<i>And machine guns?
-This guy is a legend.</i>

499
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,800
-<i>He's my hero.
-Taking on the army? That's a choice.</i>

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,280
[protester] There she is!

501
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,960
UNIT lies! UNIT spies!

[Wells] <i>People are now questioning</i>

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,520
Eight years ago,
Conrad applied to work here.

506
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,360
Kate even interviewed him.

507
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,120
This is a grudge
dressed up as a youth movement.

508
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,440
No, it's more than that.
It's about power. [sighs]

509
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,920
And this has given him a voice, right?

510
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,080
I mean, he's been craving attention
his whole life,

511
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,360
and his mum practically ignored him
until the day she died.

512
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,520
His mother's not dead.

Moira Clark lives in the south of France.

514

Nice villa. Paid for by Conrad.
Meanwhile, he's raking it in.

516
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,320
He owns three properties,
and of course, he's a tax dodger.

[helipad doors open]

518
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,640
Why is that containment cube outside?

519

transferred to Geneva.

520
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,240
-Our security status has been downgraded.
-Oh, this is getting way out of hand.

521
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,200
I'm glad you're okay.

522
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,240
-How was Whitehall?
-Cabinet only care about their jobs.

523
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,080
If there's enough pressure, they'll fold.
Support a full inventory of UNIT premises.

524
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,800
What if your tech goes public?

525
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,440
[scoffs] Imagine what happens
when a dictator get access

526
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,000
to a time window or a transduction drive.

527
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,280
Our technology would tear the world apart.

528
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,480
[muffled shouting, clamouring]

529
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,080
-Are local agents all safe?
-Everyone accounted for.

530
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,680
How did Conrad get a staff list?

531
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,200
We're working on the assumption
he has someone on the inside.

532
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,720

534
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,360
I've cleared a path to the lift,
but we need to move quick.

535
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,560
The Vlinx is doing a live intercept
on all personnel.

536
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,600
Phone, emails, the works,
looking for any links to Conrad Clark.

Encode the results. This screen only.

539
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,760
We've got a problem.

540
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,960
What are you doing? [stammers]
Stop, we don't need weapons.

541
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,320
[grunting]

542
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,960
That's confirmation.

543
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,280
I need those results.

544
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,920
Results collated. Two subjects identified.

545
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,560
Subject one, Ruby Sunday.

546
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,560
-Yeah, we'll skip that.
-[Vlinx] Subject two, Jordan Lang.

547
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,480
[Shirley] Jordan?

548
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,840
There's layers of bounced VPN,
shadow accounts, false identities.

549
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,880
[Kate] Follows dozens of radical blogs,

subscription to Albion TV,

551
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,080
revisionist podcasts...
It's an echo chamber of disinformation.

552
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,200
[Ruby] Well, where is he now?

553
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,680
Attention, all units,
does anyone have eyes on Jordan Lang?

554
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,960
All units, locate Jordan Lang.

555
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,760
[Ibrahim] <i>All units. All units.</i>

556
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,760
Ground staff report shots fired.
And someone's in the lift.

557
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,800
I need you to authorise a deadlock seal
of this level immediately.

558
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,840
Kate!

559
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,760
How many? Are they armed?

560
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,400
Comms are down,
but scans indicate one male.

561
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,640
-Aged 20-25.
-Yeah, it's Conrad.

562
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,920
-Stop the lift.
-No, wait. Let him come.

563
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,600
-What?
-He might be armed.

564
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,960
That man has single-handedly
undermined everything we work for.

565
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,840
We need to finish this.

566
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,200
-Defensive positions.
-[Shirley] Yes, ma'am.

567
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,480
Hold your fire. Do not shoot.

568
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,760
Wise words.

569
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,920
'Cause the world is watching you
right now.

570
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,440
Drop the gun, Conrad.

571
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,960
That's a lot of weapons
pointing at one man.

572
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm just defending myself.

573
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,880
Drop it. Now.

574
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,040
I don't take orders from traitors.

575
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,760
And that's what you are. All of you.

576
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,120
Conrad, this has to stop.

577
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,560
Go play with your imaginary goblins.
I'm exposing the truth.

578
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,800
You're not, though.

579
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,040
This isn't about a cause,
it's grandstanding and ego.

580
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,080
You're a lying little boy
that can't bear to be called out.

581
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,600
-[gasps]
-Don't you dare point a gun at her.

582
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,480
You were right, Conrad.
I didn't remember you,

583
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,200
so I checked my notes from
that interview eight years ago,

584
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,240
-and do you know what I wrote?
-I'd throw in a compliment.

585
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,240
The three words that summed you up.

586
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,240
"Don't trust him".

587
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,400
Mmm.

588
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,720
God, you think you're so superior...

589
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,800
up in your tower, looking down on us.

590
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,320
Keeping you safe.

591
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,680
I want a confession. On camera.

592
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,280
Admit to the lies.
Show us the monster costumes.

593
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,400
Show us the tech that you're hiding,
that we paid for.

594
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,920
-You're deluded.
-The grown-ups are talking!

596
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,720
Come on, commander-in-chief. Admit.

597
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,000
Or are you a coward like your father was?

598
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,280
You should be very careful
what you say about my father.

599
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,120
His only legacy was a pack of lies.

600
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,040
He was a hundred times the man you are.

601
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,280
And that gun is UNIT issue,
so where's Jordan Lang?

602
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,120
Who?

603
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,120
He's been shot. Ground team
are rushing him to the infirmary.

604
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,600
You shot someone to get in here?

605
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,280
It's nothing to do with me.

606
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,000
A man's life is hanging in the balance,
and you're not even sorry.

607
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,400
Maybe you shot him.

608
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,320
Or he was an actor. Or he never existed.

609
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,800
So, come on. Confess.

610
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,640
All right.

611
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,880
Let's start with your best friend.

Where is the Doctor and his box of tricks?

613

Oh, you're so lucky he's not here.

614
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
She's telling the truth.

615
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,560
And actually, I'm glad he's not here
because he would've stopped me.

616
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,480
Oh. From what?

617
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,480
From showing you and your followers
what we're protecting them from.

618
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,840
The truth, Conrad. As requested.

619
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
What's that?

620
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,200
Conrad, get out. It's hunting you.

621
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
What's in there?

622
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,920
Everyone, stay well back.

how committed are you
to the lies you've told?

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,880

687
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,080
"I stand with UNIT" is a hashtag.
So is "hot Taser lady".

688
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,400
-Did they mean you or me? [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

689
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You okay?

690
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
[breathes shakily]

691
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,560
No, I don't think I am.

692
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,080
'Cause I see it now.
I've just been stuck in limbo...

693
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,280
[chuckles]

694
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,520
...waiting for the Doctor,
the end of the world.

695
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,640
[chuckles]

696
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,880
And I just don't know
how to get any better.

697
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,160
It's like everything I've seen,
the good and the bad...

698
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,720
[sighs] I just need some time
to get my head around it.

699
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,680
Away from everyone.

700
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,560
Somewhere new. On my own.

701
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,720
Of course you do.

702
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,040
And when you're ready,
if you're ready to talk,

703
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
you call me.

704
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Yeah. [inhales sharply]

705
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,400
[chuckles]

706
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,000
You've already got two mums.
What, do you collect them?

707
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,440
[chuckles]

708
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
[sighs]

709
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,000
[breathes deeply]

710
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
[sighs]

711
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,280
[warbling]

712
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,600
[warbling intensifies]

713
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,400
[Doctor] The Shreek is back in its hive.

714
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,160
No need to thank me. [chuckles]

715
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,040
You have to be invited into my TARDIS,
Conrad.

716
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,600
To be special.

717
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,720
But you...

718
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,160
you're special for all the wrong reasons.

719
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,480
You see, I am fighting a battle

720
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,840
on behalf of everyday people
who just wanna get through their day,

721
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,120
and feel safe, and warm, and fed.

722
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,520
And then along comes this noise.

723
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,000
All day long, this relentless noise.

724
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,960
Cowards like you, weaponising lies,

725
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,600
taking people's insecurity and fear,
and making it currency.

726
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,360
You are exhausting.

727
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,400
You stamp on the truth,

728
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,040
choke our bandwidth,
and shred our patience

729
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,480
because the only strategy you have
is to wear us down.

730
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,960
But the thing is, Conrad,

731
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,000
I have energy to burn and
all the time in the universe.

732
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,920
[chuckling]

733
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,880
[sighs] What is this?

734
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,720
An intervention?

735
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,160
Are you here to save my soul?

736
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,840
You betrayed my friend.

737
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,760
You've had plenty of friends.

738
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,360
Have you met Belinda Chandra yet?

739
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,760
Who?

740
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,360
You want spoilers?

741
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,280
I'll tell you your future.

742
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,800
You die in a prison cell,

743
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,840
boiling in anger and poison
until your heart packs in at age 49.

744
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,960
Alone and unloved. Forgotten.

745
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,920
The world carries on.
The world gets better.

746
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,320
You aren't even a footnote.
Just ashes on the wind.

747
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,080
I don't accept your reality, Doctor.

748
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,600
I reject it.

749
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:34,720
So put me back in my prison
and get off my world.

750
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,800
[footsteps approaching]

751
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,400
Did I imagine that?

752
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,800
No, sweetheart.

753
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,920
It's ever so big, innit?

754
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,640
Who are you?

755
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,520
Oh, I'm the Governor...

756
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,480
and it's your lucky day.

757
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,920
[♪ theme song playing]

758
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,880
[Doctor] <i>Lagos, Nigeria.</i>

759
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,880
[leader] <i>I've been expecting you.</i>

760
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,360
Wait. You're all missing.

761
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,360
[leader] <i>It is always hungry.
We must feed it.</i>

762
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,200
-[Doctor] <i>Who are you?</i>
-[leader] <i>This is my domain.</i>

763
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,360
-[Belinda] Doctor!
-What the hell is this?

764
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,240
[♪ theme song continues]
