Violett was in an awful lot of pain,

I'm sorry, but I don't think
his name is up to you.

That's why we found you and saved you.

354
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,600
And that's why the mistress chose you.

355
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,480
The boy who wants the world to be better.

356
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,480
A wish from the heart.

357
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,120
[chuckles] Yeah.

358
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,480
How's the little one?

359
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,680
Oh, uh, you know, same as ever.

360
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,240
Smiling.

361
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,560
[baby coos]

362
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,560
[coos]

363
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,640
-Look at him.
-[coos]

364
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,320
[Conrad] He's so tiny.

365
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,080
But he sustains this entire world.

366
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,240
-And he never cries.
-No.

367
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,680
No, all he does is chuckle.

368
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,160
[chuckles]

369
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,040
He's amazing.

370
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Isn't he?

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,400
He's terrifying.

372
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,760
He's absolutely terrifying.

373
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,720
And we have a temporal fix.

374
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Counting down.

375
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,240
Vindicator now powered up
to 99% and rising.

376
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,080
When you've got time…

377
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,120
You said make him a sandwich.

378
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
Is the trap ready?

379
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,560
Just waiting to be primed, ma'am.

380
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,320
Good, good, good.

381
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,400
Careful, ma'am.

382
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Gets a bit slippy with ice.

383
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,800
Ooh. And ever so cold.

384
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm not a child.

385
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,160
Well, you're my child
in a manner of speaking.

386
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,880
It could be said
that you sprang from my loins.

387
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,920
That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever heard.

388
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,560
How's the Doctor?

389
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,760
Getting there.

390
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,960
Doubts at 30%.

391
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,760
But it's sunset at 20:58,
and that's when his thinking intensifies.

392
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,600
[The Rani] It's a shame
these little people have to die.

393
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,600
I was getting rather fond of them.

394
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,800
But tonight we will find him.

395
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,040
The One Who is Lost.

396
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,800
And then the great work begins.

397
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,720
[Conrad] <i>Many years ago</i>
<i>when Gallifrey was young,</i>

398
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,400
<i>the Doctor and the Time Lady</i>
<i>had been terrible enemies.</i>

399
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,640
<i>They had fought over all sorts</i>
<i>of irrelevant things.</i>

400
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,680
<i>But the Time Lady knew</i>
<i>they could be great friends.</i>

401
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,520
<i>If only Doctor Who knew</i>
<i>how clever she was.</i>

402
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,560
<i>So one day</i>

403
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,440
-<i>she stepped out of the shadows.</i>
-It's weird, innit?

404
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,040
-Like they're there but not there.
-<i>She said, "Doctor Who, remember me?"</i>

405
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
-How is that even possible?
-[Conrad] <i>And he did.</i>

406
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,160
<i>He said her name out loud.</i>

407
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,680
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"We shouldn't be enemies anymore."</i>

408
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,520
-Uh, sorry.
-[Conrad] <i>We're the only ones left.</i>

409
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,800
I don't suppose you could spare us
a couple of quid, could you?

410
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,760
-[Conrad] <i>All the Time Lords are dead…</i>
-No, no.

411
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,680
I shouldn't be talking to you.
This isn't right.

412
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,520
[Conrad speaks indistinctly]

413
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,600
Sorry, but is your name Shirley?

414
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Ruby.

415
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
[chuckles]

416
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,720
[chattering]

417
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,640
This is how we live.

418
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,040
The disabled, the dispossessed,
the ones who don't fit in.

419
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
I swear I've never seen this place before.

420
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,040
Yes, you have. You walk past it every day,
and you ignore us.

421
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,080
But how do I know you,
'cause I swear we've never met.

422
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,240
Can you please just tell me
what the hell is going on?

423
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,560
[Shirley] We get ignored.

424
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,000
We're poor and forgotten and irrelevant,

425
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,800
and that is the way the world is.

426
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,280
Except… sometimes all of us
in the camp get these glimpses.

427
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
It's like a glimpse
in the corner of my eye,

428
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,840
like I can remember something.

429
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Then… it's gone.

430
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,920
-A glimpse of a better world.
-[chuckles]

431
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,680
[Shirley] Yeah,
but you're different from us lot.

432
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,160
Pardon me if I don't frisk you,
but you seem very non-disabled to me.

433
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,800
Oh. [chuckles]

434
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,640
Well, I could be taller, but yeah.

435
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
[all laughing]

436
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,280
Yeah, but despite that,
you're the same as us.

437
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,920
You keep having doubts
about the world, but why?

438
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,040
Um…

439
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,800
Well, there's this man called the Doctor,

440
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,760
and he's connected somehow.

441
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,240
'Cause it feels like
I've lived through this before.

442
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,000
I've seen 2025 and it was different.

443
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,560
And I tried telling my mum
and my gran, and they said…

444
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,920
You can't say things like that.

445
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,840
A foster child can't listen to doubts!

446
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,880
There is something wrong with you,
my girl.

447
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,400
Somebody put guzum upon you.

448
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,600
[Carla] <i>It's my daughter.</i>
<i>She's been expressing doubts.</i>

449
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,360
I think you need to come
and take her away.

450
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,280
My own mother.

451
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,400
[glass shattering]

452
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,840
[sighs] Get her another one, Pete.

453
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
Val says you were lucky.

454
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,640
She says we're all lucky.

455
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,560
We live outside the world,
so we can see it better.

456
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,000
-We can see when things don't make sense…
-Thank you.

457
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,240
…but here we are.

458
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,480
We haven't got a penny,
but I've got this wheelchair.

459
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
State of the art.

460
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,160
And God knows, with my spina bifida
I need medicine, and I've got nothing.

461
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,800
But I'm okay.

462
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,120
Val says we're suspended.

463
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,600
For me, I think these things
are like fossils or relics,

464
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,640
like they're bleeding through
from a life that's been lost.

465
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,960
Brian, tell 'em your theory.

466
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,720
It all comes down to Conrad Clark.

467
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,200
Yeah, well… [chuckles]
I keep having thoughts about him too.

468
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,520
[chuckles]

469
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,840
Ruby Sunday.

470
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,960
I don't trust him for a second.

471
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,280
Oh, my God, you too.

472
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,040
You can get arrested
for saying things like that.

473
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,320
Yeah, well, I don't know why or how.

474
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,120
But Conrad Clark is a monster.

475
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,760
[all cheering]

476
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,800
That's exactly what I say.

477
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,320
Everything that's wrong
revolves around Conrad.

478
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,880
And that man's hiding something.

479
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,080
But what? Can you tell from,
like, the sound of his voice?

480
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,120
Yes, because being blind
gives you magical powers.

481
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,880
-[all laughing]
-All right. [chuckles]

482
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,440
Give me a break. [chuckles]

483
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,840
No, it's obvious.

484
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,200
It's perception bias.

485
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,120
He's not disabled,
so he literally can't see us.

486
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,160
And if he can't see us,
well then we don't get seen.

487
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Yeah, he's like king
and ruler and emperor and god.

488
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,720
I mean, how did Conrad
become god of the earth?

489
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
[sighs]

490
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,680
So what do you think, Ruby?

491
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
About what?

492
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,200
We don't just sit here
all day complaining.

493
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,280
We've got plans.

494
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,840
[sighs]

495
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,720
We're gonna bring down God.

496
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
You with us?

497
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
Oh, I'm in. [chuckles]

498
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,960
I am in. [chuckles]

499
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,240
[sighs]

500
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,280
But the Time Lady had an idea.

501
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,480
She said, it's not over… not over,
because I know a secret hidden away.

502
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,960
<i>And the secret came from the depths</i>
<i>of Time Lord history.</i>

503
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,560
<i>A secret so old and so terrible,</i>
<i>everyone had forgotten,</i>

504
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,400
<i>but the secret was beginning to wake.</i>

505
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,840
<i>And the Doctor said, "Tell me the secret."</i>

506
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,600
<i>But the mysterious Time Lady</i>
<i>was clever and wise,</i>

507
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,320
<i>and she knew that Doctor Who was weak.</i>

508
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,640
<i>Doctor?</i>

509
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,880
<i>Doctor, can you hear me?</i>

510
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
<i>I haven't got much time. They're coming.</i>

511
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,000
And this hell dimension
is sliding into the pit.

512
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,960
I don't know if I'm gonna survive.

513
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,360
Thank you for that, you know.

514
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,040
<i>But I have to warn you,</i>
<i>I can only send you one warning</i>

515
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,280
<i>and this is gonna sound strange,</i>
<i>but listen to me.</i>

516
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,560
<i>Tables don't do that.</i>

517
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,480
Remember, tables don't do that.

518
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,880
<i>I gotta go.</i>

519
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,000
I miss you.

520
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,640
Well,

521
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
more than that,

522
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,240
I love you.

523
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,040
<i>I warn you, Doctor,</i>
<i>this secret will change reality forever.</i>

524
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,800

We are the last Time Lord
and the last Time Lady

701
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,800
from the planet Gallifrey
in the constellation of Kasterborous.

702
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,160
-No, no, no, no, no.
-But this planet is a lie.

703
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,200
This whole world is a wish.

704
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,080
What are you even talking about?

705
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,640
-[panting]
-Oh, darling, darling.

706
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
I know this is hard.

707
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,680
-Come. Come.
-Leave him alone!

708
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,240
But he made so much of this happen.

709
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,200
He stirred the gods, Belinda.

710
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,200
He woke the most ancient of powers.

711
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,560
Come and see.

712
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,960
I can't let you in.
I don't trust you for a single second.

713
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,640
But look.

714
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,600
What?

715
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
[panting]

716
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Conrad?

717
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,160
Doctor.

718
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,600
Why does everyone keep calling me that?

719
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,720
The last time we met,
you told me I was nothing.

720
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
So what do you think of me now?

721
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
[The Rani] It's the child, Doctor.

722
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,640
You woke the Pantheon.

723
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:21,400
And the most powerful god of all was born,
Desidirium, the God of Wishes.

724
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,920
And he's mine.

725
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,880
All the world below
is a world I have wished.

726
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,800
[The Rani] We needed one more thing.

727
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,640
Come on.

728
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,240
No God of Wishes
could have infinite power,

729
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,000
or we'd be drowning
in a universe of breast milk.

730
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:49,360
So, I needed to boost his powers
which led to the Vindicator.

731
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,440
Hidden in plain sight, do you remember?

732
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,200
-No. No.
-Gotta say, great bit of tech.

733
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,160
It criss-crossed the universe,

734
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,280
creating a web of power
to bring you back here.

735
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,760
Look at that.

736
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,760
Voystet-bladen energy
to the power of five,

737
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,040
-roughly the equivalent of…
-A billion supernovas.

738
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,440
There.

739
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,640
He's remembering.

740
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:21,760
So the Vindicator created a web
of titanic power ready for me to use.

741
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,600
Power great enough
to amplify the wishes of a god,

742
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,400
allowing Conrad to create an entire world.

743
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,600
You cannot wish
a whole world into existence.

744
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,480
Exactly.

745
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,440
It's full of mistakes
and it cannot sustain itself

746
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,360
because you have doubts.

747
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,080
Doubts… Doubts are not allowed.

748
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,760
[Belinda] All right, yes, we have doubts.

749
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,920
So what if we do?

750
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,720
Everybody has doubts.

751
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,480
Oh, she's got it.

752
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,360
She's very good.

753
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,080
Because the truth is…

754
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,320
[Mrs Flood]
The doubts are not the problem.

755
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,880
The doubts are the whole point.

756
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,440
Doubt is such a beautiful thing.

757
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,240
If you question hard enough,
then doubt can crack open the world.

758
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,760
-[rumbling]
-On cue!

759
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,320
[gasps]

760
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,040
It shook.

761
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,520
The whole palace shook.

762
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,200
What is happening?

763
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,000
That's why I needed you
trapped inside the wish.

764
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,840
Because this isn't
just exposition, Doctor.

765
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,920
I need to tell you everything
so that your doubt becomes all-consuming.

766
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,240
If ordinary doubt cracks open the world,

767
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,760
then a Time Lord's doubt rips open
the structure of reality itself.

768
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,880
Come and see.

769
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,360
-Quickly. Out we go!
-[panting]

770
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,760
So much fun.

771
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,000
Look at the city.

772
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,960
[gasps]

773
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,800
Farewell to London.

774
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,360
That is not real. It can't be.

775
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,280
That is not… That is not real.

776
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,760
The palace exists
as a fixed point. It's safe.

777
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,200
But you wished this world into existence,
and then you kill it.

778
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,560
Why are you doing this?

779
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,200
Because once reality is broken
on a scale as vast as this,

780
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,920
-I can see underneath.
-See what?

781
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,760
Deep within the Underverse, he is hidden.

782
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,400
The One Who is Lost.

783
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,600
Who?

784
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Oh!

785
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,920
There she blows!

786
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,000
[♪ fast-paced music playing]

787
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,560
[inhales sharply] Tell me. Tell me.

788
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,000
Tell me who you are looking for.

789
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,120
Omega.

790
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Omega.

791
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,280
The first Time Lord.

792
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,080
The creator of the Time Lords.

793
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,840
The greatest
and most terrifying Time Lord of all.

794
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,080
[in ominous voice] <i>Long live Omega.</i>

795
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,680
<i>Omega shall be free!</i>

796

[groaning, panting]

797
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,720
[sighs]

798
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,320
I remember.

799
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,560
I remember.

800
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,960
The Doctor is me.

801
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,720
And the Rani…

802
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,080
[panting]

803
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,920
You can't do this!

804
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,080
I remember! All right?

805
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,400
I am the Doctor!

806
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,080
I am the Doctor!

807
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,600
Oh, my God. Belinda.

808
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,120
Get rid of the wife.

809
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,480
Take her across the threshold.

810
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,800
[Belinda] What are you doing?

811
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,600
Where's John? Where is he?

812
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,920
[laughs] There is no John.

813
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,800
You married a ghost.

814
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,000
Nice of you to join us, Doctor,
but I remember you too.

815
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:18,120
And I know that you'll try everything
to stop me, so I can't take that risk.

816
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,120
[Doctor gasps]

817
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,880

820
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,960
But don't you understand?

821
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,640
I have a daughter!

822
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,400
Poppy is real!

823
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,800
Don't you know what that means?

824
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,480
