1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The agent who specializes in medical science, Kanenari Naruki.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
But I can do it.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He is the one who is behind the truth of the medical care 3 years ago.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Who is the one who put all the sins on his father and chased him to suicide?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What you can do is to make everything clear.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I have no choice but to follow.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I will not be disbanded.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Finally, I arrived at the true identity of the black curtain.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's you, Professor Amino.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You sacrificed your father for your own good.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
All your sins will be revealed to the white day.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
However, the master of the shadow is facing the fangs.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If Professor Amino becomes the director, everything will be buried in the dark.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He appeared on the front stage.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is it really Professor Amino?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, he was aiming for this opportunity.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What do you mean?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The directorial round of the theater will be held every two years.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Two years ago, Professor Amino lost his position in the field of that opera.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now he finally expressed his true identity.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But why did Professor Amino blame Naruki's father for the same crime?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He thought it would be better to give up the name of the group rather than to admit the failure of Topal Jutsu and lose the relationship with Stifascia.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He also had the confidence that he could take back the reputation that fell.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What is the real reputation?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The number of supporters of Gigi and Amino is increasing, but the Tendo faction is still the best.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Is that so?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The problem is what kind of bullets Amino has prepared in these two years.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to participate in the battle.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I thought this day would come one day.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't think it will be possible for the Tendo leader, but it's a bad start.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Professor Kuramochi's German-speaking was very sudden, but did he have any tricks?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was surprised by the sudden news.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The post I opened was decided by the chairman.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's do our best.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I see. You're doing your best, brother.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm doing my best. It's all thanks to Mr. Naruki.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you're honest, thank you.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You may not know, but he's the one who said the shadow mouth is where the person is not.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why is it?

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I called you.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What do you drink?

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Tiffin.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Tiffin?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's a liqueur made with Dagevin tea.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It has a delicate scent and an elegant sweetness.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There's no such thing.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't help it.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll have a warm tea.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What do you mean?

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I want to give a warning to the two who run a restaurant agency.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
EX Travel?

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I know.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a travel agency that made a great profit from the PCR test in the middle of the corona.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Recently, they've been selling the third woman.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In Japan, they're making money by the pre-earning test, which is said to be a problem.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So they're being targeted by the third woman.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You two are great.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And there's a suspicion of not paying the compensation for the corona measures.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The Ministry of Health has been marking it for a long time.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It looks like they're looking for the head of the Yatoa branch.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I might get a consultation.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Be careful. It looks like the president of Zenigyeba is doing a vicious business.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Our bad reputation is written on social media.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let me say it.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a poor man's jealousy.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But I think it's better to follow the guidelines of the Sanfujinka Association.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's natural to judge the difference between other clinics.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've been making more than 25% profit since I bought the sword.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's not like you're violating the law.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What's wrong with that?

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But...

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Horiguchi.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In the world, what's not on the table is what's not done.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What's the opinion of the Sanfujinka director of Okayama?

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm considering using a talent company.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't ask me for a bad place.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Find someone who can definitely make money.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Even though I'm in my mid-40s, I don't think I can do this job.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
First, let me hear your hope annual salary.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
40 million yen.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's the highest salary among all the employees I've ever had.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't compromise on this.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't mind including a direct on-call.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Then the annual salary will naturally increase.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I see.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are the other conditions?

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I want to contribute to the health care system.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I want to save the pregnant women in the area where the medical care is not enough.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So that's your belief.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's wonderful.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But...

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's impossible for me.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What?

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is it impossible?

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Under the current conditions, there are some cases that are close to hope.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The rest is up to you.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm Dr. Connection's Yonaga.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm the mayor's Mochizuki.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know if I can understand this.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Is this right?

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm Mr. Mito.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm Mito. Nice to meet you.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There's no maternity leave in Kino-Urashimi.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's right.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Anyway, it's a place like this.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Everyone has to go to a hospital outside the city.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:44,020
On the other hand, the

109
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,020
medical care system is...

110
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,020
Yes, I'm trying my best.

111
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,020
I think the annual salary is 35 million yen.

112
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
Please help me.

113
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
I think it's a great condition.

114
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
How about you, Mr. Mito?

115
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
I can't get a call.

116
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
It's evidence that I'm not convinced of the annual salary.

117
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,020
Why are you so particular about 40 million yen?

118
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,020
The local population is changing and it's hard.

119
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,020
If you go to a hospital far away, it will cost more.

120
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,020
I think pregnant women are very anxious and lonely.

121
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,020
So I was hoping that doctors like Dr. Mito would increase more.

122
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
Everyone has a priority.

123
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,020
Death case?

124
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
That's right, Mr. Yonaga.

125
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,020
I want you to go here.

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
What?

127
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,020
I have to check my passport if I'm going abroad.

128
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
No.

129
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,020
It's a mission.

130
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
EX travel.

131
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,020
Starts from the travel industry.

132
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Currently, hospital management is the main business.

133
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,020
It's a hard M&A.

134
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,020
President Hiwakazu Hiro is very full and has a very rich car style.

135
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
It's a car style.

136
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
Found it.

137
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,020
Is this all?

138
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,020
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,020
This is our highest-class plan.

140
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
All transportation is private jet.

141
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,020
Hotel is only suite.

142
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Tourist area is a VIP taiga with a discount.

143
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,020
Three meals are three stars.

144
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,020
The president said.

145
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,020
It's difficult to make a reservation now.

146
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,020
I see.

147
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,020
There are things that can't be solved with money.

148
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
I have money.

149
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
You're a good customer.

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Who are you?

151
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
President.

152
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,020
I said I was running a medical agency.

153
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,020
Dr. Connection.

154
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,020
My name is Golden Jun.

155
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
I was invited to a tour of the Chinese prefectural government.

156
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
I'm from the north.

157
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,020
I'm glad you know the value.

158
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,020
I can't believe I can taste such a high-quality tea.

159
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
I don't believe in rumors.

160
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
What kind of rumors?

161
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,020
Very capable.

162
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,020
Sometimes the gray method doesn't work.

163
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,020
Instead, the goal will definitely be achieved.

164
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,020
Great.

165
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,020
I want you to introduce the will to become the president in the Sanfujinko of Okuyama.

166
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
The amount of introduction is.

167
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
How much is this?

168
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
10 million.

169
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
10 million?

170
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,020
There is one person who is a bit specific.

171
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,020
But the demand is high.

172
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,020
How much?

173
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,020
40 million yen per year.

174
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,020
I don't hate greedy people.

175
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,020
Then I will proceed with the story.

176
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Yonaga.

177
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
Yes.

178
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,020
I wonder if he can accept this condition.

179
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:50,020
What I'm looking for is a doctor who can sell his soul for money.

180
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm Mito.

181
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,020
Nice to meet you.

182
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,020
Nice to meet you.

183
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
I'm Hiwa.

184
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Nice to meet you.

185
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
Please.

186
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
I'll start right away.

187
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,020
Do you know what this condition is?

188
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
Yes.

189
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,020
Never turn to the president's proposal?

190
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,020
Yes.

191
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,020
You just said something, Yonaga.

192
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,020
I think it's too much of a proposal.

193
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,020
There is a black hole in the ex travel.

194
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,020
The president's prayer for the money-making system is not easy.

195
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,020
Certainly, the condition is clear.

196
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,020
Honestly, I don't think that Mito's ideal medical treatment can be realized.

197
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,020
I want you to be true to your faith.

198
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,020
Mito has a strong feeling for hectic medical treatment.

199
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
I agree.

200
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:57,020
As a medical professional, I will take over as a management professional.

201
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:04,020
If you follow the rules, I promise you the best treatment.

202
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
What do you think?

203
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,020
Please.

204
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
I'm back.

205
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,020
You look like you chose President Hiwa.

206
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,020
He was a rich man after all.

207
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,020
You like money, too.

208
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,020
But I said I wanted to save the local pregnant woman.

209
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,020
I sold my soul to the money as the president requested.

210
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,020
It's not a bad story.

211
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,020
We make more money than the higher annual salary.

212
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,020
Amino will also be elected medical director.

213
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,020
Medical director?

214
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,020
The top of the medical department of the University of Tokyo.

215
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,020
And you're working on the back.

216
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,020
Of course.

217
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,020
I saw the other day when the medical director came out of Amino's room.

218
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
I brought a souvenir.

219
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,020
Money.

220
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:17,020
If Amino is to work as medical director and hospital director, it will be a terrible thing.

221
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,020
What do you mean?

222
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:25,020
These two posts are both eyeing each other with the management of the medical department of the University of Tokyo.

223
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,020
So I couldn't move without permission.

224
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,020
But if Amino gets both powers...

225
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,020
It's the beginning of dictatorship.

226
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,020
You'll be beaten by both Stefasha and your father.

227
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,020
No way.

228
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,020
I'll be kicked out, too.

229
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,020
Because I'm your friend.

230
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,020
I have to stop it.

231
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,020
I'll look for information that will be beneficial to the director.

232
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,020
Yeah.

233
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:09,020
I've been working hard to change the extreme system before the sphere.

234
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:15,020
I've been doing a lot of reform, but I haven't reached the goal yet.

235
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,020
If you can help me, please follow me.

236
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,020
I heard about Amino.

237
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,020
This hospital has been changing since the director's order.

238
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:47,020
But if Amino gets it, we can't expect a good management.

239
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,020
He's related to Stefasha.

240
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:57,020
We're investigating the cleaning company that has Stefasha's share.

241
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:06,020
Professor Amino is one of the victims, so he might be the hidden culprit of his corruption.

242
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,020
When did you notice?

243
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,020
I first thought of Stefasha and Professor Kuramochi.

244
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,020
Stefasha's daughter, Hirona, visits Professor Kuramochi many times a month.

245
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,020
Professor Kuramochi doesn't consider other methods.

246
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,020
He only suggests opes using stiffs.

247
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:33,020
I'm sure he's been doing some kind of business with this.

248
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,020
Then why did you punish Kuramochi?

249
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,020
I was trying to find him.

250
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,020
I was looking for a way to get rid of him.

251
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,020
Can you set up a meeting with Stefasha?

252
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,020
Then I asked you about the Opus of Maesan.

253
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,020
I thought Professor Kuramochi might be behind this.

254
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:05,020
The other day, the materials you submitted were very meaningful.

255
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:13,020
But I couldn't get rid of him because he was so good at explaining things.

256
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Director Tendo, can you join me?

257
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,020
If we don't stop him now, we won't be able to get him back.

258
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,020
We have common enemies. We should help him.

259
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
We don't need that.

260
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,020
If we lose here, all of the efforts you've made will be in vain.

261
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:41,020
For the future of Kyokuto, we have to prove Amina's innocence and make her disappear.

262
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:55,020
I have never forgotten the death of Professor Masanari.

263
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:03,020
His passion for medical care, his attitude towards patients,

264
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,020
his unwavering attitude towards patients,

265
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,020
he held a high regard for them.

266
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,020
But before he died...

267
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,020
Please tell me how to proceed.

268
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,020
Thank you.

269
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
Dr. Naruki.

270
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
What is it?

271
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,020
I wanted to be a doctor like you.

272
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,020
A doctor who doesn't make mistakes.

273
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Father would do that?

274
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,020
I couldn't believe what Dr. Naruki said.

275
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,020
I couldn't realize his pain.

276
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:04,020
When you were away from Kyokuto, I couldn't do anything.

277
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,020
I don't want to regret it anymore.

278
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,020
I don't want to see tragedy.

279
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,020
So, please don't get involved anymore.

280
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,020
Then I have one request.

281
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:32,020
Yorioka, the head of the Human Resources Department, is collecting useful information for the re-opening of the Tendo branch.

282
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,020
Can you use that information?

283
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,020
He's a man who has always been a reliable person with the ability to lend me strength.

284
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,020
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,020
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,020
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,020
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,020
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,020
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,020
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,020
I'm sorry.

294
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
Aisaki Hospital?

295
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,020
Dr. Amino said that if it's hard to stay here, we can stay here.

296
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,020
It's hard to stay here?

297
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,020
He said that it was our fault that he committed suicide.

298
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
That's not true.

299
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:44,020
But it's true that we leaked it to the press.

300
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:51,020
The hospital said that the patient's rate is extremely low, and the medical trial will take time and money.

301
00:18:51,020 --> 00:19:00,020
Besides, Aisaki is in a better environment for treatment, and I can take care of her.

302
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:08,020
I'll think about what makes me the happiest.

303
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,020
You're really a dedicated person.

304
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,020
I thought so too.

305
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:37,020
I thought it was a good thing that you transferred her here.

306
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,020
But it's not.

307
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:45,020
I made a family and made her more noisy.

308
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,020
I'll do everything.

309
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,020
I don't recommend it.

310
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:10,020
Dr. Naruki said that he trusted me and had no choice but to comply with the request.

311
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Is that really true?

312
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,020
I think so.

313
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:25,020
I think it's because you had some merit.

314
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,020
You gave your father money?

315
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,020
There are things in the world that are happier than they are.

316
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,020
I don't want to destroy your father.

317
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:49,020
At least I want to be a pure and pure father.

318
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,020
How is it?

319
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
It's a wonderful thesis.

320
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,020
It's from the team of the Montauk Institute of Science and Technology in the United States.

321
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
What is this?

322
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,020
I want you to be the person in charge of this thesis.

323
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Normally, I would be the top of the facility.

324
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,020
I posted it on the Global Medical Insight once.

325
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,020
It was not recognized worldwide because of its low level of knowledge.

326
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,020
So I want to take the title of the director of the Institute of Brain Neurology and increase the credibility of the thesis.

327
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,020
It's connected to the development of brain neurology in Japan.

328
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:46,020
As you know, Global Medical Insight is the world's best academician.

329
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:52,020
That achievement should be a big hit in the directorial round.

330
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,400
Professor Amino is now distributing money to the

331
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,020
affected people and increasing the number of votes.

332
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,020
I understand that the director does not want to involve the victims.

333
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,020
But NARUKI is a dear friend.

334
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:16,020
So I want to help you do what I can.

335
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,020
And I want to protect the extreme.

336
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:28,020
I want you to fight with the right method without using dirty hands like the director.

337
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,020
I hope you can think ahead.

338
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
I understand.

339
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:45,020
But before I sign, I will contact the Montauk Science Center and confirm the legitimacy of the thesis.

340
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,020
Please continue to be the director. I support you.

341
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
I'm a doctor connection.

342
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,020
What's going on?

343
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Hitohanami said she would quit the hospital.

344
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,020
It's still a week since she went to Okayama.

345
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,020
It's still in the middle of the term.

346
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,020
When she gets off, the issue of the sale will be exposed.

347
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,020
Yes.

348
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
You guys stop her.

349
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,020
She's paying a lot of money.

350
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,020
NARUKI.

351
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,020
You guys stop her.

352
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,020
She's paying a lot of money.

353
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
NARUKI.

354
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,020
I'm asking for a ticket to Okayama Station.

355
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
I'm going out.

356
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,020
Let me hear the reason.

357
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,020
Isn't it a personal freedom to quit or not quit?

358
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,020
I'm not going to.

359
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,020
This time it's a business case of a business man.

360
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,020
I got a call from the mayor of Kinourashi.

361
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,020
I'll raise the annual salary to 42 million yen.

362
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
I want you to come to my house.

363
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,020
It's against the rules to contact the client without asking the agent.

364
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,020
I didn't know that.

365
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,020
And you're changing your mind right after you made the contract.

366
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,020
That's why you have so much work.

367
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,020
You're going to tell me a delicious story.

368
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
No.

369
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,020
There's a reason.

370
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:15,020
I'm Mito, the person in charge of the business.

371
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
I'm in charge of the business.

372
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,020
I'm sorry to bother you.

373
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,020
You're not ready for this.

374
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,020
You're not ready for this.

375
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
You're the one who started the business.

376
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,020
You didn't raise the salary, but you did something good.

377
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,020
I understand.

378
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,020
What?

379
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
I don't rely on the teachers.

380
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,020
I do business alone.

381
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,680
All the

382
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,020
inspection, analysis, foreign-bribed, direct, and on-call?

383
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Yes.

384
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Then there's no complaint.

385
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Mr. Okano Mikado, please come to the new office.

386
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,020
Shut up.

387
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,020
You always say that you don't know your face color, so don't put on makeup.

388
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,020
Hey, can you sleep properly?

389
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
That's what I want to know.

390
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,020
Teacher, you're being told off at the end of the day.

391
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
I know that right away.

392
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,020
Worry about yourself rather than others.

393
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,020
I talked to Ayato.

394
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,020
How was it?

395
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,020
After this child is born, he will cooperate with me in various ways.

396
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
I see.

397
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,020
So I decided to go to a nursing school.

398
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:46,020
Only the teacher was on my side all the time, so I want to be on his side too.

399
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,020
If I come to this hospital, I'll be strong.

400
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,020
Thank you.

401
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,020
I'm so embarrassed.

402
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,020
Mr. Sanfujin and Mr. Hei?

403
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
What's going on?

404
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,020
The production is not going well.

405
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,020
But it's still half a year since I started.

406
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
After all, you haven't been able to do it alone.

407
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,020
You didn't come to the on-call, so I called you.

408
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020
I think you really did your best.

409
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,020
But you haven't been resting properly for half a year.

410
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,020
In that state, you have to make medical mistakes.

411
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
I'm fine.

412
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,020
I can't ignore other medical professionals' complaints.

413
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,020
Please understand to make the organization.

414
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,020
This is the only hospital that failed to start.

415
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,020
I moved to other places because I got on the train.

416
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,020
That's why you have so much experience.

417
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,020
Then why are you so particular about junior law?

418
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,020
I recently got back together.

419
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
Would you like to go out?

420
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
How about it?

421
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,020
Would you like to go out for a drink?

422
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Kana-chan.

423
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,020
You still have that.

424
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,020
Of course.

425
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
What about your child?

426
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,020
I'm taking care of my child at home.

427
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,020
I earn money on weekdays.

428
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,020
You earn money?

429
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,020
I'm in debt.

430
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,020
My parents' factory has been in trouble since then.

431
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,020
I quit the nursing school.

432
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,020
What?

433
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,020
I said I'd be on your side.

434
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,020
It's hard to do what you want to do.

435
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,020
Life doesn't go well.

436
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,020
I'll help you.

437
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
What?

438
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,020
Let me help you.

439
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,020
No, I can't do that.

440
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,020
But...

441
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,020
I'm your problem.

442
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,020
Instead,

443
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,020
I want someone like me to give up on their dreams and live in a better world.

444
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,020
Please.

445
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,020
So I decided to start a fund.

446
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:45,020
I wanted to support people who couldn't become nurses or female nurses for financial reasons.

447
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:53,020
It was necessary to continue to support more than 40 million people across the country.

448
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
I'm sorry.

449
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,020
I didn't know that.

450
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:02,020
I'm sorry to have made you all go around.

451
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
No.

452
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
If it comes true,

453
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,020
I'll save a lot of people.

454
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,020
I want to make this dream come true.

455
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
You couldn't stop me?

456
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,020
I'll ban 80% of the total amount of the fee based on the contract.

457
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
Don't mess with me.

458
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,020
If the debt is high, we're in big trouble.

459
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,020
If you don't agree, you can rely on the judicial decision.

460
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
Interesting.

461
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:38,020
I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of team you'll find in court.

462
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
Can I just cancel the trial?

463
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
Leave it.

464
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,020
You used the protection well.

465
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
What do you mean?

466
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,020
You said too much.

467
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:55,020
Why did you pull up the money from the debt yesterday at this time?

468
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
I was asked by Mr. Naruki.

469
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,020
I passed the information to the head of the department yesterday.

470
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
But isn't that illegal?

471
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,020
That's why I used the protection, not you.

472
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,020
It is illegal to re-transfer the person who was transferred by yourself within two years.

473
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,020
This time, I'm calling on Mr. Mochizuki, so I don't agree with the transfer recommendation.

474
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,020
It's out of the way in terms of ethics.

475
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:22,020
By the way, I've already talked to Mr. Mochizuki about the 30% annual fee.

476
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Is it 13 million yen?

477
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
While keeping it to yourself.

478
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,020
What about the lawsuit?

479
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,020
I have no fire.

480
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,020
All of them?

481
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:34,020
It will be completed in the introduction session with a 8 million yen transfer fund that is not a problem for the general fund.

482
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,020
The president of the fire may notice it and sue Mr. Mito next time.

483
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,020
That's what he's after.

484
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,020
I really don't have a plan.

485
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,020
You need a pay cut for the past.

486
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,020
If Naruki is not good, it's Mito.

487
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
It's hard.

488
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
What?

489
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,020
This notice came out from the Sanfujinkai Association.

490
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:08,020
Sanfujinkai doctors who work at the medical institution of the company EX travel are all under the influence of the association.

491
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
What do you mean?

492
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,020
I don't know.

493
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
I'm in trouble.

494
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
How about that theory?

495
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
Naruki.

496
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,020
You pulled a drawstring that you shouldn't have.

497
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
Drawstring?

498
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
It was all Naruki's calculation.

499
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,020
If the president of the fire causes a lawsuit against Mr. Mito, the Sanfujinkai Association will not be silent.

500
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:36,020
He was originally blindfolded and was reprimanded for making a fight with the association.

501
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:42,020
The fact that the Sanfujinkai Association is denied is the same as the actual professional removal process.

502
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:49,020
If you work here, the professional qualification will be reduced and the gap between doctors will already be widened.

503
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
The hospital staff will not miss it.

504
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,020
Thanks to the repeated forced hospital sales, the bottom of the cash will also run out.

505
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,020
Everything that has been accumulated will collapse.

506
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020
It's not the trial anymore.

507
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,020
I don't have a reason.

508
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
EX travel.

509
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:25,020
After the removal process, the problem of the old man's salary is being investigated, and the problem of the old man's salary is becoming more and more obvious.

510
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,020
Also, Mr. Mito contacted me and the fund preparation is going on.

511
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,020
I see.

512
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,020
So, what is the special reward for me this time?

513
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
It took a lot of money, didn't it?

514
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,020
Mr. Naruki said he would show as much effort as possible.

515
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,020
How about this?

516
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,020
I'll have it.

517
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:49,020
Oh, by the way, Mr. Naruki, you realized that the teacher wasn't for money, didn't you?

518
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:55,020
I investigated the Sanfujinkai Association she had worked for, but there was no result except for the middle school.

519
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,020
Now, the Sanfujinkai Association is facing a severe shortage of people.

520
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,020
The crime of will is also a serious problem.

521
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:08,020
Nevertheless, she was the most cruel Heikichi Sanfujinkai.

522
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,020
I can't do it without a sense of duty and justice.

523
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
This is...

524
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
If you knew, please tell me.

525
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
I didn't even think about that.

526
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
Hmm.

527
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,020
I think it's because there was some merit for Mr. Naruki.

528
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,020
What's wrong?

529
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,020
Did my father have a reason?

530
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Father?

531
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,020
Amino has been making a fool of me for giving my father money.

532
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,020
I'm going to investigate.

533
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,020
What?

534
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Did you talk to your father after that surgery?

535
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,020
No, he didn't tell me anything.

536
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,020
I don't think he could say it even if he wanted to.

537
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:15,020
I imagine that there were more things I wanted to tell Mr. Naruki.

538
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,020
I think there was something.

539
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,020
That's what my father is like.

540
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,020
I'm sorry.

541
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,020
Mr. Amino called me right after the surgery.

542
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,020
He wanted me to be the one who was jealous.

543
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,020
I'm sorry, Mr. Naruki.

544
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,020
I want you to be the one who had the surgery.

545
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,020
Huh?

546
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,020
I can't accept the failure of topology.

547
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,020
Are you hiding the truth?

548
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
I'm really sorry.

549
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,020
Please understand.

550
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,020
I can't.

551
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,020
At least you should explain it to your family.

552
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,020
If Kuramochi, the first person, fails,

553
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
Stift and topology will be disbanded.

554
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
But...

555
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,020
If you stand in front of the arrow,

556
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,020
you won't be hurt by that technology.

557
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,020
Is that the right choice?

558
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,020
I want you to protect the future of the medical profession.

559
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,020
Here.

560
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,020
Please stop.

561
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
Please accept it.

562
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,020
I'll give you a warning.

563
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,020
This is a sign of a little bit of justice.

564
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,020
Mr. Naruki.

565
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,020
Please.

566
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,020
Mr. Naruki.

567
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
Please.

568
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,020
But after the press conference,

569
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,020
I found out that Professor Amino was with Stifarsia.

570
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,020
What the hell is going on?

571
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,020
Calm down.

572
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,020
Professor said it was for the development of medical care,

573
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,020
so I became a dirty man.

574
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
That feeling doesn't change.

575
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,020
Don't lie to me.

576
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,020
The most important thing for a professor is

577
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,020
to connect with Stifarsia.

578
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,020
The situation has worsened.

579
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
What?

580
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
What?

581
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
I think you called the police

582
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,020
because you apologized to me at the press conference the other day.

583
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,020
Don't you feel guilty?

584
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
I'm just looking forward.

585
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,020
I'll tell you everything.

586
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,020
You'd better stop.

587
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,020
What do you mean?

588
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,020
Your son,

589
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
Kanenari-kun,

590
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,020
I heard he's a very good doctor.

591
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,020
He must have been impressed by his father's back.

592
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,020
I want you to be the one who will take care of this extreme future.

593
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,020
Are you threatening me?

594
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,020
I don't mean that.

595
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
But as a result,

596
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,020
I will destroy Kanenari-kun's future.

597
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,020
You'd better look ahead.

598
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,020
I don't know who to believe anymore.

599
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,020
I've received the money.

600
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,020
It's a matter of course to pay the debt.

601
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,020
I can't run away anymore.

602
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,020
I can't do anything.

603
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,020
It's hell itself.

604
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,020
I can't even see my son's face properly.

605
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,020
I want my son to go down the right path.

606
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,020
I'm going to make a decision.

607
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Your father was a really good doctor.

608
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,020
He forgot his unworthy responsibility.

609
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
I couldn't protect him.

610
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,020
I want you to be a good father to my son forever.

611
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,020
I want to be a good father to my son forever.

612
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,020
Did you see the article?

613
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,020
Yes.

614
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,020
It seems that the game is going well.

615
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
What do you want to show me?

616
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,020
It's Earl Grey.

617
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,020
As expected.

618
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,020
It's because Charles Grey,

619
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,020
who won the election in the 19th century,

620
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,020
is the fifth.

621
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,020
I think it's perfect for today's Nadeki.

622
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,020
I'm going.

623
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,020
From now on,

624
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,020
the Deku University Hospital will hold the presidential election.

625
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,020
Please vote in the short term.

626
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Mr. Naruki.

627
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,020
It's you again.

628
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,020
Please help me with this in the presidential election.

629
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,020
Before voting,

630
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,020
I would like to tell you something.

631
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,020
Three years ago,

632
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,020
the father of Maesan Dousaka

633
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:23,020
failed to perform the surgery for the opening surgery of Naruki Masanari.

634
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,020
In fact,

635
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,020
it was a failure of Mr. Kuramochi's topology.

636
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,020
And behind it was

637
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,020
Professor Amino.

638
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,020
Professor Amino blamed his father.

639
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,020
Why do you have to do that?

640
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:48,020
Because there is a connection between Professor Amino and Stifasha.

641
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,020
There is a back-up document.

642
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,020
The screen.

643
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,020
The screen.

644
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,020
Is it a victory?

645
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,020
The document is...

646
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
Then,

647
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,020
is it okay if I do it?

648
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,020
This is the paper that President Pendou was responsible for

649
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,020
and posted on the Global Medical Insight the other day.

650
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:44,020
When it was confirmed to the US Montauk Science Center,

651
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,020
it was confirmed that such research results had not been released.

652
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,020
Please wait.

653
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,020
I confirmed it to the head of the facility myself

654
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,020
and received the explanation of the direct research results.

655
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,020
But the research results have not actually been released.

656
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,020
It is not allowed to be enthusiastic about the paper.

657
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,020
However,

658
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,020
I have contacted the head of the facility and apologized this time

659
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,020
and it was not important.

660
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,020
President Pendou, rest assured.

661
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,020
Then,

662
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,020
let's start the voting.

663
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,020
Yes.

664
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,020
Then, I will resume.

665
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,020
I will do something.

666
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,020
Thank you.

667
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,020
How was it?

668
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,020
The new president is...

669
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,020
Amino.

670
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,020
Amino.

671
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
Amino.

672
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,020
Amino.

673
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,020
Amino.

674
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,020
Please come in.

675
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,020
President Pendou.

676
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,020
Thank you for your hard work.

677
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,020
I will leave the rest to you.

678
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,020
I understand how my father feels.

679
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,020
He was betrayed by a person he trusted.

680
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,020
He was hurt so much.

681
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,020
He was betrayed by a person he trusted.

682
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,020
Please come in.

683
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,020
Congratulations on your admission,

684
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,020
President Amino.

685
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Thanks to you, I was saved.

686
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,020
It's okay.

687
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,020
It was a good thing that I met the Montauk Science Center.

688
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,020
I look forward to working with you.

689
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,020
Why did you betray Mr. Naruki?

690
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,020
Stop it.

691
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,020
You know about what happened two years ago.

692
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,020
I just did what I should do.

693
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,020
I have come this far.

694
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,020
I have no intention of retreating.
