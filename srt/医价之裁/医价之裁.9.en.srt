1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I will definitely reveal everything.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Bring me the EC.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Are you trying to hide the truth?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Please stop.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Please accept it.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Please believe in me.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You sacrificed your father for your own good.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mr. Masarari Naruki, who is your father, is holding a press conference.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
When you were in the extreme hospital, did you really try to make that sin your partner?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I betrayed you, I did something that I couldn't get back.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm leaving Aminoto.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Stay in the extreme hospital.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Don't waste Yuuki's effort.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You're not good enough for Naruki.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're a loser.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can't laugh at that joke.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's not a joke.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
From now on, you don't need your power.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Please leave.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nothing in particular.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sit down.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll have iced coffee.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't have tea.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'd like some whipped cream.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Whipped cream...

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't need it.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you for waiting.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thank you.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's good.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You seem to have calmed down a little.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm glad I got fired.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What?

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I know.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not going to have a future if I stay with him.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Naruki.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're here, aren't you?

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Forget about him and work at home.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll be a part-time employee for a while.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You can work comfortably.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can't help it if you're on leave.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You should move forward.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm Aki Yonaga, a part-time employee.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Nice to meet you.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Who is the boss hiring him?

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It seems that the boss wanted to scout him.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He was at the Doctor Connection.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is he on duty?

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll check later.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Boss, you have a reservation.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I see.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I've been waiting.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Nice to meet you.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Goodbye.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mr. Kawabe?

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Mr. Yonaga?

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Is he your mother's boss?

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's really into my mother's cancer treatment.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Nice to meet you.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He's still strong.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's do the cancer treatment.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Not only that, but also me.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you for your help.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm glad you're doing well.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mr. Kawabe Chizuru.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's been a part-time employee at the cancer center.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He used to work at the University Hospital.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
May I ask if you have any questions?

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you're willing to help, I'd like to get over 20 million yen a year.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
20 million?

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you get over 20 million yen...

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, I don't mind changing the number.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What?

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
For example, a beauty clinic.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Beauty?

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What about Mr. Kawabe?

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'd like to prioritize pay.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The End

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why do you need so much money?

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mr. Yonaga, you shouldn't say that.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because...

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My mother's hospital bills are running out.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hospital bills?

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My mother has a rare disease of sepsis.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She's going to be hospitalized.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The hospital bill has been reduced.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Only the special room is open.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's a special bed, right?

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If the hospital has a special room for the patient,

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the patient has to take care of the bed.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
There are cases where the patient is admitted to the hospital

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
without the doctor's permission.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Did you introduce me to another hospital?

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If it's a low-income hospital, it's still open.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But considering the situation,

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm more at ease with the hospital that the specialist is in.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Can you get me into this hospital?

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then, this is the hospital's room.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I see.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If the patient is in the hospital,

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
the hospital will have to pay for the medical bills.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Isn't that a dirty way to do it?

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But the hospital bill is true.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's a popular hospital.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
By the way, which hospital is she admitted to?

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Aisaki Hospital.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Aisaki?

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a very low-income hospital.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Professor Amino of the public health department is now attracting attention

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
because she is admitted to the head of the extreme.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is the plan of the nursing hospital's business expansion.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, the task is...

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No, no.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I trust you in that area.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Do as you please.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Is there something wrong with that?

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's like my mother's time.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
My mother also admitted to Aisaki.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't think so.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I heard that Amino's eyes are alive now.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Amino?

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Considering that there are also other debt that my mother made in class,

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't do it with the current salary.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I understand.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll do my best to help you.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Excuse me.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I also trusted Amino back then.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But now...

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know the truth about the case that Naruki is pursuing.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Anyway, let's pick up a hospital that looks good for conditions in the BOK.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Even if you change jobs, you can't use Mr. Kawabe's skills.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't really want to change my specialty.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's difficult to make a living with the current career extension.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The main office is different from the sub-company.

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's hard to earn medical fees and the pay is not high.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's a job that saves lives, but it looks like a bad thing.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But it doesn't start with that.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Did you kill Mr. Yonaga?

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can't help it if I'm here because I don't have a job.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll definitely regret it.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So what are you doing?

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm going to do a charity event at a free time.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's not what you should do now.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Get rid of it.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The criminal team is friendly.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't come out again.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have to do something about Amino's main office.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If I don't do something, I'll be crushed.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That guy is a big help to someone's betrayal.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I feel responsible for that.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm doing my best, so I want to do something.

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So what happened to Kurama?

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's back in the theater, but he's barely showing himself.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He's hiding because he's afraid you'll get caught.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mr. Naruk.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're not here, are you?

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll pay for it.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'd rather invite you on a date.

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Can you please take a look at it now?

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sure you've already come to a conclusion.

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Amino seems to have authority in the medical industry.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We can't win the fight.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But...

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If the situation changes, please contact me again.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Come in.

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The meeting is online.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Meeting?

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry to have you all here.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'd like to have a cup of tea, but I don't have any staff.

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's fine.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Tell me if some of the weekly newspapers are true.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
About the medical care of the extreme university hospital that happened three years ago.

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There's a secret in that case.

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My father, Narukin Masanari, who was at the meeting at the time,

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
was a victim of the so-called victim.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Victim?

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,920
It was announced that my father was a

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
ophthalmologist, but the one who actually got jealous was Kuramochi, a toparist.

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And the one who blamed my father for the failure of toparism was Amino Kagehito.

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What is this?

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Amino is the current president, right?

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That Amino...

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So, is it true that you're a hospital animal?

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Any evidence?

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There is no evidence to show at this stage, but I am convinced that it is true from multiple evidences.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No evidence.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So, what is the truth?

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If it's just a conjecture, it won't be a clear case.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Please say something.

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's not a false accusation.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm Naruki.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm a doctor.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm a doctor.

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

203
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm Naruki.

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's about time to get into the game.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm Tendo, the head of the Kyokutou University Hospital.

206
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Head?

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're the person responsible for the medical care, right?

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I know the truth, and I'm currently requesting an investigation by the third party.

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So, the president of Amino is actually the one who is responsible for the medical care?

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I think so.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We will find the truth.

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I want you to verify it.

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Because of that stupid meeting, even the staff of our Stifasha is affected.

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The staff is temporary, so it's okay.

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I hope so.

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Come in.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Excuse me.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We have a guest.

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Hi, Wanada.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is Tanimura, the director of the Labor Standards Department.

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hello.

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Hello.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Director of Labor Standards.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You did a great job.

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's a shame that we found Naruki's fault.

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's not his fault.

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I wonder if the business will stop with this case.

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I've known him for a long time, so I'm worried.

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Please.

230
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hello, this is Dousaka.

232
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I saw your meeting.

233
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Is that true?

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sure it is.

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Please give me some time.

236
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll tell you everything.

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You were in the second grade of the University Hospital at the time.

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I've heard about you from my daughter once.

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You have a weak reaction, so you can talk about anything.

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Mr. Naruki, is my family okay?

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If you have time to worry, you can think about the hospital.

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Be more sincere.

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm not free either.

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There are top-class doctors in this school.

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You don't have to worry about anything.

246
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Next, let's talk about the future.

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I trusted you before.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Mr. Naruki, I want to know the truth.

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's all.

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Thank you.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry to hear that again.

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But I'm sorry to hear that again.

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But I'm sorry to hear that again.

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But I'm sorry to hear that again.

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm glad you found me early.

256
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's proceed with the treatment without hurrying.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Thank you for your help.

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Doctor?

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's do our best together.

260
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm doing my job.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
These are the three doctors I want to recommend.

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There are many stories about 17 million people.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If you consider Mr. Kawabe's career, you can negotiate with him.

264
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Then, let's do an interview.

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Is that really okay?

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Ms. Yonaga.

267
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Isn't the job of the current director of the Shionai-kai special to Mr. Kawabe?

268
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You're throwing away your career for money.

269
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If you think about it, your mother's hospital fee will be fine.

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm already...

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Mr. Kawabe told me before.

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This job is my life.

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
How much did my mother and I help you?

274
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Don't look down on me.

275
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm not an adult.

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't push your ideals.

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But...

278
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry, Ishigami.

279
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Can you fire her from my position?

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't care if you disappoint me.

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
She's my precious mother.

282
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I've already decided.

283
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Is this my welcome party?

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No, it's another party.

285
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm glad no one's welcoming you.

286
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's not true.

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But...

288
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're a little out of it.

289
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're the reason your mother's condition is getting worse.

290
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Mr. Kawabe really helped me.

291
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What do you mean?

292
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
My mother also refused to be hospitalized.

293
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
My mother was at Kyokuto University Hospital.

294
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She was treated with cancer by Mr. Kawabe.

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
She was supposed to be hospitalized after that.

296
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We can't accept you.

297
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Why not?

298
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You can eat by yourself.

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We prioritize patients who need high-calorie drugs.

300
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Please understand.

301
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't know anything about it.

302
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll be at home taking care of my mother.

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes.

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'd like to ask you to come to my house.

306
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Is that so?

307
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yes, thank you.

308
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
A report deadline.

309
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Please call me if you need anything.

310
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Excuse me.

311
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Are you okay?

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm done for the day.

314
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Can I go to your mother's place?

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll make dinner if you like.

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Let's eat together.

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Teacher...

318
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I...

319
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm really sorry.

320
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

321
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I like this job.

322
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I protect my life.

323
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This job is my life.

324
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So don't worry.

325
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll cook for you.

326
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Please.

327
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Thank you.

328
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You can eat by yourself.

329
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's why you can't be hospitalized.

330
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's like a priority issue.

331
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's because...

332
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you need high-calorie drugs,

333
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
the medical department changes.

334
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The patients need long-term care.

335
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The medical department is the priority.

336
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This hospital only accepts patients who are in need of money.

337
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes?

338
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Patients who need high-calorie drugs need long-term care.

339
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So they get a higher salary.

340
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If the total number of patients is 80%,

341
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the basic cost of hospitalization is 1.

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They can't even treat patients who are in need of money.

343
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Isn't there a problem?

344
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No, it's up to the hospital to decide who to put in.

345
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's not up to the law.

346
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Please pay.

347
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Wait. I'll pay.

348
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If my mother can put in, I can work and earn money.

349
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Please do something.

350
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't think it's going to change.

351
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Please wait.

352
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Please do something.

354
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The situation didn't change.

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I wanted to work part-time and take care of my mother.

356
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I see.

357
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But Mr. Kawabe didn't give up.

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't worry.

359
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He said he was dating Amino.

360
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Thank you.

361
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I can work at Dr. Connection like a child.

362
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
My mother was treated well until the end.

363
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So I want to do something this time.

364
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't want to give up for people who need Mr. Kawabe's skills.

365
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's our policy to hire employees.

367
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Try it until you feel like it.

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Is that okay?

369
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But don't take it alone.

370
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If you can do something for me, tell me.

371
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes.

372
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay, let's eat.

373
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yes.

374
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Thank you for the food.

375
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Are you going to arrest him?

376
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
If the rumors of Dr. Connection are true, arresting him is possible.

377
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Then we should investigate the case of the director of the university and Amino.

378
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The director of the school is already working on it.

379
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This policy will never be broken.

380
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Tanimura, you're connected to Director Amino.

381
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm trying to gather evidence to drive Dr. Connection into the previous case.

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's not just me.

383
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
There are many people who are connected to Director Amino.

384
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's like crushing Dr. Connection with the whole school.

385
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's what you're doing.

386
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This is not fair.

387
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I want to find out about Amino and Stephasha's bribe.

388
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm sure they're involved in a political conspiracy called the Seijou Country.

389
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I've never heard of that information.

390
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I only hear good things about Director Amino.

391
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So Director Amino is also the chairman of the Foundation for the Protection of Medical Affairs?

392
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yes.

393
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm thinking of putting my power into your activities from now on.

394
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Please write the article as you like.

395
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I understand.

396
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Excuse me.

397
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Are you the staff of NARUKI?

398
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Do you know him?

399
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I've been listening to a lot of stories lately.

400
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Are you okay?

401
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I quit my job.

402
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I have nothing to do with that company.

403
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'd like to ask you to let Dr. Kawabe's mother in.

404
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Do you know that some of the hospitals in AISAKI are being turned into other hospitals?

405
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yes.

406
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That's why they're reducing the number of patients.

407
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That's right.

408
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Reducing the number of patients in the hospital and increasing the number of nursing facilities.

409
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Both of these are the requests from the country.

410
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The country?

411
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I have to do that too.

412
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I want to help, but I'm sorry.

413
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Please.

414
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It seems that she has directly contacted Director Amino.

415
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm sorry for doing something selfish.

416
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But it was no good.

417
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I see.

418
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Please let me take the interview the other day.

419
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I understand.

420
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Please sit down.

421
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yonaga-san.

422
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I've said something terrible before.

423
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Thank you for everything.

424
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I wanted to solve it like a teacher, like magic.

425
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You made my wish come true when I was your mother.

426
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That's not me.

427
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
What?

428
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The teacher who worked at the Kyokuto University Hospital at the time

429
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
happened to hear about you and helped me.

430
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Really?

431
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
He's a strange person.

432
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
He's a second grade student, but he's a little clumsy.

433
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
He was having a hard time at the time, but he has a lot of memories of others.

434
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I don't know what the second grade student is.

435
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm sure you'll get a certificate from the Kyokuto University Hospital.

436
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Certificate?

437
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It seems that he will be a master of the school as a master of the school.

438
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'll call you again.

439
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
What's wrong?

440
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
My mother was hospitalized at the Aisaki Hospital.

441
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Is it true that it's all because of you?

442
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Why is that?

443
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I wanted to use you.

444
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Please explain.

445
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
At that time, I had already decided to open a branch agent.

446
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I was looking for a gym staff.

447
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
At that time, I visited Aisaki and saw you.

448
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You were studying well, and you seemed to be good at calculating.

449
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Above all, you have a high desire to work.

450
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I stepped on you if my mother could be hospitalized.

451
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
When?

452
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Before we met?

453
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
At that time, I prayed that the other person was not illegal,

454
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
but I knew that there was a limit to the amount of people who did it.

455
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I was able to improve the FIM score immediately.

456
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
He is a little expensive, but I wonder if my mother has improved so much.

457
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
No, that's not true.

458
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's a score that determines how much patients can live their daily lives.

459
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
How much food, toilet, and clothes can be done without help.

460
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The higher the score, the higher the amount of people who are hospitalized.

461
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The way of doing it was expected to be like a dramatic recovery.

462
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
This is a clear failure.

463
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Mr. Kawabe knew about you, so he decided to meet Amino directly.

464
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I don't want to make things big for Mr. Kawabe either.

465
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But can you listen to her wish?

466
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I understand. Can I leave this matter to me?

467
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
As a result, the head of the department was disposed of and your mother's hospitalization was recognized.

468
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Well, now that I think about it, that position was probably under the guidance of Amino and Tokage's tail.

469
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Why did Mr. Kawabe keep Mr. Naruki secret from me?

470
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Because I said I didn't have to talk.

471
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That way, I can show a fateful encounter.

472
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
An encounter?

473
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm looking for staff.

474
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh, sorry.

475
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Thank you.

476
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
This is...

477
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's my company. I'm looking for gym staff.

478
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
A shift agent.

479
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
A job that delivers doctors to the hospital of hope.

480
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
If you work at the right place, the patient and his family will be happy.

481
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's a worthwhile job.

482
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I don't care if it's a second-rate job, so I'm looking for people with enthusiasm.

483
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Can I apply for that?

484
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's a second-rate job, but I'm enthusiastic.

485
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I thought that was completely destiny.

486
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So you were caught by me.

487
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
A person?

488
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You were disappointed.

489
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Now that I think about it, I can't beat Mr. Naruki.

490
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That's what it is. It's not destiny.

491
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
What's wrong?

492
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Mr. Naruki is amazing.

493
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
He moves things like magic, as I thought.

494
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm very...

495
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Everyone will hit the wall.

496
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I just won't give up.

497
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I can get what I want, and I will find the hidden truth.

498
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
If you're done, go back.

499
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm busy with the trial.

500
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I just won't give up.

501
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's an ideal job to stay where you should be.

502
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Then you just have to break the wall in front of you.

503
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Excuse me.

504
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm looking around the nursing facility for my mother.

505
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You're looking after your mother, right?

506
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Well, how are you two related?

507
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh, I'm a mother.

508
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
How are you two related?

509
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh, I'm a sister.

510
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Oh, you're brothers.

511
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
No, I'm a father.

512
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I see.

513
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I see.

514
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You're so young. Who are you looking after?

515
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You're really a father.

516
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You don't have that attitude.

517
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You said you'd help me with the mission.

518
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Do you really have to dress like this?

519
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What's wrong?

520
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yes.

521
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
This is the nursing facility.

522
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And this is the living room.

523
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'll make you some tea.

524
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Please drink some water.

525
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Hey, hey, hey.

526
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I haven't eaten today.

527
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
This is the living room.

528
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Is this just a partition?

529
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
That's right.

530
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's why they sing it's a living room.

531
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I don't care.

532
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

533
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

534
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I can't wait.

535
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Of course you're worried.

536
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That's the reality of the nursing facility.

537
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
The country is trying to increase its nursing facilities.

538
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So you're making it a part of the population?

539
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's about 4 people.

540
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The cost of purchasing the partition is also being paid.

541
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That's a lie.

542
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I feel a little bit guilty.

543
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
As far as I know,

544
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I can't say it's illegal.

545
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I see.

546
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
The number of patients is decreasing because of the increase in the number of nursing facilities.

547
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's not strange,

548
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
but it's been six months since the establishment of the Aisaki Nursing Hospital.

549
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's getting bigger.

550
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We've got an investigation result from the outside.

551
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Amino Kagehito is a regular customer of the cleaning company.

552
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He hasn't been in touch with anyone recently.

553
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Not at all?

554
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:21,820
He knows that he's being suspected of being a

555
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,820
I'll call you again.

556
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,820
Thank you for your time.

557
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,820
Even the Ame's seal of the old register.

558
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,820
I made time.

559
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,820
I made time because I asked the court agent.

560
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
What is it?

561
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,500
What is the

562
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,820
The nursing hospital here is dry.

563
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:59,820
It's called a private room just because it's a partition.

564
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,820
Well, that's how much the nursing hospital is needed.

565
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,820
But the unregulated population is bad.

566
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,820
What are you talking about?

567
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:17,820
I looked it up and found that this nursing hospital has more than one nursing staff for 4 people.

568
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,820
If there are many staff, they will receive a lot of rewards from the country.

569
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,820
But the nursing staff is clearly not enough.

570
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:32,820
In other words, by approving the nursing staff, they are receiving unpaid rewards.

571
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,820
No, I don't mean that.

572
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,820
Then let's have the old register confirm it.

573
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,820
My relatives are the old register staff.

574
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,820
You should stop lying right away.

575
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,820
Yes, well, it can't be helped.

576
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,820
I'm short of people.

577
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,820
I'm trying to get some staff.

578
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,820
That's a lie, isn't it?

579
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,820
I thought so and looked at the information about the old register staff.

580
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,820
The recruitment of nursing staff has already been cut off and is not available anywhere now.

581
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,820
It is also confirmed that there are no unregulated people.

582
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,820
In other words, it is clear that the country is intentionally deceiving the reward.

583
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,820
In that state, it is not bad to try to expand the number of patients.

584
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,820
That's ...

585
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,820
I'm sorry.

586
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,820
I'll take care of it.

587
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,820
You go back to work.

588
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,820
Yes.

589
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,820
I didn't expect such a disaster.

590
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,820
I feel responsible as a doctor.

591
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,820
I will definitely improve the situation and punish him.

592
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:55,820
However, when I think about the future of patients, I don't want to make it a big deal.

593
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,820
Of course, it is not the purpose to make it a big deal.

594
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:07,820
However, the expansion of nursing staff in this situation is indeed a double.

595
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,820
Then ...

596
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,820
My mother ...

597
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Since the expansion of nursing staff has been confirmed, the number of patients can be secured.

598
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,820
It is now possible to enter the general hospital.

599
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:33,820
Doctor, can't you continue your current job as it is?

600
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:38,820
Thank you.

601
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,820
Really.

602
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,820
Thank you.

603
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,820
Then, Mr. Kawabe will not be transferred.

604
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,820
You mean you won't get the introduction fee?

605
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Mr. Yonaka has set up a contract to introduce several nursing staff to the Aisaki nursing hospital.

606
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:05,820
I think it will be more than that.

607
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,820
I'm glad I was able to help the company.

608
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,820
As expected, the president has been dragged here.

609
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,820
Thank you.

610
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,820
Mr. Yonaka, can I talk to you?

611
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,820
Special Investigation ...

612
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,820
I'm here.

613
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,820
I will take a look at your official application.

614
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
What?

615
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,820
You are not suitable for the company.

616
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,820
Why?

617
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,820
You imitated the way NARUKI works, right?

618
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,820
It was wonderful.

619
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,820
Actually, that day, NARUKI called me.

620
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,820
He said he fired you.

621
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,820
You were looking for a person who was capable of doing his job, right?

622
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,180
By the way, I stepped on the

623
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,820
ground when I was in charge.

624
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,820
Now I think I was manipulated by my mother and her.

625
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:11,820
She didn't abandon you.

626
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,820
Tell her.

627
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,820
It's like you can support her.

628
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,820
Mr. Ishigami ...

629
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,820
English breakfast, right?

630
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,820
I thought it would be gone soon.

631
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,820
When you want to increase your concentration, you only drink that.

632
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,820
I will continue working here.

633
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,820
I said I didn't need it anymore.

634
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,820
You're telling me not to involve myself anymore, right?

635
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,820
When my mother was in charge, NARUKI said that.

636
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:55,820
You said that.

637
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,820
You can work without me.

638
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,820
You can take a break for a while.

639
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,820
That's a little clumsy.

640
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,820
Thanks to you, I was able to cherish my time with my mother.

641
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,820
Thank you very much.

642
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,820
I knew that.

643
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,820
I can't help but repay you.

644
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:30,820
And through Mr. Kawabe's transfer consultation, I was convinced that Amino was a black person who pushed everything on others.

645
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:38,820
So I will be NARUKI's strength.

646
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,820
The wind that blows to me will get even more severe from here.

647
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,820
You may also be a target.

648
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,820
Then please take revenge on Amino and win the game.

649
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,820
Please recover your honor.

650
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,820
Then there is no problem.

651
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,820
No problem.

652
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:05,820
I will put English breakfast in the first job of Dr. Connection.

653
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:27,820
NARUKI.

654
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,820
I forgot to say thank you.

655
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:41,820
Thanks to you, I met a good gym staff.

656
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:48,820
Isn't it a matter of ethics to discard the cancer patients introduced by the hospital for that benefit?

657
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,820
I have to pay back for that time.

658
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,820
Today I will talk about the future.

659
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:03,820
I want to do something that will deliver Japan's wonderful medical services to the world when I retire.

660
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,820
It's still a dream that I've been dreaming.

661
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,820
I think it's a good dream to think about how to do it later.

662
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,820
Will you support me?

663
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:30,820
Yeah, I'll help you.

664
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,820
It's almost time.

665
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,820
What?

666
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,820
What is your strategy?

667
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,820
It's a bribe from the Stifar company.

668
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,820
Do you mean to buy the whole company?

669
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:57,820
If you take over the company, you can prevent the evidence of the medical care and the connection with Amino three years ago.

670
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:04,820
Even if you can't get a decisive blow, if you let go of those who follow Amino, the wind will change at once.

671
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,820
But we're the only ones who can buy it.

672
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,820
It's not impossible.

673
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,820
Thank you.

674
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,820
The company is full of distrust towards Amino.

675
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,820
I've saved enough military funds.

676
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,820
This is the last step to clear Amino's sins.

677
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,820
I was saying that it's a charity.

678
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:35,820
The Stifar company has a lot of individual investors, and there should be a lot of other investors who will follow our way.

679
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,820
In addition, the results of the negotiations were also obtained from the large-scale investor fund.

680
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,820
There are 12 awards.

681
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,820
Thank you.

682
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,820
I was very happy to see that the fund would follow my way.

683
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,820
So it's really a bribe?

684
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:57,820
Yeah.

685
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:05,820
It's possible for us.

686
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,820
Amino is moving.

687
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,820
Mr. Naruki?

688
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,820
Are you listening?

689
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:21,820
Amino is using the funds that he owns to buy a large number of Stifar companies.

690
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,820
You're not going to let your plan go to waste, are you?

691
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,820
It seems so.

692
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,820
To fight against this side.

693
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,820
The Stifar negotiations have begun.

694
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,820
Isn't the timing too much?

695
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,820
Thanks to you, I was able to get a hand in it.

696
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,820
Thank you.

697
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:51,820
I also have information as a former bank clerk.

698
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,820
What was moving in the Stifar department was a slip-up.

699
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,820
The slip-up is the best.

700
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,820
For the food industry and the medical industry,

701
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:13,820
Naruki should be crushed as it is.

702
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,820
What is it?

703
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,820
The head of the Ministry of Health and Welfare has been appointed to a special team.

704
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,820
The goal is to pursue the illegal connection of Dr. Connection.

705
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,820
Please wait a moment.

706
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,820
It's no longer a matter of being able to control us.

707
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:46,820
Dr. Connection is over.

708
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,820
Peel off Amino's mask.

709
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,820
Apologize to everyone.

710
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,820
This is the final mission.

711
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,820
We shouldn't be hiding.

712
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,820
The true path of the I.O. is the history of sacrifice.

713
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,820
Have you ever imagined what kind of future you were drawing?
