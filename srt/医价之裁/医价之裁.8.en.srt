1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Finally, I have arrived at the truth of the medical care 3 years ago.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Kanenari Naruki.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Don't you have a sense of sin?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You should look ahead.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Kanenari.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Please believe in your father.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
To relieve my father's worries, to take revenge.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
With this in the presidential election?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I will start moving.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Before the vote, I have something to tell the voters.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Because there is a connection between Professor Amino and Stifasha.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There is a back-up document.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The screen.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Where is the victory?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thanks to you, I was saved.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
However, I met a betrayal of unexpected.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How was it?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The new president is Amino.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Evil has obtained absolute power.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have a feeling that the chosen ones will sit.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's just a chair and a desk.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I was going to be the chairman, but it took more time than I thought.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If I was with Naruki, it wouldn't have taken so long.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Did you keep an eye on him even after he quit the military?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I didn't keep an eye on him.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I don't hate people who don't know what to do like Naruki.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry I cut it off.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The end.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The diagnosis is a mid-nuclear copper mine.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We are planning a clipping operation.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How is it, director?

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No problem.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Please proceed.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's stop, everyone.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If there is something, I will return it immediately.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't like that.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Professor Dendo is committed to the progress of medical care.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have always respected him.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's keep working together.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Next, Toyoda.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Please stop.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But I'm Yorio.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I didn't realize the fault of the paper.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's my responsibility.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And because I lost the presidential election,

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it's not over.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I just do what I should do.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've come this far.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have no intention of retreating.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Please.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Director Inoshima.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Thank you for your hard work.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I heard.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Today's foreign visit was 200 people.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's a good thing.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mr. Shuto.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Can I reduce the number of foreign visits?

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Our clinic is over.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You wanted that seat.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But the way you do it now ...

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I just suggested it.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Director Inoshima is the one who is implementing it.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's you.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think that you will lose your trust in

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
simply turning over what you decided.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then at least increase the number of people.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Mr. Inoshima.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If you have the right to deny, you can do it.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If you have the right,

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you can turn the emergency ban on

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the production of paper only for the sake of the paper.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You are making the current situation.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tomorrow morning, I have a lot of reservations.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I have to rest early.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Then ...

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Continue.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Please.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's time to relax.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I have to hurry.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I want you to talk to the customer.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm busy.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I have a lot to do.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are working hard.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is a heavy work.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Please give me a bonus.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You are really easy to understand.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What?

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm not like you.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm not like you.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm not like you.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not like you.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What?

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You are trying to distract me.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You don't have to do that.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But you were my only friend.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's unnecessary.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Because there is no other person.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a shock.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why?

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's what he decided.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hello.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm Inoshima.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Please.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You want to quit the clinic you run.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The owner is the head of the consulting company.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Wow.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You have five hospitals in the last three years.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I run a lot.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But I don't have a day off.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There are more than 150 people a day.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
150 people?

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You don't have a mental health certificate.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I had a bad eye two years ago.

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I was transferred from the department.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I haven't met the conditions yet.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Where is this hospital that has more than 50 people and has no certificate?

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Mr. Maruki.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't mind if the law goes down.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What are your conditions?

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No certificate.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And it's a hospital that can get a death certificate while working.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're contradicting.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If you can't get a certificate, it's hard to gather the certificates for death.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But it's for my daughter.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm going to take the medical school exam next year.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I want to cooperate as much as possible.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I want to make more time for my family.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Isn't it strange?

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm the chairman, so I don't have to stop.

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think I can do it.

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're the owner.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You can't resist it?

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I need to understand the situation.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's impossible to fight.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I want to hear the opinions of the wise.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't think he's quiet.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why are you in my office?

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I saw you follow him.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know you, but I don't use a valuable car.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
How long are you going to stay?

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I can't give information to other people.

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Please leave.

151
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is my office.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm just using it.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I used you.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Ishigami?

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It was here.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I used you at that time.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Michidori, please remove the seat.

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Brother.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I have a debt to Mr. NARUKI.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm going to give it to you.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't give me water.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What is the consultation?

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I want to hear your opinion.

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
150 people a day.

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I thought you were doing social security.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There are many possibilities.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Social security?

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If you are diagnosed with depression and quit the company,

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
the country will issue a medical certificate for the longest period of one and a half years.

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't want to go to work, but I have patients who come to get a medical certificate.

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The hospital is already in favor of it?

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm getting a profit from being able to get in.

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There are also hospitals that only think about social security.

174
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry for this simple strategy.

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It was a very meaningful time.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What do you mean by using me at that time?

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I heard from Ishigami before.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
For me to step on the stage,

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
for further money-making in this industry.

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What happened at that time?

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Mr. NARUKI.

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yonaga, it's a mission.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I heard.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This time it's not a sneak in, it's a sneak in.

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sneak in?

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Sneak in?

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I asked you.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What?

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I can see it.

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is Yonaga in front of the hospital near the mental care clinic in Inoshima.

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Boss, the patient who just finished the examination has just entered the first round.

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Please.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Do you like detective dramas?

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Please report it normally.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
All right.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
KORI, the curry is coming.

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's done.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is Yonaga. Please.

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't sleep.

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What?

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The report was blocked.

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Focus.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm not sleeping.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was sleeping.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm not sleeping.

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I was sleeping.

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is it.

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's over.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm going to go now.

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is Yonaga.

212
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm tracking the discovery of suspicious emotions.

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Be careful.

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's an additional reward.

215
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Roger.

216
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's Assam milk tea.

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It has the effect of relieving fatigue and sleepwalking.

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you very much.

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
As usual, it's a drama.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's how popular it is.

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No.

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If the evaluation is only on the medical technology,

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the reason why it's popular is because it's easy to give a diagnosis.

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's not the only problem.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's not a simple strategy.

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
In fact, it is a case of patients who are not sick,

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but who are prescribed high-priced medications and sleeping pills.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I looked up the patients who went to Dr. Inoshima's clinic.

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Bingo.

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The diagnosis you wrote is another crime.

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But when I saw you changing jobs,

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
the owner's chief was the one who ordered it.

233
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can't stand the crime anymore.

234
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Isn't that right?

235
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't have a right to testify.

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm not going to testify.

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm going to testify.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I was always following the story of my own clinic being popular

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
even though I didn't have a right to testify.

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But my daughter told me.

241
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
She wanted to be a doctor who could save people's hearts like her father.

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
She wanted to do a job that would make her proud.

243
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So I decided to change jobs.

244
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I had a sense of self-awareness that I was doing something wrong.

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Even if I didn't know that the medication was actually being sold,

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I could have expected it to be so.

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't introduce such a doctor to other hospitals.

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's about trust.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He's right. He's a split.

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The conditions are strict.

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But...

252
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Mr. Maruki.

253
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I can do it.

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why did you accept him?

255
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He was just being used.

256
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He shouldn't be thrown out so easily just because he made a mistake.

257
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I think Dr. Inoshima has a reason for that.

258
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Maybe he knew that the medication was being sold.

259
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This time, he's very emotional.

260
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We can't accept him.

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why?

262
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why?

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I just can't let the medical profession that needs help to survive.

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Dr. Inoshima was creating such a situation.

265
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There must have been a gray client before.

266
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're pretty gray.

267
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Sometimes, you force yourself to take the initiative.

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I want to know what kind of case you're dealing with right now.

269
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I can ask you.

270
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You're interested in Mr. Maruki, right?

271
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No, I'm not.

272
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is where you should work hard.

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You know about what happened two years ago, right?

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Two years ago?

275
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I just asked you to give me your opinion as a psychiatrist.

276
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Then, I'll do it.

277
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I have one question.

278
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What happened to Mr. Maruki in this conference room?

279
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Please tell me.

280
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I came here for that.

281
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I first met him two years ago.

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I came to the bank to get a job in the management department.

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I met him for the first time.

284
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He's excellent.

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He's a great man.

286
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Can I ask you why you're hiring him?

287
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You'll know if you search for your father's name.

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He's Masanari Nalchi.

289
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He's in charge of the sanitary in the hospital.

290
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So, I'm trying to change the environment.

291
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Is that so?

292
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But you look like you're in a bad mood.

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I saw your bank name when you were exchanging your name.

294
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Did you get a job?

295
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You're still not used to the job.

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
In other words, you're not trustworthy.

297
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Please change your job.

298
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Change.

299
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Are you mistaken for a nightclub?

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You don't like it, so you can't go through with it.

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Please solve it yourself.

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I told you to change your job.

304
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I've been consulting with the management.

305
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm going to continue working.

306
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But Mr. Nalchi's hope will definitely come true.

307
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's not your fault.

308
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want to help you.

309
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I want to help you.

310
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

311
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But I can earn money.

312
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm a non-compensatory doctor.

313
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Non-compensatory?

314
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Even if I change to a non-compensatory doctor at my age,

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I earn about 8 million yen a year.

316
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But if I do a medical checkup with non-compensatory doctors,

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I earn 10,000 yen a year.

318
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's more expensive.

319
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I can't.

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You can't improve your skills with a medical checkup.

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Don't narrow your possibilities.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Find a job that will make you look ahead in the future.

323
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What are you thinking about?

324
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yes.

325
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's not that money.

326
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's just a waste of time.

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You said you could do it with non-compensatory, right?

328
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So I can't.

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I've been working for a while.

330
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I know what this company lacks.

331
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
They care about the cost of living more than the jobless.

332
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's why they're trying to get a simple case.

333
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We can't see growth with that.

334
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We're taking care of the client's future.

335
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We should have more self-awareness.

336
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The ideal is one step ahead.

337
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If you go that far, you'll show us a good example.

338
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm looking forward to it.

339
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I understand.

340
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yes.

341
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Mr. Naruki, we found a hospital we can introduce you to.

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's called Himezuka Hospital in Chiba.

343
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
A non-compensatory doctor is applying for a job.

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
He wants to hire a young man.

345
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Do you know what I'm doing?

346
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes.

347
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But I want you to show me what you can do.

348
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What do you mean?

349
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't want you to say this is a lie.

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Wait a minute.

351
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I think it's wrong to pay a young man's fee.

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What are you talking about?

353
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I tried to negotiate, but it didn't work out.

355
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I think the hospital was under pressure from the Far East.

356
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The Far East General Assembly was attacked by a non-compensatory doctor.

357
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Then you're a non-compensatory doctor, too?

358
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's me.

359
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I thought you were a non-compensatory doctor.

360
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I happened to know about his non-compensatory work.

361
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why?

362
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, if you're a non-compensatory doctor,

363
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
it's easier for you to get into the life of a doctor.

364
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Even if he had a non-compensatory job,

365
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think he had a problem.

366
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
A problem?

367
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Can I talk to you for a minute?

368
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm worried about being sent to prison.

369
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
When will you show me your book?

370
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Isigami, the inspector is here.

371
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I can't do that because I'm so particular about that case.

372
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Do you think my transfer will be decided?

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No.

374
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But if you give me a little more time,

375
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll do my best.

376
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No.

377
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll finish it.

378
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Wait a minute.

379
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll get closer to you.

380
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You don't understand anything.

381
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I've been planning to do this since the beginning.

382
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't want to transfer from Hana.

383
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I've come up with a way to make more money.

384
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
A way to make more money?

385
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm going to open a transfer agency that specializes in doctors.

386
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I was going to steal the knowledge of the industry's left and right hands,

387
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
but I didn't expect an amateur like you to be in charge.

388
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
If there's only one thing I've got,

389
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't let you face a doctor like me forever.

390
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I used you.

391
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Don't be a fool.

392
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You were really a coward.

393
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You ran around with your heroism.

394
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I understand your true nature.

395
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But I want you to pay attention to one thing.

396
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's not like you're going to do it with Mirono.

397
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The world is not so easy to make a company and succeed without experience.

398
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's normal.

399
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But I can do it.

400
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's called morality.

401
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm worthy of being the one who saves the poor.

402
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You've been so comfortable until now.

403
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm sure you'll be happy.

404
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We'll be in the same company next time we meet.

405
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Nice to meet you, Routoku.

406
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
As the story goes,

407
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
he had a huge human defect.

408
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I told you before.

409
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What he did after that.

410
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What are you doing?

411
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What are you ignoring?

412
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
In the end, Naruki quit school because of the school incident.

413
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I was surprised to see him go that far.

414
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
On the contrary, he might not be able to do it without that much determination.

415
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Me too?

416
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
He's got a lot to do as a medical director.

417
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But I'm glad I met the school interpreter of the junior high school.

418
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yuuki, you looked like you were having a great time at the baseball club.

419
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I hope you can come to the club.

420
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yuuki said he wanted to go.

421
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
He's cute.

422
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
After that, I desperately went to work.

423
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That's why I'm in this position.

424
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
If I hadn't been in charge of that guy,

425
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I might have been able to get out of prison sooner.

426
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The violence incident may be true.

427
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But I also have a misunderstanding.

428
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You said that at that time.

429
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
At that time, Naruki was working in the Far East.

430
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
He tried to blame his father for the crimes of his peers around him.

431
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He said he lost his job in the Far East.

432
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's not true.

433
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
In the first place, Naruki's father was blamed for that medical past.

434
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
What?

435
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The new director of the Far East University Hospital, Ami Kagehito.

436
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Naruki has been trying to get his father's heart out of his chest.

437
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That's not the only thing.

438
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
How's the agent?

440
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
He's doing great.

441
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The gym staff is also good.

442
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I see.

443
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You're so good at it.

444
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You're not a doctor, but an agent.

445
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That's my line.

446
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You're more of a man than a doctor.

447
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm not a man. I'm a man.

448
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And...

449
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Revenge.

450
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Revenge?

451
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yuki said he wanted to be a doctor.

452
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And he's aiming to pass the Far East Middle School, which is strong in baseball.

453
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I see.

454
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I couldn't be a doctor.

455
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So I want to fulfill his hope.

456
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm helping you because I want to make the Far East University Hospital a great place for your son to be.

457
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Sorry.

458
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It wasn't just a friendship.

459
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
A father's heart.

460
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't know anything about presents that much.

461
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yorioka?

463
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I understand.

464
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I was interested in you again.

465
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Is this about Dr. Imoshima?

466
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm not going to borrow your hand.

467
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yorioka came by earlier.

468
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Why did you betray him?

469
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm sure he's a bad mouth, a bad attitude, and a bad personality.

470
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm sure.

471
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm sure.

472
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But I think I was relying on you.

473
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But...

474
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Why?

475
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
About the child...

476
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I was dropped by the president of the Ami.

477
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You're Yorioka, right?

478
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yes.

479
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You passed your son?

480
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yes.

481
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm the next president of the medical department.

482
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yes.

483
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think there's something only you can do for Yuki's future.

484
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes.

485
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
If you refuse...

486
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You'll destroy your son's future.

487
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
What do you think?

488
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's a wonderful thesis.

489
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I had no choice but to obey.

490
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Maruki, I'm sorry.

491
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Maruki, you knew that, didn't you?

494
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You're particular about Dr. Inoshima because you're relying on Yorioka, aren't you?

495
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
For my daughter.

496
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But I think Dr. Inoshima's case is beyond the gray area.

497
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
After all...

498
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yes, this is Dr. Connection.

499
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I see. Thank you.

500
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'll see you again.

501
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I've been a little off the road.

502
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You're a serious person, so I'm sure you'll be a good fighter.

503
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yuki, we're here.

504
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yorioka.

505
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You came to our school on purpose.

506
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You're very enthusiastic about your studies.

507
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I was a very fulfilling mayor of Tokyo.

508
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I met Mr. Michinori and Mr. Naruki.

509
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Mr. Naruki?

510
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I just got a call about a clinic I wanted to hear about.

511
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What kind of place?

512
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Inoshima Mental Care Clinic.

513
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What's wrong?

514
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Nothing.

515
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You're changing jobs?

516
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What are you talking about?

517
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's not a job.

518
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

519
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's too much of a disadvantage.

520
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Who do you think you're the president without a right to be a mayor?

521
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
If it's a stone that moves according to your will, anyone would be fine.

522
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Anyway, I won't forgive you for being so selfish.

523
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm sick of hearing what you say.

524
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
What?

525
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Please wait.

526
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm sorry. These people suddenly...

527
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Excuse me.

528
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
This is the Labor Standards Director's Office.

529
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm going to file a complaint.

530
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I didn't hear you.

531
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I didn't say anything.

532
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So you were just filing a complaint to investigate the labor situation.

533
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yes.

534
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm not supposed to be working late at night.

535
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And I found out that the clinic was not functioning.

536
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Officially, it is a violation of the regulations for the health care of health care and medical care.

537
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't get it at all.

538
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
A company that runs a clinic can't run a clinic.

539
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Inoshima Mental Care Clinic writes a lot of medical records.

540
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
They were doing the worst business of making them buy unnecessary drugs with the drug they own.

541
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I didn't know that.

542
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I think so, too.

543
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
What are you doing, Tanimura?

544
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That has nothing to do with it.

545
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Please help me.

546
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh.

547
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Normally, I don't notice.

548
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What about Inoshima?

549
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It seems that he didn't recognize it.

550
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
The owner's wife was making a small company and cheating.

551
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But there is also a business of social security and search business, so the business is suspended.

552
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And it feels like a joint owner, and it's on the national news.

553
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
What?

554
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What are you going to do from now on?

555
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's impossible to live in the medical industry.

556
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
My wife and I are getting a divorce.

557
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I thought that Inoshima's life would be the future of my daughter.

558
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
My family was also wiped out.

559
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm sure I was wrong.

560
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I knew it was a bad thing, but I kept going.

561
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Mr. Naruki.

562
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Thank you for your trouble.

563
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Mr. Naruki Kanenari.

565
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Mr. Naruki.

566
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Mr. Inoshima Yoshiharu's transfer support is on the agenda.

567
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Mr. Naruki Kanenari is a former medical student.

568
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
He was arrested by the Sanhokin Association.

569
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
He was also involved in the medical accident.

570
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Mr. Naruki Masanari, your father, was also involved in the accident.

571
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
When you were in the hospital, did you really try to make up for the crime?

572
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I ran away from my boss and left.

573
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Is there a reason why you can't answer?

574
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Please explain.

575
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm just trying to get in touch with you.

576
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I'll answer.

577
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's been two hours.

578
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
What's going on?

579
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yes, this is Dr. Connection.

580
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm just trying to get in touch with you.

581
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
What do you mean?

582
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
What I told you is an article.

583
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's not good.

584
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm not the one who's going to get in.

585
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Come in.

586
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Excuse me.

587
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
What's wrong?

588
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's about the article on the weekly magazine.

589
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's been a lot of trouble.

590
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's been a lot of trouble.

591
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Is Mr. Naruki okay?

592
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
He looks like a close friend of mine.

593
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Good timing.

594
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Come in.

595
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Guten Tag.

596
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

597
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I've been thinking about it, and I've been told that Dr. Kuramochi has come back from Germany.

598
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm grateful that the director himself has been a good person.

599
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You mean you were moving?

600
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I can't see the story, but I'm the only one who can.

601
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm the same as Professor Tendo.

602
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I can't see through what's not going through.

603
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It's a very good sense of justice.

604
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I want to keep this song going with Professor Tendo.

605
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I think you need to read the wind for that.

606
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Thank you for your advice.

607
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But I wonder which one of you needs to read the wind.

608
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You're the one who figured out the pharmacist's fault.

609
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You can't use it too much.

610
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The timing of the old machine was great.

611
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Thank you very much.

612
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I guess I'll have to work for you, too.

613
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I wonder if you'll come back.

614
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
The End

615
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Welcome back.

616
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm home.

617
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm out of breath.

618
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I've been studying too much lately.

619
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
If I can't get into the baseball team, it's meaningless.

620
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
What?

621
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Dad...

622
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You've gotten better.

623
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I know you've been practicing hard.

624
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm sorry, NARUKI.

625
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm not apologizing.

626
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm sorry for betraying you and not getting anything back.

627
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm sorry.

628
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'll leave Aminotama and stop playing baseball.

629
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm going to let go of my courage.

630
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The End

631
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,000
The hospital that was in a state of emergency from the east said they wanted to accept you.

632
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I've been out of the way for a while, but you're a serious person, so I'm sure you'll be a force of war.

633
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Thank you.

634
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Did you find the place where Mr. Inoshima was going to change jobs?

635
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yorioka.

636
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
What?

637
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I knew it.

638
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You chose justice over your son's future.

639
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
NARUKI...

640
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But I don't think I should quit.

641
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Stay in the end.

642
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Don't waste Yuki's effort.

643
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It was a situation where I had to betray my friends or my son.

644
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You made the right choice.

645
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm fine.

646
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You know best that even if you die, you're not a human that can be crushed easily.

647
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But...

648
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
There's no need to separate from Amino.

649
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Just tell him this.

650
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Even without a word, Yuki can pass the exam.

651
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
What are you going to do if your father doesn't believe in your son?

652
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Well, you decide.

653
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Thank you.

654
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
What about Mr. Yorioka?

655
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm not changing jobs.

656
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Is that okay?

657
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm going to live if I betray Amino.

658
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I heard from Mr. Ishigami that I met Mr. NARUKI the other day.

659
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I think...

660
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Mr. NARUKI said to Mr. Ishigami at the end...

661
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Maybe it was a lie.

662
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That was for Mr. Ishigami.

663
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yes, I'll do something about that.

664
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Can I talk to you for a moment?

665
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Excuse me, is this a promise?

666
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm NARUKI, I came to meet Mr. Ishigami.

667
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Please wait a moment.

668
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's a shame that I can't go to school because of my famous work.

669
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
When will you show me your textbook?

670
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I used you.

671
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But Mr. Ishigami won't back down after I tell him.

672
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That's why you became a bad person and said something like you're going to get a grudge.

673
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Mr. NARUKI won't admit it honestly.

674
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You don't have to answer.

675
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Now, work, work.

676
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's a big blow because of that article.

677
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
New cases don't come in, and it's canceled.

678
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'll do my best.

679
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Thank you.

680
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
What did you say?

681
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I didn't see anything wrong with you when I scouted you.

682
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I came all the way here because you were there.

683
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

684
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So that's it.

685
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That's it?

686
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You're fired.

687
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
What are you saying?

688
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It's the meaning of the word.

689
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Please leave.

690
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I can't laugh at that joke.

691
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's not a joke.

692
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
From now on, you don't need your power.

693
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Please wait.

694
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Thank you for everything.

695
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm looking for a passionate person because I don't care if it's an inexperienced person.

696
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
YONGA is an honest and excellent staff.

697
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Let me concentrate on the taste.

698
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Please concentrate on your job.

699
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I see.

700
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I'll sleep in Darjilin.

701
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Then YONGA, mission.

702
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'll sleep in Darjilin.

703
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'll sleep in Darjilin.

704
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I'll sleep in Darjilin.

705
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'll sleep in Darjilin.

706
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Then YONGA, mission.

707
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'll sleep in Darjilin.

708
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Thank you.

709
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
With you close to me

710
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I keep on running

711
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'll reach for the answer

712
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Because I'm the only one who can do it

713
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
From now on, you don't need your power.

714
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Can I apply for it?

715
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Are you ready?

716
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Soon.

717
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I don't want to give up.

718
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
A meeting?

719
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
We will definitely find the truth.
