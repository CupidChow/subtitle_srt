1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,120
And I know that you'll try everything
to stop me, so I can't take that risk.

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,600
Rani!

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
Welcome to the time hotel.

4
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,680
If you'd like to come with me, sir?

5
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,440
Magic door?

6
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,400
He had an actual magic
door? The little... too late.

7
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,976
Happy morning.

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,480
One more day to go. It's
may the 24th tomorrow.

9
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
John?

10
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,160
What? But... Anita!

11
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,056
Hello, doctor.

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,880
My god.

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,120
But the world... The world was...

14
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,936
The world was destroyed.

15
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,160
No. No, no, look.

16
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,736
Look.

17
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,296
It's may the 23rd again.

18
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,176
May the 24th never arrives. It resets.

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,256
It gets to midnight and
then it all clicks back

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,816
to 7:00 A.M. on may the 23rd.

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,456
It's done it hundreds of times.

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,960
But we're... We're in mid-air.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,100
I've got the house key. I
can open a door anywhere.

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,936
This is crazy.

25
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,600
Anita, it's... It's so good to see you.

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,320
And, honey, somebody else
was pleased to see you too.

27
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,056
- Ricardo.
- Ricardo.

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,776
- Head of hr.
- Head of hr.

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,216
He worries too much, but he's lovely.

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,490
And this is a baby boy,
due in three months...

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,640
If we ever get there because
this place is in trouble.

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,920
The hotel's in spasm,

33
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,560
<i>cause we're in 4202 and the
world keeps ending in 2025.</i>

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,216
As far as I can see,

35
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,936
- that woman in the sky...
- the rani.

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,376
- The rani.
- The rani.

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,776
- She's a time lord too, yeah?
- Yes.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,216
I tried looking for your tardis

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,776
- but I can't find it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,696
Anita, you are...

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,136
You are talking time lords and tardises.

42
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,856
When I left you, you
were just... Ordinary.

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,016
I didn't say that.

44
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,280
This job at the time
hotel taught me so much...

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,520
And...

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,520
On my days off, I'd go looking for you.

47
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,896
You are the doctor!

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,976
You are an enemy of the daleks!

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,800
Now you are in our power.
You will be exterminated.

50
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,520
I ran straight from that to
Ricardo, so all's well that ends well.

51
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,016
But what about this rani?

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,496
Why's she doing all this?

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,816
Why does Friday the
23rd keep resetting itself?

54
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,416
She needs the same
day to keep repeating itself

55
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,856
so that it gets thinner and
thinner and thinner until it snaps.

56
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,256
Once it's broken, she can see
underneath the skin of reality.

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,456
What for?

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
To find omega.

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
The most fearsome
time lord in existence.

60
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,736
Can you take me to her?

61
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,496
That palace of hers is no entry.

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,816
She's surrounded by a threshold.

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,176
We can't get in.

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,136
It says that portal was the
time hotel, December 2024.

65
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,376
You were supposed to
follow him everywhere.

66
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,816
All right, I had Christmas
off, and so did you.

67
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,256
We're the same person.

68
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,320
That strutting little pompadour.

69
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,360
He'll try to stop us.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,896
We can't wait for another midnight.

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,016
Nine, nine, nine, nine,
seven, seven, seven,

72
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,696
six, seven, seven,
seven, seven, seven, nine.

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,016
We don't have to.

74
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,880
The seekers have fixed the location.

75
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,096
There. Hidden beneath
reality, deep in the under verse.

76
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Omega.

77
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,080
Creator of the time lords.

78
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,736
Our lord and master.

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,160
No one is lord and master of me.

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,760
Now, how to bring him home?

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,780
Here you are, doctor. Poppy's room.

82
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,936
Belinda woke up without you.

83
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,736
Every time the world
resets, it gets a bit bumpy.

84
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,400
Things fall through the gaps.

85
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,376
Everyone sort of compensates,
like they make the reality work.

86
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,976
It's a world built on a wish,

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,896
willed into existence by the
rani's pet human, Conrad Clark.

88
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,240
<i>The doctor loved
playing jokes and games.</i>

89
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,320
<i>And he had a favourite
planet called earth.</i>

90
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,416
<i>A quiet little... And I have a daughter.</i>

91
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,696
But she isn't real.

92
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,960
How dare you?

93
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,896
I have been in the
halls of the goblin king.

94
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,056
I have stood in the palaces of the daleks.

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,376
I have entered the
caves of Satan himself.

96
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,816
But what has happened here

97
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,216
in this tiny little bedroom
in the middle of suburbia

98
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,136
is bigger than anything.

99
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Hello?

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,080
Is someone there?

101
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
It's me.

102
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,060
You're home. I thought you were.

103
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
I don't know what I thought.

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
I'm coming down.

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll make us some tea.

106
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,080
Nice surprise. Daddy's here.

107
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
But I'm.

108
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm belinda chandra.

109
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,936
And you're poppy.

110
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,080
She's real.

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,480
My god. You're the doctor.

112
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,480
But you're real.

113
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,200
Here she is.

114
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,960
- We've had a baby.
- In a single day.

115
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,456
And who's that?

116
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,336
This... this is Anita.

117
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
I just work in hospitality, really.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
Is she safe, doctor?

119
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,416
Please tell me our daughter is safe.

120
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,080
She is in danger, but we
will fight, bel, to save her.

121
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,320
Fight like never before.

122
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
What on earth?

123
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,176
Well, don't look. All of you, keep working.

124
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
I said keep working.

125
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,976
Mr Smith, what on earth
do you think you're wearing?

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,720
The future.

127
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,376
Just a second, guys, because
these are doorways into real time,

128
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,400
allowing you to see the truth.

129
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,016
Mr Smith, whatever this
is, I demand that you stop.

130
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,536
Mr Smith is gone.

131
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,240
I am the doctor.

132
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
I'm wearing a suit.

133
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm wearing tweed.

134
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm wearing nylon.

135
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,480
Danger. Sub-atomic disruption.
Reality levels now converging.

136
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,400
Doctor, what's happening?

137
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
Welcome back, Kate.

138
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,056
- What is it now?
- I don't know.

139
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,576
I've never done this before. Hold on tight.

140
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,120
I think reality is reasserting itself.

141
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,720
Rosie.

142
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,016
Rosie.

143
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,016
Conrad... Conrad couldn't
imagine you for even a second

144
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,216
so you didn't exist.

145
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,800
But now you are back, thanks to Anita.

146
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,176
I'm in the hotel industry.

147
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,416
Neet, neet, I need you to
stay there. Keep that door open.

148
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,400
Keep the real time flowing, honey.

149
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,736
Why is Conrad Clark on television?

150
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,576
Never mind him.

151
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,350
What the bloody hell is that thing?

152
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,376
Bone beasts. Creatures
from the under verse.

153
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,440
Because when two realities
collide, it creates friction

154
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,896
and the friction creates
these excitated atoms,

155
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,096
and that summons the bone
beasts. They're like antibodies.

156
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,496
They sort of graze, feeding off the atoms.

157
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,696
Cleaning up the world.

158
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Now,

159
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,480
one more thing.

160
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Hello, everyone.

161
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,296
I'm belinda.

162
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,240
And this is our daughter, poppy.

163
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
Well, now you're going too far.

164
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,496
Morning, winnie love.

165
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,976
Another day in paradise?

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,856
- Happy may the 23rd.
- Same to you.

167
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,936
Only one day to go.

168
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,256
We had all unit personnel
bio chipped so we know where they are.

169
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,696
We only have a ten-mile radius,

170
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,200
but maybe we can use the chip
to signal them and wake them up.

171
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
But...

172
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,120
What the hell is going on?

173
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,280
You can't say things like that.

174
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,456
You've got to behave, Ruby.
You can't go slandering Conrad.

175
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,336
Winnie, I'm sorry about this,
but I promise things will change.

176
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,016
I don't understand. It's just a normal day.

177
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,136
Where are you going?

178
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Me?

179
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,760
I'm gonna save the world.

180
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,840
Whoo-hoo!

181
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,896
You're running up and
down like a mad sumaddy.

182
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,496
What you really doing?

183
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,856
What I do best.

184
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Bye!

185
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,160
Okay. Let's repeat chapter one.

186
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,400
- Is it working?
- We need to move a little faster.

187
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,096
Sweet little desidirium.

188
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,096
If only you were older, you could
imagine such complicated things.

189
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,176
Instead, I've got you.

190
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,216
I'll do anything for you, mistress.

191
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,760
Don't say that.

192
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,536
You really are ridiculously handsome.

193
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,696
I could tilt you on your side
and serve olives in those dimples.

194
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,176
But still, the doctor,
he's out there somewhere

195
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,736
and you hold all of the
wish in your head, Conrad.

196
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,056
Can you see him?

197
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,960
Can you find him, Connie?

198
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,040
For me?

199
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,920
<i>Gold alert. Gold alert.</i>

200
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,936
So, you see those plans up there?

201
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,936
Cross-match them into null-space.

202
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,936
I need you to build me that in
record time. Can you do that?

203
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,610
Consider it done, sir.

204
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,920
Doctor!

205
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,976
- Hello.
- Hi.

206
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,176
- You're blonder.
- Yes.

207
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,416
- How is Carla?
- She's fine.

208
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,816
How is... no.

209
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,656
No, no, no. Do not go hugging me, you.

210
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
I feel like I haven't washed for days.

211
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,176
A daughter?

212
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,896
Do you mean an actual daughter?

213
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,976
That's amazing.

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,960
Yeah, it surprised me too.

215
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,080
I have been a housewife.

216
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,320
Come here!

217
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,720
Gold protocols. Doctor on the bridge.

218
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,520
Update all of us please.

219
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,096
Basically, we are
facing the unholy Trinity.

220
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,720
God of wishes, crazy
time lady, Conrad Clark.

221
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,576
Mel, I am sorry. It is the rani.

222
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,256
She's still alive?

223
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,656
I fought the rani when I travelled
with the doctor all those years ago.

224
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,896
This should be the best day of my life.

225
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,656
Another time lord. It means
I'm not alone... except...

226
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,816
She's ruthless.

227
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,176
Worse than ruthless,

228
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,136
she's indifferent to any
pain or morality or humanity.

229
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,656
The whole universe is
just an experiment to her.

230
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,376
Now, the Trinity have wished this
world into existence. Conrad's world.

231
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,776
But he couldn't imagine
everything, so he used us.

232
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,136
We half-remembered ourselves,

233
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,376
living Conrad's version
of an ordinary life.

234
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,176
All crushed and stifled and appalling.

235
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,360
But if things are half remembered,
then we met a girl named poppy.

236
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,776
- Exactly like her, doctor.
- What does that mean?

237
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,016
It just makes it even more amazing, bel.

238
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,296
Little scraps of
memories, yours and mine,

239
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,720
have come to life in a child of our own.

240
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,440
Caution. Teleport incoming.

241
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,616
You really are an idiot, doctor.

242
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,496
You had a whole world to hide
in and you ran half a mile away.

243
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,696
The rani.

244
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,936
And Melanie.

245
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,336
We meet again.

246
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,136
I thought you'd be dead.

247
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,376
I thought there's no way that painted
doll of a Princess could ever survive.

248
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,896
I never thought about you once.

249
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,376
You thought of me every night.

250
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,016
Rani, the time lords were
slaughtered. How did you survive?

251
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,776
I saw it coming, the genetic explosion.

252
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,376
I had a split second, flipped my
DNA, made a biological sidestep,

253
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,936
survived the carnage.

254
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,210
How did you get to earth?

255
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,520
I have the only tardis in existence.

256
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,440
Time ring.

257
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,360
- Poor baby.
- It led me to you.

258
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,480
Although, that wasn't difficult.

259
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,776
Find a stupid, blonde
earth girl and there you are.

260
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,936
Excuse me?

261
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,216
It was so tedious putting up
with you and your 57 mothers.

262
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,740
I've never met you in my life.

263
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,616
- All right, rubes darling?
- Mrs flood?

264
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,536
- That's my neighbour.
- That's my neighbour.

265
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,216
They're both the rani.

266
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,816
We bi-generated.

267
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,176
Obviously, I bow to the mistress,

268
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,616
but it took a lot of planning
spying on those two.

269
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,096
"Cor blimey, look at that police box."

270
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,376
And pinning it all down to may the 24th.

271
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,880
But I was brilliant.

272
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,296
The plan is omega?

273
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,136
Splitting open the world to reach
him in the under verse beneath.

274
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,416
Every civilisation has a thousand
legends about the world hidden below.

275
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,616
The upside down or narnia or hell.

276
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,056
That is the under verse.

277
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,976
To which omega was banished.

278
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,016
My father fought
omega back in the 1970s.

279
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,896
Said he was a titan,
called him the mad god.

280
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,896
Omega was the first.

281
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,576
The one who discovered time travel.

282
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,016
Some call him the
original sin of the time lords.

283
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,496
Cast out from gallifrey.

284
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,176
Legend says that they bound him
and banished him because he is insane.

285
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,296
The point is, he's alive.

286
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,896
Exiled to the under verse
means he survived.

287
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,976
You can't know that.

288
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,896
Alive or dead, he will
work as a gene bank.

289
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,816
With his body, I can
resurrect the time lords

290
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,200
and construct a new gallifrey.

291
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,176
Your gallifrey?

292
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,536
Well, the gallifrey of old
never did appreciate me.

293
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,496
But this one, this will
be a power in the sky.

294
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,016
But if you need the DNA of a
time lord, then what about you?

295
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,096
The two of you?

296
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,176
I think she's asking us to mate.

297
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,256
You don't understand.

298
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,496
That's why I keep telling
you that poppy is so special.

299
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,176
Because she is impossible.

300
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,856
The child of a time lord.

301
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,200
And?

302
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,256
There's no such thing.

303
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,616
We're sterile.

304
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,920
We are infertile.

305
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,696
The species is barren.
We're a biological dead end.

306
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,920
There can never be
another gallifreyan child.

307
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,480
Sometimes I think that's
what bi-generation is.

308
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,296
A life force trying
anything it can to survive.

309
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,800
What happened?

310
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,440
That genetic explosion it...

311
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,816
It didn't kill us but it
roasted us and sterilised us.

312
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,536
Extinction is taking
a bit longer, that's all.

313
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,056
So, poppy came out of the wish?

314
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,616
Like an accident?

315
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,416
The most beautiful accident
because that is what life does.

316
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,856
It just happens.

317
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,416
A mad woman and a maniac
came up with a ridiculous plan

318
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,800
and out of it... came her.

319
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,056
Doesn't poppy solve everything?
I mean, she's time lord DNA.

320
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,160
Well, yes, except...

321
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,336
- The mother.
- What about me?

322
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,936
- Human.
- And?

323
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,176
The child is contaminated.

324
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,776
Come on.

325
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,856
I think I've lost the crowd.

326
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,416
- You are disgusting.
- And you are cattle.

327
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,536
We're talking about time lords here.

328
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,736
The highest universal race,

329
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,216
the greatest and purest
classification of life.

330
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,640
He walks around like he's one of you,

331
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,616
but you're like insects to
him, playthings, a fetish.

332
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,736
And deep down in
your hearts, you know it.

333
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,416
Now shut up, step aside.

334
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,696
Let me build a new gallifrey, and
I will leave your world untouched.

335
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,600
Then... then the wish ends.

336
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,656
- What would happen to poppy?
- She would cease to exist.

337
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,416
- No.
- She would vanish.

338
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,920
Like a whisper.

339
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,496
Doctor, I am genuinely
sorry, but she's not real.

340
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,620
She's made of hopes
and dreams and wishes.

341
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,800
That is every child.

342
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,880
But if we don't end the wish,
this stays as Conrad's world.

343
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,856
We can't do that. That's not
happening. Absolutely not.

344
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,696
Don't you tell me what
we can and can't do

345
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,280
<i>cause I don't care what unit thinks,
or time lords or gods or anyone.</i>

346
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,816
I remember her being my daughter,
and if I remember it, then it's true.

347
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,696
Not one of you is taking
her out of existence.

348
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Have you got that?

349
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,456
Not one of you.

350
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,760
Quite the dilemma.

351
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,336
I just came to make an offer.

352
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,920
Stand with me, doctor,

353
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,696
and set a new race of
time lords up on high,

354
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,216
or stay down here with the beasts below.

355
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,280
I swear I will stop you.

356
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,320
The battle is on, doctor.

357
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,840
<i>Good luck.</i>

358
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,240
How close are we?

359
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,656
Target fixed.

360
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,440
The chronon beam will pull
omega out of the under verse.

361
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,296
Trouble is, the unit tower
is a tinderbox of weapons,

362
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,240
but if we fake an excitation of its atoms,

363
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,360
the bone beasts will see
the tower as an enemy.

364
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,520
She is provoking the bone beasts.

365
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,640
We are at war.

366
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,856
<i>Hostiles detected.</i>

367
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,616
<i>Sector 7, grid 5, sector 14, grid 1,
sector 19, grid 5, sector 27, grid four.</i>

368
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,456
- <i>All weapons coordinated and primed.
- Attention all staff.</i>

369
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,496
This tower is going into battle mode.

370
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,976
Combat teams, attend your stations now!

371
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,376
- The vlinx is designated...
- Mel. Melanie!

372
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,096
- Prime battle coordinator.
- Power up the indigo device.

373
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,456
Rose, I want you to bio-sync Ruby

374
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,576
- for the flight.
- I'm on it.

375
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,176
- Did you say flight?
- Yes, I did.

376
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,776
- <i>Gold alert. Gold alert.
- Anita, Anita, keep that door open.</i>

377
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,656
I need you to keep real time flowing.

378
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,136
Hey. Hi. Bel, trust me.

379
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,336
We're going down to
floor minus 10, yeah?

380
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,640
- Come on.
- Activating weapons platform.

381
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,040
<i>- Warning. Null-space activation.
- Warning. Null-space activation.</i>

382
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,416
Is it ready?

383
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,176
If I have to hold it together
with my bare hands.

384
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,856
- Yes, it's ready.
- What is that thing?

385
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,176
I call it a zero room.

386
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,336
We're half a mile underground.
We're shielded from all signals.

387
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,256
And the room inside that thing,
it is beyond time and space.

388
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,616
It will exist outside of reality.

389
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,256
We put poppy in and if the wish
comes to an end, we open it up.

390
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,336
And poppy will still exist?

391
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,016
- I hope.
- You hope?

392
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,416
I will do everything I can to make it work.

393
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,016
I owe the doctor my life, miss chandra.

394
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,600
I won't let him down.

395
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,536
Do you mean poppy goes in there alone?

396
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,410
<i>Cause I'm telling you, she does not.</i>

397
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
I'm going with her.

398
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,200
And I can't help you in the fight.

399
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,496
My battle is in there, saving my daughter.

400
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,656
Bel, if the rani wins
and we are destroyed,

401
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,616
you will be locked in
there for all eternity.

402
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,960
You wouldn't starve or
age or suffocate. You'd just...

403
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,520
You'd just be. Forever.

404
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,080
- With poppy.
- With poppy.

405
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,280
Let's do it.

406
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,536
Open the parallax cannons.

407
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,960
- Fire!
- Maximum parallax!

408
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,376
<i>Caution. Zero coordinates
mapped on to real time dynamics.</i>

409
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,616
<i>Repeat. Zero coordinates
mapped on to real time dynamics.</i>

410
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,360
<i>Warning. Floor minus ten
is now an instability zone.</i>

411
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,880
- What if it doesn't work?
- I think we won't remember.

412
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,590
She will fade away like gossamer.
It'll be like poppy never existed.

413
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,490
- That will never happen.
- Never.

414
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,896
Because it makes sense now. I
was meant to meet you, belinda.

415
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,840
It was all for this, so
that poppy can live.

416
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,920
Close it.

417
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,520
- Double galvanic beams.
- Fire!

418
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,936
<i>Squad 1, maintain position.</i>

419
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,896
- They're getting closer.
- Squad 2, maintain position.

420
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,760
- More power.
- Squad 3, terminated.

421
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
<i>Squad 4, defend the east flank.</i>

422
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,256
- What's that for?
- It's like a bio sync-up thing.

423
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,160
It makes the software respond to you.

424
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,776
The indigo device is a
transmat, like a matter transporter.

425
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,320
You'll be fine as long as you
don't press the yellow button.

426
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,056
My god. It really works.

427
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,040
Press the blue button.

428
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,936
That'll get you to Conrad

429
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,296
so you can stop him and
bring his wish to an end.

430
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,656
Well, how do I do that? What
do I do? Can I punch him?

431
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,880
Yes, you can.

432
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,216
Medic! Medic!

433
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,736
Parallax cannons, east 21.6.

434
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,240
Fire!

435
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,696
Well, hang on. What about
Anita and her magic doors?

436
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,056
I'm just a hotelier, really.

437
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,576
Well, can't you get us into the palace?

438
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,576
Anita needs to keep that door open
or you lot will slip back into the wish.

439
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,336
Now, the bone palace is protected.

440
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,616
It has a threshold.

441
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,696
If you tried to transmat in there,

442
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,936
- you'd be pureed, baby girl.
- Nice.

443
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,176
I need to get in there,

444
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,336
lower the threshold
so I can stop the rani.

445
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,336
- But how can you do that?
- I... I tricked her.

446
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,800
Copied her coding.

447
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,576
Bone beast three, out of range.

448
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,136
We're turning, west 44.5.

449
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,080
All personnel, hold on tight.

450
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,840
<i>Warning, revolve protocols.</i>

451
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,280
- Galvanic beams at maximum.
- Fire!

452
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,576
Get to cover!

453
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,896
Shirley, monitor the
threshold on frequency five.

454
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,896
As soon as it falls, Ruby,
activate the indigo device.

455
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,576
Fly well, doctor.

456
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,096
If we die here today, I love you lot.

457
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,640
Just shut up and go!

458
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,776
Protect the retrofold cables.

459
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,960
Keep the red-links connected.

460
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,760
Threshold down!

461
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,760
Come on!

462
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,840
Like I wasn't ready for you.

463
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,776
- Ouch!
- You were too late, doctor.

464
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,000
The portal has locked on to its target.

465
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,336
And you're really very obvious.

466
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,296
I know you haven't
arrived with a weapon.

467
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,096
Only a speech, some
dazzling words, maybe a pun

468
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,376
and then some lachrymose
little tug-the-heartstrings

469
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,016
mimosa-scented platitudes
about the power of love.

470
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,136
But aren't you tempted,
doctor, to start again?

471
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,296
The time lords reborn?

472
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,176
The time lords of omega
were tyrants and murderers.

473
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,696
Then rebuild them with us.

474
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,496
You're not amongst the
humans now. Stop pretending.

475
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,576
You're a lord of time
and space. Now act like it.

476
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,936
Don't you want to see
him? The almighty one.

477
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,320
Don't you?

478
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,456
Yes.

479
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,280
Omega locked and approaching.

480
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,856
Here he comes. Back to reality.

481
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,760
What is that? What is
that? Is that a doorway or...

482
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,400
The tomb of omega or
his prison, his asylum?

483
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,440
I suggest we find out.

484
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,640
I want to say thank you.

485
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,480
- Sure.
- I mean it.

486
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,976
Because Conrad's world, it
could've been so much worse.

487
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,336
A fantasy world, I'd expect guns
and whisky and girls, but yours is nice.

488
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,616
- It's actually nice.
- I did what he said.

489
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,936
- Who?
- The doctor.

490
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,096
He told me people just want
to be safe and fed and warm.

491
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,456
So that's what I did.

492
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,640
And you tried to give everyone a family.

493
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,736
All that time we spent together,
you never mentioned your dad.

494
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,136
You never ever mentioned your father.

495
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,416
And I... I wonder why.

496
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,680
You don't know me at all.

497
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,576
A heartbeat.

498
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,040
A double heartbeat.

499
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,256
Omega lives.

500
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,976
Omega. Omega. Omega

501
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,736
I summon you, creator of the time lords.

502
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,936
Come back to this world.

503
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Omega. Omega. Omega. Omega.
Omega. Omega. Omega. Omega.

504
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,760
But some of it was true.

505
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
You and me.

506
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Because I was there, Conrad.

507
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,000
In the dark, when I made you smile.

508
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,840
That was real.

509
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,136
Omega. Omega. Omega. Omega.
Omega. Omega. Omega. Omega.

510
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,600
Drone guards, stand by.

511
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Yes.

512
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,280
What?

513
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,536
Rani, get back.

514
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,776
But what is it?

515
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,800
The under verse is a world of legends,
so omega has become his own legend.

516
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,680
He is the mad god,

517
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
the titan,

518
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,160
the original sin.

519
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,016
I will become the god of time

520
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,656
with time lords to feast upon.

521
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,760
Well, I think you'll find...

522
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,280
So sweet.

523
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,696
Omega.

524
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Omega!

525
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,480
Remember me?

526
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,056
My little doctor.

527
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,736
It's been a very long time.

528
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,456
May I introduce to you the rani.

529
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,880
This little thing?

530
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,320
So much for the two ranis.

531
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,960
It's a goodnight from me.

532
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,000
Thanks.

533
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,376
Omega.

534
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,720
The very first time lord.

535
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,480
May I ask, what is your intent?

536
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,200
I am free to feast upon this world.

537
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,056
None shall stop me.

538
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,680
Then there's nothing I can do.

539
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,456
I stand here without hope or help.

540
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,840
Just thinking if only...

541
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,800
If only I had a weapon...

542
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,120
Hiding in plain sight.

543
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,440
Wait a minute.

544
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,600
The power of one billion supernovas.

545
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,280
Conrad.

546
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,160
I wish you to be happy.

547
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,920
Back into hell!

548
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,440
End the wish.

549
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,600
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

550
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,216
Don't you ever wonder deep
down in both your hearts,

551
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,960
where your tardis is?

552
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,880
We were in the tardis.

553
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,120
Back to floor minus ten.

554
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,720
It's okay.

555
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,656
Can't we wish for poppy?

556
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,080
But then she might vanish...

557
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,600
When I do this.

558
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,400
Because I must.

559
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,720
No more wishes.

560
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,856
Ooh.

561
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,980
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

562
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,600
I don't know.

563
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,320
Poppy.

564
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,040
Baby!

565
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,840
Poppy!

566
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,600
My god.

567
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Hey. Boop.

568
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,336
Well, we know he's human by birth.

569
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,000
We just don't know where
in time and space he's from.

570
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,736
Do we? We don't know.

571
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,576
Hey, he's a foundling just like me.

572
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Like me.

573
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,296
So, I thought,

574
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,480
- who is the best mother in the world?
- Me.

575
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,800
But I am too busy playing poker.

576
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,816
Cherry.

577
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,976
But we can't just

578
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,736
I mean, there's paperwork and all sorts.

579
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,440
Paperwork is sorted.

580
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
Joseph.

581
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,416
Joseph was my late husband's name.

582
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,096
- Aw, Joe Sunday.
- Aw. Joe Sunday.

583
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,256
- Little Joe Sunday.
- Yeah.

584
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,896
And what about you, doctor?

585
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,056
Ruby says you're a father now.

586
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,640
I pity the child.

587
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,370
But what will you do?

588
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,150
You can't run around
like a nutcase anymore.

589
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,640
Things will have to change.

590
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
I know.

591
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,520
Poppy! Where's my girl?

592
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,496
She's too big for this
already. Aren't you, poppy?

593
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,816
She'll climb out. This
place is a deathtrap.

594
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,496
I know, I know, I know.

595
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,896
We need rails. Safety rails
going all the way around.

596
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,336
It's gonna look amazing.

597
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,376
So what are you guys
gonna do, the three of you?

598
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,576
- Like, settle down?
- Absolutely not.

599
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,616
My daughter's not
gonna have a boring life.

600
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,336
We can go anywhere

601
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,976
and everywhere and
show her everything.

602
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,896
Are you too hot in this, pops?

603
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,136
It's always cold in here, but
for the first time it's too warm.

604
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,840
That's the tardis accommodating.

605
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,136
There's one thing I still don't understand.

606
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,856
How come my memory was different?

607
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,656
Why did I remember things
that no one else could?

608
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,376
I have no idea,

609
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,576
but we have seen many a
strange thing together, Ruby-roo.

610
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,696
Hey, it's a skill!

611
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,960
It's a skill.

612
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,856
We'll need all sorts of
things, like a room for toys.

613
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,920
I can do that. I can do that. I
can turn the tardis into anything.

614
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,456
We can put a room
off there or anywhere.

615
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,376
I wonder where we take her first.

616
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,256
She could see Neptune. No!

617
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,376
- She could see kerala!
- Kerala.

618
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,536
I have never been.

619
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,660
All of the universe
and I have never been.

620
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,416
We can go and see my
uncle roo. He's wonderful.

621
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,496
In the year 60,000, there is a
planet called new New Delhi.

622
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,960
- We are going there.
- We're going there.

623
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,496
Isn't it funny? I used
to say take me home.

624
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,296
And now you wanna stay. I knew it.

625
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,560
I knew. I knew I would
get you in the end.

626
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,696
I wanna see planets and galaxies.

627
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,696
I wanna see the big bang.

628
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,240
Mate, we will have the best of times.

629
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Where's she gone?

630
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,640
- Who?
- Poppy.

631
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,720
Who's poppy?

632
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,200
But...

633
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,856
One more thing I've gotta sort out.

634
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,680
Okay. Let's see.

635
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,776
Because the robots...

636
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,136
The robots from
missbelindachandra one.

637
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,336
Ruby, I had a whole planet
named after me. It was so mad.

638
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,256
They picked up the
star register in the future

639
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,030
after the rani destroyed the earth.

640
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,256
Now, the planet is not destroyed,

641
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,160
so I've gotta Chuck this
thing back out into space,

642
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,240
then the robots can find it.

643
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,640
History is intact. Thank you very much.

644
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,280
- Doctor, where's she gone?
- Who?

645
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,080
- Poppy.
- Who's poppy?

646
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,120
Your daughter.

647
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,336
What do you mean?

648
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,880
You have a daughter.
The two of you. Together.

649
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,860
I think I'd remember that.

650
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
Imagine.

651
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,440
But what... what do you think the cot is?

652
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,336
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

653
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,600
There... there was... There
was a little girl named poppy.

654
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,840
A long time ago.

655
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,520
That space baby lives far
away in a different world.

656
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,080
Ruby, I think your memory
got a little bit scrambled.

657
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,536
Belinda, where shall we go?

658
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,496
There's a great big
universe waiting for us.

659
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,896
Take me to the stars.

660
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,320
Good. Good. Good, good, good.

661
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,770
Let me just make sure
everything is back in place.

662
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,696
Look out. Here he is. Trouble.

663
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,560
And you're just in time, doctor.

664
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,240
Here it comes.

665
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,496
- At last!
- It is now officially may the 24th.

666
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,080
The day we thought would never arrive.

667
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,000
Congratulations.

668
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,856
Welcome.

669
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,680
Happy may the 24th.

670
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,440
- Happy 24th.
- Happy 24th.

671
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,160
And I better go.

672
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,040
That signals the end
of my time here, I think.

673
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,080
Anita, you are so amazing. I...

674
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,680
Thank you.

675
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,816
You're very welcome to stay, Anita.

676
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,696
You could work for unit. You'd
be very useful with a key like that.

677
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,776
I'm so sorry, but this key is far
too powerful for the 21st century.

678
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,256
And they only gave me one day.

679
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,830
I'm not allowed to stay.
There's far too much to do.

680
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,240
- They say hello, by the way.
- Who does?

681
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,880
The boss.

682
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,120
Okay. Parking that.

683
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,816
So, the entire world is back to normal?

684
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,536
Yes. Yes!

685
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,040
And we... are off to Neptune.

686
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,096
See you later.

687
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,576
- Come on, rubes, we'll pop you home.
- No, no. Just wait. It's important.

688
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,416
Is the world exactly as it was?

689
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,656
Well, funny you should say.
There are tiny little changes.

690
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,936
Like, Conrad's world was sort of glitchy.

691
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,640
Now we've got the same.

692
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,576
We're getting reports that the
border between Norway and Sweden

693
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,656
has moved seven miles east.

694
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,960
And the colour teal is a bit more blue.

695
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,776
And Ernest borgnine is still alive.

696
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,856
So there are mistakes.

697
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,056
It was bound to happen, Ruby.
Reality shifted on a massive scale.

698
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,616
Ernest borgnine got lucky.

699
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,456
And there's one more big change.

700
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,280
Mel found this.

701
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,720
<i>Reporting from empress
house. And I found him.</i>

702
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,216
<i>He posted this online.</i>

703
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
<i>Stop filming me.</i>

704
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,480
<i>Nice.</i>

705
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,656
<i>Chief cook and bottle washer.</i>

706
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,360
<i>Nice little place in lewisham.</i>

707
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,416
<i>I looked inside. It's harmless.</i>

708
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,136
<i>And no one remembers
him from the old days.</i>

709
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,616
<i>That Conrad's been
forgotten. Even by himself.</i>

710
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,520
<i>I think Ruby did a very kind thing.</i>

711
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,960
The gods are full of tricks.

712
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,920
One wish survived.

713
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,656
And it turns out to be him, not poppy.

714
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,800
Ruby. Ruby, I told you
there is no one called poppy.

715
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,896
Kate, do you remember a
child called poppy in this room?

716
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,080
No.

717
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,360
- Do you?
- No.

718
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,176
The vlinx, do you have any record

719
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,456
of a child called poppy, in
this building, on may the 23rd?

720
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,760
Negative.

721
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,896
Shirley, do you remember her?

722
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
No.

723
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,056
Susan, you saved poppy's life.
You built a zero room to save her.

724
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,160
Surely you've got to remember that.

725
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,440
There is a zero room on floor minus ten.

726
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,776
I built it like an escape
pod. For all of us.

727
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,056
Poppy went in there.

728
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,840
We all watched her come out.

729
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,016
- We saw it. We did.
- Ruby, I'm sorry,

730
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,896
but you are remembering this wrong.

731
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,376
And not to be rude,

732
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,900
but it's kind of offensive to say
I've got a daughter I don't remember.

733
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,496
Poppy's your daughter?

734
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,616
Well, exactly.

735
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,376
She doesn't exist.

736
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,800
So what we're saying is, my
memory is one of the glitches.

737
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,216
- It must be.
- I'm glitching?

738
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,896
- Yes.
- Poppy's a glitch?

739
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,920
Yes.

740
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,016
Except the glitches were
real before they changed.

741
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,496
Because I was right in
the wish world, wasn't I?

742
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,576
And I'm right now.

743
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,856
Conrad wasn't some nice, happy chef,

744
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,056
- was he, Kate?
- No.

745
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,896
And that's not teal, is it?

746
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,296
No, it's too blue.

747
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,536
Don't you see? There's another world.

748
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,176
A slightly different reality.

749
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,416
And it might just be a tiny
little change, but she's a child.

750
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,936
She's a little girl and she's so beautiful.

751
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,296
Her name is poppy, and
she's lost somewhere out there.

752
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,536
Ruby, I'm not wrong on this.

753
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,136
Doctor, one life has disappeared.
And you know this can happen.

754
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,816
You know this better than anyone
because it has happened before.

755
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,096
It happened to me, remember?

756
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,696
I'm looking for your daughter, Ruby.

757
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,176
- Who's Ruby?
- That Christmas

758
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,456
I was that life. I ceased to exist.

759
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,456
<i>And you did everything
you could to bring me back</i>

760
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,360
because you couldn't bear a
world with one person missing.

761
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,056
You did that for me too.

762
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,760
I was trapped in that time explosion.

763
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,520
I was a baby.

764
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,000
And you were there.

765
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,656
You said you went through my entire life.

766
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,130
That car when you were seven.

767
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,680
- That was you.
- Yeah, but... You saved me.

768
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,056
I'm barely a year old.

769
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,480
Born out of the tardis, remember?

770
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,400
You set me free and saved my life.

771
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,400
You save all of us.

772
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,000
Sometimes I think we're all your children.

773
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,440
We're missing one person.

774
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,800
Your daughter.

775
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,656
I have a daughter?

776
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,000
Yes.

777
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,520
If poppy's real, that
means she was mine.

778
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,400
I will find her.

779
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,200
Bel, I swear on my life I
will do anything to find her.

780
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,216
But, doctor, we can help.

781
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,536
We've got the time window.

782
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,096
We've got temporal dams. We've
got retrodynamic artron cascades.

783
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,920
Time has shifted by one degree.

784
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,096
By the tiniest little degree.

785
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,096
There is no technology in the
universe that can change that.

786
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,600
There is only one thing
that is strong enough...

787
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,336
To change reality one tiny degree.

788
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,256
Which is what?

789
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,630
The last of the time lords.

790
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,320
Okay.

791
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,016
Poppy.

792
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,280
Her name is poppy.

793
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,120
Okay. Her name is poppy.

794
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,600
Aw, man, I like this face.

795
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,250
What are you showing me that for?

796
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,280
Man.

797
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,640
Man.

798
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,016
Let's be honest.

799
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,200
I was the best.

800
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,936
Okay, let's say best male.

801
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,280
But don't tell the others.

802
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,000
What? How?

803
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,976
- How are you here?
- I know.

804
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,350
I shouldn't be here at all.

805
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,536
Cause and effect is
getting a little bit out of order.

806
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,216
I'm surprised it's not the other
guy. He is always turning up.

807
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,520
You've redecorated.

808
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,256
I don't like it.

809
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,976
Does it really need to be bigger
in a room defined by its bigness?

810
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,096
But why are you here?

811
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,696
I've been popped out, like
popped out of my timeline

812
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,256
because there's a great big time
schism on its way, caused by you.

813
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,456
Time needs to be shifted, doctor.

814
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,216
So I am going to punch a
ton of regeneration energy

815
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,616
into the vortex to jolt it. One degree.

816
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,656
- Giving your life?
- A life for a life.

817
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,056
Because I saved the world
at the expense of one person.

818
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,216
And that is no world at all.

819
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,696
There won't be any worlds.

820
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,976
If you rupture the time vortex, you
could damage the whole of creation.

821
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,200
Is that why you're here?

822
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,480
To stop me?

823
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,800
Nah, it was never gonna work.

824
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,536
Blimey, you're gorgeous.
Your face is absolutely beautiful.

825
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,136
Well, it will be our last
one if I get this wrong.

826
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,360
Don't get it wrong then.

827
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,520
Good idea.

828
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,280
This is gonna eat my soul.

829
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,050
- No chance of bi-generation?
- No chance of what?

830
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,936
Never mind. Forget I said anything.

831
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,480
Just... this is gonna hurt.

832
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,216
Try shifting your third
strand of phenotype markers

833
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,096
one micro-spasm to the left.

834
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,120
Just might help.

835
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,320
That is clever.

836
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,056
But, hold on

837
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,536
I'm older than you.
Why didn't I know that?

838
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,110
- You know, it's all a bit - timey wimey.
- Time-wimey.

839
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,400
- Is that still a thing?
- Going strong.

840
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,540
We never change.

841
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,000
All these faces and
we never really change.

842
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,976
- Man.
- You scared?

843
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,496
Terrified.

844
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,880
Don't go in fear.

845
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,480
Go with that lovely smile.

846
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I just wish we...

847
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,680
We had longer.

848
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,440
May we always wish that.

849
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,800
We're stretching the timeline too far.

850
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,296
I've got to go.

851
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,320
Back to my old life.

852
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,600
Bye then.

853
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
Good luck.

854
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,880
I love you, doctor.

855
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,056
I never say things like that.

856
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,840
That's why you got me.

857
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,336
I should say that to yaz.

858
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,560
You never do.

859
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,800
But she knows.

860
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,880
- Goodbye, doctor.
- Goodbye, doctor.

861
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,936
No.

862
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,040
Not yet.

863
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,816
Here he is.

864
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,056
Bad penny.

865
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,056
Go on then, mystery man.
Where have you been?

866
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,200
I would love to be called bad penny.

867
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,680
But... what...

868
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,440
What happened?

869
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,310
You were there, and then you were gone.

870
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,496
But come on. She's waiting.

871
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,370
- Who is?
- Poppy.

872
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,720
Poppy.

873
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,936
Poppy, poppy, poppy, poppy, poppy!

874
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,160
- Isn't she beautiful?
- The best. How could I forget?

875
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,296
Remind me, what happened...

876
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,536
What happened again?
I was with you and then...

877
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,800
Well, we stopped the rani.

878
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,456
And then all of unit
got busy all of a sudden.

879
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,640
Then I turned around and you'd gone.

880
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,336
And I had to get back home.
Cause that was the point.

881
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,736
All this time I had to be here,

882
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,496
in this house, at 7:30 A.M.
on the 24th of may, remember?

883
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,760
I kept telling you every time we landed.

884
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,896
Doctor, I told you. Get me home!

885
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,696
24th of may 2025.

886
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,170
I need to get back for poppy.

887
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,336
Never mind Miami.

888
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,776
Poppy's waiting for me.

889
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,800
My daughter.

890
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,816
Will I ever see her again?

891
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,536
Never mind happy new year.

892
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,776
I've got to be home for
poppy on may the 24th.

893
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,176
If I'm not back by 7:30, I'm in trouble.

894
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,880
I can't wait for you to meet
poppy. She's so cheeky.

895
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,520
So you were...

896
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,456
You were always
coming home for poppy.

897
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,580
Exactly.

898
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,016
I got taken away by
the robots on the 23rd.

899
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,896
And for my timeline to get back to
normal, I had to be here, for poppy,

900
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,296
on the 24th of may at 7:30 A.M.

901
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,456
But why 7:30?

902
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,296
Right. Better be off.

903
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,176
Bit early for gentlemen callers, belinda.

904
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,616
But he's a nice one.

905
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,936
This is my mum, lakshmi.

906
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,976
Hello. I have heard so much about you.

907
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,496
And this, um, is one of the
doctors from the hospital.

908
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,896
At last. I keep telling her
to bring home a doctor.

909
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,376
- Amma.
- No, no, no, not for you.

910
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,536
For me, doctor.

911
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,416
You see, I have this pain down
my left side every time I turn corners.

912
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,816
- Right.
- It's really... That's for me.

913
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,256
I got to go. I've got a
concert in Manchester.

914
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,496
- Good luck.
- Lovely meeting you.

915
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,416
And you as well.

916
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,816
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

917
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,856
Bye, poppy love.

918
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,880
Bye-bye.

919
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,096
So you... you had to come
home because your mother

920
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,216
I'm on nights.

921
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,536
So mum and dad had poppy.

922
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,216
I had to be back for 7:30...
Because Manchester.

923
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,280
You really have forgotten, haven't you?

924
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,520
I'm glad you managed to
find us so you can finally meet.

925
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,896
Poppy, this is uncle doctor.

926
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,120
I'm her uncle?

927
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,560
Well, I thought it sounded nice.

928
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,360
Who's her father?

929
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,360
- I've told you.
- Remind me.

930
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,560
Her father's ritchie.

931
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,496
Ritchie akingbola.

932
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,080
I've known him since I was 21.

933
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,416
We got together, and
well, poppy was born.

934
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,936
We're not together anymore.

935
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,736
We both wanted different
things, but he's a lovely man.

936
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,280
He sees her all the time.

937
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,440
He's a good soul. You'd like him.

938
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,760
I hope ritchie akingbola
knows how lucky he is

939
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,480
to be the father of a girl who is

940
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,136
one hundred per cent human
since the day she was born.

941
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,016
What else would she be?

942
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,256
Nothing. Nothing.

943
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,560
Poppy the human. Always and forever.

944
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,776
All is well with the universe.

945
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,336
I thought I had those grips.

946
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,216
You know, the ones for my
hands. Have you seen them?

947
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,976
I saw dad trying them out. I
think they're under the stairs.

948
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,440
Hold on.

949
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,000
Hello, pops.

950
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,640
Can I tell you a secret?

951
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,360
I can't have children.

952
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:37,960
But if I could, I wish that
she was exactly like you.

953
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,760
Boop.

954
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,620
Except I brought all the wishes to an end.

955
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,880
Clever old me.

956
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,720
There we go.

957
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,560
Hey.

958
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,000
You all right?

959
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,120
Yeah.

960
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,720
Yeah, just, you know, thinking.

961
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,800
The gods play tricks.

962
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,440
But I beat them.

963
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,880
I always win.

964
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,240
Thank you. For everything.

965
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,720
You've driven me absolutely mad.

966
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,960
But I've got to say, you're the
most amazing man in the world.

967
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,640
That sounds like a goodbye.

968
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,936
I wish we could come with you.

969
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,000
I'd love to show poppy the stars.

970
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,096
But you know what happens next.

971
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,736
She'll be shot at by lasers
or hunted by cartoons

972
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,160
or blown up by mad time ladies.

973
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,920
I can't do that to her.

974
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,296
It's been an honour,
miss belinda chandra.

975
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,896
An honour, a nightmare and a triumph.

976
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,016
Maybe when she's grown
up, you could come back?

977
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,096
Take me to Neptune?

978
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,176
I'd like that.

979
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,400
I'd love that.

980
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,320
But will you?

981
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,560
Will I ever see you again
or do you never go back?

982
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,600
I hope you'll see me again.

983
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,536
But not like this.

984
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,120
What does that mean?

985
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I've got to go.

986
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,640
Just...

987
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,440
Why does it feel like there's
something I've forgotten?

988
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,280
That's our lives, belinda.

989
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,480
We travel in and out of
the slipstreams of time.

990
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,960
Beautiful things can
be forgotten and gone.

991
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,240
But they still happened somewhere.

992
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,360
I think one thing remains.

993
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,760
I love you.

994
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,040
And I love you, pops.

995
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,240
That will never change.

996
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,800
Don't wanna do this alone.

997
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,080
I'm never alone with you.

998
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,320
Joy to the world!

999
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,840
And that is exactly the word.

1000
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,280
This has been an absolute joy.

1001
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,240
Hello.
