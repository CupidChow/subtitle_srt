Jingchu,

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,480
Father is still angry.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,790
Don't confront him right now.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,670
Admit to shielding the suspect first,

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,030
and clear your name

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,670
when the time is right.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,190
Qiao Ping took part

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,510
in both murder and kidnapping.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,310
Such crimes can't be forgiven.

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,590
Father, please see the truth.

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,370
You...

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,420
=Episode 21=
=The Grand Wedding=

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,750
Isn't he a prince?

24
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,750
Why would His Majesty punish him so harshly?

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,950
Though he is a prince,

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,470
he receives none of a Prince's privileges.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,550
Yesterday, His Majesty ordered him flogging

28
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,890
before granting him an audience.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,870
Has a physician seen him?
Did he get any medicine?

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,080
He is all right,

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,550
but he worries about you.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,830
He told me not to let you know.

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,290
Best if you act like you never heard.

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,720
I understand.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,960
Thank you.

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,790
Though punished,

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,830
he drew the Imperial Guards' attention.

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,870
The case files on Qiao Ping and Begonia Snow

39
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,780
have been submitted.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,710
Things might change soon.

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,790
Please wait here patiently.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
Miss Jiang.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,590
I'll take my leave now.

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,710
Even when things are tough for you,

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,310
you still risk yourself for me.

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,910
Xiao Jingchu,

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,510
am I really worth it?

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,760

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,740

Xiao Jingchu.

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,640
It's alright, let's go.

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
I'll get you out of here.

53

54

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,870
will be lost in the flames.

What's going on here?

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
Did you miss me?

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
Mm.

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,230

you're already gone?

Is that so?

81
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,040
So what will you do now?

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,710
Then use your life

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,190
to help me one last time.

88
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,510
As for whether you'll survive,

89
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,790
that depends on your fate.

90
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,310
I've come to bid you farewell.

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
Before I leave,

92
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,750
I'll deal with that wealthy merchant.

93
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,230
My Lady, please take care.

94
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,680
You may go now.

95
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,390
Will the Crown Prince treat you well?

96
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,880
He will.

97
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,310
Will he treat you better than I did?

98
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,480
Let go of...

99
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,550
Will he be like me,

100
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,670
ready to give his life for you?

101
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
They're here.

102
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,670
Jiang Leyao, receive the decree.

103
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,350
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees,

104
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,790
the case of Jiang Leyao

105
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,390
involves the life of Guard Qiao Ping.

106
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,390
After thorough investigation,

107
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,190
the evidence for Qiao Ping's death is solid.

108
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,430
Such deeds cannot be tolerated by law.

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,230

114
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,350
to the Meridian Gate for execution.

115
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,190
Let's see who dares touch her.

116
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,030
(I'm wondering)

117
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,030
(how Ning Bingqing's wedding is going.)

118
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,510
I'm angry, yes,

119
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,950
but I did watch her grow up.

120
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,110
That day when Jingchu came to see me.

121
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,470
That reminded me

122
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,430
her wedding with the Crown Prince

123
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,310
was indeed held in haste.

124
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,870
If I hadn't backed her,

125
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,230
she might never find her footing

126
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,670
in the Crown Prince's manor.

127
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,430
You're kind, Your Majesty,
and Jingchu is thoughtful.

This...

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,950
Why is no one on duty on a day like this?

130
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,160
