The End

Episode 16

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The End

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The End

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The End

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Episode 16

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is it.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Do you need me to do anything else?

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're just going to help me?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
After all, I have a request.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then answer my question.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Did you plan it when you agreed to help me find the book?

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
As long as the time is up, you can get your identity back.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So your target is not just Qi Zhen, Ning Tao, and Chang Rong'er?

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's the second question.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ning Tao's body is buried under the wall of the Second Garden.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Chang Rong'er reported to the government

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that Ning Tao went out to play, but didn't return.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you need it, you can tell me.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thank you, sir. But before that,

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I need to confirm something.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
After that,

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Chang Rong'er can die.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
There's no need to calculate between us.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
As long as it's about you, I'll do my best.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Second Miss, you look great in white.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You should wear it often.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Really? But Senior Sister is also in white.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm afraid it will hit her.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How can it be?

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Each of you is beautiful.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Greetings, Father and Elder Sister.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Greetings, masters.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Duke Ning, look.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Both of you are in white today.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You are all beautiful.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ice is cold and high-quality.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Luo Yao is simple and pure.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She's beautiful.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Father, I'm not feeling well.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll go back first.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Greetings, masters and Eldest Miss.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Greetings, masters.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Greetings, Elder Sister.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Masters, look.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Second Young Master is also in white today.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He's so beautiful with Eldest Miss.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's right. Ice is cold and high-quality.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Luo Yao is simple and pure.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ice is cold and high-quality.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is it like this again?

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Could this be the cause of that nightmare?

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What happened that night?

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The truth will be revealed soon.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Elder Miss, please forgive me.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Second Miss said she was in a dead end.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She was in a dead end.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She wanted to wear white to show her beauty.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A dead end?

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Good.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Tomorrow, the show of the Sea Sugar Snow

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
will be missing someone.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jiang Le Yao, no matter if you're reborn or not,

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
you can't escape this calamity.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Master, Li Yong hasn't been found yet.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It seems useless to find his name card

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
in his residence.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Li Yong is a dangerous man.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Put the focus on this name card.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's all female names.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Check if the missing woman

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
is the right one.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Second Miss, this is the soup

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I made for you.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Drink it while it's hot.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sister, this is the soup

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I made for you.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Drink it while it's hot.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you, Sister.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
After you became a maid,

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you've become more considerate.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's all because

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Second Miss taught me well.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Jiang Le Yao, if you don't drink it,

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
then you're reborn too.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If you don't drink it,

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
then you're reborn too.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you don't drink it,

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
then you're reborn too.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If you don't drink it,

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
then you're reborn too.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If you don't drink it,

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
then you're reborn too.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why does this soup

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
taste a little weird?

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You really know everything.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I have no appetite.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll just give it to you.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The secret arrow which you prepared

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
is really good.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:07:01,500
Thank you.

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,780
The more pure you are,

109
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,060
the more I want to destroy you.

110
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,420
Since you're also a reborn woman,

111
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,780
how can I put the medicine in the soup?

112
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,220
It's the same as the last life.

113
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,580
You can't escape.

114
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,700
Stop.

115
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,100
Mr. Xiao.

116
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,060
Mr. Xiao.

117
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,580
My second lady is ill.

118
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,220
I'm going to take her to the doctor.

119
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,180
Please let her go.

120
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,060
Get out.

121
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,540
Why did you kick me?

122
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,340
I'm fine.

123
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,940
It doesn't mean I'll be fine for a while.

124
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,060
The ointment is different from the medicine.

125
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,020
Even if it's a small amount,

126
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,860
you can't hold it.

127
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,420
It's ointment?

128
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,900
But I'm awake now.

129
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,540
No.

130
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,860
It's a rare opportunity.

131
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,020
I can't miss it.

132
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,580
I'm fine.

133
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,380
I'm fine.

134
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,620
it's a rare opportunity.

135
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,300
What happend?

136
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,060
Lu You?

137
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,060
Come on.

138
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,060
No. Let me go.

139
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,060
Let me go.

140
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,060
Let me go.

141
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,060
Let me go.

142
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
You had a nightmare?

143
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
It's not a dream.

144
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,060
Do you remember what I told you last night?

145
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
I can do anything for you

146
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
as long as you say it.

147
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,060
Now,

148
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,060
can you tell me what happened?

149
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,060
I...

150
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,060
You don't trust me?

151
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,060
I only trust myself.

152
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,060
I can do it now.

153
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
I won't bother you

154
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
with the rest.

155
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,060
I won't bother you.

156
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,060
You think I'm willing to do it?

157
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,060
I'm so idle.

158
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
Wang Yan.

159
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,060
Sir.

160
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,060
Go dig out Ning Tao's body.

161
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,060
Take it back with me.

162
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
Yes.

163
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
I had a nightmare.

164
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,060
Miss.

165
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,060
What are you going to do?

166
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,060
Kill.

167
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
Kill you.

168
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,060
Miss.

169
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,060
Miss.

170
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Miss.
