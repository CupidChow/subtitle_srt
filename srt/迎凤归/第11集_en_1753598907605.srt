00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,500
Whew

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,060
In fact,

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,140
Chicken

5
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,700
Has a sentence

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,240
Laugh

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,100
Is within

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,060
According to painting

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,140
File

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,820
goner

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,040
you

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,540
There are

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:00:59,700
In.:

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,060
What does it matter

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,420
that you're here at this late hour?

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,260
Do you know what you're doing?

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,620
Ning Bingqing

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,060
is not only the legitimate daughter of Duke Ning,

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,460
but also the future Crown Princess Consort

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,740
and the beloved one of the Empress Dowager.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,020
This is my business.

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,860
It has nothing to do with you.

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,260
Nothing to do with me?

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,900
In your eyes,

25
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,340
we're just unrelated people.

26
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,580
What else?

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,420
We're just using each other.

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,500
Using each other?

29
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,340
Jiang Liyou,

30
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,300
are you in your senses?

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,540
Don't forget

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,900
that you were the one who started it.

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,140
Why can't you

34
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
stop talking now

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,700
and take responsibility?

36
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,620
How can you

37
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,860
not feel me

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,740
is the reason for this?

39
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,580
Do you really

40
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,220
want to Table Tのahead with me?

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,980
We've always been in business.

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,540
We work together now.

43
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,500
Wuji,

44
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,580
let's keep shorn away

45
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,500
from each other's lives.

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,620
Next time, I will be for Wuji's sake.

47
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,900
Take care of the tribe.

48
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,020
Lady Ning from the Tong Family.

49
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,720
You don't want

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
It's not that you don't know my background.

51
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,760
Even if I become

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,000
the Lady of Ning Mansion,

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,740
I'm still a

54
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,840
surviving woman.

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,960
It's not hard to become

56
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
the real Lady.

57
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,800
She's really a beauty.

58
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,960
It's a pity to be a maid.

59
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,840
But I...

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,200
I can only serve people.

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,200
That's great.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,200
Look.

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,840
We look so alike.

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,360
Don't fight with me, Miss Chang.

65
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,200
How can I compare with you?

66
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,800
I only deserve to serve you.

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,760
The person I lack most

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,000
is the one who serves me.

69
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
The person I lack

70
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,560
is the one who can replace me.

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,360
From tomorrow,

72
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,080
you must live with me.

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,760
You must try to become me.

74
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,200
Do you understand?

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,640
Left shoulder is tall, right arm is long.

76
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,480
The legs are thick and thin.

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
The waist is small.

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
It's not suitable.

79
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,560
There's no one in this world

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
who is perfect.

81
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
What are you doing?

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,760
Wait.

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,840
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,720
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,280
Miss Chang is here.

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,520
Miss Chang,

93
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,680
you're strong.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,280
I...

95
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you think

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
those ladies are just

97
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,680
because they're noble?

98
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,960
If you don't experience these,

99
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,480
what's the difference

100
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
between you and those rough girls?

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
The most important thing is to

102
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,920
marry a noble girl.

103
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,320
So what?

104
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,720
After I got married,

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,920
I was still locked up in the house.

106
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,320
I was tortured by them.

107
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,600
They were so weak

108
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
and cold.

109
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,000
They even broke into the ghost house.

110
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,320
I couldn't cut my shoulder

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
or lift my arm.

112
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,280
If I was rejected by my husband,

113
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,840
how could I survive?

114
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,280
But she's a girl.

115
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,800
So if you don't want to be rejected,

116
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,240
you can only learn to marry.

117
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,120
Your Excellency,

118
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,120
do you want to go out and have a look?

119
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
I got news from Ning's mansion.

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Miss Jiang was held in a tight grip

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,680
and lay in bed for two days.

122
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
She's very pitiful.

123
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,000
Her business

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,880
has nothing to do with me.

125
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,520
Her business has nothing to do with me.

126
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,840
You're fired.

127
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,920
What a bad mouth!

128
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,200
How can I use

129
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,480
such a good pen?

130
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,600
This is a rare medicine.

131
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,440
It's said to be a secret recipe in the palace.

132
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,680
You can cure it

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,480
by applying it once.

134
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,680
Where did you get this medicine?

135
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,960
I know this fellow.

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,360
You finally became me.

137
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,120
This is idiotic.

138
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,280
Eating it

139
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,240
is being out of reality.

140
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,800
It's a lie.

141
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,440
How could that be applied to reality?

142
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
You've misunderstood me.

143
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm not even plastic

144
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,640
as you.

145
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,680
I'm just a token

146
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,000
of the seal of act.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,960
I also lit up

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
the fire.

149
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
A token!..

150
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,000
I lighted up the fire

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,600
It's just a token of filial piety.

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,800
You're a lowly thing.

153
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,040
You want to betray me?

154
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,680
Listen to me.

155
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,560
Ningfu can't leave me.

156
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,120
Neither can they.

157
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,440
You're just a substitute I found.

158
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,280
A bitch.

159
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,200
Father said

160
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,520
the past will pass away

161
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,920
and she'll be a good girl in the future.

162
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
I can't disappoint my father.

163
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,400
The Fifth Princess of Ningdu

164
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,820
why did she become

165
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,360
so emotional and displeased?

166
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,800
Who was she talking about heat?

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Is it that masked man?

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I must speed up.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You don't have to be angry.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No matter how hard you try,

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
you can't get rid of the bitterness of the villagers.

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But father said

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
he was innocent.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
A ten-year-old girl

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
is just a little advantage.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Give me your tongue.

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I hate innocent people.

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I must destroy them.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I must destroy them.
