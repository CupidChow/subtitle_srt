Did you see who was lying on the table?

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why is he so serious?

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Everyone who is in charge of the Fulong Cake is like this.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The show is about to start.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Enjoy it.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So funny.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sister Zheng, we are women.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why are you laughing?

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We are strong and weak.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Where are you going?

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm not feeling well.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I want to go back.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You can't go up there.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's go.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's wrong?

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Bad news!

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We are drowning!

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go!

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We are drowning!

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hurry up!

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hurry up!

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hurry up!

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's really you.

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Go.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hurry up!

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I just watched half of the show.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How can I be so helpless?

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hurry up!

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hurry up!

46
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hurry up!

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hurry up!

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hurry up!

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hurry up!

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hurry up!

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hurry up!

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hurry up!

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hurry up!

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hurry up!

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hurry up!

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hurry up!

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Wait for me.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's going on?

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hurry up!

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We are drowning.

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm coming, woman!

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Please let me go.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm begging you.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you know what you said to me when you let me go?

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are going to die.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Today, I will give you the same flower.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Zhang Liyou!

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yao Jiangchu!

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Aren't you from the Shadow Division?

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why are you still standing there?

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you a dead man?

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why are you still standing there?

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hurry up and catch him!

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Leave him to me.

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I will help you to get justice.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hurry up!

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Your Excellency.

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Leave us.

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you want to take a rest?

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm fine.

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm fine.

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm fine.

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm fine.

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm fine.

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You are fine.

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you want to take a rest?

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You really won't catch me?

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No.

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You won't ask me why?

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No.

91
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But I want to tell you.

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
After the sugar-coated snow,

93
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I had another chance.

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But I can't forget the pain of that night.

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I was in good health.

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But I felt very, very hot.

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I only got better after I got myself.

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I only got better after I got myself.

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I will help you in the future.

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I want justice.

101
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I want justice.

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Besides,

103
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Mr. Xiao,

104
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
what I want

105
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
is never a person who only cares about me.

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What I want

107
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
is not given by Mr. Xiao.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Jingle You.

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will be your driver in the future.

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You just need to be yourself.

111
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm fine.

112
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm fine.

113
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm fine.

114
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm fine.

115
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm fine.

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm fine.

117
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm fine.

118
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm fine.

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm fine.

120
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm fine.

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm fine.

122
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm fine.

123
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm fine.

124
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm fine.

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm fine.

126
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm fine.

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm fine.

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm fine.

129
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm fine.

130
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm fine.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm fine.

132
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm fine.

133
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm fine.

134
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm fine.

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm fine.

136
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm fine.

137
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm fine.

138
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm fine.

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm fine.

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
A long memory is blown away.

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Drunk and in love.

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Afraid of dust and dust.

143
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Afraid of years and never come back.
