1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,220
Can't escape the cold maps broke the

2
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,540
Watching You

3
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,380
Episode 20

4
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Your grandfather

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,240
had the gr estimates of it

6
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,100
when he got married to you and that Qingun

7
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,580
Not all of us wereicit,

8
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,400
but

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,040
once he got married to you

10
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,220
and Tao Er is happy about it.

11
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,660
From now on,

12
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,660
you should be a good son

13
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,100
and be a good father.

14
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
Yes, I understand.

15
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,180
In order to take care of Young Master Tao

16
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,500
and his family in the future,

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,300
I hope you can

18
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,660
give me the right to his family.

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,380
That's good.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,380
Congratulations, Young Madam Tao.

21
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,820
Today is the day

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,380
you and Young Master Tao are getting married.

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,980
You should celebrate it

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,020
with a table of wine

25
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,500
and let the servants in the mansion

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,780
know you as their master.

27
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,860
It makes sense.

28
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,100
Today, I'll cook for you in person.

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,180
I hope you can enjoy it.

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,700
Great.

31
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,540
This...

32
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,100
This is a good idea.

33
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,580
Young Master Tao,

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,780
Young Madam Tao is too tired

35
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,180
to go to the wedding.

36
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,620
So she prepared a box of food.

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,820
Please have a taste.

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,700
It's a big place.

39
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,980
I dare not leave it.

40
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,460
It's nothing.

41
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,860
You...

42
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,820
Please leave.

43
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,580
I didn't expect the study to be so strict.

44
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,020
How can I eat it?

45
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,020
Let me ask you.

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,980
Why did you lose money this month?

47
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,580
Did you lose your money?

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,980
You're pretending to be dumb, aren't you?

49
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,820
You're a bitch.

50
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,460
Let's see how I'll take you...

51
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,100
Stop.

52
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,700
Who are you?

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,260
Get lost.

54
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,860
Get lost.

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,060
Thank you, Young Madam Tao.

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,260
Get up.

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,020
Are you Madam Zhao?

58
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,220
I didn't save you out of a sudden.

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,140
I want to cooperate with you.

60
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,260
You've been wandering outside the study

61
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,260
of Duke of the State for days.

62
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,580
You want to borrow the study?

63
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,940
Yes.

64
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,940
Are you willing to help me?

65
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,860
It's okay.

66
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,660
If you don't want to,

67
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,060
just pretend that I didn't say anything today.

68
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,380
Ten taels of silver.

69
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,220
I need ten taels of silver to pay for my own loss.

70
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,980
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,940
You little bitch.

72
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,820
You always run to Duke of the State.

73
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,180
Don't you just want to get out of bed?

74
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,540
Sleep.

75
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
I want to sleep with you.

76
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
I'm cold.

77
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,660
I'm going to make you a sweet potato cake.

78
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,580
You...

79
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,700
Go to sleep with the sister

80
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,180
who just went over, okay?

81
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,780
She's warm now.

82
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,700
Okay.

83
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,140
Jiang Le Yao.

84
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,540
I'm so merciful

85
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,580
to give you the chance to climb the bed.

86
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,500
You have to enjoy it.

87
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,900
Sleep.

88
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,420
I...

89
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:26,940
I want to sleep.

90
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,540
Let me go.

91
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,260
Let me go.

92
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,860
I want to sleep.

93
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,620
I'm no longer the Jiang Le Yao

94
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,500
who used to be a spirit-bearing spirit.

95
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,580
It hurts.

96
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
It hurts.

97
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,180
It's...

98
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,620
What a surprise.

99
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,340
From today on,

100
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,060
you can take care of

101
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,100
the second young master's starting point.

102
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,380
You can avoid the first day

103
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,060
and the fifteenth day.

104
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,700
Luo Suo.

105
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Luo Suo.

106
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,540
This is the time

107
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,780
I'm meeting up with Xiao Jing Chu.

108
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,140
If this fails,

109
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,540
I'm afraid the cooperation

110
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,380
won't go well.

111
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:52,600
You go

112
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,200
Where are you going

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Young master

114
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,680
Young master

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,100
I'll go fetch you some cake

116
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,480
You wait here, okay?

117
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,140
No

118
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,640
Rong asked me to sleep with you

119
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,320
Yes.

120
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,120
Do you like me?

121
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,520
I like you.

122
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,200
Then you

123
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,480
can't sleep with anyone else.

124
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Women are all opposite.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,120
I mean

126
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,920
you should sleep with him.

127
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,480
Find me. Find me.

128
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,560
Find me. Find me.

129
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Find me.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
My lord, I'm sorry.

131
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,400
I need to take care of Young Master.

132
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,480
Is that idiot that important?

133
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,640
Next time,

134
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
if you dare to hurt me again,

135
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
you'll be dead.

136
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,360
It's cold.

137
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
I was idle in the day.

138
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,680
I made a pair of protective shoes for you.

139
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
You saved me from danger many times.

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,640
I hope you won't mind.

141
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,160
Come on.

142
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,440
No, thanks.

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,360
Who did this?

144
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,960
Nobody.

145
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,080
You're my maid.

146
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,560
Trying to bully you

147
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,080
implies also bullying me.

148
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,760
Miss Le Yao

149
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,480
didn't go to the study of Ningguo Palace today.

150
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,560
On the way,

151
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,160
Young Master was stopped

152
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,240
and told to sleep.

153
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,200
If Miss Le Yao didn't go,

154
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,000
she would be beaten by Miss.

155
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,480
Where is she?

156
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,320
I've controlled her.

157
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,000
I just got her

158
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,120
and delayed her to the study to find the mechanism.

159
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,000
Is it important?

160
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,800
Are you

161
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,040
worrying about me?

162
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,280
Yes.

163
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,640
I'm just worried

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,160
that you can't complete the task.

165
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,400
This is the person you're looking for.

166
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,440
Rest early.

167
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,240
There's a separation and a mistake.

168
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,520
There's a mistake in the end.

169
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,920
The last silence is the same as the past.

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,120
Thank you for your care.

171
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,480
It's good that you're fine.

172
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,600
It's good that you're fine.

173
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,360
This Young Master

174
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,240
is more considerate than I thought.

175
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
The premise of being considerate is to be interested.

176
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,200
Otherwise,

177
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,240
the doctor is still the Iron-Face Yan Luo.

178
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,640
Stop hitting me.

179
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
It hurts.

180
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
When you see Jiang Le Yao in the future,

181
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,000
you have to go around her.

182
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,280
Do you understand?

183
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,680
I understand.

184
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,520
Stop hitting me.

185
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,520
Get lost.

186
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,520
Get lost.

187
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,240
Idiot.

188
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,440
In autumn, suddenly the moon and the waves appeared

189
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,400
And the sunlight shone

190
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,000
As if the bottle of wine was dancing on the surprise

191
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,480
Be clear, my Animal

192
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,600
Ohhh my Be texting

193
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,600
So all be afraid and the water will be cold
