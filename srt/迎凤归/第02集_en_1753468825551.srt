I'll tear his teeth off

one by one.

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,620
Take him away.

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,620
Go. Go.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,620
My lord, yesterday, in the south city,

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,620
someone bought clothes

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,620
with the money from the underground bank.

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,620
Where is he?

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,620
His name is Rong'er.

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,620
He's in Ning Mansion now.

26
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,620
My lord, Ning Mansion

27
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,620
is the first mansion in the capital.

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,620
Should we

29
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,620
tell Duke Ning about it?

30
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,620
The case of the Xuan Yin Bureau

31
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,620
will be killed by anyone who dares to stop it.

32
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,620
Episode 15

33
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,620
When the late Duke Ning

34
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,620
was in danger,

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,620
he was lucky to be saved

36
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,620
by my great-grandmother.

37
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,620
That's how we get

38
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,620
the wealth of Ning Mansion.

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,620
Do you

40
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,620
accept this jade pendant

41
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,620
or not?

42
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,620
Do you accept

43
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,620
this marriage?

44
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,620
Miss, please wait here.

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,620
This time,

46
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,620
I'm the second lady

47
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,620
of Ning Mansion.

48
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,620
Chang Rong'er!

49
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,620
Why did you hit me?

50
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,620
I finally

51
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,620
caught you.

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,620
Why didn't he

53
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,620
die in the village?

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,620
I wanted to replace him

55
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,620
with the one who married into Ning Mansion.

56
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,620
What should I do now?

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,620
You...

58
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,620
You knew it all?

59
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,620
I think

60
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
I should know

61
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,620
that the Jiang family is not kind to me.

62
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
My parents

63
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,620
treat me like their own daughter.

64
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,620
Who would have thought

65
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,620
that they would die in the fire?

66
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,620
I'm so sad.

67
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
You're sad

68
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,620
that you stole my jade pendant

69
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
and married into Ning Mansion in my place.

70
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,620
It seems that he doesn't know anything

71
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,620
and just came to find the jade pendant.

72
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,620
That's right.

73
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,620
I stole the jade pendant.

74
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,620
How dare you admit it?

75
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,620
It's your mother

76
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,620
left it for you.

77
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,620
I stole it

78
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,620
because

79
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,620
I've asked around.

80
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,620
The second young master of Ning Mansion is a fool

81
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,620
and he likes to hit people.

82
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,620
I treat you like my own sister.

83
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,620
How could I bear to

84
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,620
marry you into Ning Mansion?

85
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,620
You want to help your sister?

86
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
I'll accompany you.

87
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,620
So you stole the jade pendant

88
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,620
to help me

89
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,620
marry into Ning Mansion.

90
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,620
For my sister,

91
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,620
I'm willing to do anything.

92
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Sister,

93
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,620
I'll repay you

94
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,620
with my life.

95
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,620
The jade pendant is genuine

96
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,620
after the confession of the Duke.

97
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,620
But the masters have left

98
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,620
to return to their hometown for a marriage.

99
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,620
They are too busy to take care of themselves.

100
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,620
I'm the one who takes care of them.

101
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,620
The whole Ning Mansion

102
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,620
is welcome to welcome the new people.

103
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,620
Welcome to welcome the new people.

104
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
Sister,

105
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,620
I heard that

106
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
there are many people in the high-rises

107
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,620
and the people are all around.

108
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,620
I really can't bear

109
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
to see you alone in the tiger's den.

110
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,620
How about

111
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,620
I be your personal maid

112
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,620
to protect you?

113
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,620
You're the master,

114
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,620
I'm the maid.

115
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
I'll step on you

116
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,620
in the foot of the rock.

117
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,620
Then I'll

118
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,620
listen to you

119
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,620
when you're with me.

120
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Don't worry, sister.

121
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,620
I'll serve you well.

122
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,620
Since I've been reborn,

123
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,620
I must find the real bear

124
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,620
who set fire to the mountain

125
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,620
behind Rong'er.

126
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,620
The skin is not as hot as the tree.

127
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,620
The people can't fight the powerful.

128
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,620
No matter how hard you fight,

129
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,620
you're just a beast

130
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,620
who can be cut into pieces.

131
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,620
Cut off his legs.

132
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,620
Cut off his legs.

133
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
I want them to

134
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,620
join the evil spirits in Ning's Mansion.

135
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,620
Evil spirits

136
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,620
will be bloodshed and bloodshed.

137
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,620
The people of Ning's Mansion are the most powerful.

138
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,620
Fortunately, I used the money

139
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
that the noble lady gave

140
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,620
to make new clothes.

141
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,620
You can stay in Ning's Mansion first.

142
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,620
We'll talk about everything

143
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
when the Duke returns.

144
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,620
Chang Rong'er,

145
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,620
you're involved in the gambling case.

146
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,620
The Xuanyin Bureau issued a warrant.

147
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
What gambling?

148
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,620
Xuanyin Bureau.

149
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,620
I didn't do anything.

150
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,620
You can't arrest me.

151
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,620
Another stubborn one.

152
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,620
Take her back to the Xuanyin Bureau.

153
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,620
It's her.

154
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
Her name is Yan Luo Xiao Jing Chu.

155
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,620
Be careful.

156
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,620
Be careful.

157
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,620
You're the one who should be careful.

158
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
If Rong'er is arrested,

159
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
I won't be able to find

160
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,620
the evidence behind the scenes.

161
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
If I'm caught,

162
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,620
I won't be able to find the evidence.

163
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,620
I'll never be able to avenge my parents.

164
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
You Xuanyin Bureau are so shameless.

165
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,620
Why did you arrest my sister?

166
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,620
Xuanyin Bureau

167
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,620
doesn't need to be explained to anyone.

168
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,620
Get out of the way.

169
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,620
Your Excellency,

170
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,620
what's going on?

171
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
What's going on?

172
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,620
She's the second young mistress of Ningfu.

173
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,620
I can arrest her.

174
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,620
But you

175
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,620
hit me.

176
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,620
If you want to get the hairpin back,

177
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
tonight,

178
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,620
the Xuanyin Bureau

179
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,620
will accept your interrogation.

180
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
Leave.

181
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,620
Ouch.

182
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,620
Sister.

183
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
I'm the second young mistress

184
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
and you're a servant.

185
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,620
Don't you know your place?

186
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,060
Please have some tea, Your Ladyship

187
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,900
Go get a mantis neliti

188
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,340
Ok

189
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,260
I'm innocent, Momo.

190
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Momo.

191
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,460
I'm innocent, Momo.

192
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,460
Jiang Leyao.

193
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,860
How dare you steal the gold hairpin

194
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,660
that Madam liked the most?

195
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
