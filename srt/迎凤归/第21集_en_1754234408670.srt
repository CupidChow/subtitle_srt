1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,100
Do you really think that

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,140
it's Sha puffers?

3
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,100
mustn't there be

4
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,760
fields of shaped reeds

5
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,060
watermelons

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,680
Firewood

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,700
Wash them

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,740
Wash them

9
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,780
Wet them

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,940
Brian

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
Don't face him

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,960
when you're angry.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,800
Just accept the crime of covering up the suspect

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,240
and then find a chance

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,880
to wash your name off.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,440
Qiao Ping participated in the murder,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
kidnapped and killed innocent people.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,800
Please show your mercy.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,200
You...

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
You...

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
Isn't he a prince?

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,520
Why did His Majesty

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,800
punish him so severely?

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,960
Although you're a prince,

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,600
you don't have any treatment for a prince.

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,600
You didn't see His Majesty

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,640
when you entered the palace yesterday.

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
You were punished to be punished.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,400
Did you see a doctor?

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,000
Did you take any medicine?

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,880
I'm fine.

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,280
I'm just worried about you.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,720
I even told you not to tell anyone.

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,120
Just take it as you don't know.

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
I know.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,560
Thank you.

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,760
Although you're punished,

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
you also led to the invasion.

39
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Qiao Ping's case

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,840
and Haitang Xue's file

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,640
are all on the ground.

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,720
There will be a change soon.

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,800
Please be patient.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,680
Miss Jiang,

45
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
I'll leave you alone.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,720
I'm in such a poor situation.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,320
And you even risked your life for me.

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Xiao Jing Chu,

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,000
do I really know that?

50
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,880
Yao.

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,080
Yao.

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,000
Xiao Jing Chu.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,560
It's okay.

54
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,080
Let's go.

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,880
I'll take you out.

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,360
Did you see that?

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,880
The one you love

58
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
will die.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,320
Xiao Jing Chu.

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,360
Don't move.

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,480
You're hot.

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,680
I'm fine.

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm fine.

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,800
Xiao Jing Chu.

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
What's wrong?

66
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,520
You miss me?

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,640
I miss you.

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,920
I miss you.

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,920
Xiao Jing Chu.

70
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,440
I won't let you die.

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,760
I won't.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,840
Don't be afraid.

73
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,520
I'm here.

74
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,720
The Lord is fine.

75
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,880
He's just worried about you.

76
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,040
He especially told me not to tell you.

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,360
So just think he doesn't know.

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,200
Kalimba

79
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,600
Go

80
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,560

81
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,600
you

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,600
you

83
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't worry

84
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,560
You forget

85
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,200
It's yourli

86
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,280
that you forgot

87
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
Do you forget

88
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Xiao Jing Chu will be arrested

89
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,160
unless he's dead.

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,520
Otherwise,

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,440
he won't let you off.

92
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,280
Miss Qiao Ping's life

93
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,080
is yours.

94
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,480
Then,

95
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,240
use your life

96
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,920
to do me another favor.

97
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,480
As for

98
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,400
your future,

99
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,640
it's up to you

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,840
whether you can live or not.

101
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
I'm here to leave with you.

102
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,440
Before I leave,

103
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,840
I'll take care of that rich man.

104
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,000
Miss, please take care of yourself

105
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,400
from now on.

106
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,000
Miss,

107
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,080
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,640
Please leave.

110
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,520
Will the Crown Prince be nice to you?

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,640
Yes.

112
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
Will he be nicer to you than me?

113
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,440
Let go.

114
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,560
Will he give his life

115
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,760
to you like me?

116
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,440
Here he comes.

117
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,000
Jiang Le Yao,

118
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,200
take the edict.

119
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:55,560
The Court of App 던

120
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,760
It's not allowed to break the law.

121
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,520
The Court of Judicial Review will take over the investigation immediately.

122
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,640
No one is allowed to speak.

123
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,760
That's all.

124
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,560
Guards.

125
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,440
Take Jiang Leyao to the Five Gates.

126
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,640
Kill him.

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
I don't think anyone dares to touch him.

128
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,920
I don't know which department

129
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
the military was in at that time.

130
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm angry.

131
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,320
After all, I watched him grow up.

132
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
That day, Jingchu came to my place

133
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,840
and brought me a good news.

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,840
His wedding with the Crown Prince

135
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,600
was too hasty.

136
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,160
If I don't go and support him,

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm afraid he won't be able to

138
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
establish his family in the Crown Prince's mansion.

139
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,080
The Empress Dowager is kind.

140
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,760
Jingchu is also a careful person.

141
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,960
You...

142
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,480
This...

143
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,640
Why is no one adding staff to the wedding?

144
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,480
Why are you so flustered?

145
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,520
Can't you see there's someone inside?

146
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
The song is called the song of the moon.

147
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
The song is called the song of the moon.

148
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
