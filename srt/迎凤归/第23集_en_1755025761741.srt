Duke Ning has lost his title.

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,030
Lady Bingqing is in prison.

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,990
The Nings are finished.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,910
Let's use this chaos

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,150
to find a way out.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,160
Hurry, let's go.

Someone as noble as Bingqing

22
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,070
is only ranked third tier.

23
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,950
Then this tiger here...

24
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,190
No matter who you are,

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,070
or how important you seem,

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,510
I'll make sure you pay the price.

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,820
Father, Father!

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,670
Why are you here?

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,440
It's been three days.

31
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,360
You've lost.

32
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,030
Now, can you tell me

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,390
who are the ones

34
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,880
behind you?

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,590
My father will come for me.

36
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,310
Once I'm out of here,

37
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,790
you'll wish you never met me.

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,790
Miss Jiang, Duke Ning is here.

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,630
It's Father. Do you see?

40
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,630
My father will come to save me.

41
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,350
Very well, I'll be waiting.

42
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,860
Father.

43
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,270
Father, you're finally here.

44
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,110
Father.

45
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,150
You've suffered a lot.

46
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,830
But now,
the entire Ning Family is involved.

47
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,470
I may lose my post.

48
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,510
Didn't you say,

49
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,870
that Lord Sun would protect us?

50
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,310
Take me with you, I'll do anything.

51
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,870
Anything at all, truly?

52
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,710
If you truly wish
to save the Ning Family,

53
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,110
then take on all the blame yourself.

54
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,470
The Noble Lords said,

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,870
as long as you bear it,
our family stays safe.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,870
Don't worry.

57
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,790
I'll place your spirit tablet

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,990
within the Ancestral Hall.

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,110
You'll be the first woman

60
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,830
the Ning Family's ancestral hall.

61
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,830
The Nings will honor you always.

62
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,480
Father.

63
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,040
Father.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,850
Father.

65
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
Father!

66
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,900
Father...

67
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,830
Bingqing, don't let me down.

68
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,800
Father.

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
You have won.

70
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,830
My father was never truly a father.

71
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,950
You are far too unruly.

72
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,430
How can you repay what I taught you?

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,950
Father, I'm afraid of the dark.

74
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,190
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,070
From now on, I'll obey.

76
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,070
Remember this,

77
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,270
you are daughter to me, the Duke Ning.

78
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,550
You carry the honor of the Ning Family.

79
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,070
Nothing matters more than this.

80
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,280
Do you understand?

81
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,370
I understand.

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,230
Do as you wish with me.

83
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,640
After all,

84
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,230
I'm already an abandoned child.

85
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,710
At this point,

86
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,030
you still won't reveal their names?

87
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,790
People are born into different ranks.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,910
The lesser serve the greater.

89
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,750
That's true for me, and for you too.

90
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,190
Just accept your fate.

91
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,550
I refuse to give in.

92
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,990
I only believe in "a life for a life

93
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,470
and justice will be served",

94
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,470
no matter how noble they are.

95
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,550
Qiao Ping is dead.

96
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,150
Not even a body left behind.

97
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,150
You know that well.

98
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,630
He fell into the Crown Prince's hands.

99
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,190
There was no chance for survival.

100
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,390
Do you think he'll treat you well?

101
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,880
Yes.

102
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,270
Better than I do?

103
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,830
It was I who forced Lady Bingqing.

104
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,790
Do as you wish with me.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,350
You're speaking too softly.

106
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,550
I can't hear you clearly.

107
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,550
Come here and answer me.

108
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,110
Though Ning Bingqing
took her own life out of fear,

109
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,670
the girls in the Begonia Snow

110
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,750
will never return.

111
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,070
In the end,

112
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,950
in this world,

113
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,670
few are willing to risk everything

114
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,470
to seek justice for women.

115
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,270
But you chose to act,

116
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,710
otherwise more would have suffered.

117
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,390
You praise me too much.

118
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,720
I...

119
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,510
I only sought justice for myself.

120
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,190
One day, revenge comes to an end.

121
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,630
When that day comes, what will you do?

122
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
I...

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,030
(My parents are gone.)

124
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,550
(Jiang Village is no more.)

125
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,310
(I have nowhere to turn.)

126
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,790
(When that day arrives...)

127
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,470
(What could I possibly do?)

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,510
Perhaps marry, tend to a home,
raise children.

129
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,590
My grandson

130
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,830
is truly devoted to you.

131
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,270
Jingchu treats me with utmost kindness.

132
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,410
He does.

133
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,790
Jingchu is indeed a good child.

134
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,110
But sadly,

135
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,590
his birth mother was a palace maid.

136
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,630
Back then, the Emperor was drunk,

137
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,710
and showed her favor.

138
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,830
When he sobered up,
he was furious,

139
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,710
so he kept his distance
from Jingchu as well.

140
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,950
Even the eunuchs dared to mistreat him.

141
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,710
Thankfully, he stands strong.

142
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,310
Why did you kill the Chief Eunuch?

143
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,070
You must already know

144
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,190
why the Emperor
doesn't accept you as his son.

145
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,870
Yet he holds great power.

146
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,400
Aren't you afraid?

147
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,830
But I wish to live.

148
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,950
Power is no reason to bully the weak.

149
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,390
No matter who he is, I'll resist.

150
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,310
(His gaze is steadfast.)

151
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,090
(He stands firm before power.)

152
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,830
(I can tell that in time,)

153
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,630
(he'll achieve greatness.)

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,390
From now on, you'll stay with me.

155
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,710
I will ask His Majesty

156
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,110
to acknowledge you as his son.

157
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,630
Grandmother, rather than be a prince,

158
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,430
I hope to join the Xuanyin Division.

159
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,790
I want evildoers
to have nowhere to hide,

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,430
let tyranny never crush the helpless.

161
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
Very well.

162
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,750
You handled it well.

163
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,550
Tell me, what reward do you seek?

164
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,110
This is my duty, I ask for nothing.

165
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,150
I only hope, Father,

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,030
you will let me keep investigating.

167
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,950
Duke Ning alone

168
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,710
could not have made it flawless.

169
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,150
I'm weary. You may leave.

170
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,550
Father, about this matter,

171
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,230
it must be investigated.

172
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,150
Know your place!

173
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,110
Do not meddle where you shouldn't.

174
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,050
What are you looking at?

175
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,800
Lower your head!

176
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,470
Since you two share affection,

177
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,810
then I shall

178
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,510
grant you marriage by decree.

179
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,630
With you managing his household,

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,550
I'm at ease.

181
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,880
This...

182
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,270
What, you hesitate?

183
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,630
Your Majesty,

184
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,190
Jingchu has shown me true devotion.

185
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,870
Yet why must a woman's fate

186
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,790
always be to live in someone's shadow?

187
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,870
Given this chance to start again,

188
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,910
I no longer accept such fate,

189
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,830
nor will I bow to it.

190
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,150
So, Your Majesty,

191
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,400
I...

192
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,990
I do not wish to spend my days,

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,870
tending to home and raising children.

194
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,510
Then what is it you seek?

195
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,150
I wish to make my mark in court,

196
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,030
to speak

197
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,830
for those like me,

198
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,670
the women who suffer in silence.

199
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,510
Well said.

200
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,520
Stand up.

201
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,190
Good child, I knew you wouldn't fail me.

202
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

203
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,070
By the Mandate of Heaven,
an edict from the Emperor.

204
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,470
Jiang Leyao of the Ning Family
is kind-hearted,

205
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,950
and outstanding in talent.

206
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,870
She is hereby appointed

207
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,350
as Lady Inspector of the Dali Court,

208
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,870
in charge of all matters
concerning women.

209
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,830
She must investigate
every case with care,

210
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,630
and discern the finest details.

211
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,390
Let no injustice hide in the shadows.

212
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,430
Let the truth shine
before all under heaven.

213
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,230
So decreed.

214
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,190
I thank His Majesty for this grace.

215
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,360
Everyone,

216
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,670
from today, I, Jiang Leyao,

217
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,870
will not bow to the powerful,

218
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,230
nor fear the influential.

219
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,910
I will speak for
women wronged and unheard,

220
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,990
and uphold justice in this vast world.

221
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,870
Thank you, Madam.
