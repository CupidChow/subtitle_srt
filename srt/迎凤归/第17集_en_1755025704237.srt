So well-behaved.

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,400
What brings you here?

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,520
Is it because
you were rude to Rong'er yesterday,

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,240
and now wish to apologize?

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I missed you all day.

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,440
I couldn't help myself.

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,120
Bingqing always says,

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,800
you're as cold as a thousand-year glacier,

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,720
but you don't seem that way to me.

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,360
You tricked me. How dare you!

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,600
That's right.

22
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,840
I really was playing you.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,960
Ever since I knew you liked him,

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,600
I've been plotting how to fool you.

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,200
Bingqing,

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,560
falling to someone like me

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
doesn't feel good, does it?

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,160
Jiang Leyao,

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,740
I won't let you go so easily.

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,390
I won't let you off, not ever!

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,370
This is the first time

32
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,000
I've seen you so fierce.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,920
What, are you scared now?

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,720
I actually like it.

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
Begonia Snow's case ended in haste,

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
and behind Bingqing,

37
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,840
there must be someone.

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,160
I meant to anger her on purpose

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,200
to lure those people out.

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,760
The bait has been set.

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,360
Now, let's see which fish bites first.

43

Leyao.

44
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,760
I hear you're quite close to Xiao Jingchu.

45
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Father, don't worry.

46
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,240
I know he's been reviewing

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,480
the Nings' shop accounts these days.

48
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,920
I'll remind him.

49
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,760
He won't trouble us.

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,200
Good.

51
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,560
Since when did our Ning Family

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,400
need to rely on someone with no status?

53
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,040
Besides,

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,640
this person even dares compete with me.

55
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,960
Aren't you afraid
I'll settle the score with you?

56
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,000
Bingqing,
what right do you have to confront me?

57
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,360
As the future Crown Princess,

58
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
how could you long for another prince?

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,760
Aren't you worried

60
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
you'll bring disaster to our family?

61
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,640
You little...

62
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,780
Enough.

63
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,080
So reckless and bold.

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,520
How dare you come here to complain.

65
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,830
I...

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
What happened with Xiao Jingchu was my fault.

67
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,850
Father, what about Begonia Snow?

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
She set fire inside Begonia Snow.

69
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Do you know who was in there?

70
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,520
How can you even mention this again?

71
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,200
Thanks to Leyao, Qiao'er was saved.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,680
Otherwise, things would be worse.

73
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,280
Leyao, step out for now.

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
Yes, Father.

75
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,680
Why fuss with a wild child?

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,560
She can't stir up much trouble.

77
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,680
Bingqing.

78
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,240
This matter...

79
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,800
You have truly let me down.

80
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,880
Father, I'm sorry.

81
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,040
I raised you all by myself.

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,320
I even feared you'd suffer wrongs.

83
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,480
After your mother left us,

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,560
I never remarried.

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,960
Tell me,

86
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,640
how I raised you.

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,440
You've given you all, heart and soul.

88
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,480
Louder.

89
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,020
You've given you all, heart and soul.

90
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,020
(Spirit tablet of Lady Qin
of the Ning Family)

91
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,480
I gave my all, heart and soul.

92
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,480
Mother, I was wrong.

93
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,120
I'll follow your last wishes.

94
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,840
Whatever Father asks, I'll do.

95
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,460
Come.

96
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
In three days,

97
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,400
a wealthy merchant from Jiangnan arrives.

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,000
Serve him well, understand?

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,920
This is our Ning Family's only hope.

100
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,400
You wretched woman!

101
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
You've learned to stash money, huh?

102
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,680
You can't just take this money.

103
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,580
Give it back to me.

104
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,420
Give it back to you?

105
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,200
You're already mine.

106
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,280
Of course, your money is mine too.

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,680
My still owes debts to the gambling house.

108
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,080
You... how dare you hit me!

109
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm your husband.

110
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
You're truly outrageous.

111
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,360
You've struck me for twenty years.

112
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,840
Today, I'll turn the tables on you.

113
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,360
Zhao Zhaodi.

114
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,960
I... I want a divorce.

115
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,560
Very well.

116
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Tomorrow at dawn,

117
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,280
if I don't get the Divorce Decree,

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
you'd better watch yourself.

119
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,520
You wretched woman.

120
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Outrageous indeed!

121
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
This place is in the middle of nowhere.

122
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,080
Why would the father and daughter

123
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,920
come here?

124
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,600
Looks like they won't be out soon.

125
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,800
We'll have to wait to figure that out.

126
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
Waiting is fine, but let's find shelter

127
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,040
from the snow first.

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,840
Follow me.

129
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
Didn't expect a young lady like you

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,880
to know these things.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,640
We village girls

132
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,840
have to know a bit of everything.

133
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,320
But still,

134
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,320
we can't compare with you noblemen.

135
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,680
Actually,

136
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,880
I'm not like what you think.

137
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,330
Besides,

138
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,120
I'm actually afraid of snow.

139
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,120
Snow is beautiful.

140
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,960
Why would you fear it?

141
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,480
Back then, I was just a child.

142
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,040
They used to beat me.

143
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,640
All I could do was hide.

144
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,280
Did you find him yet?

145
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,500
Not yet.

146
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,480
Hurry and keep searching!

147
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,520
- Leave no witnesses!
- Yes.

148
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,960
Quickly!

149
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Honestly, what a mess.

150
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,880
That little rascal.

151
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,120
Let's see where you are.

152
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,880
Xiao Jingchu.

153
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,440
I've never faced all that.

154
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
So I can't say I truly understand,

155
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,720
nor do I know how to comfort you.

156
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
All I can do

157
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,120
is simply stay by your side.

158
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,000
That's enough for me.

159
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,480
What I want

160
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,000
is nothing more than this.

161
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,480
Xiao Jingchu, the snow will stop.

162
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,480
And the sky

163
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,520
will surely brighten again.

164
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,560
Is it warm?

165
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,710
