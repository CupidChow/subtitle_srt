Someone, help!

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,880
This is

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,630
what you owe me.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,760
I want you

15
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,350
to apologize to everyone
in Jiang Village.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,910
No, it wasn't me.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,150
It was Ning Bingqing.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,070
- She did it.
- I know.

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,230
I won't let her go.

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,160
But you...

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,550
I don't feel wronged at all.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,670
I just wanted to...

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,270
to climb higher. Is that so wrong?

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,110
Would you really be content,

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,910
being stepped on forever?

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,430
Climb all you want!

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,550
But you shouldn't have used me,

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,390
my parents,

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,470
and the lives of Jiang Village,

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,950
as your stepping stones!

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,430
This hairpin

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,670
was given to me the day of the fire.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,670
It's a birthday gift from my mother.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,150
I had wanted to give it to you.

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,310
Relatives of Jiang Village,

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,070
bear witness.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,390
I'll send this wrongdoer
to Xuanyin Division.

38
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,420
She shall face the punishment
she deserves.

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,340
Chang Rong'er is inside.

40
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,630
Mr. Wang, please take her away.

41
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,830
Welcome, My Lady.

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,320
My Lady.

43
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,750
Master Tao is gone.
Rong'er has faced justice.

44
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,190
Now, you can stand tall

45
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,630
as the rightful lady of Ning Family.

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,070
(Ning Bingqing, it's your turn.)

47
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,060
=Episode 10=
=Step by Step=

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,600
My Lord.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,070
These days, Miss Jiang

50
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,190
has been doing chores
in Ning Bingqing's courtyard,

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,150
but Ning Bingqing never let her serve.

52
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,630
Ning Bingqing...

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,430
She's the next target.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,870
Also, about Rong'er's case,

55
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,950
the evidence is clear. Let's close it.

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,480
Yes.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Wait a moment.

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
Remember,

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,230
look into everything.

60
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,330
Understood.

61
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720
(Jiang Leyao.)

62
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,690
(It's been three days.)

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,550
(I have to find a way)

64
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,550
(to earn Ning Bingqing's trust.)

65
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,070
The smell of poverty is overwhelming.

66
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,430
Are you the new sister she took in?

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,830
I heard you've served here three days.

68
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,910
She's quite the cold-hearted.

69
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,550
If you have time to watch my yard,

70
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,430
you might as well read some books.

71
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,790
Money alone won't make you a noble lady.

72
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,710
You...

73
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,560
Qiao'er.

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,110
(Here's my chance.)

75
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,710
Are you blind?

76
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,680
Sorry.

77
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,350
You did that on purpose.

78
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,190
Did Ning Bingqing tell you to do this?

79
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,360
No, she didn't.

80
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,190
I'm clumsy.

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,610
It has nothing to do with her.

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,310
That's precisely why

83
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,230
she had me serve in her yard,

84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,110
just to learn the proper manners.

85
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,790
So that when I go out later,

86
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,310
I won't shout and make a scene.

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,070
I'd hate to bring shame to Ning Family.

88
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,190
Are you saying I'm the rude one?

89
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,550
The Tang Family
is the top imperial merchant.

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,190
As a noble lady of the Tang Family,
I deserve respect.

91
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,670
I never mentioned any names.

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,230
Why do you think it's about you?

93
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,590
My stomach hurts so much.

94
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,790
I... I need to excuse myself.

95
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,600
Jiang Leyao!

96
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,430
You put purgative in my tea!

97
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,520
I did.

98
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,990
Because you spoke rudely to my sister.

99
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,590
You treat her as your sister,

100
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,350
but she only sees you as a servant.

101
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,990
I come from humble beginnings.

102
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,590
Serving her is my greatest honor.

103
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,440
But you

104
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,030
always upsetting her.

105
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,830
Is it not because you envy her talent?

106
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,610
That's nonsense!

107
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,870
Tang Qiao'er, this is my turf.

108
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,230
Do you really think I'm easy to cross?

109
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,280
You...

110
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,110
Forgive me, Bingqing.

111
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,350
I simply wished to stand up for you.

112
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,390
Did I cause you trouble?

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,830
I thought you were clever,

114
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,990
but you turned out so foolish.

115
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,350
She asks, and you just confess?

116
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,360
Because...

117
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,190
Because I truly did it.

118
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,470
You ought to learn proper manners.

119
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,910
From now on, serve inside the house.

120
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,550
Really?

121
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,150
I will serve you well.

122
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,750
(I'll make sure you feel the pain)

123
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,110
(that makes you despair.)

124
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,390
My Lady, Lord Xiao has arrived.

125
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,350
I'm off to serve Ning Bingqing now.

126
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,390
Turn him down, then.

127
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,870
It's rare to see him smile.

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,990
It shows Lord Xiao's sincerity.

129
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,550
My Lady, won't you reconsider?

130
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,990
I am burdened with deep vengeance.

131
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,390
I'm in no place for love.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,390
But revenge will end someday.

133
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,430
You must live a new life.

134
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,710
(Old grudges remain, no new life.)

135
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,950
(I can't drag others into this.)

136
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,400
Forget it.

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,590
Let him give up sooner.
