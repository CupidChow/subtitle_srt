Speak.

I don't know.

if you're upset, it's my fault.

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,230
Come here and speak.

82
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,750
At least you listen well.

83
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,910

84
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,630
who started the fire

85
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,070
at Begonia Snow.

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,670
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

87
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,610
This is agate from the Western Regions.

88
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,590
It's precious. I give it to you.

89
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,230
I suppose I should accept this gift.

90
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,590
Go on, what else is there?

91
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,510
Jiang Leyao, since you took my gift,

92
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,950
please don't let others find out about this.

93
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,590
Or my father won't let you off easily.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,150
Miss, you saved her life,

95
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,590
yet she shows no gratitude,

96
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,590
and even turns to threaten you.

97
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,990
Truly, she's heartless.

98
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,510
After such humiliation,

99
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,070
not only can't she report it,

100
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,110
she can't even speak of it.

101
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,310
Even a noble lady like her

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,430
has to swallow her pride.

103
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,710
It's truly pitiful.

104
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,870
Yes, it is.

105
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,310
Women bear so many chains in life.

106
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,310
It's far too many to count.

107
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,790
If only we were born as men.

108
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,070
But we are women,

109
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,790
and that's nothing to be ashamed of.

110
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,030
No need to long to be men.

111
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,110
What we must do

112
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,430
is change the rules of this world.

113
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,870
Can we really do that?

114
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,080
We...

115
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,510
will make it happen.

116
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,630
Bingqing, what brings you here so late?

117
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,430
Jiang Leyao, you have some nerve.

118
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,390
You dared set fire in Begonia Snow.

119
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,110
(She knows everything.)

120
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
(Wait, that's not right.)

121
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,830
(Xiao Jingchu will handle this cleanly.)

122
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,710
(She's trying to trick me.)

123
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,160
Bingqing,

124
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,110
I know nothing about the fire.

125
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,430
Do you have proof to accuse me?

(Dali Court Case Records)

127
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,710
(Dali Court Case Records?)

128
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,350
(Why can she check so freely?)

129
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,150
I truly have no proof.

130
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,150
But I found out something else.

131
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,710
When Rong'er was taken away,

132
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,990
you were with her.

133
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,910
(The arson case in Jiang Village)

134
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,270
(was closed by Dali Court.)

135
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,590
(What is her link to Dali Court?)

136
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,430
Tell me, did you set her up?

137
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,720
Bingqing.

138
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,390
It's true,
I sent Rong'er to Xuanyin Division.

139
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,310
So you admit it so easily.

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,590
Jiang Leyao, it really was you.

141
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
Bingqing,

142
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,590
Rong'er and I grew up together,

143
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,430
but she always found ways to pick on me.

144
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,070
Bingqing, you know this too.

145
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,510
I was supposed to marry into Ning Family,

146
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,150
but Rong'er took that chance from me.

147
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,030
Most importantly,

148
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,960
I suspected that she set the fire

149
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,950
that killed my parents and the villagers.

150
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,510
But from what I know of her,

151
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,350
even if she dared to start the fire,

152
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,910
she couldn't control the Dali Court,

153
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,590
nor make them call it just an accident.

154
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,470
That day when I threatened to kill her,

155
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,190
I only wanted to see

156
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,230
if she had any ties to the Dali Court.

157
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,150
She's just a commoner.

158
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,510
How could she have any influence there?

159
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,870
It's all because of me.

160
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,230
Honestly, I don't care about

161
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,430
how Rong'er and the villagers died.

162
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,110
Yet every life there mattered.

163
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,550
Bingqing, do you truly not care?

164
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,470
They're just commoners.

165
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,270
Their lives mean nothing to me.

166
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,710
I've come to give you a warning.

167
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,790
Jiang Leyao,

168
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,950
taking a life can be grave or trivial.

169
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,990
If you keep my secret, Bingqing,

170
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,150
I'll always follow your lead.

171
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,350
To her, lives aren't worth a thing.

172
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,790
Luckily, your aim in approaching her

173
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,550
was simply to enter Begonia Snow.

174
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,470
Now that you've been inside Begonia Snow,

175
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,030
you needn't flatter her anymore.

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,590
If she looks down on commoners,

177
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,550
then let her see for herself,

178
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,430
how I, a commoner,

179
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,310
will turn the tables on her.
