1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,760
I don't know.

2
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,200
Please forgive me, Miss.

3
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
You don't know?

4
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,560
You're dead.

5
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,440
You're dead!

6
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,920
I'd like to see

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,160
who you are.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 15

9
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,680
I mean

10
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,120
you should continue to cooperate with me.

11
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,000
Jiang Luoyao,

12
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,000
I have no intention to cooperate with you.

13
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,720
I only have the love of a man and a woman.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,680
I won't let anyone hurt you.

15
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm afraid that you'll be punished.

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,800
Of course.

17
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,120
Jing Chu.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,800
Jing Chu.

19
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,440
It's you.

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,440
So what?

21
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,080
Jing Chu.

22
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,200
the colour of the sister

23
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:26,540
timing the heart

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Take away the high mountains and the flowing water, how tired I am

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
A week of memories are gone, the most greedy is to sink into the water

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Afraid of dust, afraid of years, I don't regret

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There are too many sweet thoughts

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,500
For theuttering life sweet

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
R'gentle tears flash like banners

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I become forgive in a flash

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Light up the lamp and let out the sadness

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Drunk and drunk, drink and drink

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Take away the high mountains and the flowing water, how much tears

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A week of memories, a wind blows

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Drunk and drunk, drink and drink

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Afraid of dust and dust, afraid of years and years

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Drunk and drunk, drink and drink

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Take away the high mountains and the flowing water, how much tears

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A week of memories, a wind blows

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Drunk and drunk, drink and drink

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Afraid of dust and dust, afraid of years and years

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Drunk and drunk, drink and drink

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll take you home later

44
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No need, I'll go home by myself

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Your door is a little broken, I'll go first

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Miss Jiang

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's really broken

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Go and deal with the person who killed her

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And the case of Haitang Xu's fire

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The Xuan Yin Temple took over

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, Miss Jiang, this is also a big deal

52
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not you who made me angry, why are you kneeling down

53
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No matter what, it's my fault to make you angry

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Your voice is too small, I can't hear you, come and answer

55
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Come

56
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You are good, help me check

57
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Haitang Xu's fire

58
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who put it

59
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You are good, help me check

60
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Haitang Xu's fire

61
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Who put it

62
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Who put it

63
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Who put it

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Who put it

65
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Who put it

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Who put it

67
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Who put it

68
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Thank you for saving me yesterday

69
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is the brain of the Western Regions, very expensive

70
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll give it to you

71
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I really deserve to receive this gift

72
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Say it, what else

73
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Jiang Luoyang, since you received my gift

74
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If others know about this

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
My father will not forgive you

76
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The girl saved him

77
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He didn't know gratitude, but he threatened

78
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What a blind man

79
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He was humiliated

80
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Not only can't report, but also can't make a statement

81
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Even a powerful girl like him

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He can only bear it

83
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Poor

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Isn't it

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There are too many shackles on women

86
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If we were all men

87
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Women are women

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is not a shame

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We are not ashamed

90
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No need to want to be a man

91
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What we want to do

92
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Is to change the rules of this world

93
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Can we do it

94
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We

95
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Will do

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
it is good

97
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
can

98
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
eh

99
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Pedigree

100
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
어떤

101
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:04,920
Just let

102
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is here.

103
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,240
Sister Zhang,

104
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,360
I knew nothing about the fire.

105
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
You wronged me.

106
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,600
Do you have any evidence?

107
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,760
The secret case of Dali Temple.

108
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,520
How could he open it?

109
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,440
I do have no evidence.

110
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,440
But I found another thing.

111
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,960
The day Rong'er was caught,

112
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,160
you were with him.

113
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,280
The poem ring of Jiang Village

114
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
was also ordered by Dali Temple.

115
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,880
What does he have to do with Dali Temple?

116
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,160
Tell me.

117
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,800
Did you design it?

118
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,920
Sister Zhang,

119
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,880
I did send Rong'er to Xuanyin Temple.

120
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,640
You're so generous.

121
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,160
Jiang Leyao,

122
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,000
it's really you.

123
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,440
Sister Zhang,

124
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,040
Rong'er grew up with me.

125
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,640
He's always bullied me.

126
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,280
Sister Zhang also knew

127
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,760
I was supposed to join Ning's family.

128
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,360
Rong'er also took it away.

129
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,320
The most important thing is

130
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,600
I suspect

131
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,040
he set the fire and burned my parents and relatives.

132
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,720
But according to my understanding of him,

133
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
although he had the courage to set the fire,

134
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
he couldn't manipulate Dali Temple

135
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,760
and turn the case into an accident.

136
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,760
I was going to kill him that day

137
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
to test his relationship

138
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,440
with Dali Temple

139
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,520
by reading the poem ring.

140
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,440
He's a commoner.

141
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,000
What does he have to do with Dali Temple?

142
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,240
It's all my fault.

143
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,360
Actually,

144
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,280
I don't care how I died

145
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,960
or how the people of Jiang Village died.

146
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,400
They were all burnt.

147
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,840
Sister Zhang,

148
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,640
you really don't care at all?

149
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,480
It's none of my business

150
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,280
if a group of commoners died.

151
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,760
I'm here to warn you.

152
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,640
Jiang Leyao,

153
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,240
killing people

154
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,000
is a big and small thing.

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
As long as you keep the secret for me,

156
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,820
I will surely

157
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,680
fight for you.

158
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,160
The people Voicelo shorter

159
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,600
than dance arena

160
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,960
in front of him.

161
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,880
It's not worth it.

162
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,320
It's a good thing that you approached him

163
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,880
to get into the Begonia School.

164
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,960
Now the Begonia School is also in.

165
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,360
You don't have to

166
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
be so mean to him.

167
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,080
Since he doesn't like the secret,

168
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,840
I'll show him

169
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,000
how I

170
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,640
play tricks on him.

171
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,760
Drinking a cup of wine

172
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,680
and walking to the high mountains to cry in winter

173
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,720
A kind of memory is gone

174
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,920
Drunk and greedy, I'm in love

175
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Afraid of dust and dust, afraid of breaking, I don't regret

176
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,920
Drunk and drunk, I'm in love

177
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:19,880
Drinking a cup of wine and walking to the high mountains to cry in winter

178
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,120
A kind of memory is gone

179
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,520
Drunk and greedy, I'm in love

180
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,600
Afraid of dust and dust, afraid of breaking, I don't regret
