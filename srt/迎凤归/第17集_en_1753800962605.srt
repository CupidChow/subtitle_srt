1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
No.

2
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,920
So sweet.

3
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,680
Why are you here?

4
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,600
Did you

5
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,960
feel rude to me yesterday?

6
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,720
Are you here to apologize?

7
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,240
I haven't seen you for a day.

8
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,880
I couldn't help it.

9
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,360
I always say

10
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,760
you are like a thousand-year-old ice mountain.

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,360
But in my opinion,

12
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
you are not.

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,000
Bitch.

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,360
You are playing tricks on me.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,360
Yes.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
I am playing tricks on you.

17
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,880
Since the day I knew you liked her,

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,720
I have been planning

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,800
how to play tricks on you.

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,960
Zhang Qin.

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,600
It's not easy to feel

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,280
like being defeated by a bitch.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Jiang Ruoyang.

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,600
I won't let you go.

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,320
I won't let you go.

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,480
I won't let you go.

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,680
It's the first time

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,080
I've seen you being so shy.

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,200
What? Are you scared?

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,640
I like it.

31
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,680
There must be someone

32
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,080
who is more unpredictable behind Ning Bingqing.

33
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,440
I have to be angry on purpose

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,480
to lure those people out.

35
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,080
I'm ready.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,520
Let's see which fish will be hooked first.

37
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,080
Lu Yao.

38
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,480
I heard you and Xiao Jingchu

39
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,640
are close friends.

40
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,520
Don't worry, Father.

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,600
I know

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
he has been

43
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,680
holding the shop's accounts.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,120
I will remind him.

45
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,960
I won't make it hard for Ning Mansion.

46
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,080
Okay.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
When will Ning Mansion

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,720
rely on a bitch?

49
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Moreover,

50
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,800
this bitch dares to steal from me.

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
Aren't you afraid that I will come to you for a revenge?

52
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,000
What right do you have to settle accounts with me?

53
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,240
You are the future Crown Princess.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,880
But you are thinking of other princes.

55
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,280
Aren't you afraid

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,280
that you will bring trouble to Ning Mansion?

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,400
You...

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,520
Enough.

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,040
You are so arrogant.

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
How dare you come to me for revenge?

61
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,360
You...

62
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,160
I was wrong about Xiao Jingchu.

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,800
Father, what about Begonia?

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,160
He set me free in Begonia.

65
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,320
Do you know

66
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,520
that it was all your fault?

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,560
How dare you mention it again?

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,200
Thanks to Lu Yao saving Tang Qiao'er,

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,840
it didn't go to waste.

70
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
Lu Yao, you may leave.

71
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,120
Yes, Father.

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:53,900
How could you

73
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,760
After your mother died,

74
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,720
I didn't make any false promises.

75
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,000
Tell me

76
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,000
how I raised you.

77
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,680
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

78
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,760
Louder.

79
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,120
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

80
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,960
Please.

81
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,080
Please take all the good intentions.

82
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,080
Mother, I was wrong.

83
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,600
I'll listen to you.

84
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,480
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

85
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,840
Stop worrying.

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,960
Please don't cry.

87
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,720
Come.

88
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,000
what

89
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
These are the only vengeance

90
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,040
that we hope

91
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Don't panic!

92
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,160
See whether there's anything wrong?

93
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,260
With this shed,

94
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,140
you'll only earn some money.

95
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,280
Alright, you bitch!

96
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,320
You're good at hiding money.

97
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,240
Take this money back.

98
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,680
Right.

99
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,120
You're one of my people.

100
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,040
This money is naturally mine.

101
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,320
How dare you hit me?

102
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm your husband.

103
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
You're a traitor!

104
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,640
You hit me for 20 years.

105
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
I'll be a traitor today!

106
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,160
Zhao Zhaodi, I'll kill you!

107
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,600
Fine.

108
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,480
If I can't get the divorce letter tomorrow morning,

109
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,400
I'll kill myself!

110
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,760
You're a traitor!

111
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
You're a traitor!

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,680
Yes.

113
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,840
Why did leaders of their families

114
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,560
come to Where All tir yolk and no nest alive?

115
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,080
If they're here for a while,

116
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,920
they won't come out.

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,800
Can we be Whilst levied in?

118
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,920
That's a good idea,

119
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,200
She's comfortable.

120
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,360
Thanks.

121
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,920
I'll let you become my wife buttons.

122
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,720
I grant your wish.

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,640
Thank you.

124
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,720
Follow me.

125
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,920
I didn't expect interesting things

126
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
from you.

127
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,720
The countryside aunties

128
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,960
are good at everything,

129
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
but no comparison

130
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,640
to princes who stay in the palace for a long time.

131
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm afraid of snow.

132
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,040
Snow is so beautiful.

133
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,880
Why are you afraid?

134
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
I was still a kid.

135
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,880
I was beaten by them.

136
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,400
I could only hide.

137
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,280
Did you find it?

138
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,400
No.

139
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Hurry up.

140
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,440
You can't leave me.

141
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,880
Hurry up.

142
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,800
You little bastard.

143
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
Where can you go?

144
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Xiao Jing Chu.

147
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,640
I've never experienced that.

148
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
So I dare not say I can't do it.

149
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,080
I don't know how to comfort you.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,080
All I can do

151
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
is to stay with you.

152
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
That's good.

153
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,560
That's all

154
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
I want.

155
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,680
You will learn it.

156
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,240
The day

157
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
soon will be bright.

158
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,520
Have a rest.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,720
Leave it to me.

160
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,880
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,680
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,400
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,360
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
