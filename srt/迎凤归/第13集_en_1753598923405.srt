1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,660
But m迫不薄

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,080
果青穹无奈

3
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,400
果青穹无奈

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,980
果青穹无奈

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,340
这女人

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,140
这女人

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:35,980
这女人

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,600
这女人

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,360
这名女人

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,580
花纱

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,340
花纱

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:40,900
这名女人

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,500
这名女人

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:41,960
这名女人

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,680
这名女人

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,260
这名女人

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,800
这名女人

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,540
这名女人

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,100
这名女人

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,120
这人

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,760
这人

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,480
这人

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,780
这他是

24
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,760
这人

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,420
哪知道

26
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,040
哪知道

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:55,940
这手

28
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,420
这手

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,160
这手

30
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,860
这手

31
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,420
这手

32
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,420
Don't say it's you.

33
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,420
If your mother could see the emperor,

34
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,420
she wouldn't be killed by the empress.

35
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,420
You have to be obedient.

36
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,420
Understand?

37
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,420
Let me go.

38
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,420
Let me go.

39
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,420
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,420
Jiang Lai Yao.

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
I trust you.

42
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,420
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,420
You go back first.

44
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,420
Okay.

45
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,420
You were already moved,

46
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,420
but you pushed Mr. Xiao away.

47
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,420
You've put two people in a difficult position.

48
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,420
How's the thing I asked you to inquire about?

49
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
Sir.

50
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,420
We've checked and compared the missing girl's whereabouts.

51
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,420
We found that they went to a place

52
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,420
called the Haetangxue before they disappeared.

53
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,420
They were all in the same place.

54
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,420
It's the top fengya place in the capital.

55
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,420
On the surface, the lion was singing,

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,420
but the lion imprisoned the girl.

57
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,420
It's a humiliation to the son of Fengya.

58
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,420
Did you check the Haetangxue?

59
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
Yes.

60
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,420
There's no problem.

61
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,420
There are no traces of girls.

62
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,420
But we've got a secret message

63
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,420
that Haetangxue is still in the same place.

64
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,420
The Haetangxue is still in the same place.

65
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,420
I don't remember.

66
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
But we've got a secret message

67
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,420
that Haetangxue is still in another place.

68
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,420
There are a lot of soldiers guarding it.

69
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,420
It's not that the tourists can't get in.

70
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,420
You mean Tang Qiao'er

71
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,420
is also on the list of Haetangxue's tourists?

72
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,420
I have a colleague who works in Tang's mansion.

73
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,420
He said Tang Qiao'er...

74
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,420
He said I should take Tang Qiao'er down.

75
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,420
Then Haetangxue's number

76
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,420
will be one more.

77
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,420
How?

78
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,420
Tang Qiao'er liked this dress first.

79
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,420
You want me to come here anyway.

80
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,420
What do you want?

81
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,420
There are all kinds of people in the Spring Festival Gala.

82
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,420
Every girl wants to suppress others.

83
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,420
Especially Tang Qiao'er from Shaoman.

84
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,420
Not to mention I offended her before.

85
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,420
Now I took her dress.

86
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,420
She must have a grudge against me

87
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,420
and wants to take the dress back.

88
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
Jiang Leyang.

89
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,420
You're here.

90
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Miss Tang.

91
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
Jiang Leyang.

92
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
Who do you think you are?

93
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,420
You dare to take my dress.

94
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
You deserve it.

95
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,420
Take it off.

96
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,420
How dare you hit me?

97
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,420
In my mansion,

98
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,420
you hit me.

99
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,420
If I don't hit you,

100
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,420
it will make my mansion

101
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,420
look weak.

102
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,420
Fine.

103
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,420
I want to see what you are.

104
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
Come on.

105
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,420
Take off her dress.

106
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Wait.

107
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,420
Tang Qiao'er.

108
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,420
I can give you this dress.

109
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,420
But you have to think it over.

110
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,420
You can't take this dress.

111
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,420
Joke.

112
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,420
There are clothes that Tang Qiao'er can't take.

113
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,420
Take it off.

114
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,420
What are you going to do next?

115
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,420
In the Xuanning Ice Hall.

116
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,420
Sister.

117
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,420
It's my fault.

118
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
You know.

119
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,420
She even offended my sister.

120
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
I should have given it to her directly.

121
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,420
Tang Qiao'er.

122
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,420
She hit my sister in my mansion.

123
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,420
She is really a drunkard.

124
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,420
I like this flower powder the most.

125
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
I like it.

126
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,420
The dress is around Tang Qiao'er.

127
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,420
It must be very beautiful.

128
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,420
Lin Binqing hates

129
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,420
pure people.

130
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,420
It's not enough just to look good.

131
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,420
Mo Mo.

132
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,420
Go find some more people.

133
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
Qiao'er.

134
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,420
So many butterflies.

135
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Oh my god.

136
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,420
Miss Tang can like butterflies.

137
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,420
I heard that butterflies are picky.

138
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,420
They only like people who are pure.

139
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Miss Tang is very pure.

140
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,420
Lin Binqing hates pure people the most.

141
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Now Tang Qiao'er

142
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
has completely offended her.

143
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
You are smart to

144
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
sow discord between

145
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,420
Tang Qiao'er and Lin Binqing.

146
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
Then why did you

147
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,420
put so much effort into the Haetang Snow?

148
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,420
I never asked Mr. Xiao

149
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,420
about the meaning of burning the medicine.

150
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
It seems that you are pointing at me.

151
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
Don't ask me what you shouldn't ask.

152
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,420
Mr. Xiao is really smart.

153
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Jiang Laiyang.

155
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,420
I know you have a great hatred in your heart.

156
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Maybe you have experienced life and death.

157
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,420
So you don't want to say

158
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,420
I can never ask.

159
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
I will pick you up outside.

160
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,420
The situation in Haetang Snow is unclear.

161
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,420
You take the Purple-Folk-Woods.

162
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,420
I thought Mr. Xiao

163
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,420
asked me to kill him.

164
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Jiang Laiyang.

165
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
If you really kill someone,

166
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,420
it's illegal.

167
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,420
I must catch you.

168
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,420
Let's go.

169
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
Tonight.

170
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,420
There is a limit to the Haetang Snow.

171
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,420
You can go with me.

172
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
I will listen to you.

173
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Go.

174
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
Give me the Purple-Folk-Woods.

175
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,500
I'm scared

176
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,040
that I'll be inspired by you.

177
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,880
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,040
How's the thing going?

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,960
Tonight, the performance of

180
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
Lihua Ya Begonia

181
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
was supposed to be about

182
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,560
Tang Qiao'er in the list.

183
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,800
Will she change her role?

184
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
After tonight,

185
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,800
I'd like to see

186
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,520
how she can be pure.

187
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,520
We just need to punish Tang Qiao'er.

188
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,440
Why do we have to take Miss Liancheng there?

189
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,640
Aren't you afraid of causing trouble?

190
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,320
What?

191
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,600
You didn't take me for a fool, did you?

192
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,760
Spring Festival

193
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,560
is my intention.

194
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,800
The purpose

195
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,240
is to let all the officials in Yun City know

196
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,240
that we still have

197
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,240
a second lady in Ning Mansion.

198
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,280
So next time,

199
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,280
we can let her

200
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
go to talk business with my father.

201
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,180
In that case,

202
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
let's pour forest firewood

203
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,600
right under本当任 understand.

204
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,880
After we're done with our promotion at과子,

205
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,240
just wait till next night

206
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,760
and let Changgui

207
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,020
go to play my father in the management

208
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,360
and burymet Nicang Yang.

209
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,760
Yes.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,920
Zhou Yixuan

211
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,200
definitely didn't

212
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,320
make the same mistake as I messed up

213
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,600
in Nanyuan Hotel.

214
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,160
Perhaps

215
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,440

Walking on the high mountains and flowing water

225
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,420
The winter is cold

226
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,420
A week of memories

227
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,620
Drunk and greedy, the heart is like water

228
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,620
