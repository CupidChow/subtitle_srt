Xia Jianchu

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is your first time to be on duty

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll take you to the temple

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Does it hurt?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It doesn't hurt

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But you asked me

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It really hurts

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't worry

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll take care of you in the future

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't have a wife

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I have a support

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't know if grandma

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
will help me or punish me

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Of course I'm helping you

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Of course

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm also helping me

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
OK

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The truth is

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's about to be revealed

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Go

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Bite him

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Bite him

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Bite him

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Bite him

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Slow down

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Bite him

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Bite him

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Bite him

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bite him

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Bite him

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Bite him

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Go

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Bite him

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Bite him

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm Jiang Leyao

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You are the empress dowager

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
of the Empress Dowager

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You are the first female official

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
in our court

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm flattered

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm flattered

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
May I ask

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
where I was on duty?

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We can do the work

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
of the imperial court

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You just need to rest

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The emperor's way

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and the emperor's way

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The empress dowager is a man of great power

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why do you need to rest?

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are a woman

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You know how to investigate cases

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What?

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you know how to investigate cases?

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why did you solve the case

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
of the maid Liu being kidnapped?

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Sir

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The maid was kidnapped

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
because of her ugly appearance

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is it a rule?

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And you

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The maid Zhao was kidnapped

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and the investigation was mixed

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You were confused

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and heard the rumors

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is your investigation case

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
bring up the files

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
one by one

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I will

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
review it again today

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sir

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That bitch

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
She is the empress dowager

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That bitch

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
is not the first time

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
she sent me the file

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
As long as I find the file

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
of Jingyan

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and follow the file

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
of my investigation case

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I will find the rules

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In the middle of the year

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
there was a fire in Jingjiao

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The time of the fire

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
was in the days of Su and Wang

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The death toll

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
was 2731

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
All of them were set as one

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In three days

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it will be the days of Wang

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why are you here?

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I miss you

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You don't mind that I broke in, right?

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is Mr. Jiang inside?

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They were dissatisfied with me

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
because of the empress dowager

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If they knew you were here

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
they might say something

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hide yourself

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Hide? Where?

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Be gentle

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Jiang

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Anything else?

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Anything else?

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Mr. Jiang, you are new here

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You are not familiar with many files

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I am here to help you

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's see this

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This year

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What's wrong with you?

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Nothing

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's continue

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This one

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Look at this

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This year

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mr. Jiang, are you okay?

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Go and get me a glass of water

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I won't

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What are you doing?

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Help me up

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Work hard

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Go

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Go

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are so rascal

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Greetings, Your Highness

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Leyao

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why are you here today?

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Everything is going well in Dali Temple

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Thanks for your help, Your Highness

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I believe in my own eyes

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The crown prince sent someone to say that he was not feeling well

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He planned to go to the capital's villa to rest for three days

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He didn't come to visit you

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are not feeling well again?

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Did the doctor ask you to go and have a look?

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Every time you are not feeling well

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
you go to the capital's villa

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Can I cure you?

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Maybe he is distracted

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The crown prince also said that he would bring you a white pear

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A white pear?

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It is said that it is sweet and delicious

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Only in the Yucheng Palace in the capital

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Right?

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Other villas don't produce white pear

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
When he comes back

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I will ask Jing Chu to send some to you

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you, Your Highness

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Crown prince

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Your mask should be removed

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I will give you one last chance

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is the person behind the tiger mask the crown prince?

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can't defeat him

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I will have to wait for a lifetime

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I will wait for a lifetime

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Father

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You have lost a lot of weight

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Drink some soup to nourish your body

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You are worried about me

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your sister is not here

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You must carry the heavy burden of Ning's family

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Father

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The crown prince is the crown prince's son

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He said that we should not repair the relationship with the crown prince as soon as possible

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I am afraid that Ning's family will not live well in the future

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What is your opinion?

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Now Ning's family has lost its power

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If we want to regain the crown prince's favor

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Except for marriage

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There is no other way

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You are not a filial son

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Father

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I just want to share your burden

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I am filial

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I will let you live in the Crown Prince's mansion

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't worry

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will focus on Ning's family and you

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Come, father

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Father, enjoy your meal

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The crown prince is a man of his word

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Only by being in the role can we find the evidence

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's okay, just practice

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Look

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Look

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I heard that the crown prince is not feeling well

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why do you have the leisure to come to Ning's mansion?

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And you

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You are about to die

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't you need to go to the Dali Temple?

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It seems that my brother is not satisfied with this

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Your Highness

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You know something

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I and Jiang...

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Mr. Xiao

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Women's reputation is the most important

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Not to mention

213
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I am about to marry into the Crown Prince's mansion

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Please be careful

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What did you say?

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Le Yao is about to marry into my Crown Prince's mansion as a concubine

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Brother, remember

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You must come to have a drink

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Le Yao

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It seems that there is some misunderstanding between you and my brother

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You should have a good talk

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I am not a concubine

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I am a concubine

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Is there something you can't say?

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I want to marry into the royal family

228
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
To help Ning's mansion

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Ning's mansion?

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What does Ning's mansion have to do with you?

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Even so

232
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why don't you choose me?

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I am also a prince

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But he is the crown prince

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He is the future emperor

236
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't see you

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I can't see you

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't see you

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't see you

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Jiang Le Yao

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Zhou Yuan

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
A new person has come

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Xiao Jingyao

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I have nothing to care about

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's time to tell you

246
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm going to the mountain to cry

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
A cup of wine, a cup of wine

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Drunk and greedy, the heart is like water

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Afraid of dust, afraid of broken

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't regret

251
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
A cup of wine, a cup of wine

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
A cup of wine, a cup of wine

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm going to the mountain to cry

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
A cup of wine, a cup of wine

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Drunk and greedy, the heart is like water

256
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Afraid of dust, afraid of broken

257
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't regret
