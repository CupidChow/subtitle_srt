To temporary slice of snow!

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,560
According to the Western forced officials,

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,560
they should point a eagle's head

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,200
at his mouth.

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,960
A soft face

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,480
is like a membranous device вечOUT

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,560
but a human body feels like a devoted demon!

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,920
It's great!

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,200
Duke Ningguan,

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,720
you're really a good girl.

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,840
I made her study hard

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,080
and become a good daughter

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,680
just to serve you.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,960
Since you're so sincere,

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,320
I can stay here for a few more days.

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,560
Great.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,760
Come on, please.

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Come on.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,360
He's so skilled.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,760
This is not the first time.

29
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,080
Detective, here's the report.

30
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,720
The owner of this court is Qiao Ping.

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,000
The owner of the Begonia Snow Wood is also Qiao Ping.

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,680
Qiao Ping was adopted by Duke Ningguo since childhood.

33
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,280
Then he became Ning Bingqing's bodyguard.

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,640
Could he be Duke Ningguo's puppet?

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
No.

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,720
His identity can be disguised,

37
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,880
but his eyes can't fool anyone.

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,960
Even if he's a puppet,

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,560
he'll only be Ning Bingqing's puppet.

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,520
Then who will Ning Bingqing be?

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Who is more powerful than Duke Ningguo?

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,080
You're not convinced?

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,000
He is different from you anymore.

44
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,800
You seem to have got training.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,760
I think

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,520
this is all cooler than I imagined.

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,320
Come on, you can talk.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,520
Check.

49
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,640
Listen.

50
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,640
Their relationship is close here.

51
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,200
I heard you crying just now.

52
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,680
You must have misheard.

53
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,600
I was singing.

54
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
This is my home.

55
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,560
I can do whatever I want.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,760
Were you happy

57
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,080
in the past three days?

58
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
I've been reading books for three days at home.

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,880
I can't even be happy.

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,880
Although we have a grudge,

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,320
I can also be sad

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
to see you like this.

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Ning Bingqing,

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,640
if you're willing to cooperate with me,

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,200
you can come to me anytime.

66
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,560
I'm just worried that

67
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:04,380
some of my

68
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,180
predecessors

69
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,380
might even

70
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,180
だらす

71
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,260
return to a better Majesty.

72
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,280
The two destroyers

73
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,500
might even become

74
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,380
the famous

75
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,040
11 could be eating

76
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,840
Dam Hawk's

77
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,760
biggest enemy!

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,560
Jiang Leng Yao is so kind.

79
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,040
Since you

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
must be here to laugh at me,

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,920
I won't let you live well.

82
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,560
Your Highness.

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,400
Luo Yao.

84
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,320
Duke Ning got a piece of the horse's head.

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,280
It seems that he used his daughter.

86
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,200
Ning Bingqing is not his daughter.

87
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,560
He just used it to kidnap someone else's pawn.

88
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,120
In this way,

89
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,760
Ning Bingqing will become what he is today.

90
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm afraid it has something to do with his training and intimidation.

91
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,360
There are some people who are pitiful.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,760
But

93
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,160
he can make Duke Ning's legitimate daughter

94
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,360
and the future Crown Princess Consort do such a thing.

95
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,040
The person behind it

96
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,680
may be the whole court.

97
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,680
Luo Yao.

98
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,880
But

99
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,920
we still have weak points

100
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,820
on Ning Initial Lord.

101
00:06:51,200 --> 00:07:01,040
If we keep

102
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,600
investigating,

103
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm afraid that Rushuang University will be in danger.

104
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,920
Then

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,920
should we checkse kritin seriously?

106
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
who the man who went to his mansion

107
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
is.

108
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
We don't know yet.

109
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
There is someone

110
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
who can help us.

111
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Who?

112
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Ning Bingqing has suffered so much.

113
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Qiao Ping

114
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
will definitely help him.

115
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Miss.

116
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Miss, I got the divorce papers.

117
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I've been waiting for 20 years for the divorce papers.

118
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
I got them.

119
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
That's great.

120
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Then I'll tell you another good news.

121
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
I don't want to cooperate with you anymore.

122
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Really?

123
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Didn't you say

124
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
you were born in Jiangnan

125
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
and you were sold by your parents

126
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
before you came here?

127
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Actually, you were sold by your parents.

128
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Your parents

129
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
have been looking for you

130
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
for so many years.

131
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
So

132
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
I wasn't abandoned.

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Of course.

134
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Now I've already

135
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
taken them to the capital.

136
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
This is your indenture.

137
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
You'll be free from now on.

138
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
This is

139
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
the last token

140
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
of my love.

141
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Take it.

142
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
After you leave,

143
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
you can spend your life with your parents.

144
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm afraid that

145
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
no one will help you when I leave.

146
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
You're right.

147
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
If you don't take it,

148
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
I'll regret it.

149
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Take it.

150
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Take it.

151
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Don't cry.

152
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Have a good life.

153
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
You don't know

154
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
that the noble girl

155
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
who looks so high

156
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
is really a good maid.

157
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
She even treats dogs as her servants.

158
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Which noble girl?

159
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Don't be silly.

160
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
You just need to know

161
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
who is a noble girl.

162
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
It seems that this person

163
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
has been to the court.

164
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
He used this to make a living.

165
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I think he's the one who's not good enough.

166
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
I really want to teach him a lesson.

167
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Look over there.

168
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
It seems that someone is going to teach him a lesson.

169
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
What Leyao said is right.

170
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Qiao Ping is going to stand up for Ning Bingqing.

171
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
But

172
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
he gave us a reason to arrest him.

173
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Let's arrest him now.

174
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Go ahead.

175
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
But

176
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
we need to let him escape.

177
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
I want to alert him.

178
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
I want to

179
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
see what Ning Bingqing does next.

180
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Yes.

181
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
What a waste.

182
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Xiao Jingzhu actually saw it.

183
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
I just want to vent my anger on the noble girl.

184
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
But don't worry, noble girl.

185
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I'll find a place to hide

186
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
and never involve the noble girl.

187
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
If you want to help me,

188
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
then do me another favor.

189
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
What favor?

190
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
I don't want to see Jiang Leyao anymore.

191
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Zhang Mengmeng,

192
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
I specially sent you a security talisman.

193
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
