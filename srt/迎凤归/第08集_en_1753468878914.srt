1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The Second Young Madam is going out.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You don't need to follow me.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Second Young Madam is going out.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Since the person behind you has been found,

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
then you should go down

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and apologize to my parents and the innocent villagers

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
of Jiang Village.

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Kill!

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Help!

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Kill!

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Help!

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Kill!

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Stop!

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's going on?

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The Second Young Master is going to kill me.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He has already cut many people with this sword.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His personal servant was badly injured last night

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and died without eating.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Eat more if it's delicious.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Father, now I have a stable foot in Ning's Mansion.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Brother, I will be filial to you in the future.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's the best you can think of.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I didn't hurt you for nothing.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You hurt me?

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If I hadn't been lucky,

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I would have been killed by you.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Nonsense!

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This...this...this...

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Tian Qi...

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's poisonous.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's poisonous.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You are not a good son.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't deserve to be a father.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You should have died long ago.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's poisonous.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Isn't this my jade pendant?

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Prime Minister, please.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Prime Minister.

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If I keep on chasing after him,

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will be dead.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Second Young Madam,

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the Duke wants you to go to the front hall.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What is it?

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It seems to be about the maid Jiang Le Yao.

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Jiang Le Yao?

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes.

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He didn't take good care of Ni Tao.

51
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What did Le Yao do wrong?

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He did wrong.

53
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But you are a criminal.

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Prime Minister, please forgive me.

55
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Second Young Master always took care of Le Yao.

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now he is...

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You shouldn't have asked me.

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What did I do wrong?

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Isn't it about Ni Tao being poisoned to death?

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You stole the jade pendant

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and replaced it with the Duke's mansion.

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You are now the second young master.

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You stole the Duke's mansion

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and replaced it with the Duke's mansion.

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You deserve to die.

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why are you here?

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Call me out.

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Call me out.

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is mine.

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are lying.

71
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This jade pendant is a pair.

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It is a gift from my ancestor.

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Back then, the old master

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
gave this to someone else

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
as a wedding gift.

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How did it become yours?

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Prime Minister, please forgive me.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This jade pendant

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
was polished by the old master

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
when he was in my house.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He gave one of them

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to my grandfather.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
As a wedding gift,

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I was not a good daughter.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was deceived by Rong'er

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and gave him the jade pendant.

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's how he got

88
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the wedding gift from the second young master.

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I know it's too late to say anything now.

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But this jade pendant

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
is a gift from my parents.

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But my parents

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
have passed away in the fire.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's all over.

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This jade pendant

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
is the only thing

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
they left me.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I just want to take it back

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
as a souvenir.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Sister Zhang,

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm really sorry.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I really want to take back

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the thing my mother left me.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Nonsense.

106
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It was my grandfather

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
who saved the old master.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Before my father died,

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
he asked me to complete

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the wishes of the ancestors

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
when he gave me the jade pendant.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Before your father died?

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No one can talk for you

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
if they know

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
that the person who did this is dead.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Is that

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
what you often say?

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Impossible.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He...

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He's dead.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I...

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sir, you can still be saved.

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But you won't live long.

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's enough that you can point out the murderer.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Take him away.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's how it went.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because he's still alive,

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
how to deal with Chang Rong'er

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
is up to you, Duke Ningguo.

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Chang Rong'er's death is not a big deal.

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This marriage

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
was arranged by the old master.

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why don't you take this opportunity

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to fight against the government?

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's not appropriate.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The second young master has been married.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How can he fight against the government?

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If Duke Ningguo

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
wants to repay the old master,

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
why don't you

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
let Jiang Leyao be your adopted daughter?

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Leyao, my respects to you.

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Come in.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you, Father.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Chang Rong'er,

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you lied to the whole Ning family

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
without any reason.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You'll be punished for your death.

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Come on.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Please forgive me, Duke.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sister,

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sister was tricked by Zhuyong.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Please save her.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Father,

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Rong'er grew up with me.

157
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He also took care of me a lot.

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Father,

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
can you forgive him

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
for the sake of Leyao?

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I happen to

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
lack a servant.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How about

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
he go to my place

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and be my maid?

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
All right.

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Let him serve you.

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Thank you, Father.

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You want to take away my identity, right?

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You bitch!

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
How dare you hit me?

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Now I'm the master,

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and you're the servant.

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You don't know

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
what to call me.

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Lady Yuzhan,

178
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll listen to you

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
in the future.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's more like it.

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But don't worry.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I won't make it hard for you.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Chang Rong'er,

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you must

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
serve Young Master.

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He knows.

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He must have done it.

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Go on.

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Go on.

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll try to be romantic.

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The most important thing now

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is to deal with Jiang Leyao,

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
