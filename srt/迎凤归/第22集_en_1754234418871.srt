Episode 12

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Please show your respect to the Empress Dowager and the Crown Prince.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This woman has done such a heinous act.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I, Duke Ning, have no idea about it.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Crown Princess and Tang Ji Fan are both dead.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I have to do everything to save her.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I was forced to do it.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Pingqing, is that really true?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Please help me, Empress Dowager and Crown Prince.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I was forced to do it.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Bring that thief here.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
My Crown Princess said

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that you are willing to do it.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Really?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you going to disobey the decree?

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Take him down.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What are you doing?

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you going to rebel?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
My Lord, you don't know yet.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The dead Qiao Ping has appeared.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Miss Jiang's death is not a crime.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Nonsense! How is that possible?

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I clearly...

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It might be a misunderstanding.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll go back and investigate.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Take him down.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you doing?

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I am the imperial official. I am the Minister of Justice.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You colluded with Ning's family and the people of the grassland.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are the one who got me.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Take him away.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You...

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You...

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let me go. You disobeyed the decree.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let me go.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let me go.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Leyao, let's go back.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is the end of this drama.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't worry.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll just sit here

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and wait for him to come.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I forced Miss Jiang

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
to kill me.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was the one who killed her.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I...

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I obeyed the decree.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You bastard!

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Guards.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Take her back to the Eastern Palace.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Boss Ye,

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's gone.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Report the situation.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,600
In the meantime,

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,000
Look after Ning's family,

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and don't let them down again.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Leave them.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Leave the palace to me.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
I don't know.

69
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,760
The marriage

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,600
must be done.

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,600
As for Ning Bingqing,

72
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,120
send him to the court

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,640
and reflect on his actions.

74
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,920
I understand.

75
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,840
Ning...

78
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,720
I've been too lenient with you.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,200
Have you forgotten

80
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
that I never need

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,960
a useless maid?

82
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,800
Father, I'm sorry.

83
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
Please forgive me.

84
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,120
Father.

85
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,800
From a prostitute to a prostitute,

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
what else can you do for Ning's family?

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
Father, please forgive me.

88
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,600
I can do anything.

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,040
I can do anything, father.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,880
Father.

91
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,600
Because of you,

92
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,000
Ning's family completely offended the Crown Prince.

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,560
Now,

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,480
only the three-pronged Yuan

95
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,440
who holds the military power

96
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,760
can save us.

97
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,720
Although he is old,

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,840
he is still very strong.

99
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,040
As long as you take good care of him,

100
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
Ning's family will be safe and sound.

101
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Do you understand?

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
Yes.

103
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
Father, please rest assured.

104
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,840
I

105
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,920
won't let you down.

106
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,120
This is the good daughter of Ning's family.

107
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,160
Lord Sun likes you.

108
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,200
You are pregnant.

109
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,640
He will cherish you very much.

110
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,880
Let's go.

111
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,600
I'll escort you there.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,680
Father.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
Lord Ning.

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,400
Take him down.

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,240
How dare you!

116
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,040
Who are you?

117
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,080
How dare you arrest people in my mansion?

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,160
I am Ning Bingqing,

119
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
the chief of the Haitang Bureau.

120
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,240
Lord Ning,

121
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,720
are you going to stop me?

122
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,400
Father, save me.

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Take him away.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,560
Father.

125
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,400
Let go.

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,360
Father, don't leave me alone.

127
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,400
I can do anything.

128
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
I can do anything.

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,120
Father.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,960
Father, save me.

131
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,360
Go.

132
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,520
How dare you!

133
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,120
You ordered me to do this.

134
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,480
There is no daughter of the Gui family in the Cloud Temple.

135
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,520
Only the prisoner.

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,320
Go.

137
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,240
We meet again.

138
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,040
It's a little earlier than I expected.

139
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,920
If it wasn't for an accident,

140
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
you think you can still see me?

141
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,720
Accident?

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Trust me.

143
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,880
I will give you justice.

144
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,680
Ning Bingqing

145
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,160
is not a person who will sit and wait.

146
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,640
So we have to be more careful.

147
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,800
The witness of Zhao Momo's case

148
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,320
appeared too coincidentally.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,920
We have to be careful.

150
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,160
This is the trap he set for me.

151
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,000
Do we have enough money?

152
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,000
Can we really return it?

153
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,200
I am Qiao Ping's son.

154
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,000
and let him escape from the trap

155
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,600
for a second.

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I just

157
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,160
pushed him

158
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,160
and stabbed him.

159
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,200
I know

160
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,320
his feelings for you

161
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,960
will surely

162
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,640
leave you on your wedding day.

163
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,480
So,

164
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
I ordered someone

165
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
to secretly order

166
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,640
a wedding gift for you

167
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,080
in your room.

168
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,760
You bitch!

169
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
You bitch!

170
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,080
You're so agitated.

171
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,280
Aren't you afraid of the birthmark?

172
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,960
You don't know, do you?

173
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,600
You don't have

174
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
any child

175
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,520
in your womb.

176
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,400
You lied to me again.

177
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,520
I'll kill you.

178
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,320
I'll kill you!

179
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,120
What right do you have to kill me?

180
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,440
Ning Bingqing,

181
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,920
even if you want to kill me,

182
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
I'll kill you.

183
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,120
You scammed me

184
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,640
and sent me to the innocent goddess of the Haitang blood

185
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,480
and the burning village of Jiang's.

186
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
How many blood stains did you have?

187
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,160
No one will kill you

188
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,640
when you're back at the wedding.

189
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,920
I'm a noble woman.

190
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm a whore.

191
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,360
How dare you kill me?

192
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,760
You're a noble woman

193
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,200
who's the most important person in the world.

194
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,080
You keep saying that you're a noble woman.

195
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,440
But you're a whore and you're a bitch.

196
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,880
Jiang Laiyang,

197
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,160
you want to uphold justice for the heaven?

198
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,640
It's a pity that you're not brave enough.

199
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm in the mansion of Duke Ning.

200
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,800
My father will come to save me.

201
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,040
Come on.

202
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,320
You're just a tool

203
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
for Duke Ning to gain power.

204
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,280
A tool that has no value

205
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,520
is destined to be abandoned.

206
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,600
Shut up!

207
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,080
Listen to me.

208
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,960
Duke Ning can't leave me.

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,160
He'll come to get me out.

210
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
When I'm out,

211
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,960
I'll kill you at any time.

212
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,800
Okay.

213
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,760
Let's make a bet.

214
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,040
Let's see if you die

215
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,280
or I live.

216
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,120
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,680
A cup of wine, a cup of wine, a cup of wine

246
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,160
Drink a cup, drink a cup

247
00:12:49,160 --> 00:13:05,440
Walk again, the mountains flow, the water is cold, the tears are falling

248
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,200
A cup of wine, a cup of wine, a cup of wine

249
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,680
Drink a cup, drink a cup

250
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,520
I'm afraid that I won't be able to fall in love
