=She Is the Phoenix=

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,960
It's this one.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,390
Anything else you need me to do?

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,510
You really want to help me that much?

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,830
After all, I do have a favor to ask.

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,230
Then answer my question.

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,870
Did you planned out everything

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,710
before you agreed to help me

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,560
find the ledger?

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,910
Once the time came,

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,710
you'd just reclaim your own name?

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,700
Yes.

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,750
So your aim

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,150
isn't just Qi Zhen,

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,000
but also Ning Tao,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,910
and Chang Rong'er.

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,670
That's another question.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Ning Tao's body

28
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,070
is buried
under the Second Courtyard wall.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,490
Chang Rong'er reported it,

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,310
claiming Ning Tao went out
and never came back.

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
If you need to,

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,030
I can reveal the truth.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,080
Thank you, My Lord.

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,590
But before that,

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,750
there's something I must confirm.

36
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
Afterwards,

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,470
Chang Rong'er can meet her end.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,830
There's no need
to keep score between us.

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
If it's for you,

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,670
I'll give it my all.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,960
Thank you.

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,940
=Episode 9=
=The Truth=

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,870
My Lady, white suits you.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,750
You should wear it more often.

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,480
Really?

46
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,750
But Bingqing likes this color too.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,830
I'm worried it might upset her.

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Why would it?

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,190
Each of you have your own charm.

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,030
Greetings, Father, Bingqing.

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,510
Greetings, Your Grace, My Lady.

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,240
Your Grace,

53
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,390
look at the young ladies today.

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,350
Both dressed in white.

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,270
Each has her own grace.

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,480
Indeed.

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,070
Bingqing is elegant.

58
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,150
Leyao is pure.

59
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,190
Both are lovely in their own way.

60
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,810
Father,

61
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,790
I'm not feeling well, excuse me.

62
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,670
Greetings, Your Grace, My Lady.

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,070
Greetings, Your Grace.

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,550
Greetings, Bingqing.

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,230
Your Grace, Lady Leyao dressed

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,630
in white as well.

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,630
They look gorgeous in their own way.

68
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,660
That's true.

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,390
Bingqing is elegant..

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,230
Leyao is pure.

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Bingqing.

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,830
(It's always the same words.)

73
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,230
(Could it be…)

74
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,150
(Is this what caused that nightmare?)

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,790
(What really happened that night?)

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,110
(The truth will soon come out.)

77
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,030
My Lady, please forgive me.

78
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,150
Lady Leyao

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,430
claims to have a Chaste Body.

80
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,510
She insists on wearing white
to show her purity.

81
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,470
Chaste Body?

82
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Alright.

83
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,430
Begonia Snow is set for tomorrow,

84
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,990
but we're still missing someone.

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,390
(Jiang Leyao,)

86
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,150
(no matter if you're reborn or not,)

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,990
(you can't escape this fate.)

88
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,460
My Lord.

89
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,550
Li Yong is still missing.

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,350
We found this roster at his place.

91
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,430
But it seems useless.

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,230
Li Yong's chances look grim.

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,230
Focus on this roster now.

94
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,870
It's full of women's names.

95
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,750
Check them against missing women.

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,070
See if there's a match.

97
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,380
Understood.

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,230
My Lady,

99
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,830
I brewed this Beautifying Decoction.

100
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,150
Drink it while it's warm.

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
Leyao,

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,870
I made this Beautifying Decoction.

103
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,110
Drink it while it's warm.

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,710
Thank you, Rong'er.

105
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,110
Rong'er, after you became a maid,

106
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,670
you've become more thoughtful.

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,750
That's all thanks to your guidance.

108
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,000
(Jiang Leyao,)

109
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,030
(if you refuse to drink,
it shows you're from the past.)

110
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,990
Why does this soup taste a bit odd?

111
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,550
(So you truly know everything.)

112
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,670
I have no appetite,

113
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,230
so I'll let you have it.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,150
But these candied fruits are quite nice.

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,390
Thank you, My Lady.

116
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,240
You may go now.

117
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,110
The purer one's heart,

118
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,350
the more I want to break it.

119
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,710
(Since I suspect you've returned too,)

120
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,190
(why would I put the drug in the soup?)

121
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,670
(Just like last time,)

122
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,870
(you won't escape.)

123
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,480
Stop.

124
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
My Lord.

125
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,590
Lady Leyao is ill.

126
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,270
I was just taking her to the physician.

127
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,990
Please let us pass, My Lord.

128
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,160
Get out of the way.

129
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,350
Why did you kick me?

130
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,230
You know I'm fine.

131
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,390
Fine now, but maybe not later.

132
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,470
Furong Elixir is different.

133
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,270
Even a little is too much for you.

134
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,870
What? Furong Elixir?

135
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,230
But I feel clear-headed now.

136
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,190
No, this chance is rare.

137
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,550
I can't miss it.

138
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,750
Leyao.

139
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,720
Don't.

140
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,760
Let me go.

141
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,340
Let go of me.

142
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,930
Let me go!

143
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,430
You had a nightmare.

144
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,310
That wasn't a dream.

145
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,750
Do you recall

146
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,510
what I told you last night?

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,110
As long as you ask,

148
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,190
I'll do anything for you.

149
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,880
Now,

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,630
can you tell me what really happened?

151
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,760
I...

152
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,230
You really don't trust me?

153
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,470
I only trust myself.

154
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,270
Chang Rong'er is ready to face justice.

155
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,400
As for the rest,

156
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,590
you needn't trouble yourself, My Lord.

157
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,230
You think I want to meddle?

158
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,710
Do you see me, Xiao Jingchu, as idle?

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Wang Yan!

160
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,730
My Lord.

161
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,870
Go dig up Ning Tao's body for me.

162
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,630
And Chang Rong'er.

163
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,670
Bring them back together.

164
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,120
Yes.

165
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,550
Had a nightmare?

166
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,230
Lady Leyao, what are you doing?

167
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,710
Repay blood

168
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,630
