My Girlfriend is an Alien

Episode 2

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Stop!

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
She is my girl.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Where are you taking her?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Get out!

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You are not the one to be punished.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You are the one to be punished.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Second Young Madam,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
it's your turn.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why did you hit me?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am the Second Young Madam.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Shen Er,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
what are you going to do next?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You are a servant.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Why are you doing this to me?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I am going to teach her a lesson.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The lesson is decided by the Duke and Second Young Master.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But I will take care of it in the Second House.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Maids,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
marry the Second Young Madam.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
She will be punished for hitting the Third Young Madam.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
When the masters return to the mansion,

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
she will be punished for her life.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My Lord,

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
the Ning family has committed suicide.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Even if we suspect that it is related to the Ning family,

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
we have lost the last clue.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Then go find a new clue.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you for saving my life, Lord Xiao.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is not a problem.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You want to be my spy?

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can save you

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
with my ability.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You are indeed capable

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
of framing your master

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and seducing the chief minister of the Xuan Yin Bureau.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you want to do?

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The Ning family is strong and powerful.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The Ning family is strong and powerful.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It is a big and small family.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to come to Lord Xiao's house

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to help the Ning family.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You are honest.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then I will give you a chance.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In the study of Duke Ning,

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
there is a book called The Book of Ruyi.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Go and find it for me.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will do my best.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Reply to me every two days.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Lord,

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I am out of the way.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will find you.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Then can you promise me

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
that if I am in danger,

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you will appear in time?

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You are my man

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
when you do things for me.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I will save your life.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you, Lord.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Thank you, Lord.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We are in a cooperation relationship.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You help me find out the information.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Tell me.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What do you want me to do for you?

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Next,

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
you just need to be a distant visitor

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and watch a good show.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Give me back my sachet.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Help!

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I want water.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are they all dead?

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Why are you back?

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Isn't there a way out in Xuan Yin Temple?

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Lord Xiao just wants to investigate

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
if the fire in the village is a man or not.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's an accident.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That fire was an accident.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Accident?

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Accident?

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I came back.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's good that you came back.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I had no choice.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The situation was critical.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I have already thought of a plan.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You will be beaten.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You will not be in danger.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Do you believe me?

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Of course I believe you.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You are my sister.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How can you harm me?

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Of course.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I will not harm you.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Since you are lucky,

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you should live well.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I will need your help in the future.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Lord Ning will take the second young master back home soon.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Qi Zhen will definitely report to the bad guys.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you have any way to deal with it?

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The affairs of Ningguo Palace are busy.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I won't interfere with the second young master.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But Ning Tao is a fool.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He doesn't know what to say.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He listens to Qi Zhen.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
With your beauty and wisdom,

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
it's easy to win the second young master's heart.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't want to serve that fool.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Now the situation is critical.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's easier to serve the second young master

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
than to be kicked out of Ningfu.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have prepared

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the second young master's favorite jade cake.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And I added the lotus umbrella.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I gave this fool the lotus umbrella.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You should enjoy it.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Help me to put on makeup.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Since you took my identity,

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
you should enjoy what I have experienced.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Is it delicious?

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's hot.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's hot.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You should sleep.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You won't sleep.

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sleep.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't bite me.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sleep.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sleep.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Shou has chosen the rich and the poor.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You asked for it.

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
