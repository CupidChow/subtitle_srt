00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The news of the hundred-year-old

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
is coming to the new people.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The new people?

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The new people?

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The new people?

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The new people?

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The new people?

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The new people?

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The new people?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The New People

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Is she really gonna do that?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
She will do it again soon.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's a rare opportunity.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I must get it.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Be good.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,600
It's not wise to risk your life for it.

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,000
But I know

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,000
you'll be careful.

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,440
So you followed Duke Ning

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,680
to get close to me?

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,480
What else?

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,480
Did he like you?

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,320
Xiao Jingyou,

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,600
you killed innocent people

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,960
and killed people.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,840
It's unforgivable.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,760
Now,

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,880
come back to the palace with me

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,320
and report this to my father.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,560
Who cares about a bunch of lowly people?

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,160
I can't be a father.

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,200
I can't be an enemy.

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,560
What's the point of living?

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,080
I burned them to death

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,160
so as not to burden the court.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,720
I'm helping the emperor.

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,920
The country's foundation is for the people.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,760
No matter how rich or poor,

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,720
the people are like grass and grass.

42
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,920
They don't deserve to be the crown prince.

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,240
It's not up to you.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,360
You two

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
are not worthy of being the crown prince.

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,560
You are

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,200
smart indeed.

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
But you're too naive.

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,160
Do you really think

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,760
I'll let you two

51
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,240
leave here alive?

52
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,880
I think

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,160
you will.

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,400
Wang Yan,

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,360
aren't you going to show up?

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
Your Highness,

57
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,800
let me

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,520
escort you back to the palace.

59
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:47,320
Nikandexabout

60
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,760
Your Highness,

61
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,640
do you know your mistake?

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,360
Father.

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,520
I ...

64
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,840
I was just 🌱 grumbling.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
Please forgive me.

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,880
Now that your age

67
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
is Seung- Freooook

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,760
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,680
How about this?

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
You'll be sentenced to three months' imprisonment.

71
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,160
Reflect on your mistakes.

72
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,600
Thank you, Father.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,720
I'll reflect on my mistakes.

74
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,920
Father.

75
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
This is

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,160
2731 lives.

77
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,800
Of course I know.

78
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,360
But he's the crown prince.

79
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
He's the enemy of the state.

80
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,560
He's the foundation of the state.

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,720
Even if he makes

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,280
mistakes occasionally,

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,240
I'll teach him a lesson.

84
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,920
But it's not your turn

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,000
to be the enemy.

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,400
Your Majesty.

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm the one who should be punished.

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,480
I can't be punished if I don't punish him.

89
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
What do you think,

90
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,000
my dear subjects?

91
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,960
Your Majesty.

92
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,800
The crown prince was young and missed the chance to check.

93
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
Now he's lost his memory.

94
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
The crown prince is the crown prince of the state.

95
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,400
He's been imprisoned in the Eastern Palace.

96
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,960
He's been practicing the way to govern the state.

97
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,520
He'll be able to supervise the imperial temple and the country in the future.

98
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,120
I agree.

99
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,440
Great.

100
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,160
How is it?

101
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,440
You two saw it, right?

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,800
He's the crown prince.

103
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,840
He's also the king

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,920
who will be loyal to you.

105
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,400
It's stupid

106
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,880
to oppose him.

107
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,840
Your Majesty.

108
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,400
It's a sacred place.

109
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,960
You're so carefree.

110
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Aren't you afraid of hurting the people's hearts?

111
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,800
Shut up.

112
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,960
It's not your turn

113
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,000
to be the queen of the court.

114
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,720
You're at a disadvantage here.

115
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,280
If you two cause trouble again,

116
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,680
I won't spare you.

117
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,240
Go back to your palace.

118
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,680
Go.

119
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,640
Don't you know it yet?

120
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,640
You're not fighting with me.

121
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
You're fighting with the heavens.

122
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,920
So,

123
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
there's no doubt that I'll lose.

124
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,200
Father.

125
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,040
Father.

126
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,200
Please save my father.

127
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,440
Save my mother.

128
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,320
Enough.

129
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,000
Father.

130
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,160
You're just a concubine.

131
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,720
Just die.

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,200
I just wanted to

133
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,920
pick you up

134
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,400
and say goodbye to you.

135
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,400
She was so frugal

136
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,680
and기를TA QININGY exactement.

137
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,680
It's not

138
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,520
funny.

139
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,320
Nobody likes to exactly

140
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,760
like you.

141
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,520
I don't care

142
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,120
whether it's about me.

143
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Is there no justice in this world?

144
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Jing Chu, the Crown Prince will never give up on you.

145
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,920
If you fight him, you will never win.

146
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Why don't I order you to go to the northwest camp to stop the storm?

147
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Northwest?

148
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Am I going to hide forever?

149
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
The Emperor values the Crown Prince.

150
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,920
No matter what happens, the Emperor will never blame him.

151
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Is it true love or a lie?

152
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,920
You're all useless! Get out!

153
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
This is the third wave of the storm.

154
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
There are no other waves.

155
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
The battle is going on outside.

156
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
It's the Crown Prince.

157
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Guards!

158
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Take out the two people's evil mouths!

159
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Yes!

160
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Yes!

161
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Take out the two people's evil mouths!

162
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Yes!

163
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,920
I'm not going to see the imperial physician.

164
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Summon the imperial physician!

165
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Your Highness.

166
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Where's your master?

167
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
What?

168
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Can't I get him to come?

169
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Your Highness, please calm down.

170
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
The Seventh Prince has a cold.

171
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
His master is in the palace.

172
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Father cares about the Seventh Brother.

173
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
The Crown Prince's pulse is stable.

174
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Master said that if you continue to take the medicine, you will be able to get better.

175
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Come here.

176
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Closer.

177
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
I've been taking this medicine for ten years.

178
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
It has no effect.

179
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Today, you taste it for me.

180
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Is this medicine right?

181
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Why is it coming out?

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Your Highness, please forgive me.

183
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,920
This medicine will only make people become more and more stupid.

184
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,920
How dare you harm me?

185
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
No.

186
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You don't have the guts.

187
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Jiaqi, come here.

188
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Good child, as long as you are obedient and eat the medicine,

189
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,920
everything in my room will be yours.

190
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Can I have this jade seal too?

191
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,920
You are too anxious.

192
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,920
