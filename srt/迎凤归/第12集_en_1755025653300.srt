Am I beautiful?

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,200
Of course, Lady Bingqing.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,040
Why call me that now?

14
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,090
Out!

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,160
Didn't I tell you to go?

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,760
Who upset you this time?

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,080
(I almost forgot)

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
(though she's engaged
to the Crown Prince,)

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,600
(she still can't let go of Xiao Jingchu.)

21
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,900
You're here to prepare

22
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,760
for the Spring Banquet in three days.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,080
We'll formally introduce you

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,680
to Yun City's noble families.

25
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,760
Thank you, Bingqing.

26
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,520
You've always been so kind to me.

27
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,440
I wish to do something for you as well.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,340
What help can you offer me?

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,600
Bingqing,

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,120
would you like to invite Lord Xiao

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,440
for a walk?

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,280
(If I wish to truly earn her trust,)

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,840
(I can't simply obey her)

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
(like Rong'er did.)

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,720
(I must help her,)

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,280
(like the God of Matchmaking.)

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,820
Today is the Death Anniversary
of your mother.

38
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,960
His Majesty's arrival

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,480
is surely to honor her memory.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Stop! What are you doing?

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,920
Why all the noise?

42
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,560
Consort Xi was feeling unwell.

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,840
She didn't like these peony blossoms.

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,200
Father.

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,680
These were Mother's favorite flowers.

46
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,040
They're all she left me.

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,560
She was just a palace maid,

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,240
one whose name I can hardly recall.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
Must I really honor her now?

50
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,360
Keep smashing them until they're gone.

51
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,040
Take this. Use it to keep yourself safe.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Mm.

53
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,280
Jingchu,

54
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,760
go to Mother's room,

55
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
help bring me a pot of peony blossom.

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
I'd do anything for Mother.

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
Go on, then.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,840
What brings you here?

59
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,420
Looks like you've recovered.

60
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,600
You can walk around.

61
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,520
Thanks to your medicine.

62
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,760
Thank you, My Lord.

63
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,760
Gratitude and repayment

64
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,160
aren't really your style, Leyao.

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,320
Speak. Why did you come to me?

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,720
I'd like to discuss,

67
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,720
working with you again.

68
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,560
Tomorrow,

69
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,520
can you accompany Ning Bingqing
on the lake?

70
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,230
I'm not free.

71
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,200
In return,

72
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,320
I'll grant you one request, My Lord.

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,240
How did you know about this?

74
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Lighting sky lanterns
guides the departed.

75
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,120
Xiao Jingchu,

76
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,320
you can write down

77
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,860
your longing and wishes.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,480
The lantern will send your words on.

79
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,140
I've never believed in the afterlife,

80
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,880
let alone in sky lanterns.

81
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,120
The realm of the dead

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
was always born of tales.

83
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,480
How could my words be sent?

84
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
A wandering soul among mortals.

85
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,640
Dark spirits roam free.

86
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,520
Family waits below in the afterlife.

87
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,760
Sometimes I wish,

88
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,520
that world was truly real.

89
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,320
Xiao Jingchu, hurry, write it down.

90
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,680
Jiang Leyao,

91
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
tell me,

92
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
is it harder for those who leave first,

93
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,280
or for those left behind?

94
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,760
Those who leave first

95
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,560
will build our next home.

96
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,040
Those left behind

97
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,680
live on with sorrow and longing,

98
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,360
but as long as we live,

99
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,960
there is still hope.

♪Words lost in choking silence,

101

while others

103
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,940
cling to life fueled by hate,

104
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,850
and that's how they endure.

♪Cold window and the faded letter

106

as long as it gives strength,
it's enough.

108
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:22,740
(Sky lanterns send your wishes afar)

109
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,920
I'll count to three,

110
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,480
then we release it.

111
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,000
One, two, three.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,260

♪Let longing be sent with the breeze♪

118

(Xiao Jingchu,)

119
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,040
(too much hatred burdens me.)

120
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,090
(I cannot return your feelings.)

121
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,110
(You will find the one)

122
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,000
(who'll never let you be alone.)

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
(Jiang Leyao,)

124
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,400
(I hope you never leave me.)

125
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,680
We've found something.

126
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,540
Speak.

127
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,880
The roster we found

128
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,840
in the Ruyi House

129
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,160
matches the missing girls' list
from ten years.

130
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
It seems

131
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,040
Ruyi House is just the beginning.

132
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,440
What we're looking into

133
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,000
is more complex than we thought.

134
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
However,

135
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,240
we've already raided

136
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,280
the gambling den.

137
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,440
For now, we can follow the clues

138
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,960
from these missing girls

139
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
and keep investigating.

140
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,720
When?

141
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
Ah.

142
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,880
When should I meet Ning Bingqing tomorrow?

143
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,840
Oh, at the Xu Hour.

144
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,800
Alright.

145
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,840
Weren't you the one trying to match them?

146
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,760
Why are you so anxious now?

147
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,360
I'm not anxious at all.

148
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm just worried,

149
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,960
that Xiao Jingchu might make a mess.

150
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,840
Why isn't he back so late?

151
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,040
I'll go take a look.

152
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,070
I never wish to meet

153
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,400
such shallow women again.

154
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
My Lord.

155
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,400
Miss Jiang is here.

156
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,960
How is it today, My Lord?

157
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,160
She is well-read and polite.

158
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,860
Spending time with her

159
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
feels like basking in the spring breeze.

160
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,120
Indeed.

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
After our boat ride,

162
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,160
we visited the Washe Theatre,

163
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
and watched
Romance of the Western Chamber.

164
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,680
That was wonderful.

165
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,280
I enjoyed talking with another lady,

166
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,600
but you didn't seem upset.

167
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,440
Today's outing was my arrangement,

168
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,480
and everything went as I wished,

169
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,200
so why would I be angry?

170
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
Jiang Leyao,

171
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,720
look into my eyes and tell me,

172
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,600
have you never felt a thing for me?

173
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,520
Not at all.

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,040
If anything, My Lord,

175
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,160
you're the one pressing me.

176
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,080
Could it be...

177
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,160
you are the one with feelings for me?

178
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,200
I...

179
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,920
Of course not.

180
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,880
Glad to hear that.

181
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,920
Leyao,

182
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,640
how do you truly feel about me?

183
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,840
I've already said,

184
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,000
it's merely cooperation.

185
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,960
There's nothing beyond that.

186
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,480
Then why?

187
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,080
Why did you help with the peonies?

188
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
It was just out of convenience.
