1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,660
The

2
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,120
Epoch Thank you then

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,020
If you give a

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,480
Set a

5
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,540
акс

6
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,500
freshwater

7
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,800
Stir well

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid that the people in the northwest are in a bad situation.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Many people are starving.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you have any good ideas?

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Father,

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
the northwest bandits are very powerful.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If we send them to the north,

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm afraid they will be robbed.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Besides,

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the northwest bandits are very powerful.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If we send them to the north,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the northwest bandits are very powerful.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So we might as well not save them.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What about you?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The people in the northwest

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
are also the people of the emperor.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If we don't save them,

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we will be afraid of losing the people's hearts.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
we should send officers and people from the Ministry of Finance

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
to calculate the exact numbers.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We should find the people who are in the disaster.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We should open the warehouse and put food in the warehouse.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's the best way to do it.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Good.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
From tomorrow,

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you will be the imperial tutor.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you, father.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're welcome.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
As for you,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
when you're free,

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
read the sacred books.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Take her down.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Go.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Go and tell Duke Ning

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that the hundred-year-old garden will be opened tonight.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't let me down.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He Ya,

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
the Crown Prince wants you to go to the capital to play in the garden.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You should dress up in the books.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Remember to obey the rules

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and make the garden more beautiful.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Jin You,

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
your secret is going to be revealed to the world.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You must tell the people

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
who killed innocent people to thank them.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Father.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Go.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll send you there in person.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What's wrong?

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Nothing.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Stop the carriage.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Stop the carriage.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Send me to the Yuxiang Park.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Even if you use this dagger

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to stab me today,

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll be a traitor.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't try to stop me.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll kill you.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I didn't expect my second brother

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
to be a love seed.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Love is good.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can't wait to see

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
when he knows that the woman he loves

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
has received the reaction of others after she entered.

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Prepare the horse.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Father.

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why are you so late?

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Go in quickly.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't let everyone wait too long.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Everyone?

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Isn't it only the Crown Prince?

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They are all Crown Prince's subordinates.

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You must get familiar with them

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
since you are going to marry into the Crown Prince's Mansion.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I understand.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Go.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are the most beautiful girl in the capital.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You are also the most proud daughter of Ning's Mansion.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Go.

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
From now on,

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
your hatred for the evil disciples

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
will be fair to the world.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Soon, the world will be in chaos

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and will be cursed for ten thousand years.

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Your Majesty.

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Your Majesty.

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The cook is pretty fresh.

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Bastard.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You are the private maid of the Empress Dowager.

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You are the first female official in our court.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Excuse me.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's you.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No.

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I got the wrong person.

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Stop.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your Highness.

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Xiao Jingyou, your time of death has come.

109
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You don't know the rules.

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
There are only beasts here.

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No one else.

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
must be punished.

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, no.

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's Furong.

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Furong.

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Watch carefully.

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is a new little beast I caught.

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't let it run away.

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
As long as you like it,

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I promise I'll catch all the young girls

124
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and give you a good lesson.

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If I want more than these things,

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
can you find them for me?

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Although we don't know each other,

128
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
we can only be familiar with you.

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The royal family is the most glorious and the most powerful.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Long live Your Majesty.

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Long live Your Majesty.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Long live Your Majesty.

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Long live Your Majesty.

145
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Arise.

146
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

147
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you know where this is?

148
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But I know

150
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
you're the boss of the Ruyi Gambling House.

151
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're the boss of the Beihuo Gambling House.

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're the one who colluded with the Dali Temple.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You're the one who made the second batch of gold coins

154
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and the black hand behind the case.

155
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So what?

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The death of a group of people

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
can make me happy.

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's their honor.

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're shameless.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
As the crown prince,

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you killed, killed, and killed people.

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're worse than a beast.

163
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Xiao Jing Chu and that master

164
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
are really in cahoots.

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What?

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You want to investigate me?

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You want to take me down?

168
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a pity that

169
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I've already noticed

170
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
your tricks.

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I've been fooling you.

173
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Today,

174
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
you're here again.

175
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Go.

176
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Take off his clothes

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
to cheer up

178
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
for tonight's birthday party.

179
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Who are you?

180
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Your Highness,

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I didn't expect

182
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
we were fooling you.

183
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Your Highness,

184
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm here to see you.

185
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm here to see you.

186
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm here to see you.

187
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm here to see you.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm here to see you.

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm here to see you.

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm here to see you.

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm here to see you.

192
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm here to see you.

193
