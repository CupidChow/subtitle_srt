Episode 17

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The Wind and the Rain

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is what you owe me.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will go up and apologize to everyone in Jiang Village.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, it's not me. It's Ning Bingqing.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Of course I know it's him.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let him go.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But you won't wrong me at all.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I just want to go up and apologize.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Am I wrong?

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Are you willing to be taught by others for the rest of your life?

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You can go up and apologize.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But you shouldn't have treated my parents,

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the 230 gods of Jiang Village,

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
as your stepping stones.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is the birthday gift my mother gave me

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
on the day of the fire.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I want to give it to you.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Jiang Village's relatives,

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
look at this.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I will send this sinner to the hell

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
to be punished for what he did.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Chang Rong is inside.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Lord Hang, take him away.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Welcome, Second Miss.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Welcome, Second Miss.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Miss, Second Young Master is dead.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Rong'er is alive.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You are now the real second miss Ning Fu.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ning Bingqing, it's your turn.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
My Lord, these days,

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
the Lord has been making trouble in Ning Bingqing's yard.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Ning Bingqing never let him in.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ning Bingqing?

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is his next target.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And Rong'er's case.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The evidence is clear.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's get the case.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wait.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Remember to find out the truth.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Jiang Liyang.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Third Miss, I have to find a way

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
to get Ning Bingqing's trust.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The Xun people of Qiong Sanwei.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You are the sister he just took in.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I heard that you have been here for three days.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You are the one who took him in.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You are so kind.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You are so kind to keep an eye on my yard.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why don't you go back and read more books?

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can be a good daughter

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
if you have money.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You...

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Qiao'er.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The opportunity is coming.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I have to go.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have to go.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I have to go.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Are you blind?

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I am sorry.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think you did it on purpose.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Ning Bingqing told you to do it, right?

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was too clumsy.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not about you.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why you let me serve you in the yard.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I did it to learn the etiquette rules.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I will go out in the future.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I will shout and be rude.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will lose my dignity.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Who said that?

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
My family is the biggest emperor in the country.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How can I let you humiliate me?

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I didn't give you my name.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why are you so nice to me?

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I...

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have a stomachache.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have to go out.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Jiang Leyang.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You put the antidote in my tea tree.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Who told you to speak ill of my elder sister?

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You think she is elder sister.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But she thinks you are a bitch.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I was born in a low position.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's my honor to serve my elder sister.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But Lv Si made me angry.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He is more excellent than you.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What are you talking about?

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Tang Qiao.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You hit my sister in my mansion.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Do you think I can bully you?

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You...

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I am sorry, elder sister.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I just want to vent my anger on you.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Did I cause trouble for you?

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I thought you were smart.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But I didn't expect you to be so stupid.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
She asked you.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Are you going to admit it?

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Because...

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because I did it.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You should learn the rules.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Serve her in the house in the future.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will go to the room.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Serve her in the house in the future.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Really, elder sister.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I will serve her well.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I will make you suffer.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What is the pain?

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Miss.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I am here.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I am going to serve Ning Bingqing.

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You should go back to her.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You are so kind.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You are so sincere.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't you think so?

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I am so worried about my parents.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't have the right to talk about love.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But you will have a new life

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
when you have the revenge.

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I hate to see you smile.

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't have a new life.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't be involved in new things.

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Forget it.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let her give up earlier.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The rain is falling.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The rain is falling.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The world is changing.

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The light is dimming.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The water is flowing.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Autumn is coming.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The moon is brightening.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The light is dimming.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I drink to the end of the night.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I am drunk.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I drink to the end of the night.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The water is flowing.

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The wind is blowing.

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I am drunk.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I drink to the end of the night.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I am drunk.

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I am drunk.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I drink to the end of the night.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The water is flowing.

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The wind is blowing.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The rain is pouring.
