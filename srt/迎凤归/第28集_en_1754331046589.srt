1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,880
belongings.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,920
liability.

3
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
You

4
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,240
did not weigh too much.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,360
I know to treat you.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,380
Novoland

7
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,380
Episode 16

8
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,380
You are a human being.

9
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,380
Let me think.

10
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,380
I should be

11
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,380
the ghost that died for my father.

12
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,380
Impossible.

13
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,380
No.

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,380
Impossible.

15
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,380
This is our father and daughter's business.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,380
Don't get involved.

17
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,380
Father.

18
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
Li Qing.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,380
When father gave you the wine,

20
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,380
you didn't know how long it was.

21
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,380
Father.

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
But I'm not here to listen to your explanation.

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Do you know how many candles are in this room?

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
496.

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Do you know why it's 496?

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Because father

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,400
gave me 496 times.

28
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,420
I'm sorry, Bingqian.

29
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,420
I won't do this again.

30
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,420
I'm your father.

31
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,420
Father?

32
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,420
You've been lying to me for 20 years with this word.

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,420
But today,

34
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,420
I don't believe you anymore.

35
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
Bingqian, I beg you.

36
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
Please let me go.

37
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,420
I beg you.

38
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,420
Get out.

39
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,420
Father.

40
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,420
You can't get out.

41
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
I killed too many people.

42
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,420
I can't get out either.

43
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
I came here today

44
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,420
just to do one thing.

45
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,440
I'm giving you the 496 candles.

46
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
You bastard.

47
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
You really dare to rebel.

48
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Old man.

49
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,440
You've been sitting in this seat for a long time.

50
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,440
You should make a move.

51
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
You're a traitor.

52
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
You're a traitor.

53
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
You're a traitor.

54
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
You're a traitor.

55
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
You're a traitor.

56
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm a traitor.

57
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm a traitor.

58
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,440
But you forced me to do all this.

59
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
I...

60
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
I'm your eldest son.

61
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
I'm respected.

62
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,440
This throne should be mine.

63
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
But what did you do?

64
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
You could have

65
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,440
reminded me of your seventh prince.

66
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
I've been protecting you for so many years.

67
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,460
You even took away my dignity as a man.

68
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,460
Kid.

69
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
Listen to me.

70
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,460
That was just an accident.

71
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,460
You're my own son.

72
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,460
How could I do that to you?

73
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,460
I'm your son.

74
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,460
Yes.

75
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,460
I'm your son.

76
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,460
But you only have the right

77
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
to do this.

78
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
You don't have any love.

79
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Since you can't bear it,

80
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
don't blame me for being unfilial.

81
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Today,

82
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm going to rebel and break the rules.

83
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
I'll kill you first.

84
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Then I'll kill your seventh prince.

85
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Stop fooling around.

86
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm late to save the emperor.

87
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Please forgive me.

88
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
What are you talking about?

89
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Good son.

90
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
You're finally here.

91
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
You...

92
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Why are you here?

93
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Of course we're here.

94
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Because you're going to rebel.

95
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
It's all in our hands.

96
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
The truth is all in our plan.

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Is it true or false?

103
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Luo Yao.

104
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
What do you want?

105
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
The emperor can still protect the crown prince.

106
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
It's just that the crown prince

107
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
hasn't really threatened the emperor.

108
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
But if the crown prince

109
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
really rebels,

110
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
I'll see if he wants me.

111
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Then how do we make him rebel?

112
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,500
We should let the crown prince's secret

113
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
be known to everyone.

114
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
We let you know on purpose

115
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
that the emperor didn't mean to pass it on to you.

116
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
It's just that you'll rebel.

117
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Your Highness,

118
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
you really didn't disappoint anyone.

119
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Father!

120
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Father!

121
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Father, I'm sorry.

122
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Give me another chance.

123
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
They framed me.

124
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Father!

125
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
You're a traitor!

126
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Get out!

127
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Father!

128
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Father!

129
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Father, give me another chance.

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Father!

131
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
Father!

132
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Father!

133
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Luo Yao.

134
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
Luo Yao.

135
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
Yes?

136
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,540
You've lost weight.

137
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Father!

138
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,540
Father!

139
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Our Luo Yao

140
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
is now a female official of Dali Temple.

141
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
Father!

142
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
Are you happy?

143
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Luo Yao, no!

144
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,540
I just want to go back to the capital.

145
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,540
I want to be with my mother.

146
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
Luo Yao,

147
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
you must always remember

148
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,540
that I'm your father.

149
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,540
Mother is your brother.

150
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,540
As long as I look at you in the sky,

151
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,540
I'll let you go

152
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,540
as long as the world is big.

153
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,540
Do you understand?

154
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
Father!

155
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Mother!

156
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,540
I want to know!

157
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,540
I want...

158
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,540
I want to hear you.

159
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,540
I want...

160
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
I want to miss you.

161
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Father.

162
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Father.

163
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,560
I want to be with my mother.

164
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I want to be with my mother.

165
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Father.

166
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Father.

167
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Father.

168
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Mother.

169
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,560
You can rest in peace.

170
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,560
I heard that Jingyou and Yu Zhong shot themselves.

171
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
The Crown Prince is dead.

172
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,560
The Empress is being investigated.

173
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
The Empress committed suicide.

174
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,560
The Emperor is also in a bad shape.

175
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,560
She intended to give you a position.

176
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Thank you, Grandmother.

177
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
I won't let you down.

178
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Okay.

179
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Come.

180
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
I summoned you to the palace

181
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
not for this matter.

182
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
I just want to ask

183
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
how your marriage plan is going.

184
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
What do you mean by a bride?

185
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
I'm not a bride.

186
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm a concubine.

187
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
I'm a concubine.

188
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
What do you mean by a bride

189
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
who has a secret and is innocent?

190
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,580
She's taken in by her wife

191
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
and is taken in by her husband?

192
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,580
Taken in?

193
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,580
That's a good way to call a kidnap.

194
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,580
No.

195
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
I must find out

196
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,580
the case of kidnap women.

197
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,580
When is the plan

198
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
for Qingjiang Leyao in Dali Temple?

199
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,580
I'll wait and see.

200
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,580
When is the plan for the vacation?

201
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
After these cases are settled,

202
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
it should be five years later.

203
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
Then,

204
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,580
what about our marriage?

205
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Ten years later.

206
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Ten years later?

207
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I want her to be my wife soon.

208
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
But I want her to be herself.

209
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
For this,

210
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I'll work hard for the rest of my life.

211
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I'll do whatever it takes.

212
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Okay.

213
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I'm telling you,

214
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I'm the emperor now.

215
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
What?

216
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Are you anxious?

217
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I am.

218
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
I want to build a country that follows the law.

219
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
The deceased will not be pardoned.

220
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,600
The poor will not be despised.

221
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I want everyone here

222
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
to be free,

223
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
equal and independent.

224
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
I want to drink with you.

225
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I want to drink with you.

226
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
I want to drink with you.

227
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
I want to drink with you.

228
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
I want to drink with you.

229
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I want to drink with you.

230
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
I want to drink with you.

231
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I want to drink with you.

232
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
I want to drink with you.

233
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
I want to drink with you.

234
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I want to drink with you.

235
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I want to drink with you.

236
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I want to drink with you.

237
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
I want to drink with you.

238
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,600
Wine is drunk,

239
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
