1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
There is nothing at all

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,040
No big deal

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,240
SM x 2

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:23,980
Dull

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,980
The Love by Hypnotic

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,980
Episode 14

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,980
I don't care about the money!

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,980
Just tell me what you want!

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,980
Go away!

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,980
You...

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,980
You...

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,980
You...

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,980
You...

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,980
You...

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,980
You...

16
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,980
You...

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,980
You...

18
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,980
You...

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,980
You...

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,980
You...

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,980
You...

22
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,980
You...

23
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,980
You...

24
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,980
You...

25
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,980
You...

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,980
You...

27
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,980
You...

28
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,980
You...

29
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
I'm telling you, old man.

30
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,980
If you don't pay me back,

31
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,980
I'll chop off your hands!

32
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,980
Get lost!

33
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,980
You bastard!

34
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,980
You always say that, right?

35
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,980
Do you want to find your daughter,

36
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,980
Chang Rong'er?

37
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,980
You filial daughter,

38
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,980
do you still know your father?

39
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,980
Duke Luo,

40
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,980
you must help me!

41
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,980
My daughter is in Ningfu,

42
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,980
enjoying her wealth and glory.

43
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,980
But my father is wandering on the street!

44
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,980
Duke Luo...

45
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Come here!

46
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,980
Father!

47
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,980
I'm telling you,

48
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,980
you bitch, be good!

49
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,980
If I don't sell you,

50
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,980
how can I pay back the money?

51
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,980
If you don't behave,

52
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,980
I'll break your legs!

53
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,980
You...

54
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,980
Sister, don't be afraid.

55
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,980
I can protect you.

56
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,980
Come back with me!

57
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,980
You...

58
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,980
I...

59
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,980
Who is your daughter?

60
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,980
Tell her to come out and solve it.

61
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,980
Don't ruin the reputation of our Mansion.

62
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,980
My daughter...

63
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,980
I...

64
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,980
This is my daughter...

65
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,980
Father,

66
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,980
you misunderstood me.

67
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,980
I'm just a maid

68
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,980
in this Mansion.

69
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Since it's about you two,

70
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,980
go out and solve it.

71
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
Don't waste the time of the nobles.

72
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,980
The most painful thing is to stab someone.

73
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,980
Before I figure out

74
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
what happened that day,

75
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,980
you just wait and see.

76
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
Father!

77
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,980
Come here!

78
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,980
Father, get up!

79
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,980
Father, let's talk outside.

80
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,980
I don't want to...

81
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,980
Let's go out.

82
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,980
It's okay.

83
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,980
Let's talk outside.

84
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,980
Father!

85
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,980
Father!

86
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
Father!

87
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,980
Father!

88
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,980
Father!

89
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,980
Jiang Luo Yao,

90
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,980
who are you going to revenge in the end?

91
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,980
300 taels.

92
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,980
If you don't give it to me,

93
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,980
I'll ask my father to give me some money.

94
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,980
You took the money.

95
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,980
Let's cut off our father and daughter's relationship.

96
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
Don't worry,

97
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,980
Second Young Madam.

98
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,980
It's time to take back

99
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,980
the identity of Second Young Madam.

100
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,980
Mr. Xiao came to Ning Mansion in the daytime.

101
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,980
He came and didn't say a word.

102
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,980
What is he looking at?

103
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,980
Look at you.

104
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,980
Qi Zhen bit him to death.

105
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,980
He did everything.

106
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,980
He was already in prison

107
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
and committed suicide for the crime.

108
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,980
His son, Li Yong,

109
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,980
killed people with iron evidence.

110
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
He has been wanted.

111
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,980
I've called all the people in the school.

112
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,980
They haven't been found yet.

113
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
Li Yong was found by Xiao Jing Chu

114
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,980
and sentenced to death.

115
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,980
Could it be that things have changed?

116
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,980
Li Yong hid it very well.

117
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,980
How did you find his existence?

118
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,980
And you asked me to investigate him?

119
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
I...

120
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,980
I...

121
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,980
I...

122
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,980
I...

123
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,980
What is your purpose?

124
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,980
It's not over yet.

125
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,980
Mr. Xiao,

126
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,980
you can take your time.

127
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,980
Okay, I'll take my time.

128
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,980
What do you want me to do next?

129
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,980
Be careful not to hurt your son.

130
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,980
So,

131
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,980
no one can hear it.

132
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
I want

133
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
to

134
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,980
let you

135
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,980
hear it.

136
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Let Mr. Xiao set up a trap for me

137
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,980
to let Chang Shu

138
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,980
take the drug store.

139
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
In two days,

140
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,980
he will definitely find the account book here.

141
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
I've already

142
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,980
found the entrance of the study.

143
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,980
In two days,

144
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
I will definitely find the account book.

145
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Okay.

146
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
I'll be waiting for you.

147
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Rong'er,

148
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
help me.

149
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
Or I'll die.

150
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Last time we agreed

151
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
that if you get 300 taels,

152
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,980
we'll sever the relationship between father and daughter.

153
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,980
Rong'er,

154
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,980
you're my biological son.

155
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,980
How much can we sever the relationship?

156
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
500 taels.

157
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,980
Help me one last time.

158
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
I'm begging you.

159
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,980
One last time.

160
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Rong'er.

161
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,980
Greetings, Miss.

162
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
I heard that you have a bad appetite.

163
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
I made some snacks

164
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,980
for you.

165
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,980
Jiangnan is a good place.

166
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,980
You're really good at tasting food.

167
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,980
Hurry up.

168
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Send them to Miss.

169
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,980
Okay.

170
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,980
The nobleman said that

171
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,980
as long as I can burn down the whole village,

172
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,980
I can live a luxurious life.

173
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,980
So,

174
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,980
Rong'er said that

175
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,980
you're the nobleman.

176
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Rong'er said that

177
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,980
you're the nobleman.

178
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,980
You've served me all day.

179
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,980
What do you want?

180
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,980
Miss, please forgive me.

181
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,980
I was threatened and I need money.

182
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,980
You can't handle such a small matter.

183
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,980
Where's your courage

184
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,980
to burn down the village?

185
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,980
I'm begging you to give me a chance.

186
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,980
I won't let you down.

187
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Really?

188
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Tell me what you want to do.

189
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,980
I want to live.

190
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,980
I can't live without

191
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,980
the fire.

192
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Okay.

193
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
You're a cruel girl.

194
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,980
Don't let us down.

195
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,980
You want to be my dog.
