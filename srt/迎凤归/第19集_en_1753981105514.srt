Episode 21

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I can't help it.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I can't help it.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can't help it.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can't help it.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I can't help it.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What is it?

11
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,980
I wrote it立田

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,020
I heard to give you it

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,580
I remember

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,340
Don't be afraid

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,460
For Highness

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,420
That Milady

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,120
documentation

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,880
everyone

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,740
with selfless self-pity

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,100
meetings

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,020
without runt aircraft

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,000
Today

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,400
On this��

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,240
victory

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,660
as the primer

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,960
yes

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,880
Jiao Ping,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,080
I don't want to see Jiang Le Yao again.

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,200
But if he dies,

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,000
it will be too easy for him.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,600
I heard

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,080
he's been very close to that woman recently.

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,600
Jiao Ping,

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,320
I want him to live a happy life.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,520
This is himLast night,

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,000
he appeared in Dantian's lips.

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,360
This is a coat I wore when I was young and lost.

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,320
I wonder if you still remember it.

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
You are awake, Mrs. Zhao.

40
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Mrs. Zhao, I've asked for your safety.

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Mrs. Zhao, you can't get up.

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Mrs. Zhao, you are awake.

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Mrs. Zhao.

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
You killed Mrs. Zhao?

45
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Yes.

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
I killed Mrs. Zhao.

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Mrs. Zhao?

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,320
But the Court of Judicial Review has determined that Mrs. Zhao committed suicide.

49
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
If you want to take revenge,

50
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
she can come at me.

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Why did you kill her?

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
She is innocent.

53
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
She is innocent.

54
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
She is innocent if she wants to help you.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
You devil.

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Jiang Liyou, you should believe that you are innocent.

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Otherwise,

58
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,320
you are not only holding Mrs. Zhao's body.

59
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,320
The second lady has committed suicide.

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Close her in the woodshed.

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,320
When will you write a thousand letters of repentance to me and release her?

62
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Take her away.

63
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Ten thousand and four thousand.

64
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,320
I want to take revenge with ten thousand and four thousand.

65
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Young lady, the second young master and Rong'er are dead.

66
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
You are the proper second lady of Ningfu now.

67
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
You want to coordinate with them.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Now you are the one who can help them.

69
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
I want you to help me.

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
I want to help you.

71
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
I want to help you.

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
I want to help you.

73
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
I want to help you.

74
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
I want to help you.

75
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Why are you so anxious now?

76
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
You really made it difficult for two people.

77
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
What we want to do

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,320
is to change the rules of this world.

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Can we do it?

80
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
We

81
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
will do it.

82
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Miss, I got the divorce papers.

84
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
I've been waiting for 20 years.

85
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I got it.

86
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
You were kidnapped.

87
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Your biological father

88
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
has been looking for you for so many years.

89
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
He never gave up on you.

90
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
At this time,

91
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm not abandoned.

92
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
This

93
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
is your indenture.

94
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
You will be free from now on.

95
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
This is the girl's dance.

96
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Take the last heart.

97
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
After you go out,

98
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
live a good life with your parents.

99
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
I know I was wrong.

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
I've been reflecting on myself these days.

102
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Please forgive me.

103
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Let me hear.

104
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
What's wrong?

105
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
I was wrong

106
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
because I was just a maid.

107
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
I shouldn't have been with the eldest daughter of Ning's Mansion.

108
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
I lost my respect and respect.

109
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
I was wrong because as the second lady of Ning's Mansion,

110
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I was a servant.

111
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
I was wrong because I was a servant.

112
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Enough.

113
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
The Empress Dowager's banquet today

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
is to see you.

115
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Go and pack up.

116
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Ning Bingqing.

117
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
before

118
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
I just made you lose your honor.

119
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Next,

120
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Is it time to make you lose your reputation?

121
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

122
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Your Majesty.

123
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Your Majesty.

124
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Your Majesty.

125
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Ning Bingqing.

126
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,920
Greetings, Your Highness the Empress Dowager.

127
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,520
Good. Good.

128
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,120
Raise your head.

129
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,320
Reporting to Your Highness, that is the Second Prince's

130
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
daughter that he asked to see.

131
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Jiang Le Yao.

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,320
Ning's manor is a woman's army.

133
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,120
I have read your blood-thirsty rules.

134
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,520
You are indeed a noble woman.

135
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,320
I am a woman who is a good example.

136
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,120
Thank you for your praise, Your Highness the Empress Dowager.

137
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,520
But I don't think that writing these rules

138
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,520
is worth praising.

139
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,120
I summoned you today to show my respect for you.

140
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,520
Your Highness, I heard that the Second Miss of Ning's manor

141
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,920
is not only talented and unparalleled,

142
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,120
but also good and evil, and has a good personality.

143
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,320
I am also fond of the Second Prince Xiao Jing Chu.

144
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,720
I am just helping Lord Xiao solve the case.

145
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,920
I learned a lot from him.

146
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,520
It seems that you know some investigation.

147
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,720
I am also modest.

148
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,320
Not bad. Come.

149
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,520
Come sit here.

150
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

151
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,720
Sit.

152
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,520
Your Highness the Empress Dowager, my sister is from a poor family.

153
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,320
She is usually rude. Thanks to my guidance,

154
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,320
I have some good looks.

155
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,120
Oh, right. I caused you trouble today.

156
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,920
I prepared some new tea for you.

157
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,720
I apologize to you.

158
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,320
Please forgive me.

159
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Please forgive me.

160
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,060
democracy

161
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,520
Master Ning,

162
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,800
First Miss...

163
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,320
It was startsle you

164
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,120
when you smell something that tastes very strong,

165
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,080
such as tea.

166
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,160
Ms. Zhang,

167
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,600
don't you want to forgive me?

168
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,800
You know your mistakes and you can correct them.

169
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,920
Bingqing,

170
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,600
drink it.

171
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,080
Sure.

172
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,960
Ms. Zhang,

173
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,320
what happened?

174
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,680
No.

175
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,760
The tea is not to taste so good.

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,120
Is that so?

177
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,560
But isn't this

178
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,600
your favorite tea, Ms. Zhang?

179
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,680
It's too dry.

180
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,880
Your Highness, please give me the order.

181
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,520
Call the imperial physician to cure my sister.

182
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,280
Guards.

183
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,280
Yes.

184
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,320
Summon the imperial physician.

185
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,720
Summon the imperial physician.

186
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,480
This is the maid of the First Miss, Xiao Tao.

187
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,080
This cloth was hit by the First Miss again this morning.

188
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,400
I've been wanting to hear the Second Miss's story.

189
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,200
Here.

190
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,280
You've made the maid of the First Miss's

191
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,880
to take her pregnancy medicine.

192
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,000
In less than half a month,

193
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,440
she'll be pregnant.

194
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,560
If she knew you did this,

195
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,000
she wouldn't let you off.

196
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,880
You can't stay here any longer.

197
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,640
Take this money and leave now.

198
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,240
If she knew you did this,

199
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,640
she would take revenge

200
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
on you.

201
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,560
Aren't you afraid?

202
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm afraid this matter is not big enough.

203
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,280
After the Crown Prince's court session,

204
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,160
he's going to greet the Empress Dowager.

205
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,960
The good show is about to begin.

206
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,160
Your Highness,

207
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,600
looking at the pulse,

208
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,000
she's pregnant.

209
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,120
The imperial physician is right.

210
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,680
I'm the daughter of Duke Ning's manor.

211
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,880
I'm the future Crown Princess.

212
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,240
I'm not that kind of woman.

213
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,360
Your Highness, you're wise.

214
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
I've made a promise to you.

215
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,720
This girl is indeed pregnant.

216
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,800
She's been pregnant for more than a month.

217
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,160
The medicine is actually a fake pregnancy medicine.

218
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,040
After taking it for a while,

219
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,880
she'll get pregnant.

220
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,160
Even the best doctors

221
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,200
can only diagnose pregnancy.

222
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,880
Imperial physician, where did you go wrong?

223
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,880
You even got pregnant.

224
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,440
You'll be in trouble.

225
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,280
Shut up!

226
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Shut up!

227
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,120
Ning Bingqing,

228
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,520
how dare you!

229
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,000
Tell me, who's the father of the child?

230
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,000
Sister,

231
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,840
you must have been forced, right?

232
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,640
Tell me.

233
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,920
The Empress Dowager will definitely help you.

234
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,120
Ning Bingqing.

235
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,680
Ning Bingqing.

236
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,280
You've disappointed me.

237
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,520
Guards,

238
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320
take her to the court for interrogation.

239
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,760
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

240
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,840
That person...

241
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
That person is...

242
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,120
Greetings, Grandmother.

243
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,400
The Crown Prince

244
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
is just in time.

245
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,920
How will you deal with your fiancee?

246
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,320
You decide

247
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,120
how to deal with your fiancee.

248
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,840
Ning Bingqing,

249
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
this time,

250
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,640
you'll never turn around.

251
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,760
I'll be drunk for a while

252
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,200
Drunk as I drink

253
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Afraid that I'll be drunk

254
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
Drunk as I drink

255
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,360
Drunk as I drink

256
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,600
I'll go to the mountains and water the water

257
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,280
I'll be drunk for a while

258
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,760
Drunk as I drink

259
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,720
Afraid that I'll be drunk
