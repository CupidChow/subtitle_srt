11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,960
Since you wish to help me,

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,840
then do one more thing for me.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,000
What is it?

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,440
Qiao Ping,

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,520
I never want to see Jiang Leyao again.

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,640
But if she just dies like this,

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,560
it's letting her off too easy.

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
I heard,

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
she and that nanny

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,520
have grown quite close lately.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,160
Qiao Ping.

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,760
I want her to suffer deeply.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,240
This is what I wore as a child.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,240
I wonder if my parents remember me.

25
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,900
=Episode 19=
=Storm Approaches=

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,520
Nanny Zhao.

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,520
Nanny Zhao, please wake up.

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Nanny Zhao.

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,120
(Blessing)
I got you a peace amulet.

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,400
Nanny Zhao, your parents will come soon.

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,240
Nanny Zhao, wake up.

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
Nanny Zhao.

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,600
You are the one who killed Nanny Zhao.

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
Yes.

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,720
I killed her.

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
But the Dali Court has ruled

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,120
that Nanny Zhao took her own life.

38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,000
If you seek revenge,

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
come at me instead.

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,880
Why kill her? She did nothing wrong!

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,360
She helped you. Then she was not innocent.

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,840
You truly are heartless!

43
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,240
Jiang Leyao.

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,680
You should be glad you're alone.

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,480
Otherwise,

46
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,200
the one in your arms today

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,320
wouldn't just be Nanny Zhao.

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,240
Lady Leyao, you've ignored respect.

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,400
Lock her up in the woodshed.

50
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,170
Not until

51
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,320
she writes a thousand apologies letters,

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
may she be released.

53
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Take her away.

54
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,280
Ten taels, four qians.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,640
I want ten taels, four qians as pay.

56
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,950
Miss,

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,280
Master Tao and Rong'er are gone.

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,780
Now you stand

59
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,920
as the rightful lady of the family.

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,480
You were the one who insisted they meet.

61
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,280
Why are you anxious now?

62
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,720
Miss, you've made it hard for you both.

63
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,320
What we must do

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,360
is change the rules of this world.

65
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,840
Can we truly make it happen?

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,080
We

67
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,520
will make it happen.

68
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,960
Miss, I have the Divorce Decree.

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,440
I've waited twenty years for this.

70
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,940
At last, I have it.

71
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,840
In truth, you were taken and sold.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,720
Your real parents never stopped

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,040
searching for you all these years.

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,880
So, I was never abandoned.

75
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,300
(Blessing)

76
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,520
This is your indenture of servitude.

77
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,920
From now on, you are free.

78
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,160
This is from me,

79
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,240
a token of my gratitude.

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
Take it when you leave.

81
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,560
Live well with your parents.

82
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,400
Do you admit it?

83
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,040
These past days,

84
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,160
I have been reflecting.

85
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,560
Please forgive me, Bingqing.

86
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,240
Let me hear. What was wrong?

87
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,640
As an adopted daughter,

88
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,520
I should not argue with you.

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,640
I forgot my manners.

90
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,800
As a lady of Ning Family,

91
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,920
I showed concern for a servant.

92
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,070
I was wrong because...

93
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,920
Enough.

94
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,440
The Empress Dowager wants to see you today.

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,560
Go and get yourself ready.

96
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,720
(Ning Bingqing)

97
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
(I only took your dignity before.)

98
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,800
(Now, I'll taint your name.)

99
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

100
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,760
Very well. Good.

101
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,560
Raise your heads, all of you.

102
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Your Majesty,

103
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,400
that is the young lady the Second Prince

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,480
earnestly asked you to meet.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,880
Her name is Jiang Leyao.

106
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,320
Bingqing,
you're the first lady of Ning Family.

107
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,440
You wrote the "Women's Conduct".

108
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,880
I've read it.

109
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,920
You truly are a model of virtue.

110
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,760
Thank you for your praise.

111
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,160
Actually, I do not think

112
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,760
that a lady who pens these rules

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,880
is worthy of special praise.

114
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,160
The reason I summoned you today

115
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,440
is about the matter of congee distribution.

116
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,320
Your Majesty.

117
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,680
I heard Lady Leyao of the Ning Family

118
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,920
is as talented and beautiful as Bingqing,

119
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
and is righteous with true character.

120
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,760
She is deeply favored
by the Second Prince, Xiao Jingchu.

121
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,880
I only aided Lord Xiao in the investigation.

122
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,560
I've also learned much from him.

123
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
It seems

124
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
you know a thing or two about inquiries,

125
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,240
and you remain humble.

126
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,120
Not bad at all.

127
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,120
Come, sit by me.

128
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

129
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,760
Please, have a seat.

130
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,800
Your Majesty,

131
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,200
my sister comes from the countryside.

132
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,820
Her manners are sometimes unrefined.

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,920
Thankfully, I've guided her these days,

134
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,320
now she shows some grace
as a lady of a noble family.

135
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,160
By the way,

136
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,720
I upset Bingqing recently,

137
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,720
so I brought fresh Longjing Strong Tea

138
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,480
to offer an apology to Bingqing.

139
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,320
I hope you can forgive my mistakes.

140
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,240
Your Grace,

141
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,120
Lady Bingqing's retching

142
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,240
is due to her pregnancy,

143
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,280
especially after smelling strong scents,

144
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,800
like strong tea.

145
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,320
Bingqing, do you still blame me?

146
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,640
It's never too late to mend our ways.

147
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,280
Bingqing, please, drink this quickly.

148
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Bingqing, are you okay?

149
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,870
It's nothing.

150
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,360
I just dislike the taste of this tea.

151
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,880
Really?

152
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,120
But this

153
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,040
was always your favorite tea.

154
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,320
Sudden retching like this...

155
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,080
Your Majesty, please give an order,

156
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,720
have the Imperial Physician tend to Rong'er.

157
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,680
Attendant.

158
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,690
Yes,

159
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,800
summon the Imperial Physician.

160
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,880
Summon the Imperial Physician.

161
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,640
This is Lady Bingqing's maid, Xiaotao.

162
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,280
This morning, Lady Bingqing struck her again.

163
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
I've long wished to serve you, My Lady.

164
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,280
Swap Lady Bingqing's Contraceptive Decoction

165
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,520
for this Conception Tonic instead.

166
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,040
Within half a month, she'll be with child.

167
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,240
If she finds out it was you,

168
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
she'll never let you go.

169
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,440
You can't stay here anymore.

170
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,320
(Two hundred taels)
Take the money and leave.

171
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
If Lady Bingqing learns of this,

172
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,440
and knows you ordered it,

173
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,720
she'll surely seek revenge.

174
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Are you not afraid?

175
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,160
I only fear the trouble won't be enough.

176
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,360
After court, the Crown Prince
will greet the Empress Dowager.

177
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,920
The real show is about to begin.

178
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,480
Your Majesty,

179
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,280
by her pulse, she's already with child.

180
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,480
Mind your words.

181
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,920
I am the lady of the Ning Family

182
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,440
and the future Crown Princess.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,680
I'm nothing like those unruly women.

184
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,960
Your Majesty, please judge fairly.

185
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,440
I pledge my life as guarantee.

186
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,400
This young lady truly has a pregnancy pulse.

187
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,240
She has been pregnant for over a month.

188
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
They call it a Conception Tonic.

189
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
But it's just a false pregnancy medicine.

190
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,920
After taking it for some time,

191
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,480
pregnancy symptoms will appear.

192
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,800
Even the most skilled physician

193
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,640
would diagnose it as pregnancy.

194
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,760
Sir, are you a real physician?

195
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,680
How could you misjudge a pregnancy?

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
Be careful,
or you may lose your official post.

197
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,290
Silence.

198
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,880
Enough.

199
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,400
Ning Bingqing, you are far too bold.

200
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,450
Speak.

201
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,760
Who is the child's father?

202
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,160
Rong'er, you must've been forced.

203
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,000
Is that right?

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,850
Speak quickly.

205
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,810
Her Majesty will help you.

206
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,720
Ning Bingqing, oh Ning Bingqing.

207
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,440
You have truly let me down.

208
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,200
Guards!

209
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,760
Take her to the Hall of Penitence.

210
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,200
Your Majesty, spare me! That person...

211
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,200
That person is...

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,280
Greetings, Grandmother.

213
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,440
You came just in time.

214
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,040
(Xiao Jingyou, Crown Prince)
How will you deal with your fiancée?

215
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,400
You decide.

216
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,480
(Ning Bingqing,)

217
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,000
(you have no way to recover.)
