1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
The

4
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Am I beautiful?

5
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Of course, my lady.

6
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
What's the lady at this time?

7
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Get out.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Didn't I tell you to get out?

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Who is making a scene again?

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I almost forgot.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Although Ning Bingqing and the Crown Prince are engaged,

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
she still can't forget about Xiao Jing Chu.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I asked you to come today

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
for the Spring Day banquet three days later.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I want to introduce you to all the family members

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
of the Ning family officially.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you, Elder Sister.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You are so kind to me.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to help you, too.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What can you help me with?

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you want to ask Mr. Xiao to go to the lake?

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you want to gain Ning Bingqing's trust completely,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
you can't be a dog that only listens to you like Rong'er.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I want to be a god that can help him.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
His god, the God of Blood, the God of Heaven.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Today is the day of the death of the mother of the Lord.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
His Majesty must come at this moment

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
to pay his respects to her.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Stop.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you doing?

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you yelling about?

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's good or bad,

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
she doesn't like these flowers.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Father,

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
this is my mother's favorite flower in the Heaven.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's also the only thing she left for me.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She's just a maid

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
who can't even remember her name.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She needs me to remember her.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Keep moving and keep swinging.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Until you finish swinging.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
From now on,

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
you should protect yourself with this.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Jing Chu,

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
go to mother's room

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and help mother move a basin of medicine, okay?

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Jing Chu can do anything for mother.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Go.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Jing Chu

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What are you doing here?

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm here to see you.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It seems that you're recovered

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and can swing.

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thanks to Lord Xiao's medicine.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you, Lord Xiao.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's not your character to be a person who knows the way to repay.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Tell me, what do you want from me?

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I want to talk to you

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
about cooperation.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ming Shi,

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
can you accompany Ning Bing to travel the world?

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm busy.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
As a return,

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I can also promise Lord Xiao something.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How did you know?

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:13,440
Light the lantern and call for the

68
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,000
Lord Xiao.

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Xiao Jing Chu,

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you can write your thoughts and wishes

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
on this.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The lantern will be transferred to you.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I never believed in the past life,

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
let alone the lantern.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The world of death

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is originally planned by people.

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How can it be true?

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The world is full of ghosts and evil spirits.

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Eighteen levels of the world

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
are gathered by people.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Sometimes I hope

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
that the world there is real.

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Xiao Jing Chu, listen to me.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Write it quickly.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Jiang Le Yao,

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
do you think

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the person who left first is more painful

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
or the person who was left behind is more painful?

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I think

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the person who left first

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
is the one who will build

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
a new home for us.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The person who was left behind

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
is living with pain and hatred.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But as long as he is alive,

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
there is hope.

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Someone is alive.

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Someone is alive.

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I live

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
because of love.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Someone

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
can only live

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
because of hatred.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Love is fine.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Love is fine.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
As long as it can bring strength,

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
it's all good.

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I count one, two, three.

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's do it together.

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
One, two, three.

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Xiao Jing Chu

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I have too many hatreds.

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I can't respond to your heart.

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You will find that

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
person who won't hurt you.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Jiang Le Yao,

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I hope

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you will never leave me.

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Sir, I found it.

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Say it.

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We found the picture book

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
when we were investigating the Ruyi gambling house.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's the same as the missing girl's name list

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
in the past ten years.

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It seems that

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Ruyi gambling house is just a beginning.

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What we are investigating

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
is more complicated than we thought.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
we have already

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
finished the gambling house's old history.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
we can

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
continue to investigate

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
with these missing girls.

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What time is it?

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Tomorrow

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I will go to the moon to pray for Ning Bingqing.

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
At the time of the moon.

140
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Ning Bingqing

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ning Bingqing

143
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You are the one who wants to

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
work with them.

145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Why are you in a hurry now?

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I am not in a hurry.

147
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I am just worried

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
that Xiao Jing Chu will mess things up.

149
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why is it so late?

150
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I will go and have a look.

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't want to see

152
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the missing girl of Yongsu anymore.

153
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Sir.

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Miss Jiang is here.

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Sir.

156
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
How is

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
your condition today?

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Miss Ning Bingqing

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
is so smart.

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Playing with her

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
is just like watching the spring breeze.

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Not bad.

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
After the trip,

164
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we went to the gambling house

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and watched a western-style drama.

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Very good.

167
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I talked to other women

168
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and you were not angry at all.

169
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I arranged what happened today.

170
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But it was my master

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
who got angry with me.

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Jiang Luyou.

173
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Jiang Luyou.

174
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Look at me and tell me.

175
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Did you

176
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
not have any feelings for me?

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No.

178
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But you are so aggressive.

179
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Could it be

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
that you have feelings for me?

181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I...

182
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Of course not.

183
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Then it's not the best.

184
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Luyou.

185
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What do you mean

186
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
to me?

187
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Luyou.

188
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What do you mean

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to me?

190
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I told you.

191
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Only cooperation

192
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
is not the best for men and women.

193
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Then why...

194
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,860
Why did you help me to sort out the

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
things?

196
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Just to make it easier.

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Jiang Luyou.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I can't stand it anymore.

199
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't want to endure it anymore.

200
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
No matter how cold you are

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
to me,

202
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I just want to tell you.

203
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I...

204
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I like you.

205
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I like you.

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I like you.

209
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

210
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I like you.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I like you.

213
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

214
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I like you.

215
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

216
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I like you.

217
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I like you.

219
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

220
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I like you.

221
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

222
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I like you.

223
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I like you.

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Take me to the mountain and flow the water.

226
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
A cup of wine to make you drunk.

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
A cup of wine to make you drunk.

228
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Go to the mountain and flow the water.

229
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll cry in winter.

230
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The memory of the last night is gone.

231
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The water is like the crystal of the crystal crystal.

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm afraid of the dust.

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm afraid of the years.

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't regret.
