00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The Beauty of the Waterfall

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You are the Second Young Madam of Ningfu.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ningfu is the first great blessing in the capital.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Jiang Leyao,

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
as the Second Young Madam of Ningfu,

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you dare to cause trouble in private

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and ruin my Ningfu's reputation.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You...

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are totally inescapable.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Father.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Father.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I was wronged.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Second Young Madam was in the sea last night.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We all heard about your story.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I...

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I was wronged.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I was wronged.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Father,

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I will be the empress in the future.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How can I face the crown prince

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
when he is like this?

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was wronged.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Get her.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Go.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Sister.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sister.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sister.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sister.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You are always with me.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know it.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Tell them.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Tell them.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was wronged.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Second Young Madam,

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you were the one who drove me away.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You said you wanted to date Sanan

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and asked me not to disturb you.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Jiang Leyao,

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the evidence is solid.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What else do you want to say?

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Come on.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Act according to the law.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Father.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Father.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Father.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Father.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Father.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Father.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Father.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Father.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Father.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My parents...

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My parents took good care of me

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and took care of me for so many years.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I treated you like a relative.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why?

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why did you do this to me?

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You just gave me a meal.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you expect me to live a life of suffering

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
just like you?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The empress told me

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
that as long as I burn the whole village with fire,

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can live a luxurious life.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You set fire.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You set fire.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You set fire.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You set fire.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You set fire.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You set fire.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I didn't burn you to death.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You...

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I let you be the Second Young Madam of Ning Mansion.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is not fair to me.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why?

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why?

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Why?

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My parents...

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My parents treated you so well.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why?

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Who are the people who are the dead?

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't know who they are.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Skin is cold and can't move.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
People can't fight power.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No matter how hard you fight,

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
it's just a piece of wood.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's just a piece of fish that can be cut into pieces.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let go of me.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Jiang Le Yao is a man of his word.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He humiliated the people of Ning Mansion.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He is a man of his word.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He committed suicide.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Anyway, your leg has been broken by me.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You are here waiting to be burned to death by the fire.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I won't let you go.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The first night has come.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The fire has been lit.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
From now on, fate is unpredictable.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I was burned to death.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is the birthday gift you wanted to give me.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I almost died a month ago.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I was so scared.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I was so scared.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I was so scared.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was so scared.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was so scared.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I was so scared.

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I was so scared.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I almost died a month ago.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Little boy,

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
give it to Le Yao.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What is it?

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Mother, what is it?

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's a birthday gift.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I was so scared that I almost died a month ago.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I was so scared that I almost died a month ago.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I was so scared that I almost died a month ago.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mother, it's ugly.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't like it.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Take it back.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The shopkeeper said,

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't know

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
which girl

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
has seen this hairpin for more than ten times.

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's right.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The shopkeeper said,

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
once it's out,

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
it won't be changed.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Father.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Come on.

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll put it on for you.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Today is your birthday.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Rong'er doesn't know where she went.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
She's not hiding somewhere

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to surprise you, is she?

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Mother, you and father eat first.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm going to find my sister

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and let her see my hairpin for the first time.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This kid doesn't eat anymore.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Le Yang, run slowly.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Father, mother, brothers.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This time, I will definitely save you.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mother.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Mother.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mother.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Mother.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mother.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No.

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
In the previous life,

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I admitted that she let me go.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But now,

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
why did she save me in advance?

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Could it be that

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I was born again?

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I know that God wants me

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to be reborn.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I've set the fire and burned the village.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I wonder if the ladies are satisfied.

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You did a good job.

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll reward you.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
As expected, the same as last time.

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It seems that fate knows that it is not enough for me.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let me go back to the past.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This time,

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I must know who killed me.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
She wants to get everything I want.

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's take a look for a while.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have to put it back.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Otherwise, it would be terrible if my mother finds out.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's really her.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm late again.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I set the fire and took the jade pendant.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I want to prove that my identity is high.

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Chang Rong, you have to rest.

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Get off.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Ruyi gambling house

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
is a fraud under the name of gambling house.

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They colluded with the underground money shop

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and transferred a large amount of money.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I did it alone.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was wrong.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Please forgive me.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It seems that you are not wrong.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You just need to know

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that you are going to die.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Back then, the life of the old man Ning was in danger.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Fortunately, my grandfather saved him.

194
