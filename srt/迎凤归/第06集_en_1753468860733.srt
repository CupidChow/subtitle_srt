1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,040
My Lady.

2
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,200
I'm nothing.

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,200
Wait.

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,260
What are you looking at

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,260
when you can't even tang tent?

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,840
That's so pickles.

7
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,480
Do you mean the same as the radish juice?

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,380
Let have a little.

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,460
I'll lose it.

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,780
Anyone would talk nonsense about the same.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,020
You don't care about a little,

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,260
What's wrong with you, Young Madam?

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,380
I'm the mistress and you're the servant.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,380
I told you to kneel down, but you only did it.

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,620
I thought we were sisters.

16
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,740
So I tried to help you.

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,500
But I'm just a servant

18
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,620
in your eyes.

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,380
What are you?

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,260
You're not worthy of being my sister.

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,740
The son of Nanny Qin, Li Yong,

22
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,780
used Young Master's name

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,460
to open a gambling house outside.

24
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,100
The victim doesn't remember the number.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,260
This is enough

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,780
to make you fall for Nanny Qin.

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,340
You're dead, Qian Po.

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,420
It hurts!

29
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,660
It hurts.

30
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,980
It hurts!

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,620
Let's go around.

32
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,180
Let's go around.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,700
Young Madam, you're so great.

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,220
I'm still in the future.

35
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,660
I can only trust you.

36
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,900
I can't see you.

37
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,740
Let's see

38
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,100
who will be the final winner.

39
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,860
Let's go.

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,900
Tell them

41
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,100
I'm going to hold a peony banquet

42
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,780
to welcome the Young Mistress of the Duke of Ning

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,220
and Nanny Qin to the mansion.

44
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,220
The gambling house

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,740
and the girl's eyebrows.

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,180
I want to see how she will react.

47
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,860
Yes.

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,060
Father,

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,620
I'm going to be the empress.

50
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,180
How can I

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,900
face the Crown Prince?

52
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
The future Crown Princess,

53
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,900
the noble lady that Her Majesty praised,

54
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,060
Ning Bingqing.

55
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,420
God finally apologized.

56
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,340
Your Grace,

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,220
Ning Bingqing, the daughter of the Duke of Ning,

58
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,540
came back from the foreign land to celebrate her wedding.

59
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,820
She came to hold a peony banquet.

60
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,860
This is a invitation.

61
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,860
Do you think I'm free?

62
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,420
I'll go back now.

63
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,620
By the way,

64
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,420
Miss Jiang sent a letter.

65
00:03:36,420 --> 00:04:02,600
estate

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,400
Since it's a good show,

67
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,060
Yes.

68
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,060
Go and check all the cases

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,220
related to Ruyi Casino

70
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,220
for the past three years.

71
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,420
Yes, Your Excellency.

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,220
Second Young Madam, Chang Rong'er,

73
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,820
welcomes you back to the mansion.

74
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,460
Your Excellency.

75
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,220
First Young Madam,

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,740
we meet again.

77
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,100
They knew each other for a long time.

78
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,700
You're quite capable.

79
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,500
Thank you for your compliment.

80
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,500
You must be tired

81
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,700
from all the work.

82
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,140
I've prepared a peony for you.

83
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,460
Please enjoy it.

84
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,660
Thank you.

85
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,860
Are you waiting for me?

86
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,260
Your Excellency,

87
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,620
I thought you wouldn't come.

88
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,820
Why not?

89
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,500
Besides,

90
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,220
you set up the stage.

91
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,260
Don't worry.

92
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,380
I won't let you down.

93
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,900
Good.

94
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,740
This peony banquet is well done.

95
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,540
You won't be out

96
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
if you're tired from all the work.

97
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,900
Please entertain the guests.

98
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,780
Thank you for your compliment.

99
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,580
I will definitely...

100
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,340
Your Excellency.

101
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,340
Second Young Madam has never held a banquet.

102
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,420
I'm afraid she might not be able to entertain guests.

103
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,100
Why don't you give it to me?

104
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,620
Okay.

105
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,980
Don't worry, Nanny Qi.

106
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,060
You may not have the chance to entertain guests.

107
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,300
Good.

108
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,580
Please do something for me, Your Excellency.

109
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,700
Your Excellency,

110
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,780
I want to break into the mansion

111
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,340
and tear down the black gambling house.

112
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,420
I'm the one who ruined the mansion.

113
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,380
Please help me, Your Excellency.

114
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,180
Wei,

115
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,260
this is about the reputation of the Mansion of Duke of the State.

116
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,420
I will investigate it thoroughly.

117
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,220
Take them away

118
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,580
and settle it.

119
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,940
Your Excellency,

120
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,820
I didn't expect that Miss Jiang

121
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,860
would give us a clue.

122
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,460
Li Yong is one of the black gambling owners.

123
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,740
It's getting more and more interesting.

124
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,660
Wait.

125
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,220
Since it's about the murder case,

126
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,580
it's not about Duke of the State's family.

127
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,460
If you have any evidence,

128
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,780
just bring it to me.

129
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,940
Let Duke of the State look at it carefully.

130
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,300
It seems that you attended the banquet

131
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,220
not just to watch the show.

132
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,100
Your Excellency,

133
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,180
please investigate it thoroughly.

134
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,460
Li Yong of the Ruyi Tribe

135
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,740
took the guards of Ning Mansion

136
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,620
to suppress the women in my mansion.

137
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,100
It's a matter of life and death.

138
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,900
Your Excellency,

139
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
please help us.

140
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,660
Your Excellency, please spare my life.

141
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,180
It's all my fault.

142
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,060
I'm the one who did it.

143
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,700
My son was ordered by me.

144
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,300
Your Excellency, please spare my life.

145
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Your Excellency,

146
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,020
this is about the reputation of the Mansion of Duke of the State.

147
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,300
You must punish him severely

148
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,900
for this.

149
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,620
You must punish him severely.

150
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,580
Guards,

151
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,780
take Qi Zhen away.

152
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,380
Beat him to death

153
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,900
for justice.

154
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,500
Duke of the State!

155
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,940
I won't bother you then.

156
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,500
Guards,

157
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,460
take him back to the Xuan Yin Bureau.

158
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,660
Wait.

159
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,100
No matter what,

160
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,060
Qi Zhen is also a member of the Mansion of Duke of the State.

161
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,580
It's against the rules.

162
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,740
It's against the rules?

163
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,300
Xuan Yin Bureau is the rule.

164
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,380
Take him away.

165
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,420
Duke of the State,

166
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,740
the guests are still here.

167
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Why don't you let me entertain the guests?

168
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,380
You seem to have met

169
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,700
a high-ranking enemy.

170
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,060
The higher you stand, the more you fall.

171
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,300
Thank you for coming to the Mudan Banquet.

172
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,820
Please come with me.

173
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,060
You unfilial daughter!

174
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,260
You even know your father!

175
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,220
It's been 12 years.

176
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,420
The show is really amazing.

177
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,860
The rain is falling, the rain is falling, the rain is falling, the rain is falling,

178
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,860
the world is changing, the world is changing,

179
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,660
the twinkling of the eyes, the flowers are changing, the water is changing, the water is changing,

180
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,260
the autumn leaves are changing, the white clouds are changing,

181
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,060
the night is changing, the candlelight is changing,

182
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,540
the wine is drunk, the flowers are changing, the

183
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,260
bill is on the table.

184
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,260
The wine is drunk, the cup is broken,

185
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,660
the wine is drunk, the cup is broken,

186
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,060
the good mountains and rivers are flowing,

187
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,660
the winter is crying,

188
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,660
the memories are still missing,

189
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,060
the wine is thirsty, the money is in the water,

190
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,060
afraid of the dust, afraid of the years,

191
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,860
the wine is drunk, the cup is broken,

192
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,460
the wine is broken, the cup is broken,

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,460
the good mountains and rivers are flowing, the winter is crying,

194
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,260
the memories are still missing,

195
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,660
the wine is thirsty, the money is in the water,

196
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,860
afraid of the dust, afraid of the years,
