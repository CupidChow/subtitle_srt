00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
Going Behind the Scenes

2
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,700
Episode 47

3
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,140
You're pregnant.

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,220
Me?

5
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,340
Your Royal Highness,

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,900
I saw this...

7
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,900
When?

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,580
This morning.

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,020
His mother died.

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:57,780
Thatב׳

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,580
No, I didn't.

12
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,500
Your Highness,

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,420
I did this alone.

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,580
Please don't involve Ning's family.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,500
Now that it has come to this,

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,780
are you going to keep it from me?

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,980
Grandmother,

18
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,780
the child in Bingqing's belly

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,900
is mine.

20
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,660
You...

21
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,980
Do you have anything to say to me?

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,180
No matter who asks,

23
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,780
you have to make sure

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,380
that the child in your belly

25
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,580
is mine.

26
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,580
As for the Ningguo Palace,

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,180
I am the Crown Prince.

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,980
You will be the Crown Princess soon.

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,780
Even if she has other intentions,

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,180
I will not let her go.

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,580
I will not let her go.

32
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,780
I will not let her go.

33
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,780
I will not let her go.

34
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,380
Your Highness,

35
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,980
the birth medicine

36
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,380
is ready.

37
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,580
What did you do this time?

38
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,580
You must be joking.

39
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,780
After all, the one you are pregnant with

40
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,780
is the royal heir.

41
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,780
Yes.

42
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,580
Royal heir?

43
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,580
As long as the Crown Prince admits it,

44
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,380
then the bastard in my belly

45
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,380
must be the royal heir.

46
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,780
Do you know

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,380
what you are talking about?

48
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,780
Grandmother,

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
that day, I was

50
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,580
poisoned by a maid

51
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,180
who was about to climb the bed.

52
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,780
I did not want to let Bingqing down,

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,980
but I did not cure her.

54
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,780
Don't...

55
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,380
It's all my fault.

56
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,780
Please punish me.

57
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,380
Why did the Crown Prince

58
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,380
admit the child?

59
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,580
He really loves Bingqing.

60
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,380
All right.

61
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
Get up.

62
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,180
Thank you, Grandmother.

63
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,380
I will tell His Majesty

64
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,380
to let you get married as soon as possible.

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,380
Thank you, Grandmother.

66
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,580
The grass is

67
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,580
being stolen from the sky.

68
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,980
In the end,

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,780
it can only be a wishful thinking.

70
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,780
Do you think

71
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,180
the rules of the rich

72
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,580
will not allow you

73
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,380
to be a little bitch?

74
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,780
Sister,

75
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,580
this time,

76
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,780
I will not let you down.

77
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,580
I will not let you down.

78
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,580
I will not let you down.

79
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,380
Sister,

80
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,780
this time,

81
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,380
it's your turn to take the punishment.

82
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,780
The one who dies

83
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,180
will be punished.

84
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,380
With the testimony of this witness,

85
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,380
the charges against Zhao Momo

86
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,180
have been settled.

87
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,580
Qiao Bing,

88
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,580
you deserve to die.

89
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,180
Qiao Bing is not an ordinary guard.

90
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,980
Don't act rashly.

91
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,980
Trust me.

92
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,180
I will definitely give you justice.

93
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,340
The

94
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,180
Xiang Lang Yang.

95
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,180
The First Miss said her wedding dress was not enough.

96
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,980
Use your blood to dye it.

97
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,380
The silk soft armor.

98
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,980
The life of a killer

99
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,980
is what I will send you

100
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,780
to Zhao Momo today.

101
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,180
This silk soft armor

102
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
is better than the sword.

103
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,180
Put it on to be safe.

104
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,180
First Miss,

105
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,180
Jiang Liao will definitely die this time.

106
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
Die?

107
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Isn't that too cheap?

108
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,580
The job is well done.

109
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,980
It's worth dying.

110
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,580
Good sister,

111
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,780
you killed someone.

112
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,580
You...

113
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,380
You deliberately let Qiao Bing die.

114
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,380
Yes.

115
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,180
I just want to see

116
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,580
how Xiao Jing Chu will help you this time.

117
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,380
Open the door.

118
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,580
Xiao Jing Chu.

119
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,380
Liao Yao, are you okay?

120
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,780
Where is the silver coin?

121
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,780
Let me see.

122
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,180
Leave me alone.

123
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,980
You go.

124
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,380
I don't want to get you involved.

125
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,580
We are already a team.

126
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,980
We are already a team.

127
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,780
How can I be involved?

128
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,580
If I were to be in jail today,

129
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,380
would you leave me alone?

130
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:00,980
Don't worry.

131
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,380
I've been in the Xuan Yi Temple for so many years.

132
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,380
Don't worry.

133
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,180
Leave the rest to me.

134
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,980
Sir.

135
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,980
Sir.

136
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,380
The palace is rushing.

137
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,180
They said that Duke Ningguo

138
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,580
was covering up for you in front of His Majesty.

139
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,180
Your Grace,

140
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,380
you sent the Second Miss to the Xuan Yi Temple.

141
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,580
Aren't you afraid that Mr. Xiao will cover up?

142
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,580
I just want him to cover up.

143
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,980
A schemer

144
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,780
and a rich man.

145
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,380
Both of them deserve to die.

146
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,780
Has there been any news from the palace recently?

147
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,980
No.

148
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,980
Let Qiao Ping go and inquire.

149
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,580
Your Grace, Qiao Ping...

150
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,580
Your Grace, calm down.

151
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,180
Your Grace,

152
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,980
Ning Hua is pregnant.

153
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,580
Ning Hua is pregnant, Your Grace.

154
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,180
It's none of your business.

155
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,780
No.

156
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,620
Já SPEAKSRS

157
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,180
So live in the palace.

158
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,580
I'd have taken permit.

159
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,380
He is angled.

160
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Ms. Jiang.

161
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,180
She didn't go out I guess.

162
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,780
He's out. It's fine.

163
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,620
But he's busy with work.

164
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,300
He can't be away.

165
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,660
So he asked me to send you a letter.

166
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,780
Tell me the truth.

167
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,780
My Lord.

168
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,900
My Lord is in a coma.

169
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,660
Drinking and drinking.

170
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,540
Walking on the mountain and flowing water.

171
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,660
A kind of memory is gone.

172
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,940
Drunk and drunk.

173
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,100
Afraid of dust and dust.

174
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,900
Drunk and drunk.

175
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,980
Drinking and drinking.

176
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,860
Walking on the mountain and flowing water.

177
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,900
A kind of memory is gone.

178
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,220
Drunk and drunk.

179
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,300
Afraid of dust and dust.
