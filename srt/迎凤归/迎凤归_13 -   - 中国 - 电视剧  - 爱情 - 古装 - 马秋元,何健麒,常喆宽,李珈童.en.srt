Why are you running?

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,160
I am a prince.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,920
Don't come any closer.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,320
I want to see Father.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,840
Your mother couldn't even help you,

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,450
let alone you.

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,000
If she could meet His Majesty,

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,760
she wouldn't be forced by the Empress.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
You must listen and behave, understand?

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,180
Let me go!

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,360
Let go!

22
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,420
=Episode 13=
=Dagger=

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,680
Jiang Leyao.

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,520
My heart belongs to you.

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,920
You should head back first.

26
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Alright.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,240
Clearly, you have feelings for him,

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,840
yet she pushes him away.

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,870
You trouble not just yourself, but him too.

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
Did you find out what I asked for?

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
My Lord, we've checked

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,480
the missing girls' movements.

33
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,160
Before they vanished,

34
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,940
all led to a place called Begonia Snow.

35
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,800
It's where officials and scholars gather.

36
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,880
The top refined spot in the Capital.

37
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,280
On the surface,
it's all about poetry and songs,

38
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,560
but in truth, they imprison young girls.

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,720
That place insults the word "refined."

40
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,280
Did you investigate Begonia Snow?

41
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,500
We investigated.

42
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,600
Nothing seemed out of place.

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,680
No sign the girls were ever there.

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,300
But a secret agent brought word.

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
He said Begonia Snow has another spot.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,760
It's heavily guarded by soldiers.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,200
Ordinary guests can't get close.

48
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,000
Are you saying Tang Qiao'er,

49
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,000
is on the Begonia Snow guest list too?

50
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,920
I have a friend from my hometown,

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
who works at Tang Manor.

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
She said Tang Qiao'er...

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,080
If I push Qiao'er out,

54
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,960
then there'd be one more spot
at Begonia Snow.

55
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,880
Push her out? But how?

56
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,360
Qiao'er wanted this dress.

57
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,800
You asked me to get it no matter what.

58
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,920
Is it for something important?

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,520
All the noble clans join the Spring Banquet.

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,640
Every young lady wants to stand out.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Especially that proud Tang Qiao'er,

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,560
not to mention, I once offended her.

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,040
Now I've taken her dress,

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,520
she must hold a grudge.

65
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,480
She surely wants it back.

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,640
Jiang Leyao!

67
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
Here she is.

68
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,490
Miss Tang.

69
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,880
Jiang Leyao.

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,440
Who do you think you are?

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,320
Daring to take what I wanted.

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
You think you're worthy?

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,600
Take it off!

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,840
How dare you hit me?

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,320
This is the Ning Manor.

76
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm the host here.

77
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,480
If I let you go,

78
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,440
wouldn't that shame the Ning Family?

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
Fine.

80
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,160
Let me see, country maiden,

81
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,560
what are you really after?

82
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,710
Guards, come here.

83
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,320
Take off her clothes for me.

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
Wait a moment.

85
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
Tang Qiao'er, I can let you

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,160
have this dress.

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,840
But think it through first.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,640
This piece of clothing

89
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,560
isn't something you can handle.

90
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,920
What a joke.

91
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,120
Is there anything in this world

92
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,200
that I can't handle wearing?

93
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,480
Take it off now.

94
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,080
Miss, what will you do next?

95
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,920
Go to Ning Bingqing's courtyard,

96
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
and show a little misery.

97
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,400
It's all my fault.

98
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,580
I knew it well,

99
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
she even dares to cross you.

100
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,680
I should've just given it to her.

101
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,480
Tang Qiao'er, how bold she is.

102
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,160
She dares harm you in my residence.

103
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,040
She really refuses to show respect.

104
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,760
This flower powder draws butterflies best.

105
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,080
A flock of butterflies
will dance round Tang Qiao'er.

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,480
That must be quite a sight.

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,480
Ning Bingqing dislikes

108
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,920
those who are pure and gentle.

109
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,040
Looking lovely alone is not enough.

110
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,180
Nanny.

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,840
Go find a few more people.

112
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,160
Qiao'er, so many butterflies!

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,160
Heavens, Miss Tang attracts butterflies?

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,040
I heard butterflies are quite picky.

115
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,200
They only gather round the pure.

116
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,600
Seems Miss Tang is truly pure-hearted.

117
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,080
Look.

118
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,960
Ning Bingqing dislikes pure souls the most.

119
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Now Tang Qiao'er

120
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,920
has truly angered her for good.

121
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,320
Sowing discord

122
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,240
between Tang Qiao'er and Ning Bingqing.

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
You really are clever.

124
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,910
Then why did you go to Begonia Snow?

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What is your true goal?

126
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,040
I never once asked you

127
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,200
about the meaning of Peony Blossom.

128
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,840
I shouldn't have asked.

129
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,640
You are indeed sharp.

130
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,800
Jiang Leyao,

131
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
I know your heart holds deep grudge.

132
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,640
Perhaps you've faced life and death,

133
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
so, you choose not to speak.

134
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,280
I can promise never to ask.

135
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,280
When the time comes,
I'll wait outside for you.

136
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,440
Things inside Begonia Snow are unclear.

137
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
Take this, keep it for your safety.

138
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,720
I thought

139
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,920
you were asking me to use it to take a life.

140
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,240
Jiang Leyao, if you truly did that,

141
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,600
it's a crime. And I must arrest you.

142
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,960
Tonight, Begonia Snow has one spot open.

143
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,480
Leyao, come with me then.

144
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,720
I'll do as you say.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,840
Go.

146
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,480
Bring over the box of Furong Weeping Dew.

147
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,440
How is everything going?

148
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,440
We'll pull a bait-and-switch.

149
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,920
Tang Qiao'er, who was on the guest list,

150
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
will be on stage instead.

151
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,360
After tonight,

152
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm curious to see

153
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,840
how she remains pure.

154
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,920
We only need to punish Tang Qiao'er.

155
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,760
Why bring Lady Leyao?

156
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,040
Aren't you afraid this might cause trouble?

157
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,120
Her?

158
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,240
She's just a fool I can control.

159
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,280
The Spring Banquet

160
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,240
was arranged by me on purpose.

161
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,600
The goal

162
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,920
is to let all the officials in Yun City
to know

163
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,840
there's one more lady in Ning Family.

164
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,960
That way, next time we can have her

165
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,640
join Father for business talks.

166
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
Tonight, let her just watch first,

167
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,440
and learn how to present herself.

168
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,480
My Lady, your plan is wise.
