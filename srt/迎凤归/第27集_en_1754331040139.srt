00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 26

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How dare you harm me?

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're here to take the medicine.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The jade seal will be yours sooner or later.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
After so many years, the Crown Prince

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
doesn't allow me to take the throne.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Then I'll take the throne.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Guards.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Please invite the Commander of the Imperial Guards and the Minister of War

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to come to my Crown Prince's Mansion to drink.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Guards.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
My Lord.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My Lord, help me.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Get up.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's going on?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What happened?

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
My Lord, I'm a musician.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I was sent to the Crown Prince's Mansion to perform.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But...

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But the Crown Prince

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
humiliated me in public.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Please forgive me.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm powerless.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My Lord,

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
isn't it a private case?

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How could you be powerless?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm in the officialdom.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's just a common thing.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You once said

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
you'd stand up for the justice of women in the world.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You also said

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you'd be ungrateful and unworthy of power.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Jiang Leyao,

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
you're a liar.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're a bastard like them.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can only say

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You shouldn't be sorry for me.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You should be sorry for me.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're the one in the official uniform.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're the girl who's been bullied by thousands of girls.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Jiang Leyao,

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
you're doomed.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Shut up.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How dare you talk back to Lord Jiang?

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Take her down.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Stop.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's go.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why would Miss Jiang suffer?

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
She's a girl.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She deserves some punishment.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't talk about her.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm the one who's disappointed in myself.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
By the way,

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
how's your lord?

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He's like you.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He's also forcing himself to scold you.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You two are so bitter.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know how long you'll endure it.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's almost time.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What's going on with the crown prince?

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
According to your arrangement,

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
the crown prince knows that his body is the emperor's.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He also knows he won't take the throne.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's drinking with the ministers.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Everyone,

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
let me propose a toast to you.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come on.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Please.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's just drunk?

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I wonder what's in the crown prince's head.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Father.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Father.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How dare you help Xiao Jing Chu

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
take the crown prince's position

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and take Ning Mansion to the other side?

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Father is right.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I know I was wrong.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll go apologize to the crown prince.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Stop.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You can't apologize tonight.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The crown prince has no time to see you tonight.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He has something important to do.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Something important?

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What is it?

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Something that can change the dynasty.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The crown prince...

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When I see him again,

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I might call him

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
His Majesty.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What do you mean?

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Minister Zhao of the Ministry of War,

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Commander Chu of the Imperial Guards,

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
what do you think?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What do you think?

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're not on the same level as the Imperial Guards.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I will never agree to rebel against you.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What about you?

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The Imperial Guards

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
are all your family.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Please don't make it difficult for me.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You two

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
don't really think

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I invited you to rebel against me

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to ask for your opinion?

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Bring it here.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The crown prince's hand

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sure you should know it.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you don't listen to me,

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
you won't be able to

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
do what you want next time.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's not just your hand.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will do as you say.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
How dare he force me to rebel against him?

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The crown prince said

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the throne was his.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He just wants to

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
sit on it as soon as possible.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why do you tell me this?

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Are you afraid that I will report to the palace?

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
My good daughter,

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you've offended the crown prince.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You will die.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But I,

131
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and Ningfu,

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
don't want to apologize for you.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What do you want?

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Good daughter,

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I want to take your body

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to see the new emperor.

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is my name.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Dad,

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm your daughter.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you really want to do this?

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Dad.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can kill my own daughter.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Not to mention a wild girl.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's no big deal to die

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
in front of two daughters.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You've been watching the show for so long.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Aren't you going to take the throne?

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The prison.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did you save me?

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I saved you from the prison.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I also found a doctor

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to cure the poison in your body.

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What?

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Are you still thinking

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that your father saved you?

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can promise you

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
to tell you everything about the crown prince.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But I have a condition.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The person who drank with him today is not someone else.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's the minister of the Ministry of War

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and the commander of the Imperial Guards.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You mean

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
he wants to rebel?

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If he really gets the throne,

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
then the Duke of Ning

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
will be a high-ranking official.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're thinking too much.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I've thought about

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the conditions I mentioned before.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm going home.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Your Majesty.

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
