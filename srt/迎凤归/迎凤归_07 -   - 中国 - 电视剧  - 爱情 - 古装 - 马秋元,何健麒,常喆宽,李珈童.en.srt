Pay your debt!

Let's talk this out calmly.

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,950
Go.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,510
Listen, old man,

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,630
if you don't pay, I'll take your hand.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,760
Out!

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,800
You useless dog.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,150
Mr. Chang, right?

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,430
Looking for your daughter, Chang Rong'er?

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,900
=Episode 7=
=Father and Daughter=

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,590
Ungrateful child, do you still know me?

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,740
Your Grace,

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,550
please, I beg you to help me.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,910
My daughter enjoys luxury at Ning Manor,

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,990
but I, her father, wander the streets.

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,750
Your Grace.

28
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,960
Come here!

29
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,180
- Father.
- Listen,

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,510
behave yourself.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,590
If I don't sell you,
how can I repay my debts?

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,790
If you defy me again,
I'll break your legs.

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,360
How dare...

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,510
Miss, don't be afraid, I'll protect you.

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,260
Come back here!

36
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,560
You...

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,630
Who is your daughter?

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,950
Tell me,

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,800
then get out.

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,420
- Don't ruin my reputation.
- Leyao, help me.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,560
My daughter, I...

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,990
This is my...

43
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,660
Father, you've misunderstood me.

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,390
I'm only a maid

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,910
in Ning Manor.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,950
Since it's a family matter,

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,250
go somewhere else to resolve it.

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,910
Don't trouble the noble lords.

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,870
(A blunt knife hurts the most.)

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,710
(When I learn my past)

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,270
(and all is revealed,)

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,990
(you'll get yourself.)

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,430
- Father.
- No, wait.

54
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,750
Father, please get up.

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,350
Let's talk outside, Father.

56
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,190
We'll go outside.

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,990
- It's fine, let's talk outside.
- I'm not done.

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,990
(Jiang Leyao,)

59
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,270
(who is the one)

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,710
(you must take revenge on?)

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,190
Three hundred taels. If you won't pay,

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,710
I'll go ask my in-law, the Duke of Ning.

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,390
Take the money,

64
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,890
and we're no longer family.

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,750
Rest assured, Madam Rong'er.

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,710
(It's time to reclaim the position)

67
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,790
(of the Young Madam.)

68
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,630
My Lord, you came to Ning Manor today.

69
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,190
You came but didn't talk to me.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,990
What are you looking at?

71
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
You.

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,910
Qi Zhen insisted

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,430
that she alone did everything.

74
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,590
She ended her life in prison in shame.

75
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,670
Her son, Li Yong,

76
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,150
is guilty of murder.

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,590
He's now a wanted man.

78
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,750
I've mobilized all of Xuanyin Division,

79
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,350
but we still haven't found him yet.

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,310
(Li Yong was already arrested
by Xiao Jingchu)

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,630
(and sentenced to death.)

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,870
(Could something have changed?)

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,710
Li Yong hid himself well.

85
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,750
How did you discover him?

86
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,430
You even had me look into him.

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,720
