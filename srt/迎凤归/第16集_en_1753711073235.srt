1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,200
Go Go Squid!

2
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,080
Episode 7

3
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,600
Your Lordship,

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,960
according to your arrangement,

5
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,040
just by investigating

6
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,520
the dedication of Haitang Snow and Fire,

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,840
we could have caught a big group of people.

8
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,160
But the result is good.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,320
caught a lot of people.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,240
But they were

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,800
kidnapped by the Dali Temple.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,880
Le Yao said

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,320
Ning Mingjing could

14
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,920
cross the Dali Temple's scrolls at will.

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,040
There must be a connection

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,360
between him and the Dali Temple.

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
We're so tired.

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
But in the end,

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,800
the Dali Temple is the one who made the contribution.

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,400
I think we shouldn't call it the Xuan Yin Temple.

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,560
Let's call it

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,000
the Charity Temple.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,000
It's not a big deal.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,120
Just regard it as an accident.

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,600
Such a skilled trick

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,320
is definitely not the first time.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,840
My Lord,

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,920
are you listening to me or not?

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,000
Who is

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,560
behind Ning Mingjing?

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
What will Le Yao do next?

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Jiang Le Yao.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
Haitang Xue.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,320
Le Yao.

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,320
Zhang Jian,

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,480
why are you here?

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,840
I recently received a new sword.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,920
I don't like it.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,840
Ask Xiao Jing to come out and find me.

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,840
I'll give it to her.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
I was just trying to trick you.

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,360
You even gave it to me.

43
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,240
Zhang Jian,

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,160
I'm afraid that

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,720
it's hard for you to ask him out recently.

46
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,400
He's been very close to a girl recently.

47
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,320
But I don't know who exactly.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,960
Why is there a girl's dress in the Xiao Mansion?

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,760
Tell me.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,120
Zhang Jian, don't be angry.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,600
That girl must not know that you like him.

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
If she knew,

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,360
she wouldn't dare to steal it from you.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,680
Miss,

55
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,480
what trick is this?

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,880
To kill someone,

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
you have to be careful.

58
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
Ning Mingjing is very respected

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,600
and noble.

60
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
Then I'll make her fall into the clouds

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,360
and then

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,440
fall into hell.

63
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,600
But Mr. Xiao

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
always behaves coldly to you.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,200
Others may not know it,

66
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,080
but they are willing to do it.

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,760
What's your idea?

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,480
I'm most annoyed with you.

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,480
Isn't it just

70
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,960
them taking a funny pose lately?

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,620
Fried stayed with you

72
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,480
all day long.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,880
But in the dessert,

74
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,160
washerman said

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,620
pens are being abnormal.

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,480
I had foreseen that

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
떠나다

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
You've been making so much noise recently.

79
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,200
Get up!

80
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm still worrying for you!

81
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
Black Thatch!

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,960
Let go of me!

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,720
Don't go, Black Thatch!

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,080
Dispatch!

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,680
Get down!

86
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,920
Let go of me!

87
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,400
and make it again.

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,240
Yes.

89
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,480
Miss Jiang.

90
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,640
Why are you here?

91
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,880
I can pick you up at Ningfu.

92
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,880
I have something to ask you to do.

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,840
Okay.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,040
Go to Dongqian and buy a ginkgo.

95
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,240
Okay.

96
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,560
Ning Bingqing will ask you at night.

97
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,200
Just tell him you didn't buy it.

98
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,080
Okay.

99
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,200
You don't even ask

100
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,520
why I want you to do this.

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,960
I only listen to you.

102
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
I'll do whatever you say.

103
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,240
It's been so long.

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,280
Close your eyes.

105
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:43,580
The

106
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,580
Yuping Troop

107
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,580
T crying

108
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
This is a new dress of mine.

109
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:55,680
Haven't worn it,

110
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,580
T crying

111
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,580
a babies helps.

112
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,580
We can see the beauty of Find Definitely in our hearts.

113
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,580
Also we will put on the H trees which you gift to help remove the bad easily.

114
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,980
But why didn't she

115
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,580
send them in the newspapers?

116
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,580
Ms Zhang

117
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,300
Your Highness,

118
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,860
you are the future Crown Princess Consort

119
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,820
and her sister-in-law.

120
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,700
She should be more shy.

121
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,660
You may leave.

122
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:57,940
Trade

123
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,900
Where is your mulberry؟

124
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,340
I'll make it beautiful.

125
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,980
What are you talking about?

126
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,220
Get one for me, then.

127
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,460
My work is busy.

128
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,900
I don't have time to play games with you.

129
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,220
If you like it,

130
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,900
you can buy it yourself.

131
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,700
How is it, Zhang Jian?

132
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,300
He has a mouth-print.

133
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,020
How is that possible?

134
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,060
He won't be so bold.

135
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,220
I want to see

136
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,020
what that girl looks like.

137
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,180
Where are you going?

138
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,020
I'm going to the Eastern Street

139
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,180
to be a girl.

140
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,420
Higher than that.

141
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,220
せてize yourself.

142
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:20,940
Okay.

143
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,860
I'd like to see

144
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,060
You're following me?

145
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,300
No.

146
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,660
I just saw you...

147
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,100
Who is the person I'm with?

148
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,380
It's not your turn to interfere.

149
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,060
I...

150
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,820
Don't underestimate the person that doesn't belong to you.

151
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,420
You don't have to come to me.

152
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,860
Tomorrow at the celebration,

153
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,300
I'll go and find you myself.

154
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,340
What are you going to do

155
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,500
after you find the person who provoked you?

156
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,340
I'll make him suffer.

157
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,780
Since you suspect all women,

158
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,700
why don't you suspect me?

159
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,940
You're a village girl.

160
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,180
How can he fall for you?

161
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,920
Du Want a girl that's deep enough about society...

162
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,980
Now I'll let you show me

163
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,320
how can you

164
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,440
beat this village girl.

165
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,420
Li Li

166
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,980
or you have to go

167
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,740
to that girl again today.

168
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,820
Sister Type

169
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,660
I am coming.

170
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,460
Get lost.

171
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,900
Did you see my hurry?

172
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Sister Type

173
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,620
I said

174
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,260
I

175
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,900
will be here.

176
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:21,860
《 花花 》

177
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,480
比雨参发晚 雨远细细连

178
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,380
时机浅浅 少浅浅

179
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,020
阴光花环 中夜水长眠

180
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,940
秋月亦泛黄 白云明月朗

181
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,700
花人珠光 亮堂堂

182
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,500
上醉花间 欢叹在月间

183
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,660
酒一醉 杯一醉

184
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,900
斟酒一杯 捉一杯

185
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,700
再走高山流水 冬去泪

186
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,980
一种回忆风吹

187
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,100

188
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,380
怕尘埃存 怕岁月已不回
