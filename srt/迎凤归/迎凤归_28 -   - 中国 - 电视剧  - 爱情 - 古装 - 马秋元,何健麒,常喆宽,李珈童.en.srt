You... are you human or spirit?

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Let me think.

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,990
I suppose I am...

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,950
the spirit come to seek justice from you.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,200
No, that's impossible.

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,580
No, that can't be.

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,750
This is a matter between us.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,840
Leave us alone.

19
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,690
No.

(Spirit tablet

22
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,200
Bingqing,

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,470
when I brought you wine,

24
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,390
I didn't know it was poisoned.

25
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,700
Father,

26
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,470
but today,

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,750
I'm not here for your excuses.

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,170
Do you know how many candles are

29
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,990
in this room?

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,390
Four hundred and ninety-six.

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,550
Do you know

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,790
why the number?

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,070
Because

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,030
you gave me away

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,550
that many times, 496 times.

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,910
I was wrong, Bingqing.

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,310
I won't do it again, ever.

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,710
I... I'm still your father.

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,000
Father,

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,270
you lied to me with this word
for 20 years.

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,350
But today,

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,110
I can't trust you anymore.

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
My dear daughter,

44
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,160
I beg you,

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,830
please let me go.

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,350
I... I beg of you.

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,440
Let you go?

48
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,100
Father,

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,070
you cannot escape.

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,310
I've taken too many lives.

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,630
I can't escape either.

52
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,510
I came here today,

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,990
only to do one thing.

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,430
To return these 496 candles

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,200
back to you.

56
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,590
You unfilial child, you dare rebellion!

57
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,710
Old man,

58
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,230
you've sat on that seat long enough.

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
You...

60
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,850
You should step aside now.

61
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,340
You're utterly rebellious!

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,790
Yes, I go against all orders.

63
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,870
But you forced me to do this.

64
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
I...

65
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,190
I am your eldest son.

66
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,950
There is a clear order of rank.

67
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,310
The throne should belong to me.

68
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,390
But look at what you've done.

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,030
You could have chosen,

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,350
yet you favored the seventh prince.

71
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,790
I shielded him for years.

72
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,270
You even stripped me of my pride
as a man.

73
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,270
My child, listen to me.

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,230
That incident was pure misfortune.

75
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,790
You are my own flesh and blood.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,830
How could I bear to harm you?

77
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,990
I am your son.

78
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,720
That's right.

79
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,390
I am your son, after all.

80
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,510
But in your eyes,

81
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,190
power always comes first here,

82
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,390
no room for kinship.

83
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,630
Since you show no mercy,

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,230
I cannot be a dutiful son.

85
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,410
Today,

86
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,670
I will commit treason
and usurp the throne.

87
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,870
First, I'll take your life,

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,310
then I'll end the seventh prince.

89
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,350
Cease your reckless acts!

90
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,150
I'm late to protect you, Your Majesty.

91
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,590
I beg your pardon.

92
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,630
Please rise.

93
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,030
My good son, you are finally here.

94
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,400
You…

95
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,270
Why have you come?

96
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,670
Of course, we would come.

97
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,910
Because your treason

98
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,110
was within our plans all along.

99
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,550
Is this true devotion,

100
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,990
or praise to harm?

101
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,640
Leyao,

102
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,720
what do you mean?

103
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,630
His Majesty protects the Crown Prince,

104
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,230
simply because the prince

105
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,230
has yet to truly threaten the throne.

106
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,550
But if the Crown Prince

107
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,630
were to start a rebellion,

108
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,430
let's see if he'll still shield him.

109
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,470
So, how do we make him rebel?

110
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,590
It's time for the Crown Prince's secret

111
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,350
to become known to all.

112
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,030
We let you find out that the Emperor

113
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,590
won't pass the throne to you,

114
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,270
just to see if you'd rebel.

115
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,110
Your Highness,

116
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,190
you truly did not disappoint.

117
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,390
Father.

118
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,670
Father, I was wrong.

119
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,170
Please give me another chance.

120
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,790
They set me up.

121
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,990
- Father.
- Remove him, ungrateful!

122
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,110
Father.

123
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,540
- Father.
- Move.

124
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,790
Father, please give me one more chance.

125
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,540
Father!

126
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,800
Father!

127
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,250
Leyao.

128
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,120
Yes?

129
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,990
My dear, you've lost weight.

130
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,310
Father, Mother.

131
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,710
Leyao,

132
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,790
you're a female official
at the Dali Court.

133
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,390
Father, Mother.

134
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,880
Are you happy?

135
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,230
I...

136
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,270
I just want to go back to Jiang Village.

137
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,190
I want to stay with you both.

138
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,200
Leyao.

139
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,910
Always remember this,

140
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,390
Father will always be your shelter.

141
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,270
Mother is your support.

142
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,630
As long as we watch over you,

143
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,750
the world is yours to explore.

144
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,040
Do you understand?

145
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,870
Father, Mother,

146
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,070
I understand.

147
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,150
I... I promise I will...

148
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
Leyao.

149
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,350
I miss you both.

150
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,630
Father, Mother,

151
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,350
I couldn't save you.

152
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,910
How I wish...

153
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,190
Father, Mother.

154
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:37,550
You may rest in peace now.

155
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,270
I have heard

156
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,910
that Jingyou ended his life in prison.

157
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,870
With the Crown Prince gone,

158
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,230
the Empress's faction was exposed.

159
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,470
The Empress took her own life.

160
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,950
The Emperor fell gravely ill.

161
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,950
He intends to pass the throne to you.

162
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,390
Thank you for your support.

163
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,310
I will not disappoint your trust.

164
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,440
Very well.

165
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,040
Come on.

166
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,430
I summoned you to the palace today,

167
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,910
not just for this matter.

168
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,750
I wish to ask

169
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,710
how your wedding plans are coming along.

170
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,270
"The talented lady has a heart condition.

171
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,190
She went missing

172
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,470
and was taken in by a kind old farmer"?

173
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,030
Taken in?
That's just sugarcoating kidnapping.

174
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,090
No.

175
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,110
I must uncover

176
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,870
every case of missing women.

177
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,510
Minister Leyao from the Dali Court,

178
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,550
when do you plan to have your meal?

179
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,390
Perhaps in half an hour.

180
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,670
Then when do you plan to take a break?

181
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,390
It'll take five years

182
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,030
to close these cases.

183
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,670
Then what about our wedding?

184
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,950
Ten years from now, perhaps.

185
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,630
Of course I wish

186
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,430
she could be my wife soon.

187
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,830
But more than that,

188
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,470
I hope she can be herself.

189
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,600
For this reason,

190
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,550
I will devote my life to her.
