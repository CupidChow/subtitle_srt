00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,199
Hello.

3
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,368
You’re Jeong-yeon, right?

4
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,661
Hello.

5
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,245
Come in.

6
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:37,871
Yes.

00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,723
Teacher…

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,640
Yes?

11
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,473
But why are you calling him “teacher”?

12
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:44,395
Oh, he was my private tutor in high school.

13
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,730
Ah.

14
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,524
Ha Yu-geon did graduate top of his department.

15
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,154
But was he like this back then too?

16
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,614
Like what?

17
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,865
I mean…

18
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,953
Was he kind of a jerk?

[7 Years Earlier]

20
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,848
You’ve been well, right?

21
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,015
Yes.

22
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,819
sigh

23
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,655
Say hello.

24
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,032
Professor Park’s student.

25
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,534
He’ll be staying here a few months,

26
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,996
and he goes to Hanguk University on a scholarship,

27
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,708
so ask him about studying or…

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,335
sigh

29
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,838
No, forget it.

30
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,552
Ugh, this little—

31
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,604
My son, Min Jeong-yeon.

32
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,479
sigh

33
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,149
He takes after his dad—no manners at all.

34
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,152
Want some coffee?

35
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,543
Like you saw in the email I sent,

36
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,544
headquarters is developing

37
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,048
a dating app, and we’re gathering the data it needs.

38
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,425
When you have someone you like,

39
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:42,347
we’ll use VR, cameras, and biosensors to capture

40
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,765
and analyze your facial expressions and behavior patterns.

41
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,810
Ah… yes.

42
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,604
Jeong-yeon,

43
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,856
you’ll convert the collected data into numbers

44
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,441
and archive it.

45
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,860
As you know,

46
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,447
it’s hard to find test subjects,

47
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,449
so you’ll need to participate in the experiments too.

48
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:07,580
Hey now—aren’t you being a bit cold to your old student?

49
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,670
Man, he never lets that attitude slide.

50
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,089
Hey, I’m heading to HQ, then I’m going straight home, okay?

51
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,800
See you, Jeong-yeon.

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,260
Yes, see you.

53
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,789
Researcher…

54
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,916
I finished everything you asked earlier.

55
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:53,835
Yeah.

56
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,631
Thanks, Jeong-yeon.

57
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,055
Teacher…

58
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,932
I missed you.

59
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,643
Me too.

60
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,319
You’ve grown up nicely—pretty, huh?

61
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,704
sigh

62
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,875
I don’t even know why he’s like that.

63
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:38,546
He used to study a bit in middle school.

64
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,799
Could it be…

65
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,011
that he fell in with a bad crowd?

66
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,931
You think he got corrupted by bad friends?

67
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,019
Bad friends, my ass.

68
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,938
If he’s doing bad things, he’s the bad one.

69
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,692
sigh

70
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,152
Ever since he started

71
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:09,827
living separately from his dad, he’s been like that… maybe.

72
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,665
If it’s okay with you…

73
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,128
would you mind if I tutored Jeong-yeon?

74
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:24,592
Oh my—really? That would be wonderful.

75
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:33,601
But if he won’t listen, don’t push yourself too hard.

76
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,855
I’ll try to talk to him.

77
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,982
Will you?

78
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,651
I’d really appreciate it.

79
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,587
What is it?

80
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,513
I’m here to tutor you.

81
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:18,479
Yeah, go work hard by yourself.

82
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,064
You got hurt again?

83
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,077
Hey.

84
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,123
I’ll tell Mom I’m getting tutoring just fine,

85
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,710
so just take your money and mind your own business.

86
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,753
Huh?

87
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,732
Jeong-yeon.

88
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,194
I want to help you.

89
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,784
Worry about your perfect little life.

90
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,538
Is someone bullying you?

91
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,956
Ah shit

92
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,166
You’re crossing a line.

93
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,336
Go study.

94
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,713
Or what,

95
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,799
go flirt with girls with that pretty face.

96
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:05,979
Shi..

97
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,191
Hey.

98
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,781
You wanna die?
