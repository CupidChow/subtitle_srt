Coconuts.

You're bored?

29

Not at all.

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
I'm thinking about my projects.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,680
What projects?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,830
There're several.

33
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,760
Which one you wanna hear about?

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,680
Just anyone.

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
I don't know much about your major.

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,280
It's just for fun.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,240
Then let me tell you

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,960
the application of AI in criminal investigations.

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:04,960
OK.

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,760
At the moment,

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,510
actually we're helping design

42
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,680
a facial recognition system for the police.

43
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,240
Through this system,

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,780
the police can identify suspects

45
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,200
who absconded decades ago.

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,920
These suspects are pretty cunning.

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,820
They flee to a small town

48
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,640
and change their names.

49
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,040
It's impossible to catch them.

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,760
And decades after the crime,

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,880
their appearances change too.

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,760
It's hard to recognize them with human eyes.

53
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,080
That's where facial recognition comes in.

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,360
Has it cracked any case?

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,720
Sure, thousands of cases.

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,640
For example?

57
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,920
For example,

58
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,520
this one murderer escaped

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,220
and turned out he'd been posing as a monk.

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,960
The case had never been solved.

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,720
Then...

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,090
Then we created the facial recognition system.

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,010
The police put a photo of him from ten years ago

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
onto their database.

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,430
The computer searched for it automatically

66
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,960
and found the photo of him as a monk.

67
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,480
Even if you change your name

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,160
and fake your date of birth,

69
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,160
it still works.

70
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,000
The computer can identify your face.

71
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,840
Isn't that cool?

72
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,340
That case was picked up by the news,

73
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
so I can tell you about it.

74
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,760
There are a lot of more

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,000
classified cases.

76
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,880
That's cool!

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm good, right!

78
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,280
Fine,

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,280
you're good.

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,360
Where's my award?

81
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,800
You want an award?

82
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,400
OK, what kind of award?

83
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,320
I want to see you play a game.

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,640
I've been teaching other people to play.

85
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,680
That's not the same.

86
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,480
I want to find out more about you.

87
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,400
Come with me.

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
Dai Feng, get up.

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,440
Boss!

90
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,040
Get up, let me play.

91
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Ling Shan, let's play.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,880
Boss, come on.

93
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,560
There's no way I'll beat you.

94
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,200
Save it. Hurry up.

95
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,160
Then... I...

96
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,420
He was a hero to so many people.

97
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,280
The Gun.

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,440
Yes.

99
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,610
This...

100
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,780
At this moment,

101
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,420
I'm more convinced than ever,

102
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,220
if he hadn't retired,

103
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,640
he'd still be the strongest player.

104
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,680
Come on, Ling Shan.

105
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
Try hold on a bit longer.

106
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,640
Thanks for exposing my weaknesses, boss.

107
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,480
It was an honor.

108
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,000
Are you satisfied?

109
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,200
Why isn't she eating?

110
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,560
Doesn't she like our food?

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,200
I don't know.

112
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,200
Ling Shan,

113
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,440
take two new dishes to the boss's girl.

114
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,880
Tong Nian,

115
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,240
why aren't you eating?

116
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm fine,

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,360
I'll eat later.

118
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,920
Boss prepared these for you.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,560
There are for you, too.

120
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,560
Thank you.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,240
Take your time.

122
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,600
Thanks so much.

123
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Have you finished?

124
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,640
Yes.

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,560
Then let's go hang out.

126
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,600
OK, let's go.

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,000
OK.

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,160
Tong Nian, we're leaving now.

129
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,920
-Bye.  -Bye.

130
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,350
Why aren't you eating?

131
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,200
Don't you like the food?

132
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,600
No, I was waiting for you.

133
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,680
Is this enough for you?

134
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,240
Sure.

135
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,160
If not, just tell me.

136
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,000
It's too much.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,360
Should I eat it all?

138
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,840
Waste not, want not!

139
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,280
You, don't you like it?

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,440
Why are you only eating rice?

141
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,640
You don't want anything else?

142
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm fine.

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,440
I never eat that much.

144
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,320
Hurry up and don't waste.

145
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm full.

146
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,280
We have 15 minutes before we leave.

147
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,440
Hurry up.

148
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,280
15 minutes!

149
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,440
Hurry!

150
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,840
Those scoundrels didn't clean the table again!

151

= The 1st Sanya Training Camp =
= Individual and Group Tournament =

152
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,810
Let's see who has luck on his side?

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Everybody draws straws

154
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,320
and that determines the matchups.

155
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
It's a knock-out tournament

156
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,200
one on one.

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,720
Outside, there are other three games in play.

158
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,240
This is the group stage.

159
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,920
What about the final overall ranking?

160
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,320
Only five people will be left in the end.

161
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,880
The rest will be eliminated.

162
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,080
But we two teams are the strongest.

163
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,640
It'd be unfair to knock each other out!

164
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
What's so unfair?

165
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,720
Can you only demonstrate your abilities

166
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
by beating people worse than you?

167
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,320
Nope, boss,

168
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
that's not what I meant.

169
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,560
I just feel that the knock out system

170
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,120
will unfairly affect our ranking.

171
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
Does it matter?

172
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,680
In team K&K,

173
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,880
there are only two ranks,

174
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,520
the winner and the loser.

175
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,120
OK, I know.

176
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,360
Also the handsome and the ugly.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,960
How dare you?

178
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm just kidding, just kidding.

179
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,680
OK,

180
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,440
let the game begins.

181
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,760
Let's toss a coin.

182
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,360
No need,

183
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,120
let K&K draw first.

184
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,640
Cool.

185
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,979
OK,

186
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,920
then K&K can go first.

187
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,960
My opponent is

188
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,240
Lin Yin.

189
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,440
My pleasure.

190
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,480
Pleasure?

191
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,400
You enjoy losing, don't you?

192
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,720
Screw him!

193
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Following.

194
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm up against Ou Qiang.

195
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,200
Little Dai, and his big bro!

196
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,400
I've got Hua Ti.

197
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,160
Good.

198
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,320
I'm playing you.

199
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,200
That's so unlucky!

200
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,800
You always get the short straw!

201
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,160
Whatever, it's the same.

202
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,920
It is not!

203
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,200
If you have to face him,

204
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,880
you'll lose straight out!

205
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,600
How can you improve you rankings?

206
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,440
I don't mean you're not good.

207
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,000
Alright alright.

208
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,000
He's the number one.

209
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,800
Anyone who faces him is gonna lose.

210
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,320
Then let's swap places

211
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,280
and sit face-to-face with your opponent.

212
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,280
For today's one-on-one round,

213
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
there won't be many judges,

214
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,560
because we're in the early rounds.

215
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,960
You shouldn't receive any help.

216
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,560
Later, if you win the game,

217
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,640
please raise your hand.

218
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,640
I'll note the winner and loser

219
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,720
on the whiteboard.

220
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,680
Grunt wins!

221
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,960
Bingo!

222
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Ou Qing wins!

223
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,840
Yes!

224
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,520
Hua Ti wins!

225
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,560
Following wins!

226
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,400
Wu Bai wins!

227
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,560
Today's winners are,

228
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,320
Wu Bai, Grunt, Ou Qiang,

229
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,520
Hua Ti and Following.

230
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,560
Congratulations!

231
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,560
It's so nice to have a rest like this.

232
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,960
Is Wu Bai really good?

233
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,480
No one can beat him.

234
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,150
Solo beat him once before he retired.

235
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,240
Solo?

236
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,380
He's so much older.

237
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,480
They played together?

238
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,280
Wu Bai started training young.

239
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,680
Tong nian, you wanna play with us?

240
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,280
Yeah, join in!

241
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,200
Boss, Tong Nian.

242
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,480
The game's over?

243
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,440
Yes.

244
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,400
What are you doing now?

245
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,720
Relaxing!

246
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah, we're relaxing!

247
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,040
Relaxing?

248
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,160
You lost and you wanna relax?

249
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,680
Shame on you!

250
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,200
No,

251
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,240
Wu Bai and I won, right?

252
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,920
Yeah.  -That's right.

253
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,680
Although the rest of us lost,

254
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
we shouldn't overstretch ourselves, right?

255
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,320
Yes!

256
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,040
OK.

257
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,920
If you want to relax,

258
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,560
do 50 pushups here.

259
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,800
Then I'll allow you to relax!

260
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,480
Boss.

261
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,920
Really? You're not joking?

262
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,800
You don't want to relax?

263
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,360
Let's do it!

264
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,080
Let's do it!

265
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,440
Let's do it!

266
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,960
You'd better keep count!

267
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:26,940
OK!

268
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,520
One!

269
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Two!

270
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Three!

271
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,640
Tell me.

272
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,520
Huh?

273
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,690
Four!

274
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,560
About AI.  -Five!

275
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,000
We talked about crime last time.

276
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
Now let's focus on AI in medicine.

277
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,320
Six.

278
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,240
One of my classmates has been focusing on that.

279
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,200
He worked with hospitals

280
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,560
on identifying lung nodules.

281
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
And before that,

282
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,520
we collaborated with another hospital.

283
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,200
But unfortunately,

284
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,560
they didn't trust us at all.

285
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,700
They found a team of experts

286
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,080
to compete with our AI system.

287
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,290
We had to identify the pulmonary nodules

288
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,760
from the hospital's past cases.

289
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,200
Who identified the most won.

290
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,320
Did you win?

291
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,240
We not only won

292
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,200
but found some previously unidentified cases.

293
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,080
You know,

294
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,240
the nodules can be really tiny.

295
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,630
It's really hard for doctors to pick them all out.

296
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,680
But our system managed it!

297
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,960
The system detected

298
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,560
an unrecognized nodule from previous cases.

299
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,360
Good for the patients!

300
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,520
Yeah!

301
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
I think if we go on developing it

302
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,640
for a few more years,

303
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,960
it'll work even better.

304
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,330
And our system has high processing speed,

305
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,410
which saves the hospital lots of manpower.

306
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,800
Fifty!

307
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I can't even stand up!

308
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,640
Are you OK?

309
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,800
Boss, we're finished!

310
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,400
Since you're so tired,

311
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,880
and so fragile,

312
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,600
why not go get some rest?

313
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,400
No!

314
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
We're fine!  -We're not tired!

315
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,080
Yeah.  -We're fine!

316
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,780
Yeah!  -Really.

317
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,600
We feel good!

318
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,320
Off you go!

319
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,680
Let's go!

320
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,720
Thank you, boss!

321
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,280
I should say,

322
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,880
Shangyan really knows how to manage a team!

323
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,680
Yeah.

324
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,520
His players respect him!

325
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,780
He's strong and that wins him respect.

326
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,000
That's what you want in a leader!

327
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,560
What?

328
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,480
You don't want to work with me?

329
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,550
You wanna do pushups too?

330
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,500
Of course not!

331
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,780
No thanks.

332
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,000
OK, let's get changed!

333
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,600
It's hot!!

334
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,280
Let's go swimming!

335
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,760
OK.

336
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,200
Check out this pose!

337
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,760
Come on!

338
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,800
Take a seat.

339
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,480
No thanks.

340
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,520
What time is your flight tomorrow?

341
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,300
In the evening!

342
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,440
The evening?

343
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,280
I have training at 3 pm,

344
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,520
so I can't see you off.

345
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,800
It's fine.

346
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,560
So, you're free tomorrow,

347
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
you can hang out for a while.

348
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,579
OK.

349
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,600
Get some rest then.

350
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,640
I'm off now.

351
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,200
OK.

352
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,480
It's ten o'clock.

353
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,160
You still have work to do?

354
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,080
Yeah.

355
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,680
I have two conference calls,

356
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,520
one at 10, one at 12.

357
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,760
So you can't go to bed till 1 o'clock.

358
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,400
Right.

359
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,800
You work really hard.

360
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,600
I'm off then.

361
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,000
Or maybe when you finish,

362
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,400
you can call me.

363
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,200
I won't be asleep too early.

364
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,080
And we can just

365
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,440
have a chat or something.

366
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,720
Or maybe,

367
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,520
we can work together.

368
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,920
Don't you have some coding to do?

369
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,120
When I finish my meetings,

370
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,240
we'll talk then.

371
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,800
OK.

372
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,420
Get your laptop.

373
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,080
Let' go.

374
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,680
I wanna look something up.

375
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,760
OK.

376
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,370
Actually, I have a question for you.

377
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,240
Go on.

378
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,200
I noticed you're always wearing

379
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
that headset when you code.

380
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,610
But why do you still need it

381
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,570
when there's no one else around?

382
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,020
What's that sound?

383
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,330
Sounds good?

384
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,810
It calms me down

385
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,370
and helps me think.

386
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,690
You like it?

387
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,530
Yeah.

388
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,490
Try this.

389
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,970
That's the rain.

390
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,080
And this.

391
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,250
Listen carefully,

392
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,290
It's a bell.

393
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,970
I fell asleep.

394
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,410
When did I fall asleep?

395
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,370
When I went to make coffee.

396
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,650
I was just listing to that,

397
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,810
and I fell asleep.

398
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,050
Are you OK that you haven't

399
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,730
had a chance to hang out in Sanya?

400
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,250
It's fine.

401
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,730
I'm happy to be with you.

402
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,290
I prefer to stay at home,

403
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,050
actually.

404
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,410
You're different

405
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,330
from what I thought.

406
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,610
What do you mean?

407
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,090
Like...

408
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,570
In a good way or a bad way?

409
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,650
Tell me.

410
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,570
You want to go to bed

411
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,970
or you want to hang out?

412
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,810
I don't mind.

413
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,690
Whatever you prefer.

414
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,970
The kids on the team

415
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,570
also came to Sanya for the first time.

416
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,730
I can't make them train every day

417
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,970
at the internet café.

418
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,570
Then I'll hang out with you.

419
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,730
Go pack your bags then.

420
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,010
Go ahead.

421
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,790
You're not gonna take a nap?

422
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,710
No, I'm writing a software.

423
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,590
It's almost done.

424
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,470
What is it?

425
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,270
I can't tell you now.

426
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,190
Don't peek.

427
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,890
You wouldn't know what it is, anyway.

428
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,390
Boss is afraid of heights.

429
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,630
Really?

430
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,150
He's afraid of heights!

431
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,350
Listen.

432
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,910
For today's morning exercise,

433
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,070
you can do it your own way.

434
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,390
Come on, boss.

435
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,230
Look around.

436
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,550
We're in the mountains!

437
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,390
How can we do our exercises now?

438
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,310
We've been here for days.

439
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,650
But all we've done are exercises,

440
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,150
classes and games.

441
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,030
People come here for vacation.

442
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,350
But we haven't had any rest.

443
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,670
This is so cruel!

444
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,230
Life is swimming against the current.

445
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,390
You keep swimming or you fall behind.

446
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,510
The rankings are cruel, too.

447
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,970
But there's more than one training method.

448
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,870
We can work really hard.  -Ling Shan!

449
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,360
But if you put too hard we'll break.

450
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,590
We're already exhausted.

451
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,590
That's enough!

452
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,350
What?!

453
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,390
Aren't you tired?

454
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,070
Ling Shan,

455
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,150
mind your attitude.

456
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:12,910
What attitude?

457
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,300
If you won't say it, I'll say it!

458
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:14,739
Are you tired?

459
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:15,750
Tell me, are you tired?

460
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,030
Ling Shan,

461
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,440
I remember when you just joined us,

462
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,430
you worked so hard.

463
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,590
You got to grip with things so fast,

464
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,750
fixing bugs,

465
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,910
and analyzing logs.

466
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,340
Then your rankings shot up.

467
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,410
But that's how we should approach every day.

468
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,350
I told you that,

469
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,070
today you'd train yourselves,

470
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,030
which means you can relax.

471
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,470
Do whatever you want.

472
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,150
I won't force you to do anything.

473
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,630
But,

474
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,790
just tell me,

475
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,950
is your heart still in this?

476
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,950
Yes.

477
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:25,880
Boss,

478
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,310
I should work harder.

479
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,630
I'm sorry.

480
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,110
Go and relax.

481
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,200
Come on.

482
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,590
Don't be upset.

483
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,430
Let's go!

484
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,950
Don't be upset.

485
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,550
They're still kids.

486
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,270
They'll grow up.

487
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,790
How old are you?

488
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,510
Let's take a seat.

489
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,620
Tong Nian!

490
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,510
Tong Nian!

491
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,510
Watch out!

492
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,310
OK!

493
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,550
Don't worry!

494
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:43,870
You're awake?

495
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,150
Look what I've done!

496
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:46,630
Now,

497
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,270
there are 52 cards.

498
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,070
Besides what you have here,

499
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,470
there are an extra 50.

500
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,790
So in the next round,

501
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,990
the probability of a deal

502
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,940
will be as follows.

503
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,350
And if you get caught

504
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,710
by your opponent,

505
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,270
you have to turn over another card,

506
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,790
and call it again.

507
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,630
But the way this software calculates is,

508
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,150
it should add this...

509
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,550
You stayed up only because

510
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,040
you wanted to make a game for me?

511
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,070
Like this!

512
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,830
Do you understand?

513
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm trying to understand what you said.

514
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,550
It's not so hard!

515
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,590
It's simple.

516
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,390
Think about it in terms of probability

517
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,310
and you'll get it.

518
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,550
You don't like it?

519
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,380
It took me two nights to make this game.

520
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,990
Don't shake it!

521
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,230
Boss,

522
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,790
Ling Shan keeps shaking the bridge.

523
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,900
Boss, tell him to behave!

524
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:46,420
You...

525
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,390
Ling Shan, stop it!

526
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,430
You're representing K&K!

527
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,480
They're so noisy.

528
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:52,950
Boss.

529
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,550
Yeah, boys are like that.

530
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,030
Let's go and hang out with them.

531
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,790
Come on!

532
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,870
Let's go!

533
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,350
It's so high!

534
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,470
You see how high we are!

535
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,350
Han Shangyan.

536
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,790
Tong Nian.

537
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,430
If you're afraid of heights,

538
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,470
maybe we shouldn't go over.

539
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,710
I'm not!

540
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,030
It's fine.

541
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:26,950
Come on, quickly.

542
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,630
You're not?

543
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,030
You go first, I'll take my time.

544
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,070
No.

545
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,490
You promised me we'd go over together?

546
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,830
Come here.

547
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,590
Oh, I know.

548
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,070
You're afraid of heights!

549
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,430
If you're too scared,

550
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,030
it's fine,

551
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,150
we can just turn back.

552
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,750
Are you kidding?

553
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,350
Why could I be afraid?

554
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,910
Are you OK?

555
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,990
Tong Nian, let's stop here.

556
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,550
No, didn't you hear,

557
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,590
this is the Love Chain Bridge.

558
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,520
If lovers go over it together,

559
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,070
they'll live happily ever after.

560
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,710
We must do this.

561
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,750
No no no!

562
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,710
Don't be superstitious.

563
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,830
It's just a bridge.

564
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,710
It doesn't mean anything!

565
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,550
Let's stop right here.

566
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,870
I knew it!

567
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,680
I finally know what the fearless Han Shangyan

568
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,390
is afraid of!

569
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,790
Heights!

570
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,030
Han Shangyan is afraid of heights!

571
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,270
You hold my waist.

572
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,670
Let's go over slowly.

573
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,590
Close your eyes.

574
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,590
OK.

575
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,310
Come back!

576
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,150
You can run fast back!

577
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,710
Aren't you scared?

578
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,310
Come back!

579
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,350
Han Shangyan!

580
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,990
Hello.

581
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,830
Why aren't you getting in?

582
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,030
What is it?

583
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,210
Can I have one of your team's new shirts?

584
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,870
I want it to match this card,

585
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,280
as a souvenir,

586
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,390
OK?

587
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,670
It's fine if you don't have one.

588
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,150
Never mind.

589
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,630
Take care of yourself.

590
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,190
Don't stay up too late!

591
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,430
Bye.

592
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,190
Take it back.

593
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,230
Hello, to the airport.

594
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,190
OK.

595
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,210
Bye-bye,

596
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,310
take care of yourself.

00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,510
And don't do that again.

615
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,030
Tong Nian, you're back!

616
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,590
Oh, a man's coat!

617
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,270
A man's coat!

618
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,350
Yeah, it is.

619
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,550
Why did you bring a man's coat

620
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,790
back with you?

621
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,230
Did he trick you

622
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,910
to Sanya and then you

623
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,910
stayed in the same room?

624
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,070
What did you say?

625
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,820
No! No! No!

626
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,590
I had my own room.

627
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,670
All by myself!

628
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,430
Really?

629
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,310
Yes!

630
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:57,830
No no no,

631
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,710
I'm still worried.

632
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,230
Come on.

633
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,790
Tell me something about him!

634
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,430
How old is he?

635
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,110
He's 29, almost 30.

636
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,910
30? He's old!

637
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,870
Not at all!

638
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,350
So, where did you meet him?

639
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,150
At an internet café.

640
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,350
An internet café?

641
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,430
How long have it been?

642
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,920
Anyway, I think it's fate.

643
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,750
We met each other a while ago,

644
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,190
but we didn't speak much.

645
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,300
Then we got to know each other

646
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,710
and somehow ended together.

647
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,710
Or maybe not,

648
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,710
we weren't exactly together then.

649
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,070
Whatever, we broke up

650
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,470
and we met up again,

651
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,459
and then we got back together.

652
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,190
Then one day I drank too much

653
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,990
so we broke up again.

654
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,470
And right now,

655
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,030
we're back together again.

656
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,670
It's been so complicated

657
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,150
but,

658
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,030
but I do like him so much.

659
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,750
Yaya,

660
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,470
I'm really, really, really into him.

661
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,270
Wait, wait, wait.

662
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,110
Wait a second.

663
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,110
Let me think.

664
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,230
Let me get this straight.

665
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,240
You two somehow got together.

666
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,550
Then you broke up

667
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,190
and got back together.

668
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,030
And then you drunk too much

669
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,910
and broke up again.

670
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,459
And now, you're back together again?

671
00:32:59,580 --> 00:32:59,900
You...

672
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,870
Something like that.

673
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,670
Hey, wait.

674
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,910
This is the same person?

675
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,630
How do you always

676
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,270
end up falling for the same person?

677
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,130
If a man breaks up with you again and again,

678
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,870
it means he doesn't appreciate you.

679
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:19,510
No.

680
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,390
He didn't want to break up with me.

681
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:21,950
It's just...

682
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,750
Anyway, it's not his fault.

683
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,390
Then tell me,

684
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,590
what's his job.

685
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,430
Please,

686
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,750
he must have a job.

687
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,910
He can't be an old man

688
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,590
surfing the net all day long.

689
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Right, he's older than me,

690
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,870
much older.

691
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,190
Out of the way.

692
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,420
You!

693
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,990
I have to clean up my stuff.

694
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,790
You wouldn't understand.

695
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,590
Don't touch my things, OK?

696
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,910
Here you are.

697
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,110
Have some more.

698
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,190
Eat up.

699
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,190
Is it good?

700
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,790
Shangyan,

701
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,830
I heard you had a cold.

702
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,190
I got this for you specially.

703
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,350
It'll do you good.

704
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,760
I heard this really touching story.

705
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,430
When you were in team Solo,

706
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,360
whenever you guys went out for a game,

707
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,310
your captain gave you one of these.

708
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,030
Can you bring me some water?

709
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,030
No, thanks.

710
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,790
I'm gonna go lie down.

711
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:44,470
Thank you.

712
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,630
Your little girlfriend

713
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,950
must be tiring you out.

714
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,990
She can't take care of you

715
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,430
and you have to hang out with her.

716
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,110
I really don't know

717
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,880
why you put yourself through this.

718
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,830
You're wrong.

719
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,710
It's because I can't bear being apart from her

720
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,950
that I've got sick.

721
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,259
Oh, I know,

722
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:08,230
you haven't had a boyfriend for long,

723
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,110
so you've forgotten how this feels.

724
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,320
But once you're in love,

725
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,680
you'll be full of energy and enthusiasm.

726
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,670
So what I'm trying to say is,

727
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,310
don't waste any time on me.

728
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,470
It's no use.

729
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,379
Bye.

730
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,430
Shangyan.

731
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,270
What are you looking at?

732
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,950
The CTF's advanced tutorials.

733
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,510
What you looking at those for?

734
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,190
Why shouldn't I?

735
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,830
I recorded their theme song,

736
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,110
didn't I?

737
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,230
I like CTF!

738
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,270
Tell me something about them.

739
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,190
Really?

740
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,910
OK.

741
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,390
Come on, Yaya.

742
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,950
Come teach me,

743
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,550
in case he criticizes me.

744
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,570
He'll criticize you?

745
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,830
No, he won't.

746
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,110
He only criticizes his players.

747
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,910
Fine.

748
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,910
Why don't you like him?

749
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,470
OK, I'll be polite to him.

750
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,590
I understand,

751
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,750
you've started learning about CTF

752
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,150
because of that old man right?

753
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,850
I don't want to see you getting hurt.

754
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,440
Who knows if he really knows how to play CTF?

755
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,670
He does!

756
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,270
And he's really good at it!

757
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,230
He's an expert!

758
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,510
He really is!

759
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,550
How good is he?

760
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,950
All I know is,

761
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,070
he's considered a master online.

762
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,230
A master?

763
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,710
He knows how to brag!
