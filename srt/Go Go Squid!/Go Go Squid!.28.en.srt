26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,880
I didn't expect your room to be so clean.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,400
I clean it regularly.

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,270
You have a cleaning lady in your club.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,000
Doesn't she help you tidy up?

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,960
She already has a lot to do.

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,040
And she's One's mom.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,800
She works here to support her family.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,330
I don't stay here very often anyway.

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,720
I can tidy up myself.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,960
You're a really good boss.

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,200
I don't want people to see me as their boss.

37
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,640
But that's what they call me anyway.

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,790
Why are you always wearing black?

39
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,870
Maybe white would suit you better.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,880
I'm a man.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,360
I don't really care what I wear.

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,800
Why...

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,320
Why are you packing your stuff up?

44
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
Our leader is back to Norway,

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,240
so I'm stepping in for a while.

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,840
And normally I don't live here.

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,040
What about your grandpa?

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,320
He'll be going back in a few days, too.

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,360
Wu Bai's going with him.

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,320
Why are you looking at me?

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,560
You need help?

52
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,160
No, thanks.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,880
Mr. Han,

54
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
let me do that.

55
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,600
Let me do it.

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,240
Can you?

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,160
Of course.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,320
Ok then.

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,680
Alright alright.

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,440
Let me do it.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,240
Uh...

62
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,680
Here you are.

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,440
Yeah, right.

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,760
He should do it.

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,040
What were you watching just now?

66
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,160
Nothing.

67
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,640
We were just chatting.

68
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,560
Good.

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,400
Here.

70
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,320
Here. Have a taste.

71
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,320
I won't.

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,920
Did you wash your hands?

73
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,800
Of course.

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,800
Let me have a try.

75
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,520
It's so sweet!

76
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,760
It's really sweet.

77
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,640
Don't you want some?

78
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
You'll like it.

79
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,720
Have a try!

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,400
I'll have some then.

81
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,000
It's good!

82
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,520
Tong Nian,

83
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,000
this might be the last time I come back.

84
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,960
I'm too old

85
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,720
to be flying back and forth.

86
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
What if I miss you again

87
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,680
when I go back to Norway?

88
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,360
Don't worry.

89
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,120
If you miss me...

90
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,030
I'll bring her to see you

91
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,590
when we're free.

92
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Really?

93
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,280
Don't lie to me.

94
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,040
As long as she's free.

95
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,880
She has classes after all.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,720
I'll be free!

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
I can always make time!

98
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,400
Good.

99
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,480
Did you hear that?

100
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
Have another one.

101
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,640
It is sweet!

102
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,480
Thanks for coming today.

103
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,560
Grandpa was happy.

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,040
You don't need to say that.

105
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,040
I enjoy talking with him.

106
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
Where're you going?

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
Home or campus?

108
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,840
Back to the campus.

109
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
When are we going to see the cat?

110
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,880
You're so weird.

111
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,080
The cat's mine now,

112
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
stop thinking about it.

113
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
Do you want it back?

114
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,360
No!

115
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,560
What are you talking about?

116
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,840
That's not what I meant.

117
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,440
I'll take you to see him.

118
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,160
You can see Little Squid after I clean him up a bit.

119
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,920
Wait.

120
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,120
What did you say?

121
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,360
Did you just call him Little Squid?

122
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,440
I did.

123
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,160
That's my username online.

124
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,040
Why'd you call him that?

125
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,960
You're Squid.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,040
He's Little Squid.

127
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,200
It's different.

128
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,440
Squid gave me Little Squid.

129
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,920
It sounds like a tongue twister.

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,360
You named him after me right?

131
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,620
Yep. That's right.

132
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,700
It's easy to remember.

133
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,560
Hold on.

134
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,720
He can't have that name.

135
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,120
He's a cat!

136
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,800
Cats eat squid.

137
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,400
It sounds weird.

138
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,200
Does it?

139
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,090
He isn't used to the name yet.

140
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,720
You can still change it.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,720
He won't like his name being changed!

142
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,710
How would you feel if I call you Tong Shangyan?

143
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
Tong Shangyan?

144
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,400
I'd like it.

145
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,440
Tong Shangyan.

146
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,640
Han Nian.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,920
Buckle up.

148
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Tong Nian.

149
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,760
Do you enjoy programming that much?

150
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,200
What are you smiling about?

151
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,920
Do you have some debugging to do?

152
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,640
Let me help you.

153
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,790
Why do you want to do debugging?

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm free anyway.

155
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,400
Let me help you.

156
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,760
You're so kind.

157
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,040
Of course.

158
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,200
Yaya.

159
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,240
We've already broken up twice.

160
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,360
Can we get back together again?

161
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Come on.

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
You call that breaking up?

163
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,200
It wasn't breaking up at all!

164
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,200
But my mom doesn't like him at all.

165
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,160
I don't dare tell her the truth.

166
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,880
Why doesn't she like him?

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,080
To be honest,

168
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,180
he seems great for you, in every respect.

169
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,120
I know!

170
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,780
My mom's a teacher.

171
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,680
Maybe that's why she doesn't like him.

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,080
I don't think so.

173
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,430
She probably just needs to get to know him.

174
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,340
You should have them spend more time together.

175
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,120
Han Shangyan's not so outgoing.

176
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,560
It's not easy to see his good points,

177
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,160
unless you spend lots of time with him.

178
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,120
Don't worry too much.

179
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,640
You've lived with your mom since you were a kid.

180
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
My dad died early.

181
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,430
So yeah, I've lived with my mom since then.

182
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,570
So I've had to be responsible.

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,960
Your mom loves you so much.

184
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,520
It must've been difficult for your family,

185
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,920
she never pressured you into starting work right away.

186
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,600
She didn't.

187
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,800
She said knowledge was important.

188
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,400
Knowledge would open doors for me.

189
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,520
Mom. Auntie.

190
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,600
You're back.

191
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,440
Tong Nian.  -Zheng Hui? What're you doing here?

192
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,560
I got a bonus from the lab.

193
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,420
So I bought some gifts for your parents.

194
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,960
Mom. What did you do?

195
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,840
He hasn't graduated yet.

196
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,080
You can't accept his gifts.

197
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,280
She didn't accept.

198
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
You're scaring him.

199
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,680
Sit down. I'm sorry.

200
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,960
-Thank you.  -Take a seat.

201
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,920
Zheng Hui is good around the house.

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,960
He's helping me wash the beans.

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,880
Do you know how to do it?

204
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,520
I've never tried.

205
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,720
Right, Summer?

206
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,120
It just needs one of you to do the housework.

207
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,770
Tong Nian is lucky, she doesn't have to do it.

208
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,350
That's right.

209
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,720
Someone else will do it anyway.

210
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,570
Mrs. Tong, let me help you take it to the kitchen.

211
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,160
No, you don't have to do that.

212
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,280
You're our guest.

213
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,040
We can do it.

214
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,600
It's ok!

215
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,640
I want you to see me as family.

216
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,240
Have a seat here.

217
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Have a chat with her.

218
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's go.

219
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,400
Ok. Let me help you with this.

220
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,040
Ok.

221
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,240
Help yourself.

222
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,960
Ok.

223
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
Ok, let's talk.

224
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,800
Mom.

225
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,920
Mom.

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I...

227
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,400
What are you trying to say?

228
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,480
Mom. Did you know

229
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,720
Mr. Han is going back to Norway?

230
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,480
Going back?

231
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,800
He didn't tell me about that.

232
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,680
How did you find out?

233
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,000
Me?

234
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,480
I just...

235
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,840
Did Han Shangyan tell you?

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,680
No.

237
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,320
Why are you still in touch with him?

238
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
You're ridiculous!

239
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,200
Keep it down.

240
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,120
We're just friends.

241
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,440
I'm telling the truth.

242
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,320
That's not the point.

243
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,680
I mean...

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,160
Mr. Han is old.

245
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,970
It's not likely he'll be coming back after this trip.

246
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,320
I think you should see him off.

247
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,640
Don't you think?

248
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
See him off?

249
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,840
Is that really what you wanted to say?

250
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,720
Be honest with me.

251
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,960
I am being honest!

252
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,480
I don't think so.

253
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,960
I have an idea.

254
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,930
Why don't you see him this afternoon?

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
Why are you in such a hurry?

256
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,200
Is it really so important?

257
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm not in a hurry.

258
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,360
Not at all.

259
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,600
But Mr. Han is.

260
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,560
I mean, he's old.

261
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,160
Of course, he's in a hurry.

262
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,830
Mom. You have no idea how hard it is for him.

263
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,600
He hasn't even had a chance

264
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,150
to visit his hometown while he's been back.

265
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,200
No one had spare time.

266
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,560
He must want to know

267
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,760
how his hometown's changed.

268
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,480
Shall we...

269
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,660
take him there to take a look?

270
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,920
Suzhou?

271
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,880
Yes, Suzhou.

272
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,960
That's a good idea.

273
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,270
He used to live in the same village as your grandpa.

274
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,520
You see? It's destiny!

275
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,920
Fate's brought us together.

276
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,820
So we should take him to his hometown.

277
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,840
Fine by me.

278
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,690
But we need to get his permission first...

279
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,880
No problem!

280
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,240
I'll check with him.

281
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,000
Come back!

282
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,800
Listen.

283
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,120
Stay out of this.

284
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,960
I'll talk to him.

285
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Wash the beans for me.

286
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,280
Got it!

287
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,480
This weekend?

288
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,400
Alright. No problem.

289
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,520
Don't worry about it.

290
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,800
I'll arrange everything.

291
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,640
Yes, two cars.

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,360
Shangyan doesn't know the way?

293
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,650
No worries. We'll go in front.

294
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,160
Here, Tong Nian.

295
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,700
Leave it to us.  -Take this yogurt.

296
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,160
Come on.

297
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,960
What're you watching?

298
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,560
What are you so happy about?

299
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,410
This advert. Don't you think it's funny?

300
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,280
Is it?

301
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,000
It is!

302
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,920
How is it funny?

303
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,000
Of course it's funny!

304
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,440
I don't think so.

305
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,520
Look how happy you are.

306
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
What happened?

307
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,200
Grandpa,

308
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,040
I'll say hello to them.

309
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,160
Wait!

310
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,160
Their car is crowded.

311
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,400
Ask Tong Nian to sit with us.

312
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,840
Shangyan.

313
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,200
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

314
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,080
Good morning.

315
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,400
It's too squashed in your car.

316
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,470
Someone can come in our car.

317
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,800
No problem.

318
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,840
I'll go.

319
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,920
Dou Nan,

320
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,520
you can go in his car.

321
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,120
Alright.

322
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,040
Shangyan.

323
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
I guess you don't know Suzhou very well.

324
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,320
I don't. But we have GPS.

325
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,120
We won't need it.

326
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,910
Just follow us later.

327
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,360
OK.

328
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,560
Drive carefully. It's raining.

329
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:49,980
It's ok.

330
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,080
I've checked the weather forecast.

331
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,000
It's sunny in Suzhou

332
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,320
even though it's raining here.

333
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,680
Good.

334
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,280
Tong Nian.  -Drive slowly.

335
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,040
Get in the car.  -Let's go.

336
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,800
Hi, Mr. Han.

337
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,240
We misjudged Shangyan.

338
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,160
He's actually very polite.

339
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,520
Just drive.

340
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,040
Take your time.

341
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,240
I'll be here waiting.

342
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,540
You must be tired, right?

343
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,720
I'm ok.

344
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240
I'll get us some water.

345
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,880
Ok.

346
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,120
You can go first.

347
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,160
We'll walk slowly.

348
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,720
Alright.

349
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,480
Off you go.

350
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,440
The weather's strange.

351
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,720
The sun came out as soon as we left Shanghai.

352
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,600
However bad the weather was,

353
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,480
I had to go to my hometown.

354
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
We go back to where we belong.

355
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,640
When I pass away,

356
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,640
I'll have my grandson

357
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,800
to bring my ashes back.

358
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
Please help me find a tomb

359
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,160
close to your father-in-law.

360
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,760
Don't say that.

361
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,520
You're still so healthy.

362
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,760
Don't worry too much.

363
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,800
My days are numbered.

364
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,080
I'm ready.

365
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,840
I've got no problem talking about it.

366
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,600
You know what?

367
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,600
It's really hard for my grandson.

368
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
He lost his parents.

369
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,960
His step-mother married again.

370
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,760
He'll become an orphan,

371
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,560
if I die too.

372
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,160
Careful.

373
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,040
Tong Nian. You're back.

374
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,560
Here's the water.

375
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
And ice-cream.

376
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,160
We'll get in the car first.

377
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,000
Ok!

378
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,200
This is for you. It's warm.

379
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,560
You shouldn't drink cold water.

380
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
I made you some tea.

381
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,200
You can have it in the car.

382
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,200
You've never done this before.

383
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,480
I don't want to make you mad.

384
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,200
It's ok. I'll take the water.

385
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,000
Tong Nian bought it specially for me.

386
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:13,880
I'll just have this.

387
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,360
Ok.

388
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,880
Thanks.

389
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,760
You're welcome.

390
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,360
I bought this for you.

391
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,240
There you go.

392
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,960
Ice-cream.

393
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,680
What are you doing?

394
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,280
That isn't for you!

395
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,920
You can take it back!

396
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,760
You've taken a bite already!

397
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,240
I'm your cousin.

398
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,380
That doesn't mean I'll eat your leftovers.

399
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,360
You're such a nuisance.

400
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,240
Dou Nan. Come.

401
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,600
Mr. Han.

402
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,560
Come here.

403
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,840
It's too hot.

404
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,120
I need to wash my hands again.

405
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,160
I'll get you a towel in the car.

406
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,320
No, it's ok.

407
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,400
I'll go to the washroom.

408
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Can you come with me?

409
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,080
He's so annoying, don't you think?

410
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,080
But I got something else.

411
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,320
What would you like?

412
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,200
Nothing, thanks.

413
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,720
What've you been up to recently?

414
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
Busy taking on Su Cheng's job.

415
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,560
You must be exhausted.

416
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,690
You should find time to relax just like now.

417
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,000
Enjoy the sunshine.

418
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,640
Don't lock yourself up inside.

419
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,000
It's not good for you.

420
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,080
What if I get sunburned?

421
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Sunburned?

422
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,920
Then you'll become detective Bao Zheng.

423
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,680
Come closer.

424
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
Why?

425
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,020
Protect you from the sun.

426
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,160
♪ Our love is as sweet as it should be ♪

427
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,580

432
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,760
Mr. Han. Look!

433
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,460
The houses haven't changed at all after all these years.

434
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,310
Hello. Nice to meet you.

435
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,840
Welcome!

436
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,840
Nice to meet you.

437
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,400
I've missed you.

438
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,120
It's been such a long time.

439
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,920
You look healthy.

440
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,640
You too.

441
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,200
This is...

442
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,160
Hi Ma'am.

443
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Hello.  -Say hello.

444
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,880
Hello.

445
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,720
Welcome.

446
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,520
Let's go in.

447
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,160
Let's go.

448
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,640
You've all grown up.

449
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,080
You're so tall.

450
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,840
I barely recognized you.

451
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,720
How many children do you have?

452
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,400
Me?

453
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,030
She's my only child.  -Just one?

454
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,280
Here. This is my daughter. Tong Nian.

455
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,000
Hello.

456
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,320
She's a big girl now.

457
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,360
When you were a kid,

458
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,500
you always had a runny nose.

459
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,880
Not anymore. Not anymore.

460
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,240
Good.

461
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,840
Hey.

462
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,280
These are my children.

463
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
My daughter and my son.

464
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Hello.  -Hello.

465
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,440
Right. I remember you.

466
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,160
You were a naughty little one.

467
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,960
Every time I saw you,

468
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,600
I was worried!

469
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,280
This is my grandson.

470
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,280
Grandson?

471
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,800
Stand up and say hello.

472
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,520
Hello.

473
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,720
Sit down, sit down.

474
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,000
How old are you?

475
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,210
You look a bit older than the rest of them.

476
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,280
Yes. He's almost 30.

477
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,760
30?

478
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,680
Do you have a family now?

479
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
No, he doesn't.

480
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,440
He's not married yet.

481
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,520
They're only 25, but they all had children.

482
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,840
Right.

483
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,640
The youngest got married 2 years ago.

484
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,780
He's even older.

485
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,200
You're not young anymore.

486
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,000
It's time to get married.

487
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,400
Your grandpa must be worried.

488
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,320
Are you divorced?

489
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,920
Come on now.

490
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,520
You've asked too many questions.

491
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,990
Young people nowadays have their own plans.

492
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm worried about him.

493
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,400
You must be worried.

494
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,000
Of course, I am.

495
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,120
You see? I'm worried too.

496
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,760
Take your time.

497
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,680
I'll go and see if I can help with anything.

498
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll go with him.

499
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,480
Where are you going?

500
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,960
I'm gonna check if I can help with anything.

501
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,240
He can't do all the work.

502
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,760
I'll go too.

503
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,840
Mom. I'm gonna join them.

504
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,720
You can't go.

505
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,520
You've got to stay here.

506
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
Have a chat with your elders.

507
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,459
What's this?

508
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,960
Sweet rice balls.

509
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,760
Look.

510
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,200
Do you need any help?

511
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,520
No, thanks.

512
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,640
You guys can just go for a walk.

513
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,040
Are you sure?

514
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,880
Yeah, I'm sure.

515
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,920
Something smells good.

516
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,080
Sweet rice balls.

517
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,360
Don't touch it. It's hot.

518
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,880
When are we having lunch?

519
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,160
Very soon.

520
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,800
You're a good cook.

521
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,320
Am I?

522
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,360
Have you been here before?

523
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,800
When I was very little.

524
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,350
But I can't remember it very well.

525
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,320
If my mom hadn't told me,

526
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,320
I wouldn't have known

527
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,540
we were from the same town.

528
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
What're you trying to say?

529
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,120
It's destiny?

530
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,360
Destiny has brought us together.

531
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,230
Do you know what I think?

532
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:03,840
What?

533
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,040
Some things are destined to happen,

534
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,360
despite a few false starts.

535
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,000
That's interesting.

536
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,760
That could be true.

537
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Let's have a look over there.

538
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,800
Do you play Chinese chess, young man?

539
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,640
A bit.

540
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,960
Let's play.

541
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,120
Join us.

542
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,160
Come on, join us.

543
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,040
Come on.

544
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,000
Young man, are you ready?

545
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,160
I'll try.

546
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,760
If you win,

547
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,760
you can take anything you want.

548
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,440
Sounds good!

549
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,000
Come on.

550
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,400
Cannon!

551
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,080
Chariot.

552
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,600
Good.

553
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
We're not finished.

554
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,920
I didn't know you could play chess.

555
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,280
I have lots of hidden talents.

556
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,640
You're a smart boy.

557
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,960
Of course, he is.

558
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I got your cannon.

559
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,440
Your King's in danger.

560
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,000
Use your horse to beat his cannon.

561
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,360
Why not come and play with him?

562
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,120
I quit! I'm done.

563
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,200
I quit!

564
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,360
Look at you!

565
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,200
You should keep your word.

566
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,240
Of course, I will.

567
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
Take whatever you want.

568
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,680
It's on the house.

569
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,520
What would you like?

570
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,760
The one on the top shelf.

571
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,400
This one?

572
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,200
No.

573
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,720
On the left.

574
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,530
I'll take this one.

575
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,600
Take a few more.

576
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
I don't mind.

577
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,240
It's ok. That's enough.

578
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,160
Let's play another round.

579
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,240
Alright.

580
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,320
I've been playing chess for 40 years.

581
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,440
I can't believe I lost to you.

582
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,360
Come on.

583
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,320
Han Shangyan. Have some juice.

584
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,000
Who you taking photos of?

585
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,320
Why are you taking photos of me?

586
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,720
I want to get a shot of your winning pose.

587
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,400
Get some more juice.

588
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,720
It's good for you.

589
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,850
Beat him, so you can have more juice.

590
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,560
Ok.

591
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,560
Beat him!

592
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,440
It's not possible.

593
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,880
What were you taking photos of?

594
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,880
It's a secret.

595
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,160
Let me have a look.

596
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,800
What's this?

597
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,840
I look so ugly.

598
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,840
Have a look at the bottle.

599
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,130
= Boyfriend =

600
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,050
Listen. A kid is playing guitar.

601
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,280
He plays so well.

602
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,840
Guys who play guitar are so cool.

603
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,730

609
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,680
What did you say to that boy?

610
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,240
How did you get his guitar?

611
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,280
I gave him 20 yuan.

612
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,020
So he could buy himself some noodles.

613
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,560
So you can play Chinese chess,

614
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,080
and guitar as well.

615
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,540
I learned it from one of my subs.

616
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,020
His hometown is just like this place.

617
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,310
I went there over 10 years ago.

618
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,000
I went to do some fishing with him.

619
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,200
How many subs did you have?

620
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,240
3.

621
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,520
One left the team.

622
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,320
Then, we had 2.

623
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,430
Did they have a chance to play?

624
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,400
Not really.

625
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,789
We always wanted to start another team

626
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,360
for them when they got better.

627
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
I didn't know

628
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,000
we had disbanded before that.

629
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,760
Where did they go after that?

630
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,120
I've no idea.

631
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,800
You must miss them a lot.

632
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680

651
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
We'd better get back.

652
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,440
We've been out here for ages.

653
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,160
You go ahead.

654
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,080
I'll be back later.

655
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,960
Why?

656
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,720
I'm afraid...

657
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,360
they'll take the wrong idea.

658
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,880
Besides,

659
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,280
I need to return the guitar.

660
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,240
Alright. Don't be too late.

661
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,600
Have a taste!

662
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,130
This is a local specialty.

663
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,000
My granddaughter made it.

664
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,600
My granddaughter.

665
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,930
She's a great cook.  -Hope you like it.

666
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,280
It tastes nice.

667
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,560
I'm back!

668
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,240
I'm back.

669
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,280
What happened?

670
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,600
Where have you been?

671
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,560
I went to the public washrooms.

672
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,600
Washrooms?

673
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,560
For a whole afternoon?

674
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,630
No. I walked around as well.

675
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,680
You probably didn't notice me.

676
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,480
You kept all of us waiting.

677
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,160
Alright.

678
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,720
This is for you.

679
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,160
I thought you two had secretly escaped.

680
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,760
Shut up.

681
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,520
This is good too.

682
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,480
Here. Have a taste.

683
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,160
Where's Shangyan?

684
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,720
I've no idea.

685
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,720
Don't worry about him.

686
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,240
He likes to wander around.

687
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,280
Let's just start.

688
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,640
We can't be back too late.

689
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,520
Don't wait for him.

690
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,120
He's 30.

691
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,870
He shouldn't be drifting about.

692
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,000
Don't worry about him.

693
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,680
Ok, ok, let's eat.

694
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,320
It's good.

695
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,240
Really?

696
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,380
Dig in.

697
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,600
It's good.

698
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,240
I'm sorry.

699
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,080
I had some work stuff to deal with.

700
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,400
Where have you been?

701
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,240
How old are you?

702
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,260
How could you keep us waiting like that?

703
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,080
Have a seat.

704
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,160
It's ok.

705
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,480
Don't get angry while we're eating.

706
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,160
Come on.

707
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,560
It's alright.

708
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,400
Don't blame him.

709
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,440
There was a boy in the village

710
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,760
who plays fantastic guitar.

711
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,720
I got lost in the music.

712
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
That's why I'm late.

713
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,760
Really?

714
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,680
Have you heard him?

715
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,360
People here are full of surprises.

716
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,680
Yes.

717
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,350
I'll get some chopsticks.

718
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,800
Try this one.

719
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,560
It's good!

720
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,960
-I'm glad you like it.  -It's delicious.

721
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,200
It's been a long day.

722
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Get some rest.

723
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,430
Press that button if you need to call me.

724
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,760
I don't want to sleep yet.

725
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,600
Let's talk for a while.

726
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,840
It's already 10 o'clock.

727
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,480
Right. It's late.

728
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,960
Why do you still need to work?

729
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Come on now!

730
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,840
Why are you sitting over there?

731
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,800
Is this a test?

732
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,000
Come here and sit on the bed.

733
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,190
I still have work to do.

734
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
And a lot of it is with international organizations.

735
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,920
So there's a time difference.

736
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,120
That's what I want to talk about.

737
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,960
You can't stay up late all the time.

738
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,120
You can't stay working like this every night.

739
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,440
You're right.

740
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,480
If you're in Norway,

741
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,280
I can still take care of you.

742
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,920
But you are on your own here.

743
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,440
Right.

744
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,920
And also,

745
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,440
let me know if you need any money.

746
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,440
Thanks, but I don't.

747
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,670
If you don't mind leaving your friends in Norway,

748
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,960
you could come back to China.

749
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,400
Back to China?

750
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,000
We'll argue all day long if I come back.

751
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,250
And that'll drive both of us crazy.

752
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,560
Don't laugh.

753
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,760
Get some sleep. Goodnight.

754
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,320
Get plenty of Vitamin C.

755
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,000
Got it.

756
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,640
Drink lots of water.

757
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,320
Ok.

758
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,480
Is grandpa asleep?

759
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,760
Of course. It's late.

760
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,400
When he's back in Norway,

761
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,480
don't talk too much about me.

762
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,920
I don't want him to worry.

763
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,000
And you,

764
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,360
come back in 3 days for training.

765
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,400
Enough about me.

766
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,080
Where are you going so late?

767
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,160
Su Cheng is going back to Norway.

768
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,140
No one is gonna be taking care of the kids.

769
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,400
I've got to go and take care of them.

770
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,160
Still awake?

771
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,390
I left something in your bag.

772
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,830
Bring it to me someday.

773
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,240
Isn't he like our cat?

774
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,520
Our Little Squid.

775
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,560
I don't think so.

776
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,520
Squid. Little Squid.

777
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,880
Are all the bags here?

778
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,880
Wu Bai.

779
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,040
You've got to

780
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,520
help your brother out.

781
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,960
Do you think I was too strict with him?

782
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,360
A bit.

783
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

784
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,520
I just wanted to focus on trying to support him.

785
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,320
Makes sense.

786
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,800
Let's go.

787
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,840
Let's go.

788
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,610
Are you expecting me to leave earlier?

789
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,840
That's not what I mean.

790
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,880
Go on then!

791
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,920
Make me some of that tea Tong Nian bought for me.

792
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,280
Where is it?

793
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,840
It's on the shelf.

794
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,480
In a green jar.

795
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,280
Wu Bai. Come and sit with me.

796
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,000
Don't want to leave?

797
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,520
It's not the place I'll miss,

798
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,640
it's the people.

799
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,640
What?

800
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,400
Are you trying to make me cry?

801
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,560
Have you ever cried?

802
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,960
Come and sit closer.

803
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,000
Will you get married

804
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,600
next year?

805
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,000
Of course not.

806
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
She's still young.

807
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,760
I'm leaving China.

808
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,160
Just be honest with me.

809
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,360
Do you want to marry her?

810
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,040
I do.

811
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,680
I do. Don't worry.

812
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,400
I've met a lot of people

813
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,640
over the years.

814
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,640
I'm pretty sure

815
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,830
Tong Nian is the one for you.

816
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,040
I know.

817
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,080
Wu Bai, won't you come?

818
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,320
No. I'll just wait here.

819
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,600
I need to check the flights.

820
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,040
Careful. Let me help you.

821
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,600
I'm in a hurry.

822
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,240
I told you

823
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,440
not to drink too much water.

824
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,870
There aren't too many washrooms on the way.

825
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,720
And look at yourself.

826
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,540
You drank a pot of tea before you left.

827
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,640
Get lost.

828
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,960
You'll know when you reach my age.

829
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,120
It's ok. Don't come with me.

830
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,080
Just wait here.

831
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Are you sure?

832
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,280
Don't worry.

833
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Be careful in there.

834
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,520
Call if you need me.

835
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,160
Hi, Su Cheng.

836
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm afraid I'll be late.

837
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,790
I need to take my grandpa to the airport.

838
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,680
Yes. He's going back to Norway.

839
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,280
Alright. See you later.

840
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,520
I want to see Mr. Han off.

841
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,800
But I have to supervise a test today.

842
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,560
You promised

843
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
you'd take me to visit him in Norway.

844
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,120
I was about to invite you

845
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,480
to come with me this summer.

846
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,200
Grandpa!

847
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,440
Grandpa!

848
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,960
Grandpa!

849
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,520
Grandpa!

850
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,000
Grandpa!

851
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,320
I'm here.

852
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,800
Grandpa.

853
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,540
Grandpa.

854
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,880
Grandpa. What happened?

855
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,200
Are you ok? Why are you sitting here?

856
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,080
It's just old-age.

857
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I just took some pills this morning.

858
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,280
So don't worry about me.

859
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,440
Of course, I'm worried.

860
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,120
I just feel upset

861
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,100
leaving you here alone.

862
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,400
Alright. As long as it's not a new problem.

863
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,980
I know you're trying to hide your pain from me.

864
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,980
But you have angina, don't you?

865
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,360
I'll take care of myself.

866
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,210
I'll book you in for a physical.

867
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,830
And try not to get yourself worked up.

868
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,720
Aren't you the same?

869
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,600
You're all by yourself here.

870
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,690
You never told me anything about your life.

871
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:00,780
Alright.

872
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,280
I think we're very much alike.

873
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,880
Both bad-tempered.

874
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,200
You'd be more worried if I told you.

875
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,450
We don't want you to fly too much.

876
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,040
I miss you and Wu Bai.

877
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,360
It's ok for me to fly back.

878
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,520
You know nothing.

879
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,640
You're old.

880
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,720
You can't keep losing your temper.

881
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,760
We're worried about you.

882
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,990
We both want you to be healthy.

883
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,720
You should know,

884
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,200
I'm old.

885
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,820
I don't have much time left to spend with you.

886
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,840
So...

887
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,560
I've got to seize every opportunity.

888
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,120
You'll live a long and happy life.
