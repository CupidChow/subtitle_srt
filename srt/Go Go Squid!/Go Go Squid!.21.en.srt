00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,130
You know, I met that male classmate before.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,880
He is nice and diligent.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,320
I heard that he's studying for his doctorate.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,720
My brother and his wife like him very much.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
They said his future looks very bright.

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,990
And he really has great potential.

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,120
No, no, no.

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480
You're saying,

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Tong Nian is in a relationship with her classmate?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

36
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,680
Wait, wait. Impossible.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,460
She's in a relationship with my grandson.

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,960
Oh no, you don't know?

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Know about what?

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,880
Me and my big mouth.

41
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,440
Maybe they didn't want to worry you.

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,400
So they didn't tell you.

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,610
What? Tell me, hurry tell me.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,840
Tong Nian and Shangyan broke up.

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,160
Broke up?

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,840
I didn't ask too much about their relationship.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,680
My sister-in-law made me promise

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,120
not to say anything.

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,640
But I'm such a blabber mouth.

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
I blew the secret.

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,160
No. No. It can't be.

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,240
A few days ago,

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
Tong Nian came here to chat with me.

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,920
They didn't think they were a match.

55
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,320
But they are still good friends.

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,560
No, no, no.

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,240
I can see that Tong Nian

58
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,400
still cares for my grandson.

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,600
Mr. Han,

60
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,470
I came here just to tell you

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
to let Shangyan take it easy.

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,380
There are women everywhere. Right?

63
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,920
He will find the right girl one day.

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,200
Don't you think so?

65
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,960
Wh... Wh... What?

66
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,160
What's the fuss?

67
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,360
What... What's this about?

68
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,000
So this is what...

69
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,240
Tong Nian gave you?

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,640
What do you want me for?

71
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,520
The schedule is here.

72
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,680
The cat is so cute.

73
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,040
He's so soft when you hold him boss.

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,880
She knows you like to be alone,

75
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,440
so she gave you a cat.

76
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,720
So sweet.

77
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,440
Boss,

78
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,440
you should spend more time with her. Seriously.

79
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,680
A girl needs company, you know?

80
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,440
We can do the training ourselves.

81
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,520
We'll be OK without you here.

82
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,520
You don't have to watch over us.

83
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,120
Are you finished there?

84
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,580
It's my cat. Give him.

85
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,800
Here you are.

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
I'll just go then, boss.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,620
Did you know what Tong Nian got the boss?

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
What?

89
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,160
What is he talking about?

90
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,240
What did he say? I didn't hear a word.

91
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,840
Chill out.

92
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,650
Do you know what Tong Nian gave the boss?

93
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,200
What?

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,640
Don't make us guess. Just tell us.

95
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,600
Stop trying to be mysterious.

96
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,440
A cat.

97
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
What?  -A cat?

98
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,610
Alright. Let's make a bet.

99
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,080
How many days can he keep the cat?

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
I'd say one week.

101
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,480
I bet the ebook reader

102
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,080
I bought a few days ago.

103
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,640
That's expensive.

104
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,280
Mrs. Zhou,

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
who bought so many things?

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,040
Shangyan did.

107
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,240
They were delivered here just now.

108
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,080
What? Our boss bought them?

109
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,810
He said he's taking this and the cat home.

110
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,680
He's going to the HQ for a week.

111
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,680
He's worried nobody will care for the cat.

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,880
Wow he's quite serious.

113
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,720
What are you looking at?

114
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,120
Boss, it's so cute.

115
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,240
Who are you talking about?

116
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,520
Me or the cat?

117
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,440
The cat.  -You are.

118
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,160
Both. Both.

119
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,320
Is Mrs. Zhou here?

120
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,460
Tell her I'm looking for her.

121
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,340
OK.

122
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,660
Why are you still here?

123
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,940
OK.

124
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Mrs. Zhou, I'm going abroad for a week.

125
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,560
No time to seal the window.

126
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,040
Pay careful attention.

127
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,440
Keep the doors and windows closed.

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,720
Unlike dogs, cats will jump out of the window.

129
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,420
OK.

130
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,720
Here are all the cat food and toys.

131
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,420
OK.

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,710
Are you going to spend your whole life

133
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,300
showing me how you waste your time?

134
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,960
Playing computer was not enough.

135
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,080
So now you got a cat?

136
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,440
That's it.

137
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,190
If you have problems, just call me.

138
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,830
And I have left the phone numbers

139
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,320
of the pet store and the veterinarian here.

140
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,640
You can contact them any time you want.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Hey, I'm talking to you.

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,960
Are you listening to me?

143
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,160
And my grandpa,

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,400
please help look after him.

145
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,680
Don't worry.

146
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,800
I'll take good care of your grandpa.

147
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,800
Then I'll get to know the cat for now.

148
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,720
I've never had a pet before.

149
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,580
Easy now.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm going abroad for a week.

151
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,800
So I brought the cat here.

152
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,900
When I get back, I'll take him away.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
Come with me to Tong Nian's place.

154
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,640
Now?

155
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,040
Now.

156
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,040
She is at school, not at home.

157
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,560
She is at home for this whole week.

158
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,600
I know everything between you two.

159
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,600
I seriously doubt that.

160
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,760
Why you...

161
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,130
have you no guilt when a girl like that cries for you?

162
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,720
Fine. Fine. Fine.

163
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
I'll stay out of it.

164
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,760
You deserve to be alone.

165
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,280
Don't hurt anyone else.

166
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,600
Hey. Let's go.

167
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,200
You want to make me mad again?

168
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
You said I deserve to be alone.

169
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,680
Why should I go?

170
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,240
Am I wrong?

171
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Who can stand being around you?

172
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,840
You don't even have friends,

173
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,680
let alone a girlfriend.

174
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,560
What's so funny?

175
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,040
I think you are right.

176
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,230
I deserve to be alone.

177
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,610
Let's go. Seriously.

178
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,330
I'll meet Tong Nian's mom at eight this evening.

179
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
It doesn't matter if you don't come.

180
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,240
But you have to take me there.

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,360
Let's go.

182
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,720
Wait for a second.

183
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,000
I need to talk to you.

184
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,920
Can the two of us

185
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,320
stop fighting for once?

186
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,800
We've fought for years.

187
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,320
Even I'm tired of it.

188
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,160
Is there any way you could let me worry less?

189
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,000
Since your step-mother got married,

190
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,080
in our Han family,

191
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,080
we are the only ones left.

192
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't want to fight either.

193
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,040
I mean, every time you scold me,

194
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,000
I do as you tell me to.

195
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,960
Tong Nian is a good girl.

196
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,240
You shouldn't let her go.

197
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,800
When your mom checks into the hospital,

198
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,360
I'll feel relieved.

199
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,890
After that, we wait for the operation.

200
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,960
Thanks.  -Thank you.

201
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,200
You are welcome.

202
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,650
Considering your mother's condition,

203
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,400
we should do the operation early.

204
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,592
We arrange the operations

205
00:10:23,593 --> 00:10:25,050
based on the patients' conditions.

206
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,870
The operation your mother needs is a very big one.

207
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,000
You should stay with your mother

208
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
and look after her.

209
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,360
The only thing I worry about

210
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,920
is if you only look after your mother,

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
will it

212
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
affect your school work?

213
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,400
Mr. Tong, don't worry.

214
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm admitted to the doctorate program.

215
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,560
Even if I miss a few days,

216
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,880
I can make it up later.

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
That's good, very good.

218
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Mom, don't worry.

219
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,720
OK.

220
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
Mr. Han!

221
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,330
I hurried as fast as I could to get here when you would.

222
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,440
And I made it just in time.

223
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,840
You came home so late.

224
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,160
I had some work to do.

225
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,360
Come inside.

226
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,240
Say hello.

227
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
Hello, Mrs. Tong.

228
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,560
Mr. Han, come on.

229
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
Mr. Han, please come in.

230
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,680
Honey, honey.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
Mr. Han is here.

232
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,320
Mr. Han, hello.

233
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,000
Hi.

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,900
Mr. Han, come inside.

235
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,020
OK. OK.

236
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,220
Come inside, come inside.

237
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,980
Let me take that.

238
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,120
Shangyan,

239
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,840
can I talk to you for a sec?

240
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Tong Nian.

241
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,240
Mr. Han.

242
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,560
What brings you here?

243
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm here to see you.

244
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,040
Sit, Mr. Han.

245
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,800
Alright alright.

246
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,320
-Slowly.  -OK. OK.

247
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,200
Playing computer?

248
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,760
No, I'm editing a program.

249
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,400
Good. Good girl.

250
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,720
Hello.

251
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,120
Hello.

252
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,280
Who is this?

253
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,320
This is Zheng Hui.

254
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,080
He's an upperclassman of Tong Nian's.

255
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,160
When he was in his junior year,

256
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
he was approved to begin his PhD.

257
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,880
He is thoughtful as well.

258
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,860
-Nice to meet you.  -You, too.

259
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,400
Who is this?

260
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,160
This is his mom.

261
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,480
Hello. Hello.

262
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,440
Have a seat, please.

263
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,910
We are all guests anyway.

264
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,880
Get Mr. Han some tea.

265
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,920
What's your name?

266
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm Zheng Hui, Mr. Han.

267
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,080
I'm Tong Nian's schoolmate,

268
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm her upperclassman.

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm going to do my PhD.

270
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,870
Last year, Tong Nian and I represented our college

271
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,990
to participate in the ACM competition,

272
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,120
an international competition,

273
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
and we won the second place.

274
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,360
OK. OK.

275
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Do you often come here?

276
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,680
Tong Nian and I are friends.

277
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,380
We often have meals together,

278
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,400
drinks and stuff,

279
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,000
and go home together after school sometimes.

280
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
Why do you come here today?

281
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
My mother fell ill.

282
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,200
So I... I was asking Mr. Tong for help.

283
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,080
We are thankful to Mr. Tong.

284
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Next time she can come here herself.

285
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,720
You don't need to be with her.

286
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,640
Right. Right.

287
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,920
His mother is getting old.

288
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,160
He is a good kid.

289
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,280
Where is Tong Nian?

290
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,920
Let me check on her.

291
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,560
What's taking her so long?

292
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,280
Tong Nian.

293
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,480
Have some fruit, Mr. Han.

294
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,380
No, thank you. I don't like fruits.

295
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,250
Mr. Han, it's okay. Don't treat me like a guest.

296
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,480
Are we really that close?

297
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,560
I mean we only just met one another.

298
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,520
As a mother,

299
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,120
I always hoped that

300
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,000
my daughter would have a boyfriend

301
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,000
who is close to her in age and interests.

302
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,880
This way,

303
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,460
they can get along, right?

304
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,200
I am not one to dwell on the past.

305
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,440
But Shangyan,

306
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,040
you should put yourself in my shoes.

307
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,680
I guess whoever knows what you've been through,

308
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,290
wouldn't want their daughter to be with you.

309
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,360
Mrs. Tong,

310
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,800
I have nothing to say

311
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,720
about what happened with me in the past.

312
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,760
It's all my fault.

313
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,520
Also,

314
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,960
you are much older than Tong Nian.

315
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,480
If you two were together,

316
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,720
what do you have in common?

317
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,470
And what Tong Nian is learning is called the uh...

318
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,080
the Neural Network,

319
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,840
do you understand it?

320
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,280
I don't understand

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,080
Tong Nian's major.

322
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,240
But she did tell me something.

323
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,760
So I respect everything

324
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,600
that she is doing.

325
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,200
What about what you do?

326
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,960
You mean,

327
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,000
my club?

328
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,440
Yes.

329
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,880
I'm an outsider to you.

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,430
I can't tell you what you should and shouldn't do.

331
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,920
I can only tell you how I feel,

332
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,360
and I don't like what you do.

333
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,680
What? Does that upset you?

334
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,080
No.

335
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm used to it.

336
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,750
I never expected an outsider to understand me.

337
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,360
I never expected it

338
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,400
and will never expect it.

339
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,400
Now you listen to me,

340
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Tong Nian is a simple girl.

341
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,400
She doesn't know much about relationships.

342
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,720
But you are different.

343
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,670
You have been working for so long.

344
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,550
You have your own way for everything that you do.

345
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,080
And to be honest,

346
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,240
I don't like your way of life.

347
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,840
You really think I wouldn't mind

348
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,090
how you treated my daughter on New Year's Eve?

349
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,080
Alright,

350
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,050
I don't want to be so hard on you.

351
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,800
You two have broken up, right?

352
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,520
Just before Tong Nian's birthday, is that correct?

353
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,040
She cried so hard.

354
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,080
Anyways.

355
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,200
What's happened has happened,

356
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,670
I just hope that you'll cater to her soft nature

357
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,000
and stop contacting her.

358
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,000
I am her mother.

359
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,310
I know her very well.

360
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,480
You must be the one to end all of this.

361
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,480
Do you understand?

362
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,310
I understand

363
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,840
what you're saying.

364
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,600
I'm not a good talker.

365
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,640
If I said something wrong,

366
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,440
then, please forgive me

367
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,840
as I am an old woman who can't help herself.

368
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,340
And for my sake, as a poor old woman,

369
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,000
please leave Tong Nian alone, OK?

370
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,320
OK.

371
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,520
I promise.

372
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,320
Since you promised,

373
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,840
I'll trust you on this.

374
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,200
Would you like to come in?

375
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,880
No, thanks.

376
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,400
I'll drive around the block.

377
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,400
Would you mind giving me a call

378
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,880
when my grandpa wants to leave?

379
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,920
OK. I'll go inside then.

380
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,840
Shangyan,

381
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,720
Can I

382
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,960
really trust you?

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,600
Mrs. Tong,

384
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,760
do you think I'm really that unreliable?

385
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,480
I'll say it again,

386
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,440
I promise you.

387
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,200
I won't bother her again.

388
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
I won't try to contact her,

389
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,490
or make her think that we have a chance.

390
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,080
Tong Nian is a simple girl.

391
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
She doesn't know much about relationships.

392
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,680
But you are different.

393
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,710
You have been working for so long.

394
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,080
And to be honest,

395
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,400
I don't like your way of life.

396
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,000
You really think I wouldn't mind

397
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,350
how you treated my daughter on New Year's Eve?

398
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,430
Have you no guilt when a girl like that cries for you?

399
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,520
I'll stay out of it.

400
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,400
You deserve to be alone.

401
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,200
Mr. Han, try this.

402
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,570
This is Earl Grey Tea. I just bought it.

403
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,400
You know it tastes good

404
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,880
so you bought it for your parents, right?

405
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,760
Not exactly.

406
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,080
My mother likes tea.

407
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,800
So wherever I go, I buy tea for her.

408
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,040
You know I also like tea.

409
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,600
Next time you can buy some for me.

410
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,950
OK. What ever you like,

411
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,240
I'll buy it for you.

412
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,040
-Really?  - Yeah.

413
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,840
Mr. Han.

414
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,520
Where is Han Shangyan?

415
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,280
-Han Shangyan? He's here, too?  -Yeah.

416
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,660
Tong Nian. I am talking to Mr. Han.

417
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,600
Don't interrupt.

418
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,810
Well, he said he's not coming in.

419
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,000
He's waiting outside.

420
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
I think he would get bored hearing us old people prattle on.

421
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,600
Where are you going?

422
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,120
I'm going to find him.

423
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,640
It's not polite to ask the guest to wait outside.

424
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,800
I'll go find him.

425
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,180
The subscriber you dialed is out of service.

426
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,800

Almost ten years.

436
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,160
Louis, let me ask you.

437
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,880
You have been a bartender for ten years.

438
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,040
Have you ever wanted to leave

439
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,740

441
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,440
More remarkable?

442
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,500
Right.

443
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,460
Being a bartender requires a lot of skill.

444
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Try this one.

445
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,960
What's this?

446
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Besheen Liquor.

447
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,000
Tea and liquor?

448
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,720
A mixture of liquor and tea.

449
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,230
Well? I understand, but you don't.

450
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,800

451

452

No.

458
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,080
It's a spare one.

459
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,640
You are so cunning.

460
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,320
Where are you?

461
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,680

00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,730
We got qualified in advance in the group match.

liquor is not a good thing.

Just this once, it's OK.

474
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,810
I've been here for months and didn't get to come.

475
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,390
Do you remember where we used to sit?

476
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,000
We had no money then.

477
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,670
Then Ou Qiang found a lady's night.

487
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,440
No. I drove here.

488
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,880
Where did you park?

489
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,240

490
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,650

00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,640
she always told me it would be OK.

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,960
But there is one thing I really regret.

512
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,480
That's retirement.

513
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,400
At that time, my age, energy,

514
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,040
skills, were all top ranked.

515
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,640
But because of impulse,

516
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,080
all were ruined.

517
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,240
Shaofei,

518
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,360
your words

519
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,280
are a dagger in my heart. You know that?

520
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,800
You're the only person I can tell.

521
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,560
Only you can understand me.

522
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Han Shangyan,

523
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,040
I feel sorry for you, you know that?

524
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,680
You had such a bad temper.

525
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,320
Why retire?

526
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
You were one of the best in the whole country.

527
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,120
Yet you retired.

528
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,210
Did you know there were so many people

529
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,150
that supported you when you were nothing

530
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,760
and kept supporting you until you were on top?

531
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,230
You hurt all of them, you know that?

532
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:48,960
I know.

533
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,370
You and I thought it was cool to retire. Right?

534
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
To quit when we were on top.

535
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,960
It's like a legend.

536
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,440
That's not cool.

537
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,240
You ruined your future.

538
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,480
Sometimes I wonder

539
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,490
what's the point of coming back to Shanghai?

540
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,560
Was it right for me to come back?

541
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,120
What are you saying?

542
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,920
I just wanted to say I shouldn't force myself.

543
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm not fit to compete.

544
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,480
My time is over and done.

545
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,680
Tong Nian, why are you standing here?

546
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,760
Waiting for a friend.

547
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,560
It's cold. Get back inside.

548
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,120
OK.

549
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,290
-See you later.  -Bye.

550
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,800
Tong Nian.

551
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,720
Mom.

552
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,640
Didn't you say Han Shangyan was right outside?

553
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,840
He was here just now.

554
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,200
Tong Nian.

555
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,360
So many guests are here.

556
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,640
Don't keep them waiting.

557
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,480
Come back inside.

558
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,240
Shangyan.

559
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,520
What are you doing here?

560
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,160
Shaofei,

561
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,500
why didn't you tell me about this?

562
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,240
Come on. Drink. Drink. Drink.

563
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,040
Come on.

564
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Excuse me, one more glass.

565
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,360
OK.

566
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,080
Guys, what's up?

567
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,840
Are you not happy to see me?

568
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,000
Say something.

569
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,600
Emotional issues.

570
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,960
Since when do you have emotional issues?

571
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,960
You?

572
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,640
Looking like this you have emotional issues?

573
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,200
Really?

574
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,920
You two chat. I'll see you later.

575
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,800
You leave just when I get here?

576
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,640
She is wandering outside. I'm a little worried.

577
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,080
Wait, who is she?

578
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,400
Who is she?

579
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,280
Ask him.

580
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,440
Come on, cheers!

581
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,600
Hi there.

582
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,680
Mr. Han.

583
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,090
I think this Zheng Hui seems like a great guy.

584
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,760
Indeed he is.

585
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,990
And he took good care of Tong Nian.

586
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,550
You're kidding. He is so young.

587
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,600
He's still a kid.

588
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,920
How can he take care of others?

589
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,150
Just now I saw you were chatting with Shangyan.

590
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,480
I hope he didn't upset you.

591
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:22,940
No.

592
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,890
My grandson is not a good speaker.

593
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,720
He doesn't know how to please his elders.

594
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,960
But he is a good man.

595
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,040
Mr. Han, you see.

596
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,520
Shangyan is your grandson.

597
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,680
So I can't say too much about him, right?

598
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:44,960
Yes, right.

599
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,080
I've been trying to learn about the competition he does.

600
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,680
It's really difficult.

601
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,800
Not everyone can do this job.

602
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I just hope

603
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,120
you can give him another chance.

604
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,400
Start over again.

605
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,920
I really like Tong Nian.

606
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,620
And I believe Shangyan'll treat her well.

607
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,560
Mr. Han, please don't try to persuade me.

608
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,320
I think we should,

609
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,950
let them decide for themselves.

610
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,520
So let's stay out of it. OK?

611
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,240
Go and have some tea.

612
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,680
Just what the heck are you doing?

613
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,680
It's dangerous.

614
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
Why are you avoiding me?

615
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,710
Everyone is inside. Won't you go in?

616
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,560
Or did something happen at the club

617
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,720
that upset you?

618
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,000
Nothing of the sort.

619
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,520
Is it because of Zheng Hui and his mom?

620
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,280
Who is Zheng Hui?

621
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,720
The boy you met at our campus last time.

622
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,080
He's a stranger to me.

623
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,670
Why should I remember him?

624
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,600
You may not remember him,

625
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,600
but I need to tell you something.

626
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,120
Zheng Hui is in a single-parent family.

627
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,520
His mother is ill.

628
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,000
But they don't have money.

629
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,230
So I asked my dad to treat her.

630
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,120
He brought his mother to Shanghai.

631
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,800
He's living at our place because

632
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,240
the hospital is full.

633
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,560
So she can't stay there.

634
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,640
But there will be one tomorrow.

635
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,320
Tomorrow they will leave, and won't be back.

636
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,480
I'm done.

637
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,520
Did you hear me?

638
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,160
How is the cat I got you?

639
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,240
Is he good?

640
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,480
It almost bit me.

641
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,640
If he did, I'd have to get vaccinated.

642
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,680
Why are you always a problem?

643
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,120
Sorry.

644
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,600
How about you give it back to me?

645
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,540
I'll raise it for you.

646
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,120
I gave him away.

647
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,720
To whom?

648
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,240
Our maid.

649
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,370
Why did you give it to your maid?

650
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,680
Because I don't like it.

651
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,800
You always bring me trouble. So annoying.

652
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,120
Got it?

653
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,040
When I first gave him to you,

654
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,960
you didn't say you didn't like him.

655
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,600
He was a lively cat.

656
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,680
I gave him to you.

657
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,240
But you gave him away.

658
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,160
What if they treat him badly?

659
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,560
You could,

660
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,360
ask,

661
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,320
to get him back.

662
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,480
I'll raise it.

663
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,760
Go home.

664
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,720
What do you like?

665
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,520
How about, I code you a computer game

666
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,200
as my formal apology?

667
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,960
I'd like to be alone.

668
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,560
I'm not in the mood to talk.

669
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,160
Go back.

670
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,000
Then I won't disturb you now.

671
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,800
What's up?

672
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,160
Why are you so upset?

673
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,880
Just now,

674
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,080
I spoke to Shangyan

675
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,320
downstairs for some time.

676
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,040
As I thought.

677
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,840
You know,

678
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,080
I have been teacher for years.

679
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,360
But I've never criticized somebody like that before.

680
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,800
You are the headmaster of a kindergarten.

681
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,720
Everyday you talk with children.

682
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,440
How can you really criticize anyone?

683
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,100
However, I just think Shangyan and our daughter

684
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,040
are not a good match at all.

685
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,100
You see. It's everything,

686
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,320
his degree,

687
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,040
his age,

688
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,480
or his past,

689
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,840
or his temper,

690
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,240
they just don't match each other.

691
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,640
What? Don't agree with me?

692
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,800
I do!

693
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,160
Why wouldn't I agree?

694
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,440
In this aspect,

695
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,920
I'll agree with you, always and forever.

696
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,360
We are on the same page.

697
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,640
We oppose it.

698
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,520
But I just feel like

699
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,570
just now, when I spoke to him,

700
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,520
I was a bit harsh.

701
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,720
I'm afraid he can't handle it.

702
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,680
Come on. A man in his thirties

703
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,120
can't take a few harsh words?

704
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,440
He can't be so fragile.

705
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,520
You're overreacting.

706
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,920
You always worry too much.

707
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,080
OK. That's enough.

708
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,240
Time for bed.

709
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,040
You've been acting weird ever since we got back.

710
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,440
You're not saying a word to me?

711
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,080
Hey, where are you going?

712
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,560
I was worried you wouldn't rest well

713
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,560
so I made you some soothing tea.

714
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,680
It's not as good as Tong Nian's.

715
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,200
You know what,

716
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,240
I should have locked you at home,

717
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,740
and never let you use the computer like that.

718
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,040
And study hard.

719
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,460
If only you were a little like your father.

720
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,720
Wanna watch this?

721
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,480
No.

722
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,480
See, see? You're always interrupting me.

723
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,600
What was I saying just now?

724
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,400
My dad.

725
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,930
Right. Your dad was such a good student.

726
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,680
I mean, would any parents let their daughter

727
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,770
marry a fickle man with no formal job like you?

728
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,440
Peking Opera or Yue Opera?

729
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,280
Peking Opera.

730
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,760
I spoke to Tong Nian's mother.

731
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,760
I could tell from talking to her

732
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,840
how much she didn't like you.

733
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,160
Is it done?

734
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,240
Wu Bai, here you are.

735
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,800
Why so late? Come over here.

736
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,240
Watch some operas with me.

737
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,760
Look at him. He's much better than you.

738
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,080
He wants to watch Peking Opera.

739
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,240
You keep him company.

740
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,240
Did you say you have an acute appendicitis

741
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,840
and need me to send you to the hospital?

742
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,480
What are you saying?

743
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,160
Louder.

744
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,000
Didn't you say you have an acute appendicitis

745
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,280
and need me to send you to the hospital?

746
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
You believe whatever I say?

747
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,680
Look at how much he likes you.

748
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,460
Stay with him. I'm leaving.

749
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,080
This is so typical.

750
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,560
So full of crap.

751
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,440
Let him go. Let him go.

752
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
What do you want to watch?

753
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,320
Peking Opera. Peking Opera.

754
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,920
Is that OK?

755
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,120
Yes, sure.

756
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,320
= NetEase Cloud Music =

757
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,670
= Little Squid =

758
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,960
He's so lovely.

759
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,680
Why doesn't he like him?
