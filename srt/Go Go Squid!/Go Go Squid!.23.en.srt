It's here.

27

Third row from the front.

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,400
Why aren't they on stage yet?

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,840
Calm down. Calm down.

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,760
Usually,

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,760
they come in 10 minutes before the match starts.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,120
I, I'm just eager to see them, okay?

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,360
Sure.

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,180
I bet

35
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,600
Shaofei would love to see

36
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,960
how you look right now!

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,120
Don't! Stop it!

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,360
Naughty girl!

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,720
Don't be upset okay?

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,440
Come on, I'm not upset.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,120
Don't worry.

42
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm good.

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,960
Good morning, everyone!

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,520
You're watching Capture the Flag, Season 8.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,360
Welcome to the quarterfinals of the China Division qualifiers!

46
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,800
Before the match begins,

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,760
I'll introduce what these

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,580
elite players have achieved so far.

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,680
Alright, first up is Mi Shaofei from SP.

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,760
He is a veteran player.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,730
However, his comeback performance

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,680
has really surprised us.

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,800
Mi Shaofei is no longer in his golden years,

54
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,680
and he retired years ago.

55
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,210
It's surprising that SP hired him.

56
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,680
Play hard!

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,920
Play hard, play hard!

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,080
Ignore the pressure. Take it easy.

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
I believe in you.

60
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
Just think of it

61
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
as a spectacular show.

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,360
Don't patronize me okay?

63
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,480
Do I need that?

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,560
Alright.

65
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,640
We've introduced everyone.

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,960
Now let's warmly welcome

67
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,640
the two teams playing today,

68
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
SP and TAOTAO!

69
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,060
= SP VS TAOTAO =

70
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,600
Wow! That's my idol. My idol.

71
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,120
1, 2, 3, SP!

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,240
Okay, the match will now begin.

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,120
The first round is the familiar attack-defense mode.

74
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,120
Okay, SP has begun strengthening their server.

75
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,040
TAOTAO's captain is attacking nodes.

76
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,040
Since the beginning, we can see

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,910
TAOTAO is focused on attacking

78
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,640
like a fierce wolf pack,

79
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,130
while SP is busy defending their server

80
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,800
in order to exhaust TAOTAO.

81
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,720
In a spurt of energy,

82
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,120
SP just gained the 6th match point.

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,300
They're just 1 point away from winning.

84
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,830
TAOTAO's server is not looking secure.

85
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,720
It'd be a miracle if they won the game.

86
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,880
They are losing.

87
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
But SP is in really good shape.

88
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,490
Today, Mi Shaofei is in top form.

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,910
It's his best game since his comeback.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
They can win this.

91
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,640
Right.

92
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,760
it seems he's supporting the whole team.

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,280
As for TAOTAO,

94
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,080
they just bypassed Ou Qiang,

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,800
and 3 players have attacked midway!

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,200
I got this, I got this.

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,000
One node held. Captured! Nice!

98
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,450
They have one,

99
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,160
and now one more.

100
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,400
Two! Nice!

101
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,360
The last one!

102
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,360
Can they hold it?

103
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,320
Nice! A perfect attack!

104
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,210
Mi Shaofei is performing extremely well.

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,000
Alright, we're watching

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,940
1 attacker against 5 defenders.

107
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,120
Well done!

108
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,280
SP has won the match, congrats!

109
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,860
They've just won the quarterfinals

110
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,350
of the China Division qualifiers.

111
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,790
It was very exciting to

112
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,180
watch two veteran players in this match.

113
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,480
They've proved themselves.

114
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,290
Right.

115
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,940
Alright.

116
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,200
Everyone, let's give a round of applause

117
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,010
to today's winning team, SP!

118
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm sure that SP is really excited

119
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,590
to have just won,

120
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,420
and would like to say something to the audience.

121
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,980
So who would like to speak first?

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,100
Let's ask team captain,

123
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,260
Hua Ti to speak.

124
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,140
Let's make some noise!

125
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,160
I think

126
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,700
the one who has the most to say

127
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,020
is our hero today,

128
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,140
Xiaomi!

129
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,260
Xiaomi! Xiaomi! Xiaomi!

130
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,500
Xiaomi! Xiaomi! Xiaomi!

131
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,040
Thank you all

132
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,180
for coming.

133
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,340
Today, we won the match,

134
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,220
and I

135
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,540
gave it my all,

136
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,340
because today

137
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,180
will be the last time

138
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,700
that I play professionally.

139
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,450
What?

140
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,220
What did you say?

141
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,230
I believe many of you have been supporting me

142
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,200
even since I was on Solo 10 years ago.

143
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,900
Over the last 10 years,

144
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,580
I've had ups and downs.

145
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,170
But I always thought if I worked harder,

146
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,740
I'd get the end result I wanted.

147
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,500
But it didn't work out that way.

148
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,140
To be honest,

149
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,980
I feel at peace

150
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,340
and I'm so grateful.

151
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,070
My time playing

152
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,060
was like fireworks

153
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,180
that light up the night.

154
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,030
short-lived,

155
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,180
but splendid.

156
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,180
So now,

157
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,260
I'd like to thank my fans.

158
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,260
Thank you so much

159
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,300
for always being here for me.

160
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,260
Thank you

161
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,220
for sharing with me

162
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,960
the best moments of my life.

163
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,660
Thank you.

164
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,680
Today, I have something else to say.

165
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,140
As of now, the only player

166
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,420
from Solo

167
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,910
who is still playing professionally is Ou Qiang.

168
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,340
I guess it was meant to be.

169
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,790
That's why his CTF username is "All".

170
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
So,

171
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,480
he'll now represent all 5 Solo players,

172
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,790
and keep working hard and getting better

173
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,960
and win both the national championship

174
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,930
and the world championship for us.

175
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,500
I feel blessed

176
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,280
to have you around.

177
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,520
I, Xiaomi,

178
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,520
Mi Shaofei,

179
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,550
will take my last bow.

180
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,140
Solo.

181
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,580
Solo, wait for me.

182
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,960
I need to ask Xiaomi what he was thinking.

183
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,060
Calm down.

184
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,460
They are still on stage right now!

185
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,420
Solo!  -Solo!

186
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,760
Who made Mi Shaofei retire?

187
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,980
Who decided that?

188
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,820
Han Shangyan!

189
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,460
Calm down, will you?

190
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,100
Solo didn't know about this either.

191
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,820
Hey!

192
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,020
What did you promise me back then?

193
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,420
Han Shangyan, let go of him.

194
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,460
Back off!

195
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,180
What did you promise me?

196
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:23,930
Let go.

197
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,330
The audience is still here.

198
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,210
Wang Hao!

199
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,050
I'm asking you one last time.

200
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,930
What did you promise me back then?

201
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,050
Ai Qing, stay back.

202
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,010
Han Shangyan, calm down.

203
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,370
Let go of him first!

204
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,610
Do I have to throw you out?!

205
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,170
Don't speak to her like that!

206
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,130
Who do you think you are?

207
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,850
You're not my captain anymore!

208
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,690
Right!

209
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,530
I'll never

210
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,720
lead any team again for the rest of my life.

211
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,200
The first thing I promised you before you retired.

212
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,130
After I leave Solo,

213
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,320
I won't take part in any group matches.

214
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,370
That's why since then,

215
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,050
I've only battled alone.

216
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,850
I've kept my first promise.

217
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,850
The second thing I promised you

218
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,690
was that I will

219
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,170
take care of them,

220
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,760
including Xiaomi

221
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,050
and Ou Qiang.

222
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,290
Sorry,

223
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,690
I failed that promise in the end.

224
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,210
Go ahead.

225
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,290
Hit me if you want.

226
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,410
I won't hit back. Do it.

227
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,930
Han Shangyan!

228
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,050
What are you doing here?

229
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,810
Your coat.

230
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,290
Too bad Ou Qiang isn't here.

231
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:54,970
Xiaomi,

232
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,170
come with me.

233
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,330
Let's go to K&K.

234
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,330
I'm not going.

235
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,880
I'm sorry, but I can't accept your offer.

236
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,530
You should feel sorry.

237
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,090
Come with me.

238
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,010
Look, Gun,

239
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,930
your team's worst ranking was

240
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,250
71st.

241
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,970
And me?

242
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,130
I've fallen off the top 100 list.

243
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,970
What can I do in your club?

244
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,090
Clean screens and keyboards,

245
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,490
what else?

246
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,210
Do you want to see me do that?

247
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,890
Give me some face, will you?

248
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,810
I went out in a blaze of glory just now.

249
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,130
You all saw that.

250
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,570
I need to call my family now.

251
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,930
Don't fight anymore.

252
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,170
Xiaomi!

253
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,570
Let's all get drinks!

254
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,730
What's wrong?

255
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,650
You all look upset.

256
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,330
What's the big deal?

257
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,650
How could you do this?

258
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,050
How could you retire?

259
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,290
Why didn't you discuss it with us?

260
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,420
You're so impulsive, how could I tell you?

261
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,250
Who's impulsive?

262
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,090
Alright, I was. You win.

263
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,570
Xiaomi,

264
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,170
this is not the time to joke.

265
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,860
You announced your retirement on stage,

266
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,410
which leaves us no chance to bring you back!

267
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,930
You really let me down.

268
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,610
I let you down?

269
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,610
You're still young!

270
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:13,930
Calm down!

271
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,130
Go ahead.

272
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,250
Look at me!

273
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,730
Did you ever think about

274
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,650
your future?

275
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,930
Are you happy now?

276
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,540
I admit

277
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,010
it bothers me.

278
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,130
I always wanted to be a world champion.

279
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,360
So, when Solo invited me to join SP,

280
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,370
I agreed right on spot.

281
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,530
Let's face it.

282
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,090
I don't have it in me anymore.

283
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,130
I've lost my edge.

284
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,240
I can't keep up with all these young guys

285
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,490
and that's it.

286
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,930
I really tried!

287
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,010
Come on, buddy.

288
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,630
Let me end things on a high note, alright?

289
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:08,770
Come on.

290
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:12,810
Come on.

291
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,890
You're the only one left from Solo.

292
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,890
Hang in there, okay?

293
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,610
When you're on stage,

294
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,450
we'll be there too.

295
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,590
Shangyan!

296
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,010
Calm down, okay?

297
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,050
Don't be mad.

298
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,070
Xiaomi didn't tell us about his retirement.

299
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,970
Solo and Ai Qing were also in the dark.

300
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,250
It's not like what you think.

301
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:48,770
I know.

302
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,410
Han Shangyan!

303
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,170
I came to watch the match today.

304
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,170
How are you?

305
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,850
Do you feel... alright?

306
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,450
Where do you want to go?

307
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,170
I'll go wherever you go.

308
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,570
Hey, Tong Nian.

309
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,010
It'll be hard for him to accept that Xiaomi's retired.

310
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,050
Please try to comfort him.

311
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,210
I will.

312
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,130
Dad, where are you? Dad!

313
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,410
Wang Hao!

314
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,690
Wang Hao!

315
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,770
Dad?

316
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,970
Dad?

317
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,290
Dad?

318
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,690
Dad, what are you doing here?

319
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,170
Dad, what's wrong?

320
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,530
Dad, Dad...

321
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,370
Dad.

322
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,860
Dad, please, please talk to me.

323
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:09,850
Dad.

324
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,850
Dad, please say something.

325
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,370
Please talk to me, alright?

326
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,810
Dad, please...

327
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,250
Please don't ignore me.

328
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:18,930
Dad.

329
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,950
Dad. Dad, don't be sad.

330
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,050
Dad.

331
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,810
Dad...

332
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,210
Dad!

333
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,570
Dad, please don't be like this.

334
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,850
Dad...

335
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,850
My life is a failure.

336
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,730
No. Dad.

337
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,090
Dad.

338
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,130
Don't be sad.

339
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,490
It's alright.

340
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,770
I can't do anything right.

341
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,450
That's not true.

342
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,930
You're the best.

343
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,130
Dad.

344
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,410
Dad.

345

Idol.

350
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,490
You announced your retirement

351
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,890
so suddenly.

352
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,220
There are many fans out there.

353
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,650
Some of them might be mad at you.

354
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,050
If they get emotional,

355
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,690
can, can you handle that?

356
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,770
Oh, I know.

357
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,660
How about I cover your head with my jacket?

358
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,650
It's alright. Don't make it look like

359
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,130
I'm running away.

360
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,130
I, I didn't mean that.

361
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,010
I was just worried about you.

362
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,330
Come on. A man can face anything.

363
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,890
Let things go when it's time.

364
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,010
Did you just say that

365
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,920
some of my old fans are here?

366
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,370
Right. They're out there.

367
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,130
Idol, remember this.

368
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,810
Whatever decision you make,

369
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,330
your old fans will always

370
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,100
believe in you,

371
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,800
support you,

372
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,800
and be there for you.

373
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,370
Let's go.

374
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,930
Mi Shaofei,

375
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,790
I've been a fan of yous since 2009.

376
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,650
Good luck.

377
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,530
We'll always support you.

378
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,680
You can do some live streaming from home.

379
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,090
Don't disappear like you did before.

380
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,010
We'll always love you!

381
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,930
Right. You have many fans online.

382
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,780
If you do live streaming, we'll support you.

383
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,490
Why did you retire?

384
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,520
You said you'd play for us for a long, long time.

385
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,610
Why did you retire?

386
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,570
Please don't retire.

387
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,890
Don't leave.  -Stay!

388
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,130
We'll always support you!

389
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,410
Right, we've got your back.

390
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:45,900
Don't leave.

391
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:47,530
Please don't leave us.

392
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,130
I'm so grateful

393
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,410
for what you just said.

394
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,050
Thank you.

395
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,610
Xiaomi,

396
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,690
don't leave us.

397
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,290
Don't do this to us.

398
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,690
We'll always support you.

399
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,810
Hey Boss. Hey Tong Nian.

400
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,130
Take care of her.

401
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,370
Don't follow me.

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,330
What happened?

408
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,730
Did you two have a fight?

409
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,890
He is in a bad mood today.

410
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,490
Mi Shaofei announced

411
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,970
his retirement today.

412
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,020
What?  -What?

413
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,130
What? No way.

414
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,570
Boss! Boss!

415
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,570
Is he back?

416
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,850
Have you seen him?

417
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:54,770
Boss!

418
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,690
What's wrong, Demo?

419
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,690
Leader, where's boss?

420
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,330
My mom is here.  -What?

421
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,490
She's out front,

422
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,890
and demands to see Boss.

423
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,250
Seriously?

424
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,690
Such bad timing!

425
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,290
Leader, please help me.

426
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,170
Let me handle it.

427
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,050
Hello, ma'am.

428
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,770
I'm the team lead for K&K,

429
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,250
I supervise the team.

430
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,850
I want to see Han Shangyan.

431
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,210
He's been busy with a personal matter

432
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,570
and hasn't come back yet.

433
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,770
How about

434
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,290
you talk to me first?

435
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,330
Tell me,

436
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,490
how much power do you have?

437
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,490
Can you terminate the contract?

438
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,970
What should I do now?

439
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,450
Should I knock on his door?

440
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,770
I feel so useless now.

441
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,810
I'm just like an outsider.

442
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,450
Demo,

443
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:15,779
One,

444
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,130
you guys keep working.

445
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:17,810
I'd better leave for now.

446
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,610
I'll leave you be.

447
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,200
But...

448
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,370
I'll go

449
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,210
tell Boss you're leaving.

450
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,130
No no no. Please don't.

451
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,210
He's busy.

452
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,250
Let's talk later.

453
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,370
I'll see you.

454
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,570
Keep working. Bye-bye.

455
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:26,920
Alright.

456
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,450
What? Don't...

457
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,130
Bye-bye.

458
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,050
Well...

459
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,110
I understand what you said.

460
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,770
But let's be clear,

461
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,280
it's useless to say anymore!

462
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,290
I came here

463
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,210
to terminate his contract!

464
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,410
Our family is not rich,

465
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,130
but for my son,

466
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,210
we'll borrow money to pay the compensation!

467
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,650
Don't you worry!

468
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,490
What should I do?

469
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,210
Things keep getting worse.

470
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,810
Hi Solo.

471
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,330
Hi Solo.

472
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,770
Hi Solo.

473
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,210
Boss, the termination contract.

474
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,610
Double the compensation.

475
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,410
Take it from my bonus.

476
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,010
Transfer the money

477
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,530
to Shaofei in the company's name.

478
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,770
Also,

479
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,950
don't tell anyone else about this.

480
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,250
Okay.

481
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,090
What are you thinking?

482
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,250
Check it out.

483
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,370
The termination contract.

484
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:15,770
We have to

485
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,810
finish the formalities.

486
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,130
I know.

487
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,570
Sorry for the trouble.

488
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,250
What are you saying?

489
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,850
We're brothers. It's no trouble at all.

490
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,810
I never imagined that

491
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,840
things would turn out like they have.

492
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,810
I feel bad.

493
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,610
Whatever for?

494
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,690
I'm the one who fell off

495
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,130
the leader board.

496
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,330
Shangyan, Ai Qing

497
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,570
and you all retired.

498
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,370
So it's my turn now.

499
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,330
That's exactly why

500
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,090
I feel terrible about it.

501
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,690
We were all being selfish.

502
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,120
How could we push you and Ou Qiang

503
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,700
to make our dream come true?

504
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,530
I'm the one who brought you back here

505
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,650
and gave you this dream.

506
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,140
So how come things turned out like this?

507
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,400
Come on.

508
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,370
Truth is, I've figured it out.

509
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,570
No matter how great you are,

510
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,490
you'll be surpassed one day.

511
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,440
Ou Qiang has been doing well.

512
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,370
I believe he will

513
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,210
keep playing for a while.

514
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,050
I believe in him.

515
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:46,820
Yes.

516
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,490
That's all your stuff?

517
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,610
Yes.

518
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,010
Yeah. That's it.

519
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,330
Let's eat together tonight.

520
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,850
I have other plans.

521
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,830
Alright, where to sign, captain?

522
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,640
These contracts

523
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,010
are difficult to understand.

524
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,450
What are you doing?

525
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,330
After all we have been through,

526
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,850
signing a contract

527
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:28,970
is unnecessary.

528
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,530
Apart from the compensation,

529
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,370
feel free to come to me

530
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:36,730
if there's anything

531
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,650
I can help you with.

532
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:46,730
Thank you.

533
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,650
Finished everything?

534
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,680
Yeah.

535
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,330
Good job.

536
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,890
The hard part is over.

537
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,490
What should we do if they start fighting?

538
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,810
That won't happen.

539
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,770
We should still plan for it, right?

540
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,210
Don't scare me!

541
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,650
Shaofei stood no chance

542
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,970
fighting against Shangyan.

543
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,490
Are you kidding?

544
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,330
He's just a bit thinner than

545
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:50,280
your man, alright?  -Can you please sign this for me?

546
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,850
Don't say that about my idol.

547
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,610
I watched your match yesterday.

548
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,930
I cried when you said you'd retire.

549
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,850
Can you sign this for me?

550
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:57,610
I'm Jiahao.  -Okay.

551
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,330
Tong Nian, I'll get Boss for you.

552
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,620
Wait, wait.

553
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:03,730
You go.

554
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,210
Go talk to him first.

555
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,530
Alright, I'll go.

556
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,050
Xiaomi, thank you very much.

557
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,170
-Have a seat.  -Okay.

558
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,720
Please.

559
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:14,940
Sit.

560
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,890
You want some water?

561
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,730
I'm sorry.

562
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,060
I came here without your permission.

563
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,070
I understand you're upset.

564
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,730
Shaofei wants me to tell you that

565
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,890
he wants to see you.

566
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,960
He's downstairs right now.

567
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,290
Do you want to go and see him?

568
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,290
Don't be impulsive.

569
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,210
Wanna see me?

570
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,370
Will they fight?

571
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,290
Don't think so.

572
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,330
Wanna go get a drink?

573
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,170
Hey, hey...

574
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,210
What are they doing?

575
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,010
I don't know!

576
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,010
You two... What are you doing?

577
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,970
Let's get sweaty before drinking.

578
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,690
Bring it.

579
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,970
You two wait here.

580
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,050
We'll be back in 2 hours.

581
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,330
Hey, we'll go with you.

582
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,440
Hey!  -Hey!

583
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,650
Let's go!

584
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,410
I, I can't run!

585
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,710
I'm not an athlete like you are.

586
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,860
And I don't

587
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,130
feel well today.

588
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,370
Alright.

589
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,010
We'll stay here and wait for them.

590
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,640
Okay.

591
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,530
Look, they're over there.

592
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,060
Huh?

593
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,250
Are you guys alright?

594
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,290
You okay?

595
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,730
Exhausted.

596
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,330
We didn't even do warm-ups.

597
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,970
Aren't you worried about your heart?

598
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,170
We run every day at K&K.

599
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,300
We take health more seriously than SP.

600
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,930
I'm no longer part of SP.

601
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,120
Why do you still want to start a fight with me?

602
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,090
I'm mad at you.

603
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,890
You have no ambition!

604
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,410
You know what?

605
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,170
Your ambition has to match your ability.

606
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,650
Otherwise, you'll be a joke.

607
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,130
You're great!

608
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,570
You've always been.

609
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,730
You're just old now.

610
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,450
What?

611
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,970
I'm old?

612
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,410
I'm still in the prime of my life.

613
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,730
Unlike you.

614
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,170
You're over 30.

615
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,850
The cruelest thing in life is

616
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,050
when you're no longer a hero.

617
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:47,800
Right.

618
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,520
Well-said.

619
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,290
What's so funny?

620
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,850
Why are you laughing?

621
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,690
Make them run, too.

622
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,640
Come on.

623
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,210
Don't be lazy. Let's run!

624
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,560
No, no, I can't.

625
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,290
I can't run right now.

626
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,530
I'm sick! I really am!

627
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,970
Running will make you feel better.

628
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,720
Come on. Come on. Let's run!

629
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,930
Tong Nian, help me!

630
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,890
Tong Nian, save me!

631
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,450
Yaya really can't run today.

632
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,010
Are you cold?

633
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,530
Put your jacket back on.

634
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,090
Let's go.

635
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,010
I can carry that.

636
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,650
Have some.

637
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,330
You know I can't drink!

638
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,930
Where are you going?

639
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,250
What are you doing?

640
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,530
She can't drink.

641
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,130
What happened

642
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,130
is all in the past.

643
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,650
The present is what matters.

644
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,530
Cheers.

645
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,010
What's your plan now?

646
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,330
Go home?

647
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,370
I had a fight with my mom when I left.

648
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,650
I told her that

649
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,770
I'd come back as a champion.

650
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,090
When I get back,

651
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,280
I'm sure she will laugh at me.

652
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,990
You know, things have changed now.

653
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,370
There's plenty of jobs related to cyber security.

654
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,330
You don't have to go home.

655
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,090
Let's not talk about this.

656
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,970
You moved out of the dorms.

657
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:10,730
Where will you live?

658
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,410
Not sure.

659
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,160
I'll stay in a hotel

660
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,530
for a few days.

661
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,690
Stay at my place.

662
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,490
We're not married, dude.

663
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,010
Are you proposing to me?

664
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,880
My grandpa will leave for Norway next month.

665
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,130
While he's here,

666
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,490
Wu Bai and I will visit him.

667
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,340
After he leaves,

668
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,570
the house will be empty.

669
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,610
Stop.

670
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,690
I can't do that.

671
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,210
Let's drink up.

672
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,210
Another one.

673
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,410
Alright.

674
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,170
Cheers, girls.

675
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:33,570
Are you okay?

676
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,290
Do you want to throw up?

677
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,730
Are you going to throw up or not?

678
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,370
I'm fine!

679
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,770
I've never thrown up before!

680
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,530
Hey, it's okay.

681
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,090
I have two backup plans.

682
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,220
So don't worry.

683
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,130
I have

684
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,170
many male cousins in my family.

685
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,410
They all like drinking

686
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,240
and I take care of them every time they throw up.

687
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,720
So, so, don't try to hold it

688
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,530
just because you're my idol.

689
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,290
It has nothing to do with that!

690
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,610
I told you I'm fine!

691
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,970
Come on. Just do it.

692
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,760
You, you look like you're going to throw up.

693
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,370
You...

694
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,970
I'm good, really.

695
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,330
Thank you.

696
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,050
I will now take my last bow.

697
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,330
You were amazing that day.

698
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,610
In front of so many people,

699
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,690
you won a huge match

700
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,490
and then announced your retirement.

701
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,570
Do you know

702
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,890
some people never get

703
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,210
that kind a chance.

704
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,170
Really?

705
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,280
Yeah.

706
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,010
It's just like when Shangyan retired.

707
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,850
Hey, out of the 5 of you,

708
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,210
you like him the best, right?

709
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,530
I hate him,

710
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,130
but I love him even more!

711
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,450
We were so close back then!

712
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,290
But now?

713
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,090
What about now?

714
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,450
I know that!

715
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,610
That's why

716
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,530
you chose to retire with him.

717
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,130
Right.

718
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,370
He was hurt,

719
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,850
and I was emotional.

720
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,970
I regret it.

721
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,090
I regret it so much!

722
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,930
But it's too late!

723
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,890
If I had kept playing

724
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,930
without retiring,

725
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,790
my scores would've been like this!

726
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,380
But what can I do now?

727
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,130
Look at me now.

728
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,650
I'm just... just...

729
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,210
Enough.

730
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,290
Stop talking about the past!

731
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,210
Think, think about the future,

732
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,330
think about tomorrow.

733
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,130
Tomorrow...

734
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,210
let's have chicken tomorrow, alright?

735
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,850
Chicken...

736
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,970
Your phone didn't work

737
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,570
in Norway, right?

738
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,410
Is there anything you want to say to me?

739
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,570
I'm glad that

740
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,790
you and Shaofei had a nice day today...

741
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,870
I told you before I'm a terrible person, right?

742
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,090
I, I don't think so.

743
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,560
I didn't tell you I was leaving.

744
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,810
I turned off my phone and left it in China.

745
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,290
Aren't I a terrible person?

746
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,470
I didn't tell you when I came back.

747
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,650
If we hadn't met at the stadium,

748
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,960
you wouldn't have even seen me yet.

749
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,400
How about that?

750
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,890
I know you went abroad for work.

751
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,060
I know you're upset and I won't fight with you.

752
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,010
You had too much alcohol.

753
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,180
Eat something.

754
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,080
What if I didn't go there for work?

755
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,210
Then why did you go there?

756
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:03,890
For a blind date.

757
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,410
My family know her.

758
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,730
She's a lovely girl,

759
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,770
and she's good-looking.

760
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,299
But...

761
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,810
you're dating me now, right?

762
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,330
I just said we should stay in touch.

763
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,970
Did I do something that

764
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,650
you... didn't like?

765
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,810
You're fine.

766
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,890
But how should I put it?

767
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,010
We're from different worlds, get it?

768
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,970
That's how I feel about you.

769
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,030
Maybe it's because of the big age gap.

770
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,210
A man at my age,

771
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,010
should get married.

772
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,870
I need to keep my options open, right?

773
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:51,970
You should

774
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,010
do the same too.

775
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,410
You're the only one I want.

776
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,840
Good lord, why are you so stubborn?

777
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,090
Take a hint, would you?

778
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,690
No.

779
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,850
I don't think

780
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,030
you should go on a blind date while you're dating me.

781
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,210
If you don't like me...

782
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:29,970
I don't.

783
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,010
Do you think I'm really that unreliable?

784
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:39,930
I promise you.

785
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,770
I won't bother her again.

786
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,410
I won't try to contact her,

787
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:48,000
or make her think that we have a chance.

788
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,210
Don't force something to happen.

789
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:54,250
