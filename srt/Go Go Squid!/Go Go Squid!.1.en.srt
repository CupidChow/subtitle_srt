and reinforced their defenses.

They are the champions of Singapore station's

51
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,250
first CTF World Tournament!

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,800
Congrats! Although K&K is a new team.

53
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,380
Yes.

54
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,950
It's still surprising that

55
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,100
with Gun as their leader,

56
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,320
they could lose this match.

57
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,080
On the other hand,

58
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,630
we all know that the manager of SP China

59
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,330
is Solo,

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,250
the guy who introduced CTF

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,430
to Chinese fans 10 years ago,

62
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,360
the legendary former captain of team Solo.

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:35,840
Yes.

64
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,940
He's also brought on Appledog,

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,840
who was the main attacker of Solo,

66
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,920
Shangyan.  -to join the SP team.

67
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,400
Their performance has been stable,

68
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,170
and the teamwork is perfect in this group.

69
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,090
They make me think of the Solo team in their heyday.

70
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,890
Solo is still the miracle worker!

71
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,950
With him as the leader, SP is unrivaled,

72
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,560
just like the old Solo team.

73
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,720
Congratulations again!

74
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,580
They're the winners!

for a very long time,

77
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,060
SP and K&K will remain

Why didn't you input the virus

90
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,810
when I asked you to?

91
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,440
97 told me to wait.

92
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,100
Problem?

93
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,640
We needed to defend our server first.

94
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,980
That's your reason?

95
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,810
And you, One!

96
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,050
You're the sub-defender,

97
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,960
and what did you do?

98
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,080
You acted on your own.

99
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,010
You messed up our plan!

100
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,350
I messed up your plan?!

101
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,270
You're blaming me?

102
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,770
Grunt, what One said is true.

103
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,310
You were being reckless today.

104
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,810
You left so many loopholes open.

105
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,600
How was I reckless?

106
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,520
I left loopholes?

107
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,560
Then you should have fixed them!

108
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,190
I wish you were as good as Wu Bai.

109
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,560
He never nags at us.

110
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,630
Wu Bai is our captain!

111
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,480
I can't compare to him.

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,600
You all suck!

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,390
We suck?!

114
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,390
Enough!

115
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,940
We lost the championship!

116

You think second place is alright?

117
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,850
There are only 2 kinds of people in competition.

118

121
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,670

are there any more strawberries for sale?

then perhaps,

154
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,060
none of these would have happened.

155
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,440
Overnight.

156
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,980
Overnight.

157
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,640
Alright.

158
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,770
May I have your ID card?

159
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,850
Thanks.

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,020
What are you looking at?

173
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,600
Hey!

174
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,640
What's up?

175
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,430
Instant noodles are bad for your health.

176
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,140
I have chocolate in my drawer.

177
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,140
You do?

178
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,980
Give it here.

179
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,390
You are here to work,

180
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,890
not to steal my food.

181
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,520
It looks terrible.

182
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,480
You hungry?

183
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,680
You can have some of these.

184
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,100
Eat your food and shut up.

185
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,320
Hey...

186
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,600
Hi.

187
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,350
Yes?

188
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,890
This is our overnight meal set...

189
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,900
Did you make it?

190
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,770
It smells good.

191
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
You... You're cute.

192
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,350
Thanks.

193
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,810
May I...

194
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,440
have your name please?

195
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,980
I'm Tong Nian.

196
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,600
Well...

197
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,060
maybe we can hang out sometime.

198
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,890
Hello?

199
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,440
Hello?

200
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,440
Hello!

201
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,300
This is our overnight meal set.

202
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,190
Oh. How much?

203
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,980
The meal? It's f....

204
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,600
40.

205
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,390
Let's make it 30.

206
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,640
What's wrong with you?

207
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,350
The meal is free!

208
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,980
Free!

209
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,560
No way!

210
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,230
Free!

211
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,100
Be quiet.

212
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,150
Bring me an orange juice while you're at it.

213
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,190
Sure thing.

214
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,890
Thanks.

215
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,980
Your orange juice.

216
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,810
You've overcharged him.

217
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,390
Let me crunch the numbers.

218
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,270
I was protecting you.

219
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,810
I was trying to see if he's a bad guy or not.

220
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,770
As the owner of this cafe,

221
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,180
I know all too well about men

222
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,490
who spend an entire night here.

223
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,140
Most of them are losers.

224
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,890
This guy is no different.

225
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,060
He's good-looking.

226
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,060
But that's probably it.

227
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,730
I'm talking to you.

228
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,020
Miss Squid?

229
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,100
Cute Squid?

230
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,270
Come on!

231
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,980
Fine! I'll help you.

232
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,890
I'll help you this one time.

233
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,730
How?

234
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,730
Free overnight for a week?

235
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,940
Let's say he won a prize.

236
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,230
Overnight for a week?

237
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,060
No, no, no...

238
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,920
What about free everything for a week?

239
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,160
This way,

240
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,520
he can swing by anytime he wants.

241
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,410
Good idea!

242
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,060
Go tell him.

243
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,350
Why me?

244
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,440
Do you want me to go?

245
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,590
Just tell him

246
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,720
that he can take part in our drawing today.

247
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,560
But,

248
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,220
we must add him as a WeChat friend

249
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,160
to participate.

250
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,850
This cafe doesn't have a WeChat account.

251
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,200
We don't? Are you kidding me?

252
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,690
I...

253
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,140
I don't do marketing!

254
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,730
I take money and check the accounts.

255
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,140
Nice To See You Cafe?

256
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,250
Use my phone.

257
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,940
Now go!

258
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,520
Oh...

259
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,440
Hey, man.

260
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,060
Can we talk?

261
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,560
We are hosting a drawing

262
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,190
for the coming Christmas.

263
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,560
You won our grand prize.

264
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,520
Free everything for a whole week!

265
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,690
No, thanks.

266
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,460
But you're the winner!

267
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,660
One week totally free.

268
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,350
Totally free!

269
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,140
Hey.

270
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,980
We don't have much change around here.

271
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,630
Could you please pay another way?

272
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,390
Keep the change.

273
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,020
I can't do that!

274
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,770
We're running an honest business here,

275
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:24,560
an honest one!

276
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,100
I'll pay by WeChat then.

277
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,810
I'm very sorry,

278
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,130
but our WeChat account isn't working at the moment.

279
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,770
Well, how can I pay you then?

280
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,350
Personal transfer!

281
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,690
But, you would have to

282
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,140
add me as a friend.

283
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,390
I... I'll add you.

284
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,980
Oh right,

285
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,520
don't forget your prize.

286
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,850
Free everything for a week!

287
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,910
Totally free!

288
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,520
Remember!

289
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,350
You got it?

290
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,520
Of course I did.

291
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,060
You two are friends now.

292
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,400
Come here.

293
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,020
Let me see.

294
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,460
His WeChat name is GN.

295
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,270
Let me see.

296
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,690
Check his moments.

297
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,850
What does he do?

298
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,970
There're nothing but reposts of cyber security news.

299
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,520
Do you know what this is?

300
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,140
Never mind.

301
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,960
Of course you don't.

302
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,890
You're computer illiterate.

303
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,830
Yeah yeah yeah.

304
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,550
I know nothing.

305
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,320
I know nothing at all.

306
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,800
That's what I am!

307
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,480
Problem?

308
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,980
I'll find someone who knows about it.

309
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,810
Check please.

310
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,990
Uh... oh.

311
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,900
Aren't you staying overnight?

312
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,640
It's only 2 am.

313
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,390
Only 2 am?

314
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,060
It's pretty late.

315
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,270
I'd say it's late if you were

316
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,400
a teenager

317
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,620
and you should go home.

318
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,430
But you're an adult.

319
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,160
So...

320
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,060
One moment please.

321
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,230
What should I say to him?

322
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,060
Thanks for coming.

323
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,380
Congrats for winning our prize.

324
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,690
Please come again.

325
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,100
Again?

326
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,140
You work here every night?

327
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,310
No, not really.

328
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,640
I'm on holiday.

329
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,770
I'm just here to help my cousin.

330
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,600
It's not like I work here.

331
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,270
Don't get me wrong.

332
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,980
I didn't mean anything else.

333
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,240
I just feel it's not safe

334
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,390
for a girl to stay here

335
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,920
at this hour.

336
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,190
Hey!

337
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,230
Hey!

338
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,020
What?

339
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,850
His ID card.

340
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,770
Go!

341
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,020
Han Shangyan!

342
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,060
You left your ID card.

343
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,230
Thanks.

344
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,730
Sure thing.

345
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,310
If you want to book a spot or something,

346
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,670
just leave a message on WeChat.

347
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,690
See you!

348
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,390
If you have a dream,

349
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,310
you'll have to fight for it.

350
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,310
I came back to China

351
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,810
and founded K&K,

352
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,500
to help these talented young people

353
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,060
realize their dream,

354
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,120
which is to win the CTF trophy for China.

355
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,060
Their parents

356
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,960
chose to put their trust in me

357
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,400
and let me coach their kids.

358
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,090
So I'm responsible for their future,

359
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,790
and that is exactly why

360
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,760
I must be stricter on them.

361
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,520
For their own sake.

362
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,060
After all, they're all so young.

363
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,270
They lack determination,

364
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,520
and often fool around.

365
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,500
They need to change to realize their dreams.

366
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,190
My dear teammates,

367
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,270
you'll never know what kind of responsibility

368
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,640
I am shouldering.

369
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,360
But,

370
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,560
please trust me.

371
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,890
I will not fail you.

372
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,690
Did any of you

373
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,020
see Boss last night?

374
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,880
-No, I didn't.  -Me neither.

375
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,770
None of you saw him?

376
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,390
No.

377
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,420
Did he come back at all?

378
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,230
Who knows?

379
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,840
He's an adult after all.

380
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,600
He can do what he wants to do.

381
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,940
So, should we...

382
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,520
You go.

383
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
Come on!

384
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,480
Go go go!

385
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,640
You go.

386
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,480
Me? No way!

387
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,440
-Listen to me...  -I'm not going!

388
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,140
You're the youngest.

389
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,980
Boss won't get mad at you.

390
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Go, go knock!

391
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,770
He won't get mad at me?

392
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,200
Are you kidding?

393
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,690
Jeez.

394
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,780
Boss.

395
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,230
Where were you last night?

396
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,020
Why ask?

397
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,540
I...

398
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,060
I was just worried.

399
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,600
Do you feel better now?

400
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,690
What if I don't?

401
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,890
What is it?

402
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,690
Come on, I'm listening.

403
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:44,810
Nothing!

404
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,730
I was just worried about you.

405
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,850
Do you expect me to thank you?

406
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,020
Good morning, Mr. Han.

407
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,140
It will be rainy today and tomorrow.

408
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,640
Don't forget to bring an umbrella!

409
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,350
From Nice To See You Cafe.

410
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,810
Seriously, Boss?

411
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,890
You have a new friend?

412
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,140
Good for you!

413
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,350
Why are you still here?

414
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,720
Go wash your face and brush your teeth!

415
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,100
The bus is waiting downstairs!

416
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,810
Don't test my patience!

417
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,060
If you're coming tonight,

418
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,480
please make a reservation.

419
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,520
Contact me if you have any questions!

420
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,850
Well? Did he reply?

421
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,110
Didn't you send him a bunch of messages?

422
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,730
No response.

423
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,640
Get off!

424
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,440
Let's go!

425
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,560
It's raining really hard!

426
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,350
Why are we here?

427
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,350
I have no idea.

428
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,850
What are we going to do here?

429
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,310
Boss!

430
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,060
Why did you take us here?

431
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,020
Boss!

432
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,700
Are we here for a picnic or sightseeing?

433
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,060
But it's raining so hard...

434
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,690
Isn't it nice?

435
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,440
A picnic in the rain.

436
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,190
Dude,

437
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,940
have you lost your mind?

438
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,640
Don't be ridiculous.

439
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,990
Time for our daily 5-kilometer run!

440
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,770
Boss, please!

441
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,520
It's raining!

442
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,390
Do we have to run in the rain?

443
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,310
Captain, say something!

444
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,310
Don't make us run today.

445
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,600
It's raining so hard!

446
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,230
Yeah!

447
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,690
Where do we start?

448
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,980
What? Captain!

449
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,690
Are you serious?

450
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,810
1, 2, 1.

451
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,440
1, 2, 1.

452
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,190
Move it!

453
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,350
Run faster!

454
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,230
I can't do it!

455
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,810
30 rounds!

456
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,060
Keep it up!

457
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,270
You're too slow.

458
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,480
We don't eat lunch until you're done!

459
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,480
Faster!

460
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,270
1, 2, 3.

461
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,100
The first three don't get punished.

462
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,440
I'm exhausted!

463
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,770
What are you doing?

464
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,020
Number 4

465
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,060
gets 1 day of New Year holiday deducted.

466
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,060
What? Come on!

467
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:40,640
I can't run anymore.

468
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,480
Hurry up!

469
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,270
You wanna lose my holiday?

470
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,890
Run! Hurry up!

471
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,730
Boss! Don't do this to us!

472
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,980
Hurry up! Let's go!

473
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,810
We're holding another drawing!

474
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,280
Reply "happy forever"

475
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,090
to win a prize!

476
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,140
I can't feel my legs.

477
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,770
Get up! Get up!

478
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,100
Looks like my idea worked, huh?

479
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,350
Boss!

480
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,770
Your idea of punishment is too cruel!

481
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,190
It's the New Year holiday!

482
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,310
You have a problem?

483
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,750
How many years do you think you have?

484
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,520
As a CTF competitor,

485
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,530
you only have 6 years to make a name.

486
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,440
Seize the time you have.

487
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,640
If you waste your 6 years,

488
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,640
you won't get another chance

489
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,360
even if you spent all of your holidays training for it.

490
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,480
It seems you've all forgotten

491
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,060
you just lost a match.

492
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,530
Looks like you're happy with what you got, huh?

493
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,350
Boss!

494
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,420
We came in second place.

495
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,440
In any case,

496
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,140
it's normal to lose to SP.

497
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,480
SP is always the winner.

498
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:12,810
Boss,

499
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,960
Demo didn't mean what he said.

500
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,770
Don't listen to him.

501
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,850
Shut up, you!

502
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,310
It's normal to lose to SP?

503
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,060
You're wrong!

504
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,600
The worst thing is to lose to SP!

505
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,980
You don't want to lose to Solo.

506
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,810
We know that.

507
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,720
Are you insane?

508
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,720
Don't say that!

509
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,310
What? Did I say something wrong?

510
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,520
Boss, don't listen to him.

511
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,730
He didn't mean it, really.

512
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,520
Listen carefully.

513
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,520
Losing

514
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,130
is never an option for me.

515
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,560
Got it?

516
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,560
Let me ask you something.

517
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,230
You've all been to school.

518
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,520
Do you still remember

519
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,890
the best student in your class?

520
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,140
Of course!

521
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,240
I'll never forget.

522
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,160
The teachers' favorite.

523
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,600
Do you remember who was in the second place?

524
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,020
As for the competition,

525
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,100
since you're entering it,

526
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,480
you must

527
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,270
excel in it!

528
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,310
Do you hear me?

529
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,600
Yes!

530
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,560
Louder!

531
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,440
Yes! Boss!

532
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,940
Let's go eat.

533
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,770
Am I wrong?

534
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,390
Wu Bai. Come here.

535
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,690
Don't do this.

536
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,060
They won't be able to handle it.

537
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,290
If they can't handle this,

538
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,770
they may as well go home now.

539
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,020
Am I right?

540
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,330
Do me a favor.

541
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,440
Withdraw some money.

542
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,850
The pin number is 214214.

543
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,230
How much?

544
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,500
It's up to you.

545
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,600
For the holiday.

546
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,430
You've already given us an annual bonus.

547
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,810
This is different.

548
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,810
The bonus is a must.

549
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,700
This is a personal gift.

550
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,270
So...

551
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,840
500 each?

552
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,020
Make it 5,000.

553
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,850
It's New Year after all.

554
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,560
Well, I'm your cousin.

555
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,170
Are you giving me a share too?

556
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,060
Yep.

557
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,350
5,000 per person, handle it.

558
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,060
Also,

559
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,480
can you block WeChat messages?

560
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,730
Nice To See You Cafe?

561
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,020
What is it?

562
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,230
This is an internet cafe.

563
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,290
They keep sending me messages.

564
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,690
You can delete the contact.

565
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,230
I can do it for you.

566
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,190
No, it's okay. Don't bother.

567
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,060
Just leave it.

568
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,890
Get them something good for lunch.

569
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,560
Let them order anything they want.

570
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,770
I'll be away for a few days.

571
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:18,940
Understood.

572
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,640
For how long?

573
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,060
2 days.

574
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,040
Hey!

575
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,350
Boss just left!

576
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,940
Where is he going?

577
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,770
Another city.

578
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,230
For what?

579
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,440
He didn't tell, guess we'll find out.

580
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,440
So, can we start eating now?

581
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,100
Can we?

582
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,230
I'm starving.

583
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,110
Finally!

584
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,440
I'm famished!

585
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,140
Stop doing that!

586
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,100
You scared me!

587
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,350
Why are you staring at your phone?

588
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,340
Is it because the winter holiday is coming?

589
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,040
Are you planning to go somewhere?

590
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,440
I am not!

591
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,270
My cousin runs an internet cafe,

592
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,440
it's understaffed.

593
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,520
I'll have to give him a hand during the holiday.

594
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,060
I don't have time to travel.

595
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,350
Listen to me,

596
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,900
life is not just about reading and studying

597
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,170
and helping your cousin run some internet café.

598
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,020
Look around.

599
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,840
No one's life is as boring as yours.

600
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,980
You should go out,

601
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,610
find a man, and fall in love.

602
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,680
Yaya.

603
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,200
Yeah?

604
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,020
How does it feel when you fall in love?

605
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,350
You've fallen for someone?

606
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,900
Nonsense!

607
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,840
I was just asking!

608
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,060
You have!

609
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,520
Is it Zheng Hui?

610
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,390
It must be him!

611
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,520
Are you crazy?

612
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,400
He's just a friend.

613
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,240
-Listen up.  -What?

614
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:18,310
There's nothing between us.

615
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,230
I'm serious.

616
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,100
Here he comes.

617
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,890
Here you are.

618
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,980
Thanks.  -Thanks.

619
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,580
A cup of juice a day keeps the doctor away.

620
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,810
Yaya.

621
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,640
Yeah?

622
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,300
Can I talk to you alone for a second?

623
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,770
Please?

624
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,850
Me?

625
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,710
Yeah.

626
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,890
Not... Tong Nian?

627
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,190
No, you.

628
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,440
It won't take long, really.

629
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,520
Alright.

630
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,810
Go go go, take your time.

631
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,150
Hey, Tong Nian.

632
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,520
Yeah?

633
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,740
I'll be back soon.

634
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,190
Oh... Okay.

635
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,770
Wait for me!

636
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,620
Okay.

637
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,020
Yaya, here. Come here.

638
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,640
The thing is...

639
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,270
I mean...

640
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,730
Yaya.

641
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,080
Yeah?

642
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,460
You are such a nice girl.

643
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,600
We've known each other for some time.

644
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,060
You, you are beautiful,

645
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,980
and you are a good student,

646
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,160
right?

647
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:38,800
Yeah.

648
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,770
As for Tong Nian...

649
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,270
she is nice too.

650
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,160
Yeah.

651
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,060
She's a good student too.

652
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,770
Right.

653
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,890
I think she is beautiful too.

654
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,360
Yeah.

655
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,440
So I...

656
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,500
You...?

657
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,590
So I...

658
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,270
I'm thinking...

659
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,390
You're thinking...

660
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,890
I think, I...

661
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:00,850
You...

662
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,810
I got it!

663
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,140
You like Tong Nian, don't you?

664
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,350
I should have realized it sooner!

665
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,980
A cup of juice every day...

666
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,600
That's what it's about!

667
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,480
Zheng Hui,

668
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,890
you could have just told her!

669
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,940
Yes, I could have told her.

670
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,480
But, I mean,

671
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,560
Tong Nian is such a wonderful girl.

672
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,130
I'm afraid she will turn me down, and I...

673
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,230
Don't worry!

674
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,730
You're wonderful too!

675
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,190
You and she are both so smart.

676
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,120
You two will make a great couple.

677
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,920
For the sake of so many cups of juice,

678
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
I'll help you!

679
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,470
You mean it?

680
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:37,920
Yeah!

681
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,310
Then, I'm counting on you!

682
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,600
Thank you!

683
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,940
No worries!  -Thanks!

684
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,060
It's not a big deal!  -Thanks!

685
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,940
It's my pleasure, really.

686
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,160
-Thank you, Yaya.  -No worries.

687
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,390
You're so kind!

688
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,560
Take whatever you want,

689
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,980
and leave the money on the desk.

690
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,190
The change is in the box.

691
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,120
Cash only. No Alipay, no Apple Pay.

692
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,690
I want you. How much?

693
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,170
= Mi Shaofei =

694
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,310
Han Shangyan!

Well, here I am.

700
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,310
I'm here for you.

701
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,850
I...

702
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,910
I thought I'd never see you again.

703
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,920
Stop acting like a little girl! You crying?

704
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:16,810
Shut up!

705
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,320
You have to stay for the night.

706
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,540
Let's go get some drinks!

707
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,100
Hey, hey!

708
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,730
What about your store?

709
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,620
I'm the boss, don't worry!

710
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:26,960
Let's go!

711
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,260
Hey!

712
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,940
I've got a match coming.

713
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,770
I can only stay for one day.

714
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:37,690
The genius is back in the game?

715
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,660
Where's the match?

716
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,940
I'll be there.

717
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,480
I told you, you should never have retired.

718
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,350
I'm already 30.

719
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,640
I'm too old for this.

720
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,020
Listen to me.

721
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,190
You were born to be a CTF player.

722
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,520
As long as you are in,

723
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,440
you'll definitely win.

724
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,720
Enough about me.

725
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,520
What about you?

726
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,440
What about me?

727
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,810
Sit.

728
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,810
Talk with me.

729
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,310
I put together a CTF club 5 years ago

730
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,270
based in Norway.

731
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,890
The business went well,

732
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,060
so I came back to China,

733
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,850
and built a team here.

734
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,730
We're a small team,

735
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,890
but we've been doing well.

736
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,240
They are young,

737
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,640
but they have potential.

738
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,060
That's big news, man!

739
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,520
Wait!

740
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,850
K&K club is based in Norway.

741
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:56,800
Yeah.

742
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,060
You're the owner of K&K?

743
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,230
I am.

744
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,140
Good for you!

745
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,770
That's amazing!

746
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,640
You're well-informed.

747
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,980
There's not much to do here.

748
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,680
I read the news now and then.

749
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,600
Sometimes it upset me

750
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,020
and I'd stop reading.

751
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,100
You miss the old days?

752
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,640
Not really.

753
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,940
I don't know.

754
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,380
Join me

755
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,980
if you do.

756
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,480
Don't be ridiculous!

757
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,290
I can't be more serious, Shaofei.

758
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,160
Join me and fight with us.

759
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,390
I'm too old to fight now.

760
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,590
You're younger than me.

761
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,810
Don't say you're old.

762
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,780
I flied all the way here from Shanghai

763
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,350
to find you, you know that?

764
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,240
Man, I don't have the energy or skills anymore.

765
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,850
Alright, forget it.

766
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,060
Let's go get some drinks!

767
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,800
I'm meeting with someone you know.

768
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,770
Let's go!

769
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,440
Who?

770
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,440
You'll find out! Come on!

771
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,730
Come on!

772
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,350
So mysterious!

773
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,850
Is it your girlfriend?

774
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,730
Stop joking.

775
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,060
No girl would want me.

776
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:33,960
Hey!

777
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,230
There he is!

778
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,600
Dude! This is a nice place!

779
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,410
= Member of SP: Ou Qiang =

780
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,020
Shangyan?

781
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,060
When did you come back?

782
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,730
You look guilty.

783
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,690
What's the problem?

784
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,810
Are you kidding?

785
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,140
Why would I feel guilty?

786
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,600
I'm just surprised, that's all.

787
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,520
There's another person coming.

788
