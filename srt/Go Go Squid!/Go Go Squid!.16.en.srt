47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,760
A fan.

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,900
Who?

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,920
Han Shangyan.

50
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,880
Shangyan!

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,980

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
You know, captain.

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,040
I had a thought.

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,880
Ai Qing is single, too.

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,960
Have you ever

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,440
thought about...

58
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,160
That's all over!

59
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,520
OK.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Do you remember

61
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,840
when I just came here from Sichuan,

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,600
we arrived in Beijing

63
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,040
on the same day.

64
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,000
And then we headed straight to Shanghai.

65
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,920
At that time,

66
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,200
I threw caution to the wind

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
and just wanted to realize my dream.

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,160
But now I think

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,040
I was too naïve then.

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
I'll never forget the day

71
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,160
when I got off the train

72
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,720
and saw you waiting for me

73
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,960
at the platform.

74
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,240
It moved me.

75
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,280
I thought you worried I couldn't find Solo.

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,560
But when I went to buy my ticket,

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
I realized it was

78
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
because you didn't have money.

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,600
Come on, dude.

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,520
Be more generous!

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,160
Don't bring that up again!

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm just joking.

83

♪ You found another way, I believe ♪

84

Today I

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
didn't invite Ai Qing.

86
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,440
First,

87
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,200
I want to have a party with

88
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,880
just us boys.

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,040
Second,

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,360
there's something I need to talk to you.

91
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,760
Come on, we've known each other for ages.

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,960
Just be straightforward.

93
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,840
What's up?

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,920
What did you tell your family

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,240
when you left for Shanghai?

96
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,920
Nothing much.

97
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,560
My mom's been used to it.

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,120
She wouldn't understand

99
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,080
even if I explained.

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,400
You know,

101
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,720
I had been working as

102
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,720
a penetration tester then

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
and made a living with that.

104
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,240
It's likely she thinks

105
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
I just moved to a new place.

106
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
So she didn't object.

107
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,000
And you, Shaofei?

108
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,000
Before I came here, I had a fight with my mom.

109
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
I said I didn't want to stay at that little store.

110
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
I don't think one should stay

111
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,920
in a small place his whole life.

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
To be honest,

113
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,160
just like Han Shangyan,

114
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,040
I dreamt of being a champion.

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,600
Well, captain?

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,280
Don't beat around the bush.

117
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,400
What is it?

118
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Actually, I wanted to talk to you two

119
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,200
about the Norway competition.

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,840
You're our boss now,

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
you have every right to blame us.

122
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,120
Go ahead.

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,440
I know,

124
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,520
you're not that young anymore.

125
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,080
It's quite unfair

126
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,040
that you have to compete against

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
those young kids.

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,560
But Shaofei,

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,520
if you can't improve your scores soon,

130
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,040
you'll be dismissed

131
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,400
from the first battle team.

132
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
Now the club

133
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,920
is really focusing on

134
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,000
CTF competitions.

135
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,960
This is both good and bad.

136
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
The more attention you get,

137
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,080
the more resources you get.

138
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,760
Your salary, dorms, and training

139
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,880
equipment are all the best.

140
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,560
Likewise,

141
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,080
the more resources you get,

142
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,950
the more pressure you will have.

143
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
The important thing is,

144
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,960
you should work harder, bro.

145
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't waste your investment.

146
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,920
Got it.

147
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,880
What are you doing?

148
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,280
Dig in.

149
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,480
How can we eat before you do?

150
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,840
Today is your birthday.

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
I'm getting older.

152
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,280
Look at the cake first.

153
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,040
Let's see what kind of cake

154
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,760
Shangyan bought you.

155
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Here, put in the candles.

156
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,480
Did they want us to eat it?

157
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,800
It's tied so tightly.

158
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,300
Boss,

159
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,680
are you in a bad mood?

160
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,680
You wanna talk about it?

161
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,520
You're so free today?

162
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,120
When I came to K&K,

163
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,440
you asked me why I chose this career.

164
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,400
I didn't tell you.

165
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,880
Now you want to tell me?

166
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,040
Well,

167
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,200
your generation

168
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,440
greatly influenced our generation.

169
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,560
Wu Bai joined because of Ai Qing.

170
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,600
Grunt worshiped Solo

171
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,200
and always viewed Solo

172
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,280
as his rival.

173
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,240
Get to the point.

174
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,480
I chose this because of you.

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
You haven't even

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,480
ranked first for once.

177
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,520
Don't tell others I'm your idol.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,320
When I was still in Solo,

179
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,880
I had all the MVP titles.

180
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Boss, words like that are hurtful.

181
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,560
I didn't mean to hurt you.

182
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,440
The point is,

183
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
I have high hopes for you.

184
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,240
Understand?

185
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,560
Yes.

186
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,320
Thank you.

187
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,520
To tell you the truth, boss,

188
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,520
if you hadn't

189
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,000
discovered my potential for CTF,

190
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,520
I don't know

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,240
what I'd be doing now.

192
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,280
I didn't know what to do then

193
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,160
and had no direction.

194
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,000
You allowed me to

195
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,190
prove that I'm a useful person.

196
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
That feels really good.

197
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Keep fighting.

198
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,040
Boss,

199
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,480
I know that today is Mi Shaofei's birthday.

200
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Why don't you call him?

201
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,160
Go to sleep.

202
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,520
Boss, you still have us.

203
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,680
We will be with you till the end.

204
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

205
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,480

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,240

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,760
= Happy birthday. Han Shangyan. =

209
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,160
Make a wish. Don't look at your phone!

210
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,560
Quickly.

211
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
OK. I will.

212
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,880
Blow out the candles.

213
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,600
OK.

214
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,520
Happy birthday.  -Happy birthday.

215
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,040
They're here.

216
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,480
Zhou Shan.

217
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,600
Sorry to make you wait.

218
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,200
A typhoon is coming

219
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,920
so our flight was late.  -Hello.

220
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,600
-Long time no see.  -Hello!

221
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,960
Captain Solo, long time no see.

222
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,160
You're still so handsome.

223
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,240
No, I'm older now.

224
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
You look the same.

225
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,160
Still so beautiful.

226
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
I hope you will like

227
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,720
this new Atlantis Hotel.

228
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm sure you will

229
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,400
have a good time training

230
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,920
and playing here.

231
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
Everybody, pay attention.

232
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,320
Let me introduce

233
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,640
this beautiful editor.

234
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
She is the editor-in-chief

235
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,220
of the earliest CTF magazine in China.

236
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,080
She interviewed me

237
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,960
back when I was the captain of Solo.

238
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,550
And she once stayed with our team

239
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,800
and wrote many articles about us.

240
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,920
Let's give her some applause

241
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
to express our gratitude!

242
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,760
Hello.

243
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,920
Hello. Thank you.

244
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
Zhou Shan, it's been such a long time.

245
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,920
Yes, that's true.

246
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,070
Your introduction was too simple.

247
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,480
At that time, Solo

248
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,600
was recognized by other people

249
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
in the CTF circle so quickly

250
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,240
not only because of our own efforts,

251
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,360
but also because of Zhou Shan.

252
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,720
She wrote an article every day.

253
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,880
She contributed a lot.

254
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,280
What's more,

255
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,840
she's an old fan of Han Shangyan.

256
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,430
She took so many good photos of him.

257
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
I was so jealous.

258
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,680
Well,

259
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,160
because you're not as handsome.

260
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,320
It's been so many years.

261
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
Still taking my photo without asking?

262
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,200
If I asked, would you cooperate?

263
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Besides,

264
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,680
you're more handsome like this.

265
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,400
Welcome to Sanya, Shangyan.

266
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,480
Get the luggage.

267
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,360
Let's go.

268
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,520
Your room cards.

269
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,160
Thank you.

270
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,500
This way.

271
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,600
-Thank you.  -You're welcome.

272
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,960
Guys, come get your room card.

273
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,560
Come here.

274
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,200
Here's yours.

275
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,720
OK.

276
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,400
Every day, your rank will be

277
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,400
updated on the Internet.

278
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,880
Don't make our boss lose face.

279
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,720
Understand?

280
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,440
Oh, Zhou Shan

281
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,640
is arranging your room.

282
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,640
It's not ready yet.

283
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,680
So ask her for it.

284
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,480
Since you've got your cards,

285
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,480
go up now and

286
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,480
get ready for the training.

287
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,520
Let's go.

288
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,160
We're going.

289
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,840
You can go up and have a rest.

290
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,120
OK, thank you.

291
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,880
Hi, Shangyan.

292
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,080
This is China's first elite

293
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
CTF training camp.

294
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,760
Our CTF Magazine

295
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,440
is the co-organizer

296
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,680
and also in charge of marketing.

297
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm responsible

298
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,280
for welcoming you guys.

299
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,160
Too long.

300
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,480
I can't remember all that, and don't need to.

301
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
That's OK. I know what you're like.

302
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,560
But if you have any questions,

303
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,920
feel free to find me at any time.

304
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,480
Here's my new business card.

305
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,320
I know you don't use WeChat,

306
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
or Weibo very often,

307
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,440
so it's hard to contact you.

308
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,080
But since I work in media,

309
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,680
I've heard a lot about you.

310
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,520
You're dating now?

311
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,040
Actually, I don't know if it's true.

312
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,760
I just heard this

313
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,200
from one of my colleagues.

314
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,560
He said in Guangzhou he saw you with...

315
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,040
If you have questions,

316
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,120
go find our team captain.

317
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,360
Please don't bother me.

318
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,360
OK.

319
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,080
I'll go get your room card.

320
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,680
Your room is

321
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,960
specially prepared.

322
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,400
Thank you.

323
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,440
You're welcome.

324
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,960
Have a look.

325
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,200
This is the schedule.

326
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,320
Training takes up

327
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,120
most of the time.

328
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,360
Of course there's also a bonfire party

329
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,000
and other fun activities.

330
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,600
Are you joking?

331
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,040
Why so much entertainment?

332
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,440
These children will be spoiled.

333
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,840
Han Shangyan,

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,120
don't assume the worst.

335
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,720
Look at this.

336
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,080
It's all optional.

337
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,960
Not compulsory.

338
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,610
The kids can't keep training 24/7.

339
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,200
Their energy is limited.

340
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,000
If they spend too much time

341
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,040
on entertainment,

342
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,200
they'll have no energy to train.

343
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
-Got it?  -Fine.

344
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,640
You can cancel them all, OK?

345
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,920
Mr. Xiang,

346
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,940
I also think there are too many activities.

347
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,080
The group match is about to start.

348
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,000
If they aren't focused,

349
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,200
they'll be hard to manage.

350
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,680
Fine, you can decide.

351
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,560
I'll go back to Shanghai today.

352
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,040
The training camp this time

353
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,760
is organized by CTF Magazine.

354
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,800
If you have any questions,

355
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,580
ask their director, Zhou Shan.

356
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,640
Here she comes.

357
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,780
Hello, Zhou Shan.

358
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,620
Take a seat.

359
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,680
Here, your room cards.

360
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,120
Thank you.

361
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,440
You must have read

362
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,920
the contract, right?

363
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,840
I just hope that

364
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,520
you will participate in all of the

365
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,770
scheduled activities this time.

366
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,280
Please don't leave early or opt out.

367
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,560
So it'll be easier for me

368
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,760
to report to our sponsors.

369
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,400
After all, you and your teams

370
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,320
are superstars in the

371
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,440
China CTF world,

372
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,760
right?

373
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Rest assured, Zhou Shan.

374
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,360
We won't.

375
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,000
I hope the two of you

376
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,400
will give me a little face.

377
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,720
And take this opportunity

378
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,320
to train and relax here.

379
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,680
Don't quarrel.

380
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,240
Don't worry.

381
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,080
I know why I'm here.

382
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,560
I'll go first.

383
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,680
You can put that away.

384
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,000
OK.

385
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,320
Look at that shark.

386
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,160
I'm so scared you know?

387
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,440
I'm scared that Zhou Shan

388
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,080
will come interview me.

389
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,040
You know why?

390
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,720
Why?

391
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,000
Because if she interviews me,

392
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,600
all she asks is about Han Shangyan.

393
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,040
I don't know why people are so

394
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,840
obsessed with Han Shangyan.

395
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,260
He has so many loyal fans.

396
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:01,850
He's handsome.

397
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,420
Yeah.

398
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,000
But,

399
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,290
we were on the same team.

400
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,720
Why don't I have so many fans?

401
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Ou Qiang, truth is,

402
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,320
if you were cooler,

403
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,000
you'd have more fans.

404
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,880
Cooler?

405
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,560
I can be cool!

406
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,320
Show us.

407
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,640
First,

408
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
tilt your head 60 degrees.

409
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,480
Tilt your head to the right more.

410
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,400
More.

411
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,640
Then frown a bit.

412
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,960
Yes! Yes!

413
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,840
Cast some harsh looks.

414
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,120
Right, eat some candy.

415
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,600
He always does that.

416
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,160
Exactly.

417
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,440
Look at that pinky!

418
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,120
You done being naughty?

419
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,000
Do I look like him?

420
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,000
I think if you were taller,

421
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,760
you'd look like him.

422
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,720
10.

423
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,080
9.

424
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,160
8.

425
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,360
7.

426
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,480
6.

427
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,560
5.

428
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,240
4.

429
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,000
3.

430
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,960
2.

431
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,720
1.

432
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,160
Time to rest.

433
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
Time to rest.

434
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Are you free now?

435
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,960
Can we chat with each other?

436
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,000
I have a good idea

437
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,360
that saves your time

438
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,680
and you don't have to type.

439
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,200
We can video chat.

440
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,320
Are you sure?

441
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,320
Yes, it's convenient.

442
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,480
Can you see me?

443
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,040
Yes.

444
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,320
Is this angle alright?

445
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,960
Yes.

446
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,250
Hey.

447
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,160
I had meetings all day today.

448
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,360
My throat is sore now.

449
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,840
It's OK.

450
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,840
You don't have to talk.

451
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,720
Just let me see you.

452
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,400
That's good.

453
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,520
I'll watch some competition videos.

454
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
You can do your own stuff.

455
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:54,960
OK, no problem.

456
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,160
You can do your work.

457
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,880
I'm fine.

458
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,320
The video is a bit loud.

459
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,080
I will mute you

460
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,880
so that I won't bother you.

461
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,440
OK, no problem.

462
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,360
Aren't they cute?

463
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,490
The hotel wanted to give you these.

464
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,680
What do you want?

465
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,080
I can tell you

466
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,960
where they are.

467
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,200
Stop right there!

468
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,680
I'll find the little sea horse for you.

469
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,200
Get out of here!

470
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,240
Come here!  -Stop!

471
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,200
Hurry up.

472
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,240
Sea horse,

473
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,000
shark, where are you guys?

474
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,400
Han Shangyan!

475
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,280
Han Shangyan!

476
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,480
If you don't need anything,

477
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,120
please leave my room.

478
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,080
I'm going to sleep.

479
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,840
If I don't tell you

480
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,280
where the shark is,

481
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,600
you won't be able to find it, okay?

482
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,800
Moreover,

483
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
the sea horse is so small,

484
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,800
right?

485
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
I don' t care.

486
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,160
Fine.

487
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,960
Hold these.

488
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,160
That's so cute.

489
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
Han Shangyan!

490
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,720
Han Shangyan!

491
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,040
Sit down.

492
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,360
I want to talk to you.

493
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,600
You see,

494
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,880
I'm hesitating about something.

495
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
So I want to discuss it with you.

496
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,280
Today,

497
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,200
I talked to Mr. Xiang.

498
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,360
Actually,

499
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm not sure what to do.

500
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,280
It's about Mi Shaofei.

501
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,280
Mi Shaofei?

502
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,760
I know you still care about Shaofei

503
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,920
after he went to SP.

504
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,200
Am I right?

505
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,760
Han Shangyan!

506
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,720
Can you see me, Han Shangyan?

507
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,680
Han Shangyan!

508
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,520
Don't push me.

509
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,920
At the Norway competition,

510
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,680
Shaofei's scores were not good.

511
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,480
So SP management is unhappy.

512
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,320
They'd demote him to the second team.

513
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,000
I mean, I could probably

514
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
keep the media from

515
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
knowing his true ranking.

516
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
Do you know who are you talking to?

517
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,140
You're talking to the China boss of K&K.

518
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,640
If you increase Mi Shaofei's scores,

519
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,210
then the scores of other professional players

520
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,120
will be affected.

521
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,560
Do you really think I'd allow this to happen?

522
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,950
More importantly, CTF is a sacred career.

523
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,000
It's fair and transparent.

524
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,250
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

525
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,390
I used to be a professional CTF player.

526
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,200
I really hate when people play dirty tricks!

527
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,440
But Mi Shaofei is not a young boy anymore.

528
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,040
He will probably retire next year.

529
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,200
Have you thought about that?

530
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,190
If he's really demoted to the second team,

531
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,610
he will probably lose his only chance

532
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,120
of joining the final.

533
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,640
What's his room number?

534
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,080
What room number?

535
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,960
It's called the "Poseidon Suite".

536
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,800
So no number, got it?

537
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,440
My scores were bad today.

538
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,840
I think boss will scold me for sure.

539
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
If only Tong Nian were here.

540
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,360
I'm not sure.

541
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,080
If they aren't advancing

542
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,000
to the next stage,

543
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,680
then we'd still be screwed.

544
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,200
Not advancing...

545
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,080
to the next stage?

546
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,840
What do you mean by that?

547
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,480
So ignorant!

548
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,000
Who, who is this in the cocoon?

549
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,600
Hey, can you help me out of this?

550
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,830
Why is she in front of our boss's room?

551
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,720
And like this?

552
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,680
Thank you.

553
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,720
Hello, I'm Grunt.

554
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,720
Shall we shake hands?

555
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,640
Grunt,

556
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
how can I shake hands now?

557
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,000
Demo, come here.

558
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:46,900
Open the door.

559
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,160
Why do I always have to

560
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,800
do things like this?

561
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,160
Hurry up.

562
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,240
Boss, this cocoon...?

563
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,520
Did you two...  -Yeah yeah.

564
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,160
Come in!

565
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,680
Bye.  -Bye.

566
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,120
Hey, help me out first!

567
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,760
Boss's room

568
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,240
is way better than ours.

569
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,680
Look at the fish!

570
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,400
Hi everybody!

571
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,440
Are you insane?

572
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,320
Book a flight ticket for me.

573
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,760
Also, tell the staff

574
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,720
to book one more room.

575
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,720
For whom?

576
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:34,920
Tong Nian.

577
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,240
You miss her, right boss?

578
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,760
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

579
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,440
Girls don't like guys

580
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,520
who are too needy.

581
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
Hurry up.

582
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,960
Boss, don't worry.

583
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,160
It's very easy.

584
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,600
Just download an app

585
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,000
and you can book online.

586
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,010
= Hotel Rooms =

587
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,370
= Ocean View Suite =

588
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,280
All done.

589
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,920
It's very convenient.

590
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,080
Boss, how long will she stay here?

591
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,200
Just book this weekend.

592
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,960
Why are you in such a hurry?

593
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,400
He misses her.

594
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,720
So obvious, right?

595
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,880
Grunt,

596
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,000
you have more experience.

597
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,280
How does one give a girl

598
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,160
a sense of security?

599
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,840
You're asking the right person.

600
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,800
Tong Nian, what are you doing?

601
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
You haven't showered yet?

602
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,400
ID number.

603
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,480
He wants my ID number?

604
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
Don't give it to strangers!

605
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,080
Be careful of scammers!

606
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,040
Relax.

607
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,320
It's my friend.

608
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,800
Who wants your ID number?

609
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,320
Is it that guy....

610
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,160
What are you talking about?

611
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,200
I don't know.

612
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,080
That must be him!

613
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,880
You don't know what is it for

614
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,560
and just give him your ID number?

615
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,400
I...

616
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,650
You look so anxious.

617
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,920
When will you let me meet him?

618
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,440
I'll help you question him.

619
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,280
I always feel you have a bad judge of man.

620
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,640
What are you talking about?

621
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,560
Stop it.

622
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,280
It's none of your business.

623
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,200
You must have a secret.

624
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,560
Nonsense!

625
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,880
I don't believe you.

626
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,920
= Dear Miss Tong Nian =
= You've booked a flight from Shanghai to Sanya. =

627
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,740
Hello?

628
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,150
Hi.

629
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,280
Get the message?

630
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,420
If you're not busy,

631
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,110
you can come here to relax.

632
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,640
Who was that girl just now?

633
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,080
A psycho.

634
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,880
A psycho?

635
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,600
Since you've booked the ticket,

636
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,360
I should go.

637
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,000
I booked two rooms,

638
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,480
we'll sleep separately.

639
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,120
Don't worry.

640
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,600
I'm not worried about that.

641
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,320
I'm...

642
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,200
OK, good-bye.

643
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,840
Look, there's a shark.

644
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,480
You can go back to your rooms now.

645
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,440
Don't stay here.

646
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,960
Boss,

647
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,010
two rooms will be expensive, right?

648
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
None of your business.

649
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,200
Off you go!

650
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,280
We'll go then, boss.

651
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,680
Goodbye.

652
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,000
Bye.  -Bye.

653
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,000
Sanya?

654
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,160
I'm leaving tomorrow, it's urgent.

655
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,920
Why so urgent?

656
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Big problem.

657
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,360
Such a big problem?

658
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:32,800
Here.

659
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,440
It probably won't rain,

660
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,680
but the sun will be very hot.

661
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,560
Take this.

662
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,560
Thank you.

663
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,800
Take some tampons.

664
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,800
Just in case.

665
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,920
Thank you.

666
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,640
You're welcome.

667
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,920
Han Shangyan,

668
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,160
I'm here.

669
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,520
I'm standing right outside

670
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,800
the hotel you booked for me.

671
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,200
Wait for me in the lobby.

672
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,640
OK, no rush. I'll wait for you.

673
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,640
I'll wait in the lobby.

Who's that girl?

686
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,930
I've prepared a huge lobster feast.

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,160
A big lobster?  -You're working hard.

690
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,080
Thank you.

691
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,610
I'm gonna eat like a horse!

692
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,880
Stop pushing me.

693
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,710
Don't gobble it down.

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,640
You're here.

695
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Been waiting a while?

696
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,520
Not that long.

697
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,400
Your room is ready.

698
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,600
Follow me.

699
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,520
OK.

700
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,080
Is there any wine?

701
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,600
Hello? Is there wine?

702
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,360
Yes, yes. Of course.

703
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,600
They're all hungry.

704
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,920
So cute.

705
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,600
The fish are so cute.

706
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,320
What's wrong?

707
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,880
Come here.

708
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,000
Thank you.

709
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,760
Be careful while walking.

710
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,600
Your laces were loose.

711
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,840
What if you tripped?

712
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:44,960
Let's go.

713
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,040
This is your room.

714
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,680
Here's your room card.

715
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,120
Thank you.

716
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Where is your room?

717
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,600
Not up here, it's downstairs.

718
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,400
It's so huge!

719
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,120
There's even an amusement park!

720
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,240
I think I will get lost

721
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,280
in this enormous hotel.

722
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,560
I have a bad sense of direction.

723
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,120
Tell me the username and password for your phone.

724
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,960
What for?

725
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,640
I need it.

726
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,560
The username is "TongNian"

727
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,720
plus my birth date

728
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,480
0320.

729
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,000
The password is...

730
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,040
You forgot it?

731
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,160
It's your birth date...

732
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,040
It's wrong.

733
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,480
I haven't finished.

734
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,800
Yours plus mine.

735
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,580
02140320.

736
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,480
Remember,

737
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,480
bring your phone wherever you go.

738
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,920
So I can find you.

739
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,320
I don't want to monitor you.

740
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
But you just said

741
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,840
you might lose your way.

742
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,440
There're bad guys outside.

743
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,280
You came to Sanya alone for me.

744
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,160
I'm responsible for your safety.

745
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,840
And, I also opened my shared location

746
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,760
so that you can find me

747
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,040
anytime, anywhere.

748
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,600
I didn't expect you knew how to do that.

749
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,280
Grunt taught me.

750
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,040
You must be tired after your flight.

751
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,360
Get some rest. I'll leave you be.

752
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
What should I do tomorrow?

753
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,720
There're so many entertainment facilities.

754
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,880
Pick any one you like. Bye.

755
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,760
Bye.

756
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,400
Bye.

757
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,520
It's so big!

758
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,480
Eye shadow.

759
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,240
Blush.

760
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,680
Eyebrow pencil.

761
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,600
Brush.

762
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,480
Will Han Shangyan

763
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,640
ask me to go swimming?
= Waterproof Tampons =

764
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,040
Good thing I brought this.

765
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,920
I will have a meeting in here.

766
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,680
You can go out and have some fun.

767
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,960
Come back when you're bored.

768
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,200
Don't worry. Do your work.

769
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,000
Take this.

770
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,800
It'll be easy for you to go in and out.

771
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,880
OK.

772
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,480
Be careful.

773
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,280
Grunt,

774
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,040
your boss brought his family here?

775
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,680
That's right.

776
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,680
You see?

777
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,400
Hello, Tong Nian.

778
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,320
Wanna have a cup of coffee?

779
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,160
I'll come back later.

780
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,880
Captain,

781
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,730
can you keep your eyes off of their leader?

782
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,960
Listen to me,

783
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,880
wear this, so she won't see you.

784
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,040
Let's go training.

785
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:53,960
Hey,

786
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,840
stop playing it cool!

787
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,920
Tong Nian.

788
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,200
Ai Qing.

789
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,250
You have a staff card, too?

790
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,320
Han Shangyan gave this to me.

791
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,020
But the job title is blank.

792
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,400
Look at mine.

793
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Captain, stop playing it cool.

794
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,160
Hey!

795
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,400
I don't know.

796
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,520
He just gave me this.

797
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,880
I don't know why it's blank.

798
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,920
But if you don't write something on there,

799
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,760
the staff won't allow you to come in.

800
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,400
Really?

801
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,640
Then what should I write?

802
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,600
How about

803
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,760
"family member"?

804
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,680
Well,

805
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,040
that's not appropriate, right?

806
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,240
There's nothing wrong.

807
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,600
You should tell Han Shangyan,

808
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,920
write "family member" on here.

809
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,320
If you don't, next time

810
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,520
I won't accompany you.

811
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,040
Can we have a chat right now?

812
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,280
We've met several times.

813
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,920
But we've barely talked.

814
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,920
Sure.

815
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,080
It's an honor to talk to you.

816
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,400
My pleasure.

817
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,080
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

818
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,920
Thank you.

819
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,720
Let's go.

820
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,760
You're much younger than him, right?

821
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,280
He's ten years older.

822
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,160
That's a big age gap.

823
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,120
Then I guess you aren't his fan.

824
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,760
When Han Shangyan first became famous,

825
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,480
he was 21.

826
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,200
But you were only...

827
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,360
11 at that time!

828
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,040
I...

829
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,560
I didn't know anything about

830
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,720
CTF competitions before.

831
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,680
Never heard of it.

832
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,360
So I wasn't his fan.

833
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,320
But now that I've met him,

834
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,140
I've become one of his biggest fans.

835
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,600
I never expected this.

836
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,480
In the past, we thought

837
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,680
Han Shangyan would find

838
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,160
a girlfriend who was a CTF expert.

839
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,630
He's always had so many admirers.

840
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,520
Of course it's the same now.

841
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,680
That's why we call him

842
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,000
Dream Slayer.

843
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,600
Cuz he always kills the girls' fantasy of him.

844
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,310
Is it true so many girls like him?

845
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,040
Of course.

846
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,800
