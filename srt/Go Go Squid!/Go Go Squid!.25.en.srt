27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,360
Hi.

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,110
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,790
I haven't heard from you recently,

30
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,570
so I'm here to make sure you're still alive.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,630
Look, I'm still alive, right?

32
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,990
We're friends on WeChat,

33
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,510
but you never message me.

34
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,040
I want to message you,

35
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,070
but I don't know what to say.

36
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,230
What did you buy?

37
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,790
I got some snacks to pass the time.

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,870
Instant noodles?

39
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,750
Don't eat junk food like this too often.

40
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,790
It has no nutrition.

41
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,870
What's this?

42
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,430
Liquor?

43
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,670
Liquor is a snack?

44
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,350
Besheen Liquor?

45
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,270
The second character means "heart". Yours or mine?

46
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,710
The person you're drinking it with.

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,630
The first character means "your".

48
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,710
I know that.

49
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,170
So, drinking it means

50
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,830
drinking someone's love.

51
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,790
So if you invite me to drink it with you,

52
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,230
you're the someone,

53
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,950
and I'll drink your love, right?

54
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,800
I first tried it in a bar in Shanghai.

55
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,390
Looks like you're enjoying life.

56
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,550
Of course.

57
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,750
Before leaving a metropolis like Shanghai,

58
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,950
I have to live it up.

59
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,990
When is your flight?

60
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,070
In two days.

61
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,190
Let's stay in touch.

62
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,950
Wait a minute.

63
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,470
What's up?

64
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,380
I'm going to watch the quarterfinals.

65
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,150
You're leaving,

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,310
why do you care about it?

67
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,910
All right.

68
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,950
After watching the quarterfinals,

69
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,010
let's talk, okay?

70
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,190
No way, come with me.

71
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,350
-Come on.  -What?

72
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,990
To where?

73
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,750
To watch the quarterfinals somewhere.

74
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,950
Congratulations, SP!

75
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,360
You've just won Capture the Flag, Season 8,

76
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,760
the quarterfinals of the China Division qualifiers!

77
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,710
Yes!

78
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,220
Yes!

79
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,790
SP is amazing now that they have a new player.

80
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,390
Hey, you were replaced by him.

81
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,870
I don't care. It's fine.

82
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,990
I'm really happy for them.

83
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,000
The whole point of a match is to show one's strengths.

84
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,190
During team competitions,

85
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,390
you can't let feelings get in the way.

86
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,150
Wang Hao was right.

87
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,830
If I hadn't supported them and understood this,

88
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,950
I wouldn't have retired.

89
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,510
Got it?

90
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,950
What are you drinking? I'll buy some drinks.

91
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,750
Whatever you want.

92
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,390
Is there beer?

93
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,300
Dude, if you only have enough money

94
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,190
to buy snacks like that,

95
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,950
save your money.

96
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,070
Let me pay, okay?

97
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,270
Listen, a real man doesn't spend money on himself,

98
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,470
he treats his friends, okay?

99
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,550
Alright.

100
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,680
There are many Michelin-starred restaurants on the Bund.

101
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,750
Let's try every one.

102
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:15,990
Sun Yaya,

103
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,420
I'm not that rich, ok?

104
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,070
Three beers, please.

105
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,310
Sit down, sit down.

106
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,350
Hey, since you're still so interested in it,

107
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,710
why are you leaving?

108
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,510
Do you guys really like to

109
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,510
burn your bridges when you leave?

110
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,670
What else can I do but leave?

111
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,630
Stay.

112
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,870
There are a lot of jobs you can do.

113
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,360
Do some live streaming,

114
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,880
or work at an Internet company.

115
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,800
Those are good jobs.

116
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,590
Anyway,

117
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,230
at least then you'll be a step closer to your dream

118
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,950
and what you're interested in.

119
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,950
Tong Nian, help me convince him.

120
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,550
She's right.

121
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,470
And if you really leave for good,

122
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,490
four people will be very sad.

123
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,650
I mean your former Solo teammates.

124
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,670
Look, Ai Qing, Han Shangyan and Wang Hao

125
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,990
have all retired,

126
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,980
but now they're still working in the same industry.

127
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,030
Yeah.

128
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,870
You know Han Shangyan well,

129
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,990
he couldn't bear to leave it,

130
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,710
so I bet you're the same.

131
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,960
Tong Nian, did Shangyan ask you to say this?

132
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,120
I really don't think he owes me anything.

133
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,270
I mean it.

134
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,870
He didn't ask me to say anything.

135
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,990
I want you to stay

136
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,910
for... for someone else.

137
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,910
Don't just smile.

138
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,510
Say something!

139
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,990
I need to think about it, okay?

140
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,550
Don't think about it, just act.

141
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,310
I made an appointment with several real estate agents.

142
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,270
Let's go see some apartments.

143
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,310
Why?

144
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,350
So you can rent a place.

145
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,830
You can think about it while you look at apartments.

146
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,110
Once you figure it out,

147
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,110
you'll know which apartment you like,

148
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,550
and then have nothing to worry about.

149
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,590
What if I'm still leaving?

150
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,870
In that case,

151
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,270
just cancel your contract.

152
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,870
I thought you said you were a real man.

153
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,030
Hello.

154
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,830
How are you?

155
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,750
But there's a shared apartment upstairs.

156
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,910
It will be very noisy at night.

157
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,710
Not this one.

158
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,430
The main door is always open,

159
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,950
it's not safe here.

160
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,190
And this stairwell is too dark.

161
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,870
Next one.

162
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,790
The stairwell is clean and bright,

163
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,310
and the main door locks.

164
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,870
I think it's good.

165
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,310
But I think

166
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,050
that agent in charge of renting it

167
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,830
doesn't seem unreliable.

168
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,830
I feel like he's a liar.

169
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,990
Seems like you have a lot of experience.

170
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,430
I've done my research.

171
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,270
There are other apartments.

172
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,310
Let's keep looking.

173
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,070
This apartment might be of interest to you.

174
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,590
It's small,

175
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,540
but it faces south and is very bright.

176
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,230
It's only ten minutes from the subway station.

177
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,270
And there are three bus stops downstairs.

178
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,390
Nearby there's a supermarket, gym, mall,

179
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,150
everything you need.

180
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,260
It's a great apartment for the price.

181
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,390
How much is the rent?

182
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,590
It's 5,200 yuan a month.

183
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,670
And you'll need four month's rent up front.

184
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,790
5,200?

185
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,470
Yeah.

186
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,150
Sir,

187
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,310
it seems that you two are a couple, right?

188
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,790
If you rent it together,

189
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,070
you can certainly afford it.

190
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,670
No, no, no.

191
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,030
No, no.

192
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,710
We're not a couple.

193
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,150
She's just accompanying me.

194
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,990
Sorry, I misunderstood.

195
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,070
So you're looking to rent alone?

196
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,350
Yes, that's right.

197
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,370
So Miss, why are you more interested than he is?

198
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,710
Because he's new to Shanghai,

199
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,790
so I was afraid he wouldn't pick a good apartment.

200
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,520
So as a local, you want to help him, right?

201
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,110
Yeah.

202
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,270
Well, sir,

203
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,670
what do you think of this apartment?

204
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,840
Give me five minutes to think about it, okay?

205
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,670
Okay.

206
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,670
Take your time.

207
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,310
I need to call a client back.

208
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,370
-OK  -Excuse me for a moment, sir.

209
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,410
Thank you, thank you.

210
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,550
You don't like it?

211
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,150
To be honest with you,

212
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,750
I have no idea what the future holds.

213
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,270
I think this place is too big,

214
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,720
I can rent a smaller one first,

215
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,110
I think that's better.

216
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,630
You don't know?

217
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,630
Sit down.

218
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,550
Close your eyes.

219
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,670
Close my eyes?

220
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,870
Yeah, do it.

221
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,790
Close your eyes,

222
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,710
and then start imagining it.

223
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,350
And now

224
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,350
relax your whole body

225
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,630
and sit comfortably on this sofa.

226
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,830
That doesn't seem relaxing enough.

227
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,630
Wait a minute.

228
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,910
Keep your eyes closed.

229
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,630
Can I open my eyes now?

230
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,310
No, you can't.

231
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,960
What's this?

232
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,790
A face mask.

233
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,990
Alright,

234
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,590
relax your body,

235
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,310
and sit comfortably.

236
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,350
Now start imagining it.

237
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,150
Imagine that

238
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,150
this is your future home.

239
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,110
There is delicious food

240
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,590
on the kitchen table every day.

241
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,390
Can you suddenly

242
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,350
smell all the good food?

243
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:54,910
Yes.

244
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,650
And you'll have a cute dog

245
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,670
that you're in love with.

246
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,280
He'll be sitting on the couch with you every day.

247
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,450
You can stroke his adorable,

248
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,710
furry head.

249
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,070
Wouldn't that be great?

250
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,390
And you can decorate the room

251
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,870
with potted plants.

252
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,330
And then it will feel fresh and vibrant.

253
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,150
Oh, also,

254
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,870
you'll hear beautiful music

255
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,230
when you get home every day.

256
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,910
That will make you feel happy and relaxed.

257
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,550
Who turned the music on for me?

258
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,000
Someone who likes you very much.

259
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,750
Don't you think it's lovely?

260
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:31,910
Yes.

261
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,430
Really lovely.

262
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,230
So, yes or no?

263
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,910
Yes.

264
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,430
Great!

265
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,290
I really want to thank you and Tong Nian.

266
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,910
I'll buy you a big dinner.

267
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,270
You don't have to do that.

268
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,750
But I'm worried about Tong Nian.

269
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,910
Han Shangyan always hurts her.

270
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,470
Leave that to me.

271
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,470
I'll fix it.

272
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,350
Really?

273
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,720
I brought your clothes back as well.

274
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,470
Thank you.

275
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,310
These two are yours.

276
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,150
Thank you.

277
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,470
Tong Nian, I'll put your clothes in your closet.

278
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,150
Okay, thank you.

279
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,820
= You say you like me without realizing
I'm a bachelor by choice =

280
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,470
I should provoke Han Shangyan.

281
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,710
If he still likes Tong Nian,

282
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,430
hearing that Tong Nian has forgotten him,

283
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,790
will make him sad.

284
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,390
Tong Nian.

285
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,000
You put away everything

286
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,230
Han Shangyan gave you.

287
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,350
And this coat too.

288
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,270
I cleaned it,

289
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,470
and plan to give it back to him.

290
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,870
You will?

291
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,920
Then let's take a picture of it for memory's sake.

292
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,990
Go ahead.

293
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,620

But I'm new to this,

311
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,870
so I want to ask you.

312
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,870

You're going to HQ soon,

328
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,310
don't you need to pack?

329
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,150
You bought a lot,

330
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,150
win the jackpot?

331
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,390
They are breakup gifts

332
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,990
for Tong Nian.

333
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,350
What's so funny?

334
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,430
You really spend a lot of money when you fall in love.

335
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,590
You gave her an antique necklace while dating,

336
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,030
and even bought gifts for her after you broke up.

337
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,380
Isn't that what a man should do?

338
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:12,910
Right.

339
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,460
But, if you have extra cash,

340
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,110
can you pay me back?

341
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,710
Look,

342
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,260
could you lend me some more money?

343
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,030
Don't transfer it on WeChat,

344
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,670
I'd prefer cash.

345
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,670
Do you think I'm an ATM?

346
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,110
Who else are you breaking up with?

347
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,590
What are you talking about?

348
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,230
Don't forget, we're brothers.

349
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,270
Now you remember me.

350
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,390
Cheapskate.

351
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,950
Han Shangyan,

352
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,240
congrats on making it to the semifinals.

353
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,710
Han Shangyan.

354
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,870
Can you make it quick?

355
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,310
I have something to tell you.

356
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,150
There's a man in your place now.

357
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,550
Mrs. Zhou brought him in,

358
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,870
so I didn't stop him.

359
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,070
It has nothing to do with me.

360
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,150
So don't blame me.

361
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,110
Here, Xiaomi , have some water.

362
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,190
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

363
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,270
How have you been all these years?

364
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,390
Pretty good.

365
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,990
And you?

366
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,750
Looks like you've lost weight.

367
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,930
I guess so.

368
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,190
Shangyan, I saw Xiaomi outside

369
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,510
so I brought him up.

370
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,680
When I went to Solo to apply for that job years back,

371
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,870
I planned to take care of you.

372
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,230
But then your team disbanded.

373
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,110
How time flies!

374
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,960
You kids have become adults now.

375
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,390
We're old.

376
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,150
Don't be silly.

377
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,670
I didn't see you last time I was here.

378
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,636
I didn't expect Han Shangyan

379
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:57,630
would have you come work here.

380
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,950
He's so caring.

381
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,270
I don't have to do anything

382
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,190
but clean up his room,

383
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,710
the conference room, and the training room.

384
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,520
I don't even have to clean the dorms.

385
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,750
It's an easy job.

386
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,910
Actually, as long as he sees you every day,

387
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,510
he feels secure.

388
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,550
He's like before, he hasn't changed.

389
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,870
Right.

390
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,010
You guys talk. I'm going out.

391
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,590
Okay.

392
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,470
You didn't leave.

393
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,870
Nope.

394
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,110
Why didn't you tell me?

395
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,790
I almost flew to your hometown to find you.

396
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,710
I wanted to surprise you.

397
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,430
I'm glad you didn't leave.

398
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,190
We can get together more often now.

399
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,390
I rented an apartment,

400
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,310
come and have a look.

401
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,150
So soon?

402
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,510
Yaya helped me find it.

403
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,300
She's good.

404
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,950
Your fan treats you really well.

405
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,070
What are you thinking?

406
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,650
It's just because Tong Nian is her good friend.

407
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,150
Since you're going to stay,

408
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,750
what will you do?

409
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,390
I'm still thinking about it.

410
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,310
Anyways, I've decided to stay now.

411
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,220
Listen,

412
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,070
I made Han ShangYan promise he'd come here.

413
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,230
If he doesn't come today,

414
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,750
we won't be friends anymore.

415
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,110
I'm done cleaning, let's eat something.

416
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,030
Awesome, thanks.

417
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,100
Here.

418
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,390
I don't know if it's sweet or not.

419
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,840
Thank you both for coming here today to help me clean.

420
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,830
It's so clean now!

421
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,790
You're welcome.

422
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,430
Tong Nian, listen,

423
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,670
Han Shangyan is a liar.

424
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,590
He's unreliable.

425
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,270
Don't believe anything he says,

426
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,300
it's not true.

427
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,870
I know.

428
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,270
Do you really know?

429
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,710
I know he doesn't like me.

430
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,270
But he's a good man.

431
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,830
He likes you!

432
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,790
Truth is,

433
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,860
he's rarely around women, right?

434
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,870
There's Mrs. Zhou, the cleaning lady,

435
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,470
his mother,

436
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,730
and the girl on his screensaver.

437
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,910
Anyways,

438
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,030
he's really bad at relationships.

439
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,430
Trust me, he likes you.

440
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,910
He likes you a lot.

441
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,220
Yep!

442
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,230
Oh,

443
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,670
Tong Nian, can you help me real quick?

444
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,630
The button to open the gate downstairs isn't working now,

445
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,150
so I can't open it from up here.

446
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,110
So,

447
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,710
could you go down and open the gate?

448
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,670
Solo is here.

449
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,910
Okay, I'll go let him in.

450
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,590
Okay, great.

451
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,070
Thank you, thank you.

452
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,670
It's all right.

453
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,670
Who's downstairs?

454
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,830
The man who should be here.

455
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,470
My bad.

456
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,860
I thought the door had to be pulled.

457
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,790
No training today?

458
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,430
Who's here?

459
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,870
Me, Mi Shaofei

460
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,110
and Yaya.

461
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,950
Not many people.

462
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,550
Nope.

463
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,270
Mrs. Han, you came to greet us?

464
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,030
Don't call her that.

465
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,910
Am I wrong?

466
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,230
Obviously not.

467
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,057
I could never mistake

468
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:55,480
such cute Mrs. Han for the wrong person.

469
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,310
It's her.

470
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,270
What floor?

471
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,310
Fourth floor.

472
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,390
On the left.

473
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,830
Hey, how could you turn on someone like that?

474
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,230
Are you a donkey?

475
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,510
Ignore him.

476
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,790
Okay, you should go up.

477
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,230
Let's go.

478
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,790
You go first.

479
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,640
I'll wait here for everyone else.

480
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,070
The buzzer up there is broken.

481
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,350
Then, we'll wait for you up there.

482
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,710
Congratulations, here's my housewarming gift.

483
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,550
Thank you!

484
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,510
Wow, it's so thick.

485
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,870
Count it when no one's here.

486
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,670
Hey, I'm just kidding.

487
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,430
You don't have to do this.

488
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,630
Here, take it back.

489
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,230
Keep it.

490
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,150
Take it back.

491
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,950
You don't need to be polite with me.

492
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,030
I'm just glad you're here.

493
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,710
Keep it.

494
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,550
No.

495
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,230
Aren't you guys tired of fighting over it?

496
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,830
If you don't want it,

497
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,830
I'll keep it.

498
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,350
Don't you dare.

499
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,510
Mine's thinner, sorry about that.

500
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,710
Then why give so little?

501
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,590
Let's count it.

502
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,310
No, no, no.

503
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,270
Check it later.

504
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,030
Okay, thank you.

505
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,230
When you both get married,

506
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,030
I'll give this money back to you.

507
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,110
Where is Squid?

508
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,110
Ou Qiang, she didn't come up with you?

509
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,710
You scolded her for no reason.

510
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,510
So she's crying downstairs right now,

511
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,350
and doesn't want to come up.

512
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,550
Why did you scold her again?

513
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,470
She is still sad.

514
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,310
How could you scold her?

515
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,710
Don't listen to his nonsense.

516
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,150
Han Shangyan, I'm warning you.

517
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,640
She's my guest today.

518
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,470
If you upset her again,

519
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,190
I'll throw you out of the window.

520
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,310
Yeah, you deserve it.

521
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,430
How could you treat a girl

522
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,830
the same way you treat us?

523
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,070
It's so mean!

524
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,470
I really didn't scold her.

525
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,470
Did he scold her?

526
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,030
Yes, sharply.

527
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,230
Tong Nian!

528
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,590
You little brat, you scared me!

529
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,790
You're both here?

530
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,990
Everyone's waiting for you, go upstairs.

531
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,870
Solo,

532
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,520
Han Shangyan is upstairs.

533
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,190
No matter what

534
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,310
he says or does,

535
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,430
could you please try not to be mad at him?

536
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,310
Don't worry.

537
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,950
I've never been mad at him before, and don't plan to.

538
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,830
Great, let's go then.

539
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,910
Come on.

540
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,470
Here, guys.

541
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,960
The fruit is very sweet.

542
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,630
Hello.

543
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,550
Welcome.

544
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,990
What's he doing here?  -Welcome!

545
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,150
Don't ask.

546
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,230
Well, is everyone here?

547
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,510
Yeah, except for Ai Qing.

548
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,950
I'm glad she's not here.

549
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,210
Xiao'ai,

550
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,380
respect your elders,

551
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,270
be more polite.

552
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,510
Xiaomi, here.

553
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,630
Congratulations, here's my housewarming gift.

554
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,510
Thank you!

555
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,800
Did you two plan on saying the same thing?

556
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,110
Solo,

557
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,830
you're so nice to Xiaomi.

558
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,750
You brought him cash and gifts?

559
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,230
What did he bring you?

560
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,990
Detergent,

561
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,190
towels,

562
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,190
a toothbrush,

563
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,190
and cold medicine.

564
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,310
Solo,

565
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,715
why would you give cold medicine

566
00:26:14,716 --> 00:26:15,640
as a housewarming gift?

567
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,190
So that he stays healthy.

568
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,750
My dad cares about Shaofei,

569
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,500
got it?

570
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,310
Oh, right.

571
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,110
An old habit.

572
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,350
I've been responsible for every one of you,

573
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,270
and for your health.

574
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,630
It's just in case you get sick.

575
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,950
Like I always say...

576
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,830
Keep cold medicine with you

577
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,150
wherever you are!

578
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,590
Solo,

579
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,390
it's been ten years, say something new.

580
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,750
You can't keep saying that phrase.

581
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,630
All right, have a seat, everyone.

582
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,550
Make yourselves at home.

583
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,110
Here, bring a chair over.

584
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:42,950
Sit anywhere.

585
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,910
I'll sit over there.

586
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,950
Oh.

587
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,630
Then...

588
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,750
Tong Nian,

589
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,280
the question I asked you at the dorm,

590
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,670
did you think about it?

591
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:07,950
What question?

592
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:08,990
I asked you

593
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,310
what you thought of my dad?

594
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,950
Can you be his girlfriend?

595
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,030
Little girl,

596
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,230
can you not cause a scene?

597
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,630
What are you talking about?

598
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,310
I'm going to the supermarket.

599
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,230
Does anyone...

600
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,470
Don't go to the supermarket.

601
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,510
My dad is a good man,

602
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,710
and earns more than that other guy...

603
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,550
Xiao'ai!

604
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,950
Let's go, come with me to the supermarket.

605
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,910
Grab your hat.

606
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,670
I'll take her to the supermarket.

607
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,630
I'll go with you.

608
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,430
Okay, let's go.

609
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,260
Wait, wait.

610
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,950
There is a big fish in my kitchen,

611
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,630
and I don't know how to cook it.

612
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,470
I need your help.

613
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,510
So...

614
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,230
Oh right, I should help you.

615
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,380
Xiao'ai.

616
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,940
Come here.

617
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,350
Your teacher told me,

618
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,040
you don't listen carefully in class.

619
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,230
Be honest.

620
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,270
Dad, that's because of spring fever.

621
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,990
You understand?

622
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,230
When spring comes it's hard to focus.

623
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,830
Then if no one else wants to go,

624
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,670
I'll go by myself.

625
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,590
What do you want to eat?

626
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,870
I'll buy it for you.

627
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,040
I need a lot of things.

628
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,630
I'll make you a list.

629
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,560
Give me a paper and pen.

630
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,140
I'll get them.

631
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,030
Alright, thanks.

632
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,990
I need detergent.

633
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,150
Four bottles!

634
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,630
Didn't I just bring you some?

635
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,830
It's a new house.

636
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,430
So I need to wash more clothes!

637
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,350
Well, anything else?

638
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,030
Rice...

639
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,750
-Rice.  -Yes yes.

640
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,470
Two bags.

641
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,270
Right.

642
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,190
Some salt.

643
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,620
Salt.

644
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,870
By several bottles.

645
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,030
We need a lot, right?

646
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,550
-Right.  -Yes.

647
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:38,980
Ok.

648
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,560
Flour.

649
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,140
Flour!

650
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,270
Several bags.

651
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,390
Right.

652
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,230
What else?

653
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,990
Water!

654
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,390
Water, we need mineral water.

655
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,070
Yes we need water. Yeah.

656
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,790
The big bottles!

657
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,990
Big bottles. Yeah.

658
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,001
You're going to need

659
00:28:50,002 --> 00:28:51,260
professional movers to carry all this stuff.

660
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,230
She's a little girl.

661
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,470
How can she carry so much?

662
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,390
You should help her then!

663
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,350
Sorry for the trouble.

664
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,230
It seems the last time we hung out

665
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,430
was Lunar New Year's Day.

666
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,430
I didn't find

667
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,870
what Xiaomi wanted.

668
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,390
Wait a moment.

669
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,590
Do you like these snacks, too?

670
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,230
I saw you get these last time.

671
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,950
Right?

672
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,270
My memory's good.

673
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,230
That's all.

674
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:36,790
Oh.

675
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,750
Let me help you.

676
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,080
I messaged Yaya and Xiaomi.

677
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,190
They will come downstairs and help us.

678
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,790
Here they are.

679
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,670
You two were gone a long time.

680
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,250
Gun, hurry up and help her.

681
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:04,910
Yeah.

682
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,240
I won't help you bring them up.

683
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,310
I'll leave them out here.

684
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,990
I have something to do at the club.

685
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,190
Come on!

686
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,630
Really.

687
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,030
Oh god, my wrist

688
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,550
is really hurting.

689
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,910
I guess it's from competing all those years.

690
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,910
Must be carpal tunnel.

691
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,310
Are you ok?

692
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:36,990
I'm fine.

693
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,350
I'm messing with him.

694
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,270
Let's go.

695
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,990
Careful.

696
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,070
Can you handle that?

697
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,990
Let me help you.

698
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,990
You help me take this.

699
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,710
Leave it to me.

700
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:24,860
Give it to me.

701
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,190
Put it on top.

702
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,550
That's everything.

703
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,510
Why don't you stay and leave after dinner?

704
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,590
Well...

705
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,950
I'm afraid I can't.

706
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,350
It doesn't matter.

707
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,510
Your work is important.

708
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,710
Remember to have dinner.

709
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,630
Don't get hungry.

710
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,790
Oh, I have something for you.

711
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,870
I bought them last time I went shopping.

712
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,790
Some are limited edition.

713
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,990
Thank you.

714
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,040
Stay here and leave after dinner.

715
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,390
They all...

716
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,430
They all want you to stay here.

717
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,870
They all hope you'll stay.

718
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,830
I'll go back up.

719
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,750
If you want to have dinner with us,

720
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,630
come back.

721
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,150
We'll be waiting for you.

722
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,750
Drive safely.

723
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,590
Can I

724
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,910
really trust you?

725
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,950
I promise you.

726
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,310
I won't bother her again.

727
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,870
I won't try to contact her,

728
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,630
or make her think that we have a chance.

729
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,390
Xiaomi,

730
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,560
I have to go and take care of something.

731
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,910
Where's Han Shangyan?

732
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,710
He left.

733
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,560
Huh?

734
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,090
What a waste of all our planning.

735
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,950
What did you say to him?

736
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,870
Nothing really.

737
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:18,910
Han Shangyan!

738
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,310
What's wrong?

739
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,400
Tong Nian is so kind to you.

740
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,910
Could you please be nicer to her?

741
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,950
Give me your phone.

742
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,790
Why?

743
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,990
I want to show you something.

744
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,710
Hurry up already!

745
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,530
Could you act a little more

746
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,390
fearless like you were back in the day?

747
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,870
Your official K&K China website

748
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,340
looks so pathetic.

749
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,230
Looks like a student made it.

750
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,070
Tong Nian made a new website for you.

751
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,470
She paid for it all herself.

752
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,110
Look at it carefully.

753
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,710
Come up after looking through it.

754
00:36:59,230 --> 00:36:59,750
OK?

755
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,830
She didn't sleep for several nights making this for you.

756
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,190
She did so much!

757
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,390
Can't you just go up and eat with her?

758
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,790
Otherwise, she'll be very sad.

759
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,710
Gun.

760
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,750
Tong Nian is a great girl.

761
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,070
If you care about her at all,

762
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,630
please don't make her sad,

763
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,550
okay?

764
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,410
♪ Refuse to let you see through me ♪

765
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,500
♪ It hurts me more ♪

766
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:45,930
♪ When I see you suffer ♪

767
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:52,250
♪ I'm trying hard to escape but memories flash back ♪

768
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:56,780
♪ I remember everything you said to me ♪

769
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,750
Drink and eat all you can!

770
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,670
Yes!

771
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,590
Where have you been?

772
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,390
I lost a button,

773
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,790
so I went down to find it.

774
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,870
And guess what?

775
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,070
I found it.

776
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,150
There aren't any buttons anywhere.

777
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,150
Idol, don't ruin my cover story.

778
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,610
Oh!

779
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,030
Hey, Ou Qiang.

780
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,470
Let's play video games, turn the screen on.

781
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,910
I bought a new one.  -Oh right!

782
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,100
-What would you like to play?  -That one...

783
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,230
Tong Nian, go and play with them.

784
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,990
It's ok, I'll help you.

785
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,990
It's fun, go play.

786
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,790
That one!

787
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,630
Which one?  -Just leave these here, Ok?

788
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,550
The first one!

789
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,950
Yaya come and help me.

790
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,340
Ok.

791
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,030
Hurry up!

792
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,910
Grab the soy sauce.

793
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,750
Let's cook the fish first.

794
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,870
Which soy sauce?

795
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,630
This on the left.

796
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,030
Over the past 2 years and 3 months,

797
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,070
we've won,

798
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,230
and we've lost.

799
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,590
We've laughed,

800
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,790
and we've cried.

801
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,900
There were questions,

802
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,790
scandals,

803
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,230
slanders,

804
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,380
and misunderstandings.

805
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,790
We've never

806
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,750
attempted to explain.

807
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,230
He never mentioned

808
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,460
why he became a Chinese citizen at age 18.

809
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,630
But I know why.

810
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,090
It was for the same reason

811
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,450
that I joined ACM-ICPC.

812
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,760
He wanted to win a championship for China.

813
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,840
So the world would see our flag and

814
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,220
hear our national anthem on an international stage.

815
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,510
He has already retired,

816
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,790
but even now,

817
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,830
he's still holding on to this same dream.

818
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,070
Over the past 2 years and 3 months,

819
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,190
we've won,

820
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,510
and we've lost.

821
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,030
We've laughed,

822
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,430
and we've cried.

823
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,990
There were questions,

824
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,510
scandals,

825
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,190
slanders,

826
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,830
and misunderstandings.

827
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,110
We've never

828
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,270
attempted to explain.

829
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,670
All good things come to an end.

830
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,910
We've won,

831
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,590
but will we keep winning?

832
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,990
Actually,

833
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,750
I'm not as brave as she is.

834
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,830
I don't have the courage to love her.

835
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,670
Here.

836
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,960
We don't have to eat,

837
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,750
but we have to drink.

838
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,990
The first cup

839
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,510
is to congratulate Xiaomi.

840
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,870
Here, cheers.

841
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,670
Congratulations!

842
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,850
Listen buddy,

843
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,370
don't think of my home as your second home.

844
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,230
I can't afford to treat you.

845
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,550
So stingy.

846
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,190
The second cup

847
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,670
is to congratulate you on being so lucky.

848
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,260
You're really lucky to have such a beautiful fan.

849
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,790
I'm just as good as Xiaomi.

850
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,270
Where are my fans?

851
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,790
It's unfair!

852
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,950
No, you're my idol, too.

853
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,190
Don't try to console me.

854
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,550
A fan of the team.

855
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,710
She has only you in her heart.

856
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,750
Don't listen her, come on.

857
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,670
Cheers, come on.

858
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,670
Cheers.

859
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,310
All right, all right.

860
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,510
Don't drink so much.

861
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,070
If you keep drinking like this,

862
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,550
I can't pay my rent next month.

863
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,070
Would I take advantage of you?

864
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,830
The third cup, come on...

865
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,400
Stop, stop, let me do this one.

866
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,760
Let me do this one.

867
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,750
The third cup is to thank everyone.

868
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,670
Thanks for never giving up on me,

869
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,790
including Han Shangyan.

870
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,710
Maybe others don't realize

871
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,310
how much he cares.

872
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,670
But I know.

873
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,550
Here's to you and to Han Shangyan.

874
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,390
Don't drink so much, that's expensive.

875
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,500
Tong Nian.

876
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,200
Yes?

877
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,390
Han Shangyan is a workaholic.

878
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,180
So he doesn't have a lot of time to spend with you.

879
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,510
I hope it doesn't upset you.

880
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,590
Oh.

881
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,030
I don't mind.

882
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,230
I have no reason to mind.

883
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,070
Tong Nian, we should go to the hospital.

884
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,960
Didn't Zheng Hui's mother have her operation today?

885
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,870
Oh, I forgot.

886
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,710
I'm sorry.

887
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,640
I'm afraid I can't eat with you.

888
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,310
Because my classmate's mother had an operation today.

889
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,550
My father operated on her,

890
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,510
so I should check on her.

891
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,030
Enjoy yourselves.

892
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,910
I have to go.

893
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,110
Tong Nian, let my father drive you to the hospital.

894
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,310
I'll grab a taxi.

895
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,310
Don't worry about me.

896
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:58,790
Let me drive you!

897
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:59,430
No, no, no.

898
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,470
I'll take a taxi.

899
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,470
See you, bye.

900
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,310
