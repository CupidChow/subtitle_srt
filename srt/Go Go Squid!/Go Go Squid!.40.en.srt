27

How could we sleep?

28
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,800
He snores so loudly.

29
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,960
I can hear him even with my headphones on.

30
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,920
I was pretending.

31
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
Did you have to pretend so loudly?

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,600
Annoying.

33
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,920
Listen, you guys.

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,800
I'm so nervous right now.

35
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
This is the biggest event

36
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,530
I've ever participated in.

37
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,080
We've competed in so many contests before.

38
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,860
But I've never felt this nervous before.

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,680
That's because you think of boss as your idol,

40
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,200
and want to fulfill his dream.

41
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,320
You're right.

42
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,920
But boss barely even notices you.

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,960
That's not true!

44
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,640
Thanks, I'm thirsty.

45
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,920
I'm not competing this time,

46
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,810
but I'll pray for you guys.

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,160
You know,

48
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,160
we've been together for a long time.

49
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,520
It's been great.

50
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,520
Of course.

51
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,150
Come. Let's wish for good luck.

52
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,680
Come on.

53
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,960
Not so loud.

54
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,880
Hey, listen,

55
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,920
just now,

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
I figured out

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,320
a new strategy.

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,680
It'll be really useful.

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,200
Are you sure?

60
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,040
Of course.

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,640
Look.

62
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,840
I've been closely researching

63
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,300
our opponents for a while now.

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,360
We attack together to find the loopholes.

65
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,800
Then all three of us attack it at once

66
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,480
until we break through their node.

67
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,320
They will be caught off guard.

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,880
Right.

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,330
If we keep attacking,

70
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,540
they will concentrate on defense.

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
Yes, Demo, remember,

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,080
show them our vulnerability on purpose,

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,240
then strengthen the server.

74
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,720
Han Shangyan?

75
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
Han Shangyan?

76
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,680
I'm downstairs.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
Why aren't you in bed?

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm too excited,

79
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,640
and don't want to disturb Buff.

80
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,400
Aren't you worried about disturbing me?

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,240
You're not competing.

82
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
So you're worthless.

83
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,400
Seriously,

84
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,600
after the competition that day,

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,040
I hoped you'd make a comeback.

86
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,840
It was just a lucky day.

87
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,880
Those five players weren't from the same club,

88
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,760
and didn't work well together.

89
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
We barely beat them.

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,080
It's too late, Shaofei,

91
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,280
we have pasted our prime.

92
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
I may be, but you're not.

93
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
You really won't compete again?

94
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,520
No desire.

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,110
Why you are so stubborn?

96
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,200
What about an individual match?

97
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,960
Forget it.

98
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,120
What a pity!

99
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm over 30.

100
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,000
Even if I competed now,

101
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,920
I'd have to retire in two years.

102
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,360
Just like Buff,

103
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,920
we can't stay around forever.

104
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,160
But the kids I have here

105
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,640
can play for ten more years at least.

106
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,080
Isn't that cool?

107
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Cool.

108
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
In ten years,

109
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,120
they could win dozens

110
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,400
or even hundreds of championships.

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,400
Let the past stay in the past.

112
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
I don't care who remembers me.

113
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,650
I don't want to be some kind of hero.

114
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,970
The only thing I care about

115
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,480
is my club's honor.

116
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,160
Now leave me alone.

117
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,520
Go sleep somewhere else.

118
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,250
Maybe on the chair in the training room,

119
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,430
or on the table in the meeting room.

120
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,360
The table's big. It's more comfortable.

121
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,640
Enough.

122
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
I know you won't sleep even if I leave.

123
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
I guess,

124
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,500
you're worried about Solo and his team.

125
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,840
There's nothing to worry about.

126
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,120
If he couldn't even win third place,

127
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,720
I'll be embarrassed to be called his friend.

128
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,240
Come on. Sleep.

129
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,760
Go sleep on my bed.

130
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,930
No, I like it here.

131
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,120
Yaya, I can't sleep.

132
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,600
Me neither.

133
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,760
I thought you were asleep.

134
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,920
You should have told me you weren't.

135
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,160
How about

136
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,400
we go there right now?

137
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,280
Right now?

138
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,400
It's 11 p.m.

139
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,260
What if we interrupt their sleep?

140
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,240
I know of a 24-hour store near K&K.

141
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,980
We can wait there until dawn.

142
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,000
We can't fall asleep now anyway.

143
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,950
What if we oversleep tomorrow?

144
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,680
Are you sure?

145
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,400
I am.

146
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,800
Get up.

147
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,160
Shaofei, get up.

148
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,520
Are you there?

149
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,000
Didn't you install

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
a facial recognition system for them?

151
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Yes.

152
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,490
But I forgot to add my own face.

153
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,280
It's fine.

154
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
Let me make some more expressions.

155
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,120
Maybe we can open it.

156
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,480
Right?

157
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,040
Can you?

158
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,920
I told you

159
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,840
I would come pick you up.

160
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,900
We actually got here last night.

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,560
Around midnight.

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
I... I need a bed.

163
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,240
I want to take a nap.

164
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,270
I know where there's an empty bed.

165
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,920
Let me show you.

166
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,840
See you later.

167
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,800
Be quiet. They are still sleeping.

168
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,560
Your voice is the loudest.

169
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,170
I'm coming. Move aside.

170
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,840
Goodness.

171
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,280
Are you making coffee

172
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,000
or trying to destroy the coffee machine?

173
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,480
This is not the way to do it.

174
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,280
I showed you before. Have you forgotten?

175
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,520
Look, it's like this.

176
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,680
Did you see that?

177
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,080
Forget it.

178
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,620
Since you are not helping anyway,

179
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,480
just sit down over there.

180
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,880
I'll bring you some coffee when it's done.

181
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,240
Okay?

182
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,040

Hey, don't!

188
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,720
I said don't look.

189
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,680
You can look when I let you.

190
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,840
Open your eyes on three.

191
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
-3.  -1.

192
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,040

193
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,000

How long did it take to learn this?

197
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,320
Not very long.

198
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,920
During winter vacation,

199
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,000
I was not busy,

200
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,960
and felt bored,

201
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,200
so I decided to learn how to do it.

202
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,520
I learned it pretty quickly.

203
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,640
Is there anything you can't do?

204
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,680
This is a hard question.

205
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,880
It seems I'm capable of anything.

206
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,800
Oh, I know.

207
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,000
CTF.

208
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,850

209
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,680
How is it?

210
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,400
Not...

211
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,600
bad.

212
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,960
I want to ask you a question.

213
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,230
Don't you think that our love was predestined?

214
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,520
You think so?

215
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,800
Of course.

216
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,520
When we first met each other,

217
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,840
you were in a bad mood.

218
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,770
You walked right into my brother's Internet café.

219
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
And then we met each other.

220
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
The second time was in Guangzhou.

221
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,960
You were there the same time I was there.

222
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,840
Then we met again.

223
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,760
Then just now,

224
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,880
I was standing out front

225
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,080
worrying about how to get in.

226
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,160
And then you appeared.

227
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,520
It seems that God

228
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,680
planned all of this to happen.

229
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,920
So we were meant to meet, right?

230
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
The coffee tastes good.

231
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,520
Answer my question!

232
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,200
Don't you think

233
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,000
fate wanted us to meet?

234
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,480
Aren't you sleepy?

235
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,320
Yes.

236
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,920
I haven't slept the whole night.

237
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,200
My back is sore.

238
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,000
Of course I'm sleepy.

239
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,240
Why don't you go sleep in my room?

240
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,970
Otherwise, you'll be too tired to watch the match.

241
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,430
I won't go until you finish your coffee.

242
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,320
I don't think I can do that.

243
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
Why not?

244
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,760
I don't want to ruin the heart you made.

245
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,760
Aren't we meant to be?

246
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,440
Didn't fate bring us together?

247
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Come on, admit it!

248
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,560
Aren't we meant to be?

249
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,580
Aren't we meant to be?  -Careful.

250
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,520
-Answer me.  -You'll spill it.

251
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,320
You still haven't answered me.

252
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,680
-Careful.  -Aren't we meant to be?

253
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,920
Aren't we meant to be?

254
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,840
Yes, yes, yes.

255
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
Aren't we meant to be?

256
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,200
Yes.

257
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,560

270
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,040
What are you doing here?

271
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,790
Hey, when did you come here?

272
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,120
Shouldn't you be at home?

273
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,360
Shouldn't you be with Yaya right now?

274
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,790
I, I, I...

275
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,360
Oh my god.

276
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,200
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

277
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,450
I forgot Shaofei was in my bed.

278
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,120
How embarrassing.

279
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,840
I... I'm going to the bathroom.

280
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,440
Wait, wait.

281
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,240
Where's Yaya?

282
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,880
She came with me.

283
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,000
She's sleeping in another room.

284
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,790
Don't worry.

285
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
Han Shangyan,

286
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,880
don't you think of me as a man?

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,040
You should've told me she was here.

288
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,280
I could've found another place.

289
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,240
I should ask you,

290
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,960
what did you do to my girlfriend?

291
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,200
Now you're blaming me?

292
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,160
I'm leaving.

293
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,040
Mi Shaofei!

294
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,120
Tong Nian, I'm sorry.

295
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,120
We got a bit drunk last night.

296
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,560
I didn't know he was in my bed.

297
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

298
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,880
I'll forgive you this time.

299
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't let it happen again.

300
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,560
Hear me?

301
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,880
Let me get you a toothbrush.

302
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,640
Why are there so many

303
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,120
disposable toothbrushes here?

304
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,160
I often go on business trips.

305
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,810
These are more convenient.

306
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,200
Don't you think

307
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,040
this doesn't feel like home then?

308
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,360
Are you too busy

309
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,000
to pack your things?

310
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,160
I think you should find a person

311
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,560
to pack for you.

312
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,240
So you don't have to use

313
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,880
disposable toothbrushes anymore.

314
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:26,960
Okay.

315
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,320
If I need to pack in the future,

316
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,240
I'll call you for help.

317
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,560
Well let's see.

318
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,520
Han Shangyan.

319
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,760
We've got a big problem.

320
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,280
How are you feeling?

321
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:47,880
It hurts.

322
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,000
Should we take him to the hospital?

323
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,960
Drink more water.

324
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,040
I have to compete.

325
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,960
What's wrong?

326
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,680
Your stomach again?

327
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,440
I'm fine. It's not serious.

328
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,880
You take gastric ulcer medicine,

329
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,840
how could it not be serious?

330
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,320
What's your plan?

331
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,800
We need a backup plan.

332
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,960
You take Grunt to the hospital.

333
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,200
I'll call an urgent meeting.

334
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,360
We'll discuss his substitution.

335
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,840
Boss,

336
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,060
this happened before.

337
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
I can still go.

338
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,040
I'm fine.

339
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
I'll be fine after taking this medicine.

340
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
No, you can't take it anymore.

341
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,680
You just took some.

342
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,400
Have a good rest.

343
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,200
Don't worry about anything.

344
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,120
Call everyone for a meeting.

345
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
Boss, boss.

346
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,400
Boss.

347
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,760
Boss, I want to be in the finals.

348
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,760
Please.

349
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,480
Don't replace me.

350
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,560
Do you know how long

351
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,520
I've prepared for this?

352
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,560
Three years. Three years.

353
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
I'm so close now,

354
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,040
how could you replace me?

355
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,080
I can do it.

356
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,600
I can do it, boss.

357
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
I've been training everyday.

358
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,200
I've been training very hard everyday.

359
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,280
Please, boss.

360
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,920
Please don't replace me.

361
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,920
Stop crying.

362
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,120
Whether we win or lose today,

363
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,040
we've already

364
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
qualified for the world finals.

365
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,120
Just take care of yourself.

366
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,690
You can join us abroad when you recover.

367
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,480
It's the same, right?

368
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,640
But this is our home field.

369
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,120
What if we lose?

370
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,600
You think too highly of yourself.

371
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,200
Don't you trust your teammates?

372
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,000
Without you,

373
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,000
they can still win the championship.

374
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,920
Stop crying.

375
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,680
Shaofei,

376
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,360
take him to the hospital.

377
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,600
Take care.

378
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,720
Come out for a meeting.

379
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,680
Boss.

380
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,200
Grunt.

381
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,160
Grunt. Grunt.

382
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,760
97, call an ambulance.

383
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,600
Grunt. Grunt.

384
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,570
Go!

385
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,260
Okay.

386
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,470
The stairs ahead of you will be easier.

387
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,400
Keep going straight.

388
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,120
I think you should go with him.

389
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,520
He's too impulsive.

390
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,080
Keep an eye on him.

391
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,680
Okay.

392
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,440
Where's Wu Bai?

393
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,600
He and One went out for a morning run.

394
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,920
Call them to come back for a meeting.

395
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,000
Okay, I will call them.

396
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,280
Boss, he's here.

397
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,760
Boss, what's the matter?

398
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,680
Get prepared.

399
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,080
You'll replace Grunt later.

400
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,720
Me?

401
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,520
I, I, but, but...

402
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,680
I'm not Grunt's equal.

403
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,200
Grunt can't make it.

404
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,520
You are the only one who can take his place.

405
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,280
But...

406
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
You've played in the national finals.

407
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,600
What's the problem?

408
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,240
That's different, boss.

409
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,400
Don't be silly.

410
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,480
Sit over there.

411
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,000
You have all trained together.

412
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,360
I'm going to keep this short.

413
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,160
Just now I told Grunt

414
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,700
it doesn't matter if we win or not today,

415
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,800
because we've already qualified

416
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,680
for the world finals.

417
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,640
But,

418
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,870
everyone, listen carefully.

419
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,680
Here at home,

420
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,840
you must win the championship.

421
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,160
There's no other option!

422
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,160
Are you clear?

423
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,800
Yes, boss.

424
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,600
Go and practice for a while.

425
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,640
Focus on working together.

426
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
I'll be your coach

427
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,440
for the entire competition today.

428
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,880
Come on.

429
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,320
Yes.

430
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,080
Captain,

431
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,920
this was all so sudden.

432
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
I will need your help.

433
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,640
Just play as usual.

434
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,280
I got you.

435
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,000
Let's go.

436
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,120
Then you're wasting a substitution.

437
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,290
Compared to the national finals lineup,

438
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,280
it's the same as Buff replacing Grunt.

439
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,640
You're substituting one ace with another,

440
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,920
so the team's overall ability

441
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,320
hasn't been improved at all.

442
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,200
Buff is in the top four,

443
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
so he's better than Grunt.

444
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,720
But just think,

445
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,880
his age, reaction speed, and teamwork...

446
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,800
Tong Nian!

447
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,200
I'm glad you're still here.

448
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,560
I thought I overslept.

449
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,440
We won't leave without you.

450
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,120
Did I interrupt you two?

451
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,840
No.

452
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,440
You guys have fun here.

453
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,240
Lunch will be served in the meeting room at 11:30.

454
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,120
What's wrong?

455
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,360
Grunt is ill all of a sudden.

456
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,520
He can't play today.

457
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
He needs a substitute.

458
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,960
What bad luck to fall ill today!

459
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,880
I know, right?

460
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,660
I guess they're all feeling unhinged right now.

461
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,520
Yaya, what can we do?

462
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,120
I don't know.

463
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,680
= Asia Pacific Finals =

464
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,320
SP wins!

465
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,480
Congratulations!

466
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,840
SP won the first round.

467
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,480
Congratulations!

468
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,240
SP takes third place this season!

469
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,760
Fight hard when you are young!

470
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
Cheers for SP!

= Ten Years of Legends, The China Finals =

472
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,000
Finally, this day has arrived.

473
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,120
I see pride written all over his face.

474
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,320
Han Shangyan

475
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,760
is my man.

476
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,360
This is the prize I got

477
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,920
when I first won the championship.

478
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,640
The championship ring.

479
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,230
It might be too big for you.

480
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,680
Who says that?

481
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,280
I can put it on my bracelet.

482
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,430
Or I can just buy another bracelet especially for this.

483
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,920
He will surely fulfill his dream.

484
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,560
Because he's worked so hard,

485
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,840
and he's so exceptional.

486
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,760
Let's get married.

487
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,280
Alright?

488
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,400
It's not that

489
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,840
I didn't want to say yes.

490
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,160
I think

491
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,600
I was just waiting for this moment,

his proudest moment.

Let's get married after the competition.

506
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,160
When I see these young kids,

507
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,240
it's like seeing myself ten years ago.

508
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,540
I felt on top of the world back then.

509
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,920
Failure is not a word

510
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,640
I'm familiar with.

511
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,960
You were born to be a CTF player.

512
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm not sociable.

513
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,280
CTF competitions are on

514
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,000
a loud, brightly lit stage.

515
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,110
But that is the only world

516
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,920
where I could find peace and quiet.

517
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,400
I told you,

518
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,880
never get involved in CTF.

519
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,600
But if you do,

520
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,600
then you'd better win.

521
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,600
It's that simple.

522
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,760
However,

523
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,360
I quit first.

524
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,080
Because I feared the unknown,

525
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,120
possibly losing,

526
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,680
and betrayal.

527
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,600
Only then did I realize,

528
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,040
I wasn't all that great.

529
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,880
I was hiding and crying

530
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
inside a suit of armor.

531
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,560
Then what should I do?

532
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,480
Because I failed,

533
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,000
so should I hand my dream

534
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,240
over to other people?

535
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,360
The boys of K&K

536
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,080
are lucky to have you.

537
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,600
They're lucky to have you.

538
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,360
These young men have their dreams.

539
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,240
And the most important thing is

540
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,400
they are working hard...

541
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,320
Maybe only those who recognize their weaknesses

542
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,720
can become stronger.

543
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I decided

544
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,600
to work with those who failed many times,

545
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,680
but got back up again

546
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
and just like me,

547
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,280
vowed to protect something even more

548
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,920
important than their dignity,

549
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,240
their dreams.

550
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,650

552
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,160
This is a hard road.

553
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,800
Some succeed.

554
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,600
Some quit.

555
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,880
But all of them have come here,

556
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,600
and fought.

557
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
They made those

558
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,040
who doubted them ashamed.

559
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,520
They showed direction

560
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,760
to people who had no goals.

561
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,640
They believed that

562
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,420
they were able to build their future

563
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,440

You made me lose this pass.

567
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,840
Take it with you

568
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,160
and win the game.

570

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,980
because you can live a good life with money.

572
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,430
But people are great because they have dreams.

573
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,200
So, my dream has not changed.

574
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,920
I want to help them

575
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,710
claim the world title for China.

576
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,960
We just won the national championship

577
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,360
and you want to give up?

578
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,220
People with dreams

579
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,600
are always young.

580
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,280
This is my own decision!

581
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,540
You think all I care about is winning?!

582
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,770
We're no longer a team!

583
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,880
What's the point of going on?

584
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,280
For ten years,

585
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,480
I never once thought of making a comeback.

586
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,960
I thought I had let go of

587
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,640
my youthful desires,

588
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,440
and my yearning for recognition,

589
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,560
but I realized that day,

590
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,360
although it had been so many years,

591
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,040
those who had been silently protecting us

592
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,680
had never given up their dedication.

593
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,240
They were dedicated to their dreams.

594
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,260
It reminds them of their youth.

595
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,470
It's short but brilliant,

596
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,360
confusing but passionate.

597
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,060
It's okay to fail.

598
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,180
Everyone has some regrets in life.

599
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,440
Look at these kids.

600
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,100
Even if there were only one of them left,

601
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,000
they would keep fighting till the end,

602
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,990
because they are not alone.

603
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,760
The youthful energy of past CTF players

604
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,840
is supporting them.

605
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,960
They are carrying

606
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,560
the hope and hardships

607
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,770
of every Chinese CTF player

608
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,740
who has played in the past ten years.

609
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,320
In my heart,

610
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,480
you're the best captain in all of China.

611

612
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,160
and those who are fighting off the stage,

613
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,920
thank you all.

00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
would you be that cruel to a sick person?

661
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,400
This is

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,320
the best year in my life.

663
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,200
Boss, let me join the world finals

664
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,000
and win this huge honor for China.

665
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,360
Let's wait and see.

666
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,520
Okay, because of what you just said,

667
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,360
listen up.

668
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,000
It's K&K's treat today.

669
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,800
Let's have feast.

670
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,080
Come on!

671
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,360
Since it's K&K's treat,

672
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,200
we'll have some food delivered to our club.

673
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,640
You've never visited K&K before, right?

674
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,920
Awesome. I've been dying to go there!

675
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,760
Okay. Tonight, let's have a feast

676
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,720
at K&K!

677
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,400
Yay! Great!

678
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,320
It's my treat.

679
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,440
Great!

680
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,280
Don't feel bad about ordering

681
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,480
something expensive then, okay?

682
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,040
Okay!

683
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,120
Take them out to the bus.

684
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,000
I have something to do.

685
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Go ahead.

686
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,320
Shoafei, let's go.

687
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,120
Come here.

688
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,000
Let's go.

689
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,440
Go where?

690
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,040
Aren't we...

691
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,440
going to celebrate with all of them?

692
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Yes, of course.

693
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,880
But I have something

694
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,400
more important to do right now.

695
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,910
Can I take her?

696
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,080
No problem. She's yours.

697
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,360
♪ However the weather is I will enjoy it ♪

698
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,280
Wait a moment.

699
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,920
Huh?

700
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,240
♪ I will embrace the rainbow after the storm ♪

701
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,120
Solo, do me a favor.

702
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
What's so urgent?

703
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,830
Come with me to the lounge.

704
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,430
Right now?

705
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,240
What's going on?

706
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,590
♪ The night swallows me like a dark hole ♪

707
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,710
I have no idea either.

708
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,520

719
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,480
Why act so shy?

720
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,720
Want to have some coffee?

721
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,390
Okay.

722
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,200
Let's go.

723
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,520
Why are you in such a hurry?

724
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,680
What is so urgent?

725
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,440
Follow me.

726
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,240
Get out. Out.

727
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,880
What is so mysterious?

728
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,680
Take off your shirt.

729
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,680
What?

730
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,200
Come on. Do it.

731
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,080
You brought me here to take off my clothes?

732
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,280
There's no one here. Hurry up.

733
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,800
No, no, no. Explain to me first.

734
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,360
Why should I take my clothes off?

735
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,080
I'm going to Tong Nian's home.

736
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,030
I need to borrow your clothes for several hours.

737
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,640
Are they holding a celebration party for you?

738
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,760
Alright.

739
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
You should wear something more formal.

740
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,320
Do you need a suit coat?

741
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,400
Why would you bring a suit coat on such a hot day?

742
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,740
I have to wear it at the press conference.

743
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,860
Just in case.

744
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,000
You don't understand.

745
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,800
You never handle things like that.

746
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,800
Hurry up.

747
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,560
Okay.

748
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,300
I can't go out there without any clothes.

749
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,400
Take off your clothes for me.

750
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,800
Hey, I'll do it myself.

751
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,200
Hurry up.

752
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,680
Faster. Let me help.

753
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,960
Take this.

754
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,120
Jiahao, are they inside?

755
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,880
Let us in.

756
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,920
No, you can't go in.

757
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,000
Why not?

758
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,280
Boss said no one can go in.

759
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,040
What are they doing?

760
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,280
I don't know.

761
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,960
We can't go in?

762
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,080
Watch out.

763
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,400
What...

764
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,600
Excuse me.

765
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,440
Excuse me.

766
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,040
Hey, what are you guys doing?

767
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,880
We're not outsiders.

768
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,280
One more minute.

769
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,240
What are you doing in there?

770
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,600
Is this some kind of game?

771
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,360
A game?

772
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,080
What's going on?

773
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,400
I... I don't know.

774
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
I don't know.

775
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,640
Boss,

776
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,520
why did you change clothes with Solo?

777
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,440
Who are you trying to fool?

778
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,240
Shut up.

779
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,400
Let's go.

780
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Where are you going?

781
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
Keep in touch.

782
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,680
Oh my God.

783
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,160
Lan Mei, what happened to your husband?

784
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,480
Why is he crying?

785
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,000
He's too excited.

786
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,600
He's been a huge fan for years.

787
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,360
So I took this chance

788
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,280
and bring him to meet his idols.

789
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,640
Gun, congrats.

790
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,000
You finally won the championship.

791
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,440
Stop crying.

792
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,160
If you cry whenever we win,

793
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,200
you'll become blind.

794
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,120
Okay.

795
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,520
Are you guys busy today?

796
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
If not, come to our club for the celebration party.

797
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,120
Really?

798
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,200
Of course.

799
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,680
See you later.

800
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,000
See you later.  -Bye.

801
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,640
Dear!

802
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,040
Can I really go there?

803
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,200
Can I really go there?

804
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,400
Of course you can go.

805
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
I mean, she's like Tong Nian's sister,

806
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,760
and that makes you her brother-in-law,

807
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
so we are relatives.

808
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,640
Come with us.

809
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,320
Let's go.

810
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,800
Let's get packed up and go back to K&K.

811
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,720
Wait, wait, wait.

812
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,080
Isn't she that actress?

813
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,420
I love her TV series.

814
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,080
Yes, yes, it's her.

815
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,480
Thank you.

816
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,600
Can we take a photo with you?

817
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,520
Of course.

818
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,120
Get a phone. Quick.

819
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,840
Calm down.

820
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,240
She didn't come here for you.

821
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,960
97.

822
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,200
97?

823
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,080
Hello.

824
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,160
Can you give your fan your signature?

825
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,640
My... my fan?

826
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,440
Yes.

827
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,400
I am a big fan.

828
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,840
Could you sign this for me?

829
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,240
Yes, yes.

830
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,640
Hey, Mr. Xiang,

831
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,600
you are abusing your power.

832
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,480
Come on, give him some face.  -Okay.

833
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,000
You are the Asian champions,

834
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,680
of course people love you.

835
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,680
Well done, 97.

836
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,480
Thank you.

837
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:03,720
Well, then,

838
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,000
could you sign something for me, too?

839
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,120
Of course.

840
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,360
Please sign something for me.

841
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,080
Granny,

842
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,480
it's Shaofei.

843
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,960
I wanted to tell you,

844
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,960
I won the championship.

845
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,080
I won the championship with Shangyan.

846
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,530
We finally did it.

847
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
That's my boy. Well done.

848
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,600
Congratulations.

849
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,840
Congratulations.

850
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,400
We're all here, me, your mom,

851
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,720
and your granny all want to congratulate you.

852
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,000
Yes, yes.

853
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,320
Yes.

854
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,240
Granny, thank you for

855
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,040
always, well uh...

856
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,520
supporting me.

857
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Granny, I... I will let you

858
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,480
talk to the girl I like, okay?

859
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,240
A girl?

860

I... I don't know if I am.
