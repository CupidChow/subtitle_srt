I'm leaving.

Can't we sit down and talk?

Shaofei has my number.

32

Call me before midnight tonight.

-Shangyan!  -Shangyan!

We're all friends here.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,360
Why can't we just sit down and talk?

36
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,080
Shangyan!

37
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,900
Shaofei.

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,410
It's been a long time.

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,750
Ten years!

40
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,250
Wow! You sure know me well.

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,790
Sit, let's get down to business.

42
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,450
You should have told me earlier.

43
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,390
You know he hates surprises.

44
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,750
Would that work?

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
It wouldn't.

46
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,870
You know what he's like.

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,640
I'll see if I can talk some sense into him later.

48
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,580
So, is it business or...?

49
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,660
No.  -Yes.

50
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,830
It is business.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,330
You came all the way here to talk business?

52
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm already retired.

53
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,200
We'd like you

54
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,990
to join our team.

55
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,330
So you and Han Shangyan

56
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,870
came to me for the same thing?

57
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,290
Is that why he came here?

58
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,410
I said no to him,

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,540
and I'll say the same thing to you.

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,450
I'm retired, and that's it.

61
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,660
Don't waste your time on me.

62
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,950
It's not just the two of us.

63
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,080
Ai Qing joined us, too.

64
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,900

may I have your attention please?

74
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,990
Thanks.

75
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,040
It's been a while.

76
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,580
I didn't expect that

77
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,200
you'd agree

78
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,290
to be the coach of SP.

79
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,450
The last 2 years,

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,850
I've taken jobs that weren't related to CTF at all.

81
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,950
I did make some money,

82
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,000
but I still missed the days

83
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
when I was a CTF player.

84
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,440
If we hadn't broken up back then,

85
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,330
things would have played out differently.

86
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,080
You can't change the past.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,120
The present

88
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,950
is what matters.

89
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,990
Right.

90
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,010
Back then,

91
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,510
you were the reason why so many people

92
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,730
became fans of CTF, Ai Qing.

93
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,200
So what do you plan to do next?

94
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,160
The first thing is to

95
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,660
have Shaofei and Ou Qiang join us.

96
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,080
Which means...

97
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,230
I want to lead them back to the top.

98
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,460
We'll fight for glory as we did in the old days.

99
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,540
You're all we need!

100
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,080
You're all we need.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,950
She signed the contract?

102
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,990
She did.

103
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,660
But I didn't tell her

104
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,120
that I was coming here.

105
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,660
If you agree,

106
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,330
she'll be thrilled.

107
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,750
I want to give her a surprise.

108
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,830
What about Shangyan?

109
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,750
You know he's the leader of K&K.

110
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,700
We had a match a few days ago.

111
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,410
I know that.

112
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,370
He wants me to join him,

113
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,000
and you want me to join you.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,250
Do I have to choose between you two?

115
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,750
The point is

116
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,370
if you're still interested.

117
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,750
Do you want to come back?

118
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,750
Considering your age,

119
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,250
this could very well be

120
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,370
your last chance.

121
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,070
I don't have it in me anymore.

122
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,580
I've been retired for years.

123
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,870
That's not what matters here!

124
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,910
What matters is, do you want to?

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,620
Do you want to come back or not?

126
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Do you want to win back what you once lost?

127
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,320
Do you want to be the world champion again?

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
Give me your cup!

129
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,790
Man, why are you still hesitating?

130
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,830
I really don't understand.

131
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,870
I know you want to come back.

132
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,200
So whose team will you join?

133
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,000
Mine or his?

134
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,040
Your team.

135
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,040
That's all I want to hear!

136
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,200
Back then,

137
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,120
you led us to win.

138
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,790
Solo,

139
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,870
you were my first captain.

140
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,130
I also hope you'll be my last captain.

141
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,410
I never expected you would say that.

142
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,360
I let you down once,

143
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,280
and the guilt has been killing me.

144
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,990
Thank you.

145
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,310
I know you've never given up on it.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,220
You're the best when it comes to CTF.

147
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,500
You were there when no one knew what CTF was,

148
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,410
and you have never left.

149
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,250
I admire that.

150
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,730
Now we are all on the same page.

151
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,950
It's been 10 years.

152
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,950
It wasn't easy

153
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,000
for us to come back together.

154
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,500
Let's raise our cups.

155
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,790
Come on, raise them!

156
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,910
To becoming

157
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,620
world champions!

158
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,990
To winning gold medals!

159
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,250
Damn right!

160
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,360
I'm glad

161
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,080
that you're finally back.

162
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,040
I didn't know we'd play against you

163
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,040
in the tournament.

164
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,750
If I had known

165
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,580
that you were the leader of K&K,

166
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,200
I would have been there myself.

167
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,080
We are rivals.

168
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,330
You should be aware of that.

169
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,500
Well,

170
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,700
it's been so many years.

171
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,370
How have you been?

172
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,040
What is it?

173
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,080
Just say what you have to say.

174
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,530
Okay.

175
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,750
Simply put,

176
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,010
I have convinced Shaofei to join my team.

177
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,450
We've got his contract ready.

178
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,160
Now we only need his signature.

179
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
Oh, wow.

180
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,200
Should I be impressed?

181
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,660
You know

182
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,160
I didn't come here to show off.

183
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,290
I don't have to.

184
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,450
Because in my eyes,

185
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,540
you are and will always be the best.

186
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,870
Shaofei thinks the same.

187
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,870
I didn't force him to join.

188
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,990
He thinks SP suits him more.

189
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,330
I'll give him the best resources.

190
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,330
I'll train him,

191
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,950
and make him ready to compete.

192
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,910
If that's his choice,

193
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,040
I respect it.

194
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,790
So you're gonna give up?

195
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,370
That's not like you.

196
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,830
He gave up on me.

197
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,160
I didn't give up on him.

198
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,830
I'll take good care of him.

199
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,990
I'll hold you to it.

200
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,400
You'll have to answer to me if you fail him.

201
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,580
He's also my friend.

203
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,200

Really?

207
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,600
I thought we could catch up a little, you know.

208
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,580
I'm not interested to do so.

209
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,410
See you in the next match.

210
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,870
A few days ago,

211
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,660
Ai Qing saw you in Singapore.

212
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,660
She was overjoyed.

213
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,370
I know that.

214
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,160
It's been 10 years.

215
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,950
If you were

216
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,620
in my position back then,

217
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,710
you could have made the same decision.

218
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,870
I'll leave you be.

219
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,830
Get some rest.

220
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,630
We're team Solo!

221
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,830
We're national champions!

222
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:11,100
Solo! Solo! Solo!

223
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,350
Now, let's welcome the MVP

224
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,990
to say something to us!

225
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,200
Gun, say something!

226
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,790
Gun!

227
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,950
Say something, come on!

228
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,700
Tell us how you feel!

229
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,500
Shangyan, say something.

230
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,580
Over the past 2 years and 3 months,

231
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,450
we've won,

232
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,750
and we've lost.

233
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,120
We've laughed,

234
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,330
and we've cried.

235
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,410
There were questions,

236
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,410
scandals,

237
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,910
slanders, and misunderstandings.

238
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,330
We've never

239
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,250
attempted to explain.

240
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,830
All good things come to an end.

241
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,700
We've won,

242
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,620
but will we keep winning?

243
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,560
I've decided

244
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,000
that starting from today,

245
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,450
I'm no longer with team Solo.

246
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,740
What?

247
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,370
And,

248
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,080
I'm officially retiring.

249
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,830
Shangyan!

250
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,080
Why?!

251
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,910
Why are you retiring?

252
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,500
What's the reason?

253
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,330
Han Shangyan!

254
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,700
Han Shangyan!

255
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,160
Gun, say something!

256
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,280
Why are you retiring?

257
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,120
What's going on?

258
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,370

268
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,080
Buddy, just calm down.

269
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,080
Han Shangyan!

270
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,450
Han Shangyan, calm down!

271
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,520
You can't just walk away like this!

272
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,400
You could at least talk with us first!

273
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,410
Calm down, okay?

274
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,870
We just won the championship.

275
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,860
Things will only get better!

276
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,540
Don't be so impulsive.

277
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,690
Don't just say you want to retire!

278
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,000
We are all in this together!

279
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,390
I don't see the point of staying

280
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,500
if we are losing someone.

281
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,990
And the person we're gonna lose

282
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,360
once told me we had a future,

283
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,630
that we'll go places!

284
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,250
Calm down okay?

285
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,200
I never should have trusted you.

286
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,840
Can I say something please, everyone?

287
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,120
Shangyan, don't do this.

288
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,920
We just won the championship.

289
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,850
There are fans and reporters waiting for us.

290
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,410
Let's talk about this

291
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,190
at the celebration party tonight,

292
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,410
we'll figure something out!

293
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,120
Yeah.

294
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,200
Is that okay?

295
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,620
Shangyan!

296
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,040
See you at the party!

297
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,950
We just won the national championship

298
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,370
and you want to give up?

299
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,910
We could win the world championship.

300
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,450
Why don't we fight for it? Why?

301
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,580
Well, a toast to you all.

302
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,000
Guys, I wish you all the best.

303
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,870
I'll leave for my hometown soon.

304
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,910
Shaofei, what the hell?

305
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,330
So you're leaving us too?

306
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,250
Shaofei, you can't do this to us.

307
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,180
I've... made up my mind.

308
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,700
About what?

309
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,660
I want to retire

310
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,240
and help my mom with her store at home.

311
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,120
Do you have to make things worse?

312
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,370
You are so young, don't give up!

313
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,080
Shaofei.

314
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,410
Think before you act.

315
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,580
I've thought about it.

316
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,830
Don't be like Shangyan!

317
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,500
This is my own decision!

318
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,580
You think all I care about is winning?!

319
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,800
We're no longer a team!

320
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,120
What's the point of going on?

321
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,500
Grow a spine and get yourself together!

322
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,540
Shangyan, where have you been?

323
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,610
Why didn't you answer my calls?

324
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,620
I've called you a million times!

325

Morning.

353

Here is your passport,

00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,330
and your bonus.

355
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,920

you can only compete as an individual.

Shangyan cracked their defence

Hey,

I think I've met him before.

00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,540
Yes, Granny.

405
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,950
He's my best friend, Shangyan.

Oh. Right, right, right.

407
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,790
No wonder he looks so familiar.

00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:16,519
Hey,

409
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,830
have you packed your things?

410
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,200

416
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:34,780
Hey.

417
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,120
What's wrong?

418
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,830
He didn't pay for the booze.

419
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,580
Come on! It's on the house!

420
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,990
Really?

421
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,870

422
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,040

Breakfast is ready.

427
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,540
Let's go home.

428
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,040
What's this sad look about?

429
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,500
He never showed up again.

430
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,120
Hey, wait.

431
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,640
I've got something to do.

432
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,450
You go ahead.

433
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,370
Talk to you later.

434
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,580

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,200
Right, right, right.

What's the rush?

437
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,620
Why are you back?

438
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,750
It's an emergency.

439
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,580
Hey, dude.

440
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,500
What's up?

441
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,360
You play this a lot?

442
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,990
Yeah.

443
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,580
What's the name of this game?

444
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,000
Come on, you own this place,

445
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,830
and you don't know?

446
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,950
I don't play games much.

447
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,040
It's called Escape Room.

448
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,770
Oh,

449
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,580
so how do I find out

450
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,290
who was just playing this game?

451
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,330
Well,

452
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,380
all you need is his or her user name.

453
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,910
Then how can I find out the user name?

454
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,440
Buddy, are you listening to yourself?

455
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
How would I know?

456
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,120
Right.

457
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,410
Mom, Dad, I'm back.

458
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,910
You're back.

459
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:42,720
Hey.

460
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,700
Where's Dounan?

461
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,750
Why didn't he come back with you?

462
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,490
I told him to come back and eat with us.

463
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,250
Well,

464
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,950
he was about to leave with me,

465
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,580
but then he said he's got something to do.

466
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,800
You've been coming home really late recently.

467
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,660
Have you slept at all these past few days?

468
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,120
I had to stay awake,

469
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
in case there were customers.

470
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,500
He must have blocked me.

471
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,330
Tong Nian! Tong Nian!

472
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,660
What?

473
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,080
I know how to find that guy.

474
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,790
Han Shangyan?

475
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,290
Yep!

476
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,680
I watched the security footage at the cafe.

477
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,080
Yeah?

478
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,370
I found out the game he played.

479
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,120
I already knew that.

480
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,830
It's Escape Room.

481
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,519
You don't play games,

482
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,400
how did you know?

483
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,410
I signed up for their theme song contest.

484
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,640
Knowing what game he played won't help.

485
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,200
It won't lead me to him.

486
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,830
Yes, it can.

487
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,910
It can?

488
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,290
Yes.

489
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,540
You mean it?

490
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,450
100%.

491
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,960
Also, you can use my friend's account.

492
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,290
Isn't it convenient?

493
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,500
Okay, let's do this.  -Bravo!

494
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,580
Let's see how it works.

495
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,000
You're a genius!

496
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,830
So here's the thing.

497
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,120
Log in first.

498
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,450
Okay.

499
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,040
Enter the password.

500
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,200
You're in.

501
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,750
Mr. Handsome?

502
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,500
That's the user name.

503
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,700
Now you can add him as your friend.

504
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,660
Let's search for him.

505
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,040
Grunt?

506
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,380
No wonder his WeChat name is GN.

507
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,410
So his name is Grunt.

508
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,700
What a cool name!

509
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,080
Grunt, Grunt...

510
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,790
Enough!

511
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,250
Stop your fangirling.

512
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,250
Grunt is a terrible name.

513
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,000
What do you mean?

514
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,010
It sounds sophisticated, I like it!

515
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,000
Pigs grunt.

516
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,520
Anyway it's better than your name.

517
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,150
Hey, stop!

518
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,790
Sounds like a tongue twister!

519
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,790
Stop it already!

520
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,270
Alright, here are the instructions my friend wrote.

521
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,750
Press W, A, S, D to move.

522
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,290
Try it.

523
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,660
Left click,

524
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:11,990
to shoot.

525
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,830
Before each game you need to buy weapons.

526
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,950
If you win in the previous round,

527
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,370
you'll need better weapons for the next one.

528
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,830
The rules are simple.

529
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,660
You need to practice

530
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,660
and you'll get there.

531
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,790
A smart girl like you

532
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,200
can master it after a few rounds.

533
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,290
Practice makes perfect.

534
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,700
Can't argue with that.

535
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,660
Let's send him a friend request.

536
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,580
Okay.

537
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,480
= Send friend request =

538
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,580
Hold on, hold on!

539
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,790
I'm so nervous.

540
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,120
Do you want to do this or not?

541
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,290
= Send friend request =

542
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,040
Okay, do it.

543
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,390
The player is currently on another server.

544
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,950
Thank god!

545
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,820
I thought he was just going to ignore my invitation.

546
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,160
I was so nervous!

547
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,040
How much longer do we have to wait?

548
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,290
I don't know.

549
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,340
= Grunt has added you as a friend =

550
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,700
Dounan!

551
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,540
Hu Dounan!

552
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,750
Come here! Come here!

553
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,190
Look! Did he accept my request?

554
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:28,790
Hurry!

555
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,330
Are we friends now?

556
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,290
Did he accept my request?

557
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,540
Calm down.

558
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,410
Okay, okay.

559
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,450
When we enter the game,

560
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,790
say hello to him and be cool, okay?

561
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,990
Okay, I will, I will.

562
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,540
So what do we do now?

563
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,700
Invite him to join your team.

564
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,290
Okay.

565
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,790
Yeah, click here.

566
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,410
Did he accept it?

567
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Did he accept?

568
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,370
Oh no.

569
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,200
What's wrong?

570
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,700
He's joined another team.

571
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,830
He's gone.

572
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,700
What should I do?

573
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,910
Find him for me! Find him!

574
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,950
You can look for him in the public channel,

575
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,750
or maybe you will

576
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,290
bump into him in the game.

577
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,620
How do I bump into him?

578
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,080
Relax, okay?

579
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,500
Although he's with another team,

580
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,460
you can still say hi to him, you know?

581
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,520
Approach him as a friend.

582
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,330
Okay, okay.

583
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:06,830
Right.

584
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,540
How do I say hi?

585
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,500
I just taught you, remember?

586
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,120
Here.

587
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,870
Use these 4 keys to control your character.

588
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,700
Yes, and then...

589
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,680
Come on, left click!

590
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,910
Left click!

591
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,620
You've missed your target.

592
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,740
Fire, fire, fire... Why is he still alive?

593
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,330
Jeez,  what are you doing?

594
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,160
What should I do?

595
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,200
Can you play or not?

596
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:23,870
I...

597
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,620
Go straight.

598
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,370
Stop yelling at me!

599
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,750
Go straight, go.

600
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,290
Aim, aim!

601
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,580
Fire! Fire! Fire!

602
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,700
Shoot him!

603
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,870
Aim at his head!

604
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,290
I...

605
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,370
Fire!

606
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,500
Did I just die?

607
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,290
I... I guess.

608
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,290
You got me killed!

609
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,580
I was trying to help you!

610
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,370
I... I...

611
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,160
You helped me get killed?!

612
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,750
I...

613
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,580
Don't blame me!

614
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,490
You didn't follow my instructions at all...

615
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,540
You got me killed!

616
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,920
How can you blame me?  -It's your fault!

617
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,540
How's it my fault?

618
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,580
This sucks!

619
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
I died before I could say hi to him.

620
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,500
Grunt, where's your passport?

621
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,410
Wait till I finish this round.

622
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,370
Remember to give it to me.

623
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:08,950
Okay.

624
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,410
This guy is so lame.

625
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,290
Boring!

626
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,679
It's vacation time.

627
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,639
Probably a school kid.

628
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,250
Hey, Demo!

629
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,700
Play this round for me.

630
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,370
I'll go get my passport.

631
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,790
Alright.

632
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,480
Hey.

633
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,370
Where's Boss?

634
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,620
He's sleeping.

635
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,080
He was in a really bad mood.

636
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:32,800
What?

637
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,420
Someone has been texting him on WeChat.

638
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,870
But he barely uses WeChat at all.

639
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,700
Is he seeing someone?

640
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,830
An internet cafe has been bombarding him

641
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,040
with all kinds of ads.

642
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,080
But he wouldn't let me block it,

643
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,510
saying that it's not easy to run a business.

644
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,660
So I set his phone to silent.

645
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,840
When did Boss become so kind?

646
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,370
He got stung by a bout of conscience.

647
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,840
Him going to an internet cafe is strange enough.

648
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,040
And he added some random girl?

649
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,870
And wouldn't block her?

650
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,790
Something's going on.

651
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,500
That's not like him at all.

652
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,990
Watch what you are saying!

653
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,660
Alright, I'll go get my passport.

654
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,750
Oh right.

655
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,580
That player called Mr. Handsome,

656
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,160
just ignore him.

657
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,870
He sucks.

658
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,290
He can't play at all.

659
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:16,910
Gotta go.

660
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,040
He went offline.

661
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,410
Did he leave the game?

662
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,660
He's probably taking a break,

663
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,080
right?

664
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,250
You need to learn how to play,

665
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,430
so next time you won't get killed so soon.

666
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,440
This game is really simple, you know?

667
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,130
Four keys to move, left click to shoot,

668
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,540
pretty simple, isn't it?

669
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,040
Easy-peasy.

670
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,700
Hu Dounan.

671
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,250
Yeah?

672
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,060
Can you shut up and leave me alone?

673
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,660
Sure.

674
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,910
Thank you, cousin.

675
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,790
Sure thing.

676
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,450
When I met Han Shangyan

677
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,580
at the internet cafe that night,

678
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,540
I thought he was just a game-loving geek

679
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,200
who was looking for some fun.

680
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,080
Later I realized that

681
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,000
I was totally wrong.

682
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,200
Shangyan,

683
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,990
pull back on your attack!

684
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,280
Appledog is doing well.

685
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,080
We are in!

686
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,910
Shangyan, well done!

687
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,330
You're literally unstoppable!

688
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,710
You're the best attacker I've ever seen.

689
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,450
You're getting better and better.

690
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,200
Shangyan,

691
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,500
I've always believed in you!

692
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,410
Good work!

693
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,330
Shaofei, stay focused!

694
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,500
Go go go go go, Shaofei!

695
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,580
Shaofei, follow the original plan

696
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,910
like I just said.

697
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,000
Ou Qiang, fix the loophole!

698
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,750
We're in!

699
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,520
Yes!

700
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,390
Wow!

701
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:29,830
That night,

702
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,660
he showed up at midnight.

703
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,660
Maybe... he's online now!

704
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,500
Dad?

705
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,330
Mom?

706
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,620
He's online!

707
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,950
Can I join your team?

708
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,120
Let's be friends this time.

709
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,910
Okay.

710
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,830
Great!

711
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,660
So many...

712
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,620
This one looks nice.

713
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,580
Up, down.

714
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,410
Hey, that dude with two guns,

715
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,660
why is he following Grunt?

716
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,750
Where are you going?

717
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,580
Your mouse is not working?

718
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,410
The guy in front of me is Grunt?

719
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,250
Hello, Grunt.

720
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,990
He replied!

721
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,000
But what does it mean?

722
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,250
I'll just say hi again.

723
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
Hello, Grunt.

724
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,450
Is this your first time playing?

725
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,120
No, no, no.

726
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,160
I added you this afternoon,

727
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:09,750
you remember me?

728
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,620
Press W, A, S, and D to move,

729
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,990
and left click the mouse to shoot.

730
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,020
I've done some research

731
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,790
and practised the whole afternoon.

732
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,910
I'll protect you.

733
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,000
Same reply again?

734
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,410
Did I say something wrong?

735
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,000
Where have you been all this time?

736
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,950
You're acting weird.

737
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,420
I thought you quit playing games.

738
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,370
What happened to you?

739
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,080
Are you in a bad mood?

740
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:43,870
Stop nagging.

741
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,250
You know this guy?

742
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,250
I don't.

743
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,620
Probably a kid.

744
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,910
That's a VIP account.

745
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,290
Maybe he borrowed a friend's account.

746
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,870
Kids do that all the time.

747
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,080
I'll just play with him.

748
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,950
I've seen two account hackers this week.

749
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,250
Here's another one!

750
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,290
It's so late.

751
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,750
Aren't you sleepy, hacker?

752
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,080
Kiddo, guess you need help.

753
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,830
He's not a hacker.

754
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,700
He's borrowed this account.

755
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,160
Watch out, everyone.

756
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,870
It'll be four vs. five!

757
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,790
We have Grunt, we won't lose.

758
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,620
You see the front door?

759
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:31,710
Yes, yes, I see it.

760
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,760
I've got a good computer here.

761
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,700
Hide behind it

762
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,410
until the match ends.

763
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,450
Why not get an account for yourself

764
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,950
instead of using Grunt's?

765
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,370
You wouldn't stand a chance

766
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,660
playing against me.

767
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,790
I need to take a shower.

768
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,790
Start another round for me.

769
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,330
Oh right,

770
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,620
that guy, Mr. Handsome,

771
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,080
