Hello, Sir.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,560
Hello, can you tell me

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,250
if the guest in Room 1019 is still here?

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,280
One second please.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,080
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,720
That guest has checked out.

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,920
OK, thank you.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
You missed him?

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,920
Yes.

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,880
He has checked out.

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Let me call Mr. Xiang for help.

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,720
I'll do that.

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,080
What time will Buff's train leave?

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,990
11 a.m sharp.

40
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,880
There's enough time.

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,920
Sorry.

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,880
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,480
Sorry.

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,080

Bi Dongran!

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,120
Hey! Han Shangyan!

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,400
This is a public space,

50
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,780
why are you screaming the place down?

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,320
I should have realized that you were here.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
It has been years

53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
and you still like this.

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,600
Be grateful for my super hearing.

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,750
So?

56
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:05,920
What can I do for you?

57
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,000
What's your plan?

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,800
Look for a job?

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
Of course.

60
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
I have my wife and son.

61
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,880
I have to support my family.

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,560
Keep eating.

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,560
We can talk while you eat.

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,180
Just tell me,

65
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,160
what is it?

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,800
Do you still wanna play?

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,440
What do you mean?

68
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,120
You want to sign me up?

69
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,120
You tell me.

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,640
I ran over here so early,

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,120
just to mock you,

72
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,040
and laugh at you

73
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,960
before your departure?

74
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
No you wouldn't.

75
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,560
Although we are opponents,

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm sure

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,280
you're not that kind of man.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,680
Okay,

79
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,800
tell me your reasons.

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,760
Because of your performance.

81
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,200
What do you say?

82
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,120
Not sure about the price?

83
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,800
How much are you going to pay?

84
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,920
The leader of a national champion team.

85
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,880
That sounds nice,

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,520
but is useless.

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,280
Ranks in top 4,

88
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,880
performed well this year

89
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,800
but a little too old.

90
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,080
You have two years at most

91
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
before you retire.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,960
You're right.

93
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,520
Since you're clear of it,

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,520
why do you want to hire me?

95
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,040
Listen,

96
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,320
for two years,

97
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,240
I'll pay you...

98
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,680
Can I be in the first team?

99
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,170
That's what I'm hiring you for.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,040
But you have to start from a substitute.

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,280
And you'll miss the national game this year.

102
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,080
Because you haven't

103
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,360
built rapport with your teammates.

104
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,000
OK, I accept.

105
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,280
Your participation in the game

106
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
depends on your ability

107
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,720
to co-operate with the team,

108
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,280
and your personal condition.

109
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
My plan is to

110
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,400
include you in the combat team

111
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,520
for the Asian games

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
after this national final.

113
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,040
Are you serious about what you are saying?

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,280
You tell me.

115
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,360
But if you perform poorly,

116
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,790
I can do nothing to help you.

117
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,920
It all depends on you.

118
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,440
OK, I agree.

119
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,440
Don't you want to think it over,

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,760
or request a higher salary?

121
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,120
This is your last chance.

122
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
I don't care about money.

123
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,520
I just want to compete.

124
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,680
Even in my dreams.

125
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,680
I can help you with that.

126
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,040
In K&K, minor wounds won't stop us.

127
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,960
So, if you are sick,

128
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,400
don't expect to ask for time off.

129
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,600
Okay,

130
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,760
I'll maintain my performance,

131
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,880
and you'll put me in the first team.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,920
Put this item in the contract.

133
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,920
No problem.

134
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,440
You said yes without any hesitation.

135
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,120
Wait.

136
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,800
I need a second to think.

137
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,560
Oh yeah,

138
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,840
there's something else

139
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,880
I need to tell you.

140
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,960
If I show up right now,

141
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,680
it may shake the team.

142
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,160
We can sign the contract first,

143
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,960
and don't come to the Club immediately.

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
After the national final,

145
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,680
I'll hold a meeting with them.

146
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,320
Performance is the top priority.

147
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,880
They won't say anything.

148
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,600
OK.

149
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,460
I never thought,

150
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,200
after so many things,

151
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,400
it would be you who saved me.

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
Stop being dramatic.

153
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,840
If you weren't a good player,

154
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,640
I wouldn't do it.

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,960
But in the next two months,

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,120
make sure that

157
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,520
you maintain your best performance

158
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,200
or I will cancel the contract.

159
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,840
No problem.

160
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,680
You can set your mind at rest.

161
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,440
I won't miss this opportunity.

162
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,440
That's what I want to hear.

163
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
It's best not to mess with CTF,

164
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,840
unless it's your best.

165
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
Or you'll not only disappoint others,

166
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,600
but also let yourself down.

167
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,600
Yes.

168
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,280
But my other teammates...

169
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,450
Their performance failed to meet my standards.

170
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,080
I understand.

171
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,240
Go realize your champion dreams

172
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,560
by yourself.

173
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,870
Look at this station.

174
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,750
There are so many people here.

175
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,350
How many among them

176
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,600
can realize their dreams,

177
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,320
and return home with honors?

178
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,720
Living in this world,

179
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,880
we're all supported

180
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,400
by our dreams.

181
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,520
Hold it,

182
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
you have to pay for

183
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,080
the wasted train ticket!

184
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,600
OK.

Let Buff stay at your place first.

194
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
He'll join us after the national final.

195
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,440
OK.

196
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,520
I've paid the rent and the Internet bill.

197
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,640
Better not waste it.

198
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,640
Give me the receipt,

199
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,320
I'll reimburse you.

200
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,320
Forget it.

201
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,720
Stop pretending you're a millionaire.

202
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,970
I'm your accountant right now.

203
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,760
I'll be quite clear

204
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,560
you are heavily in debt.

205
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,720
Can you even buy new underwear?

206
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,440
Are you wearing any today?

207
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,400
Let me check.

208
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,090
Get lost.

209
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,000
You and Tong Nian are getting along well huh?

210
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
Look at that face.

211
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,160
Something's up.

212
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,960
Look at this.

213
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,080
Look.

214
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,480
Is it that hilarious?

215
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,760
Yaya.

216
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,800
Yaya.

217
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,000
What's up?

218
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,760
Wait until I'm back.

219
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,400
Wait.

220
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,400
What's the matter?

221
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,280
Turn around.

222
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,600
I have to talk to you about something.

223
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,360
Han Shangyan told me...

224
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,000
What did he tell you?

225
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,080
He told me,

226
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,680
he wants to marry me.

227
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,800
Marry?!

228
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,000
Marry?!

229
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,160
Why so fast?

230
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,920
She's still so young.

231
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,480
Why's she in such a hurry?

232
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,320
I don't know.

233
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,040
You're getting married?!

234
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,440
You're getting married?!

235
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,120
You, you, you're getting married?!

236
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,320
At your age,

237
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,840
you should be in a hurry.

238
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,760
But,

239
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,120
Han Shangyan,

240
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,090
no offense,

241
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,040
except for being handsome,

242
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,440
you are nothing of a good husband.

243
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,000
But you found someone

244
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
who's willing to marry you.

245
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,880
Best wishes.

246
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,000
You are no better.

247
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,160
Boss, you're getting married!

248
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,680
You just kissed each other

249
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,040
and you getting married?

250
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,360
This is so fast.

251
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,720
I think it over.

252
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,120
I think it's a good thing

253
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,480
for us to get married.

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,520
You're enchanted by his appearance.

255
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm not.

256
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
I don't wanna break up with him anyway.

257
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,160
If so,

258
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,720
we're gonna get married someday right?

259
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,160
But I have to remind you this.

260
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Don't be mad.

261
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,720
Out with it.

262
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
He only cares about the competitions.

263
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,400
You are not angry with it?

264
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,320
Right.

265
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
He's ten years older than you.

266
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,040
Won't you think it over?

267
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,000
Right.

268
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,000
He's notorious for his bad temper.

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,320
You're not afraid of it?

270
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,280
Right.

271
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,680
Won't you feel sad if he loses his temper?

272
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,680
Right.

273
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,600
Not at all.

274
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,780
A man without his own career is but a loser.

275
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,240
Moreover,

276
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,680
although he's much older,

277
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,920
we have no trouble

278
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,200
finding things to talk about.

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,400
And you don't understand

280
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,560
how good-tempered he is.

281
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,720
He's so kind.

282
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,800
A great cook, and a sports lover.

283
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
In fact, you all misunderstand him.

284
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,280
Most of the time,

285
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,920
he's so gentle.

286
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,480
So, so gentle.

287
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,440
So, so, so gentle.

288
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,640
Gentle?

289
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
Are we talking about the same guy?

290
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,080
Of course.

291
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,720
Oh my god.

292
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,360
I can't persuade her.

293
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,440
She's now

294
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,400
totally blinded by love.

295
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,480
Anyway, he's the best.

296
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,640
None of your business.

297
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,840
Please don't.

298
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,680
Why are you eavesdropping?

299
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

300
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,000
That's all?

301
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,280
I swear I'll keep it a secret.

302
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,040
Zip your mouth, understand?

303
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,000
My neck. My neck.

304
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Let's go.

305
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,400
Go back to training.

306
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
Strike while the iron is hot.

307
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
I'll move out today.

308
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,350
So Buff can move in tomorrow.

309
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,760
Grunt,

310
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,760
Demon.

311
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,480
What's up?

312
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Big news!

313
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,560
What?

314
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,800
Boss,

315
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,760
is getting married!

316
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,680
Are you sure?

317
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,440
Is it true?

318
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,600
Well done, Tong Nian!

319
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,200
No, no, no. Wait a moment.

320
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,720
Are you sure?

321
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,320
Getting married is the last thing

322
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,360
in the world Boss would do.

323
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,560
Sure as a gun.

324
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Boss told the leader

325
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,720
himself in the Tea Room.

326
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,240
How could it not be true?

327
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,240
What else did they say?

328
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,960
I didn't hear everything.

329
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,400
They were talking about

330
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,160
wedding dresses, candies and so on.

331
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,480
Then boss discovered me.

332
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,520
So I ran over here.

333
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,720
I guess they're gonna live together!

334
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,840
Wait, wait.

335
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,560
Does it mean

336
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,800
they're gonna sleep in one bed?

337
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,700
♪ And I'm ready to take you to the top ♪

338
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,620
♪ I will show you the most beautiful view ♪

339
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,720
♪ I want to cheer you up with a happy tune ♪

340
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,200
You may not know this.

341
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,760
Your mom's got a problem with me.

342
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,340
I haven't figured out how to clear the air.

343
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,660
If I go tell her we're getting married,

344
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm afraid

345
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,840
she'll come after me with a knife.

346
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,360
Get down.

347
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,640
What... What's wrong?

348
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,120
Your dad's coming.

349
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,960
My dad?

350
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,600
He walks the dog every morning.

351
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,520
Don't let him see me

352
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,840
or he'll kill me.

353
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,960
Tong Nian, are you alright?

354
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,350
Why you are laughing and sighing?

355
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,120
I'm just thinking,

356
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,680
he wants to marry me,

357
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,720
and I'm willing to marry him,

358
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,000
but how should I persuade my parents,

359
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,840
especially my mom.

360
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,880
She hates him.

361
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,000
I think

362
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,880
you can ask him

363
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,360
to visit your family often,

364
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
to help your mom

365
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,840
with some household chores.

366
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,360
How can I do that?

367
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,030
My parents think we have broken up.

368
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,280
We didn't tell them

369
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,320
we got together again.

370
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,360
Then,

371
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,640
you must find a chance

372
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,960
to give them some hints.

373
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,000
I wouldn't dare.

374
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm afraid if I tell them,

375
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,240
they will go to Han Shangyan,

376
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,400
and give him a hard time.

377
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,720
I don't want him to suffer this.

378
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,520
I don't want to make him unhappy.

379
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,280
I don't want anyone

380
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,560
to misunderstand him.

381
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
Especially my mom.

382
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,520
I don't want him to know

383
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,680
my mom dislikes him so much.

384
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,320
I think

385
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,960
you should drop this right now.

386
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,840
Let's go help

387
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,320
Shaofei clean the apartment.

388
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,800
Shaofei.

389
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,280
Quick, get ready.

390
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,720
Come in and have a look.

391
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,640
It's very nice here.

392
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,440
There is also kitchenware.

393
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,040
Hello.

394
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,800
Hello.

395
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm cleaning the bathroom.

396
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,880
Tong Nian has gone out

397
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,320
to buy some food and drinks.

398
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,840
She wants to leave you

399
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,520
something to eat in the fridge.

400
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
She's so sweet.

401
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,040
I've paid the rent for three months.

402
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,920
You can stay here.

403
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,520
OK.

404
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,640
I've cleaned the bathroom.

405
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,200
The toiletries are ready for you.

406
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:53,820
Thank you.

407
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,680
Take a rest.

408
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,640
I can manage the rest.

409
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,480
Put all this stuff down

410
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,600
and take a rest.

411
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,440
Everything's done.

412
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,560
Is she your wife?

413
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,280
She's so kind.

414
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,310
She's not my wife.

415
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,920
Oh, not married yet!

416
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,030
Then I'll prepare a big wedding gift!

417
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,510
No, no, no.

418
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,440
He's not...

419
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,670
I... I'm Han Shangyan's girlfriend's classmate.

420
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,920
I'm her best friend.

421
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,510
Oh, I see.

422
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,600
But I see you two are quite close.

423
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,480
Friends help each other.

424
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,120
"Friends".

425
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,920
I... I'll go check Tong Nian.

426
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,840
She has been gone

427
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,920
for a long time.

428
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,880
-OK.  -Right.

429
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,000
She likes you.

430
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,680
No way.

431
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,560
Go look around.

432
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
She's good.

433
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
She's good. She's good.

434
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,560
Try this.

435
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,040
No. You eat it.

436
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,960
OK, I'll eat it.

437
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,240
It's too hot.

438
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
The sun is burning.

439
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,000
Right?

440
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,520
Let's start to work.

441
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:06,920
Hey.

442
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,600
What's wrong?

443
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,600
What?

444
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,960
You want to dance?

445
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,040
Stand here.

446
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,080
Stay in the shade.

447
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,960
Let me carry them.

448
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
How can I stand here

449
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,680
and leave you to do all the work?

450
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,480
Keep eating your ice-cream.

451
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,400
You are back.

452
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,560
He's carrying it all

453
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,040
and you're supervising him?

454
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,280
I told you

455
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,600
he's so gentle.

456
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,200
You see?

457
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,760
I thought Han Shangyan

458
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,680
was an untameable, wild beast,

459
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,640
but I never expected you'd have

460
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,560
the talent to tame him.

461
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,520
Of course.

462
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,640
Come on, let's get some boxes.

463
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,480
Take a light one.

464
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,200
-What's this?  -Pot.

465
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,200
Leave them to me.

466
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,960
Can you carry them?

467
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,920
Let me help.

468
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,560
It's OK.

469
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,320
He's so handsome.

470
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,080
Yes, yes, he's handsome.

471
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
Isn't he handsome?

472
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,960
I love him so much.

473
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,360
I love him more and more.

474
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,240
-Look at this happiness.  -So handsome.

475
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,920
Alright.

476
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,720
Let's go upstairs.

477
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,640
-Come on.  -Let's go.

478
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,760
Shut it.

479
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,600
Press this.

480
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,320
Come on.

481
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,880
Let's go.

482
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Han Shangyan, do you know

483
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,080
I've had so much to say to you

484
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
for all these years?

485
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,400
A toast to you.

486
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm fine.

487
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,400
Are you OK?

488
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,160
I' m fine. I' m fine.

489
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,600
I' m fine.

490
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm too happy.

491
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,480
He's fine.

492
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,520
I'm happy.

493
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,760
Han Shangyan, really,

494
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,040
you're too impulsive.

495
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,360
Why didn't you participate in

496
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,240
the world championship that year?

497
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,320
Even if you wanted to retire,

498
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,480
you could have done it after

499
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,040
you won the championship.

500
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,160
Shaofei, did you know,

501
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,800
I, Buff,

502
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,680
was the only one

503
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
who could defeat Han Shangyan.

504
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,920
If he won the world championship,

505
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,280
I'd have become a better player

506
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,160
than the world champion.  -Yes, yes.

507
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,680
I defeated you once.

508
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,040
So I'm even better than the one

509
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,680
better than the world champion.

510
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,200
Am I right?

511
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,360
Shangyan.

512
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:31,960
OK.

513
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,320
You know what?

514
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,680
Listen up here.

515
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
If Han Shangyan

516
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,200
didn't retire that year,

517
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,040
the world champion that year

518
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,960
would have been China!

519
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,320
I mean it.

520
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,240
It's a pity, really.

521
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,240
Here, Han Shangyan.

522
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,200
Another toast to you.

523
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,480
I,

524
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
want to thank you

525
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,520
for helping me out.

526
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,040
And you.

527
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,800
Whoever brings me back to the games

528
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,760
is my life-saver.

529
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,440
Like you,

530
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,520
and you, too.

531
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,720
Cheers.

532
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,480
Cheers.

533
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,880
Are you able to drive?

534
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,000
Of course.

535
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,600
I just got my license.

536
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,280
Legally.

537
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,960
Why'd you get a driver's license?

538
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,600
I knew there would be

539
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,400
occasions like today.

540
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,320
If you drink,

541
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,400
I can drive.

542
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,800
Just in case.

543
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
Seat belt.

544
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Are you ready?

545
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,120
I'm gonna start it up.

546
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,240
OK. Started.

547
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,920
Then,

548
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,040
clutch.

549
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,040
Handbrake.

550
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,120
This is an automatic-transmission.

551
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,000
There's no clutch.

552
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,960
Got it.

553
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,160
Automatic.

554
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
Brake on the left,

555
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,160
accelerator on the right.

556
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,880
Don't mistake them.

557
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,840
I know.

558
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,200
I passed the exam in one go.

559
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
I know what I'm doing.

560
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,240
You got straight-A even in driving.

561
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,320
Can you stop talking to me?

562
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,800
I can't talk while driving.

563
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,760
I need to focus.

564
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,480
I'll start.

565
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Then how can I tell you the directions?

566
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,080
Can you drive or not!

567
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

568
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,240
I'm sorry. So sorry.

569
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,720
What are you doing?

570
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,680
Calling the police.

571
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,080
Calling the car service.

572
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,320
No, no. No need for that.

573
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,720
I told you I can drive.

574
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
It's just because

575
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,280
you were talking to me just now.

576
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,800
I told you not to talk to me.

577
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,080
I have to focus.

578
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,400
If you talk to me,

579
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,600
I'll get distracted.

580
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,120
You talked to me,

581
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,400
so I almost ran into someone.

582
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,200
OK.

583
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,520
I put my life in your hands, OK?

584
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,640
Don't talk to me now, really.

585
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,080
You know how to use navigation?

586
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,080
A car is coming. Let's go.

587
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,700

00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,360
No way.

591
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,920
The standard speed is 60.

592
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,160
My trainer told me so.

593
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,760
OK, here we go.

Keep off the road if you don't.

597
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,240
I'm not in his way,

598
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,560

610
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,520
Back up slowly.

611
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
Turn the wheel.

612
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,000
Turn the wheel.

613
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,560
Yes.

614
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,840
I'm on the ground floor.

615
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,280
Come down and park for me.

616
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,480
Stop asking questions.

617
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,760
Come down right now.

618
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,640
Quick.

619
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,080
No, you turned too early.

620
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,840
You turned it too hard.

621
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,280
Pull forward first. Come forward.

622
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,920
Come forward. OK.

623
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,560
Drive the car forward.

624
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,840
Not this direction.

625
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
The previous direction.

626
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,040
Now change into "R", the reverse gear.

627
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,200
And turn the wheel to the right.

628
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,040
Then take your foot off the accelerator.

629
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,960
Release the brake and reverse.

630
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,240
OK.

631
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,520
Yes, go backward.

632
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,520
Reverse.

633
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,160
Too early. Yes.

634
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,560
That's not the parking space.

635
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,040
Come on, come on.

636
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,280
Stop it. Stop it.

637
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,880
Put it into gear.

638
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,760
The forward gear.

639
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,360
Boss.

640
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,120
Boss, what's the matter?

641
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,400
Who's driving?

642
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,600
Tong Nian?

643
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,200
Go get the car into the parking space.

644
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,000
But boss,

645
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,680
can't you do that yourself?

646
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,880
I was on Facetime with my girlfriend.

647
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,240
Just do it.

648
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,440
I drank so I can't drive.

649
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,000
Tong Nian, Tong Nian.

650
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,200
Let me park it.

651
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,600
OK.

652
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,680
I...

653
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,120
I don't know what's wrong today.

654
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,960
I was an expert.

655
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,200
When I took the exam,

656
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,480
I got full points for parallel parking.

657
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,840
I made it in one shot.

658
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,320
The trainer praised me for it.

659
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,840
I don't...

660
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,120
This is reverse parking.

661
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,400
Not parallel parking?

662
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,240
They are similar.

663
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,000
Why are you laughing?

664
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,200
No reason.

665
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,600
Did you know he has a girlfriend?

666
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,840
No.

667
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,000
Now you know.

668
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,000
Tell me what you think.

669
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,960
I have nothing to say.

670
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,440
Okay, Miss.

671
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,360
Come here,

672
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,760
I want to talk to you.

673
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,200
Tell me the truth.

674
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,120
What do you want from me?

675
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,680
I wasn't looking for you.

676
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,720
I can give you a signature,

677
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,280
or a photo.

678
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,720
Anything you want.

679
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,800
As long as you tell him,

680
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,240
there's nothing going on between us.

681
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,640
Anything you want,

682
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,960
except for being my girlfriend.

683
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,040
I don't want to be your girlfriend.

684
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,200
I don't like you.

685
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,040
She came here for you.

686
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,080
Dude.

687
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,280
Want me to be your scapegoat?

688
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,160
In your dreams.

689
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,320
Say that again!

690
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,200
Come on.

691
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,880
Who's a scapegoat?

692
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,200
Come on.

693
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,600
Miss, listen to me.

694
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,000
If you like him, speak up.

695
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,160
I was looking for you.

696
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,730
So you still won't tell the truth, right?

697
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,240
This is the truth.

698
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,520
Are you thinking of

699
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,040
the stomachache incident?

700
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
What incident?

701
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,160
I don't know what you mean.

702
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,440
Stop pretending.

703
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,120
It's been ages since.

704
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,840
So embarrassing.

705
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,240
Don't mention it alright?

706
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,400
Boss, it's done.

707
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,680
It's done?

708
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,320
You can go.

709
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,320
I'm an expert.

710
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,720
Boss, Tong Nian,

711
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,400
I heard you're getting married?

712
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,600
Did, did you tell them?

713
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,360
Who told you?

714
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,080
Was it 97?

715
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,840
Don't be shy.

716
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
This is a big event.

717
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,200
All the team members

718
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,080
will prepare a big gift for you.

719
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,760
Really big.

720
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,720
Just go.

721
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,960
Call a taxi for her later.

722
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,080
Well, see you Tong Nian.

723
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,240
Have you

724
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,400
decided to get married?

725
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,480
If you are in a hurry,

726
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,360
we can get it done quickly.

727
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,040
Not at all.

728
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm not,

729
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,640
not in a hurry at all.

730
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,130
Then let's wait until after the final.

731
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,640
Let me figure out

732
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,480
a way to persuade your parents.

733
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,280
It's pretty hard

734
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,800
to persuade my parents.

735
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It seems he's made up his mind.  -Let's go.

736
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,640
Shangyan,

737
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,600
Tong Nian,

738
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,160
you are back.

739
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,200
Mrs. Zhou, why are you still here?

740
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,600
I was waiting for you.

741
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,480
Waiting for me?

742
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
I heard that

743
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,000
you're getting married.

744
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,440
I'm so happy.

745
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,520
Shangyan, you are here alone

746
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,280
and have no experience with weddings.

747
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,320
I want to

748
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,040
offer your some advice.

749
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,400
Back in my hometown,

750
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,000
I was a good matchmaker.

751
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,920
I'm familiar with

752
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,400
all the wedding etiquette.

753
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,520
Mrs. Zhou, thank you.

754
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,960
I'll talk to you later.

755
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,040
Bye, Mrs. Zhou.  -Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

756
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,840
Don't forget to invite me.

757
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,040
OK, OK, OK.

758
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,280
Take a seat.

759
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,720
I've asked Grunt to call a taxi.

760
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,520
Is it okay to be a bit late

761
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
back to your dorm?

762
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,840
Can he afford the wedding?

763
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,560
Everyone's putting pressure on him.

764
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,480
He even has to face my parents.

765
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,680
He must be feeling stressed.

766
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,560
Where's Little Squid?

767
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,070
Maybe he's playing in the study.

768
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,080
Little Squid.

769
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,480
Does everyone in K&K

770
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,230
think you're gonna make a pro...

771
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
think you and I are

772
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,280
going to...

773
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,000
Get married?

774
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,760
You know,

775
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,800
their daily training is boring.

776
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,360
So even the smallest gossip

777
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,680
spreads like wildfire.

778
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,520
They love it.

779
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,440
Don't take it seriously.

780
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,120
Oh, so it was them.

781
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,520
I thought it was you...

782
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,720
Nothing.

783
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,170
I don't, I don't care about their opinions.

784
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,280
I won't listen to them.

785
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,880
I only care about

786
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,160
what's on your mind.

787
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,320
What do you think...

788
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,240
What's the matter?

789
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,960
Well, it's too late.

790
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,320
It's not easy to find a taxi.

791
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,360
Let me drive Tong Nian to her dorm.

792
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,360
It's OK.

793
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,840
I'll call the taxi later.

794
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,560
Go to bed.

795
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,720
OK.

796
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,600
What do you think is on my mind?

797
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,680
Are you out of money?

798
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,880
I know you have to run the Club

799
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,840
and you need to pay Buff.

800
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,960
If we get married right now,

801
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
it will cost a lot of money.

802
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,720
So, you think I'm out of money

803
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,510
and I can't take care of you, right?

804
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,320
No.

805
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,600
That's not what I mean.

806
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,680
I just don't want to

807
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,920
put you under great pressure.

808
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,240
So, I don't want you

809
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,840
to hide anything from me.

810
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,100
So, are you hiding anything from me?

811
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,600
I'm not.

812
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,440
You don't get my point.

813
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,200
I'm trying to say,

814
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,040
I hope,

815
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,910
I hope between us...

816
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,440
But Zheng Hui is living in your home.

817
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,120
You didn't tell me that, right?

818
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,760
I, I was afraid that

819
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,160
if I told you,

820
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,440
you would get angry.

821
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,520
So, I didn't dare tell you.

822
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,240
So, that means

823
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,560
there's something you don't know about me.

824
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,160
Isn't it?

825
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,080
You don't know me either.

826
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,120
Last time in your home,

827
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,360
when we were with Mr. Han,

828
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,720
I can't eat mangoes,

829
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,920
I'm allergic to them,

830
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,020
but I ate the whole plate anyway.

831
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,600
Why forced yourself to eat them?

832
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,000
Because you peeled them for me.

833
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,770
I was happy to eat them.

834
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,520
I forgot I'm allergic to them.

835
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,920
You said just now

836
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,240
about being honest.

837
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,240
But if you don't tell me,

838
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,040
how could I know

839
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,560
you are allergic to mangoes?

840
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,600
Right, I didn't tell you,

841
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,860
that's my bad OK?

842
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,520
But I'm just a little girl.

843
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,120
It's not necessary for me

844
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,800
to tell you everything.

845
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,760
If, if you love someone,

846
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,560
shouldn't you pay attention to them?

847
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,480
If, if you really love me,

848
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,320
you should observe me carefully.

849
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,080
So, I think,

850
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,880
you know nothing about me.

851
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
If you knew me well,

852
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,800
you would know I'm allergic to mangoes.

853
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,120
I love strawberries.

854
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,480
I don't care if you are rich or not.

855
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,470
I care only if I'm part of your future.

856
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,230
I like how we share everything with each other.

857
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,430
I don't like it when you're thinking too much.

858
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,320
OK, OK, OK.

859
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,640
Let's stop fighting, OK?

860
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,200
It could go on forever.

861
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,280
Let's calm down first, OK?

862
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,000
Calm down.

863
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,850
But, but I haven't finished yet.

864
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,410
This marriage thing must have put me on edge.

865
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,480
He's so serious about me.

866
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
And I'm so into him,

867
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,200
so satisfied with him.

868
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,760
Should I go after him?

869
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,870
No, no.

870
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,090
I'd better leave him alone now.

871
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,120
I am so stupid.

872
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,680
Why did I say such things?

873
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,560
Boss,

874
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,350
has Tong Nian got a taxi yet?

875
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,640
I guess so.

876
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,200
I need to go out, boss.

877
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,320
Strange.

878
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,000
Why no response?

Come here.

889
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,440
Hey, boss,

890
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,240
I, I just went out to meet some friends.

891
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,120
You are experienced,

892
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,560
what should I buy to make a girl happy?

893
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,560
Well,

894
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,840
lipsticks if you're rich,

895
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,000
snacks if you have no money.

896
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,480
The price is so different.

897
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,960
But there're different lipstick brands.

898
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
For example...

899
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,000
Is it for Tong Nian?

900
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,480
Buy her some snacks,

901
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,040
such as cream puffs,

902
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,520
strawberry cake,

903
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,800
and, and chocolate,

904
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,520
something like that.

905
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,480
Boss!

906
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,560
Han Shangyan.

907
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,000
Han Shangyan.

908
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,640
Seems he's so angry with me

909
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,360
that he didn't come back.

910
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,040
No reply.

911
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,360
Where is he?

912
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,880
Sir, excuse me.

913
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,490
Strawberries are not checked out here.

914
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,880
Sir, what do you need?

915
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,880
Is there strawberry cake?

916
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,760
I'm sorry.

917
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,400
Strawberry is sold out.

918
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,290
Do you want this mango cake?

919
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,120
It's so early.

920
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,520
How come it's sold out?

921
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,880
Why don't you make more?

922
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,480
I'm sorry.

923
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,120
Please come tomorrow.

924
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,910
What about this new chocolate cake?

925
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,040
OK.

926
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,800
Shangyan, do you need help?

927
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,240
No.

928
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,640
Boss, so much food.

929
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,440
Is it for us?

930
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,200
Has Tong Nian left?

931
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,440
No, I didn't see her.

932
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,960
Boss, don't be so mean.

933
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,440
Last night,

934
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,610
I lost my temper.

935
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,880
I want to apologize.

936
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,840
You won't forgive me?

937
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,200
In future, I will not

938
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,560
make the same mistake again.

939
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,480
OK.

940
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,880
And,

941
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,480
I don't know how to make girls happy.

942
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,300
When Solo got money,

943
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,980
he would buy snacks for his girlfriend.

944
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,200
I thought a girl like you

945
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,320
might like snacks too.

946
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,320
So, I bought you

947
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,120
strawberries,

948
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,000
strawberry cake,

949
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,200
strawberry macaroons.

950
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,000
The shop assistant said

951
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,340
the cake should be eaten quickly,

952
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,560
if it melts it won't be tasty.

953
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,510
Or give me a list of your favorite snacks.

954
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,040
I'll buy everything on it, alright?

955
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,360
I want to eat now.

956
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,240
I'll get them for you.
