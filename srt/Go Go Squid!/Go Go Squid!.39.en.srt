Sorry, Boss.

27
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,280
I haven't been on point.

28
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,710
I got the poorest grade

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,370
and I'll go the reflection room

30
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,280
for 2 hours to calm down.

31
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,960
I'll keep up the fight.

32
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,310
The scariest thing finally happens.

33
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,360
Not everyone can perform

34
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,370
their best under pressure.

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,450
If one player falls,

36
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,110
the whole team falls.

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,200
Of all the members of K&K,

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,520
everyone feels down.

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,450
When the competition comes,

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,360
all the difficulties and problems

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,640
start to appear one by one.

42
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,030
What comes next,

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,640
is the real test they must face.

44
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,170
You hungry at all?

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,290
No, no thank you.

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,430
You know the ranks?

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,110
The knockout system

48
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,680
is so horrible.

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
You were kicked out?

50
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,830
Nope.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,210
But our school's ACM team

52
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,110
has over 20 people,

53
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,600
which also uses this system.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,380
Of course.

55
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,500
We compete grades

56
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,600
so it's not as cut throat as what you have here.

57
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,810
Although

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,620
when you win and don't get kicked

59
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,480
you feel good,

60
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,680
you still feel sorry for

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,860
those who lost.

62
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,240
Not to mention these substitute players,

63
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,920
they may wait their whole life

64
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,160
and never compete once.

65
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,400
I feel sorry for them.

66
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,890
This is the charm of professional games,

67
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,990
also the cruelty of it.

68
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,690
A successful general sits on 10,000 corpses.

69
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,820
Not to mention

70
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,950
if you want to compete for China,

71
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,160
you need to defeat

72
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,450
thousands of people in China.

73
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,100
It's almost time.

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,460
Then I'll go to the studio to watch,

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,380
I won't disturb you.

76
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,740
What I have in my hand

77
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,120
are your general grades

78
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,680
and the rank of your servers

79
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,180
over the last two weeks.

80
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,500
These two things

81
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,140
are how you will be graded.

82
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,400
Actually

83
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,330
with this data,

84
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,280
we can already select the players

85
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,440
of this competition.

86
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,570
But I want to give a chance

87
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,740
to the last three people of this list.

88
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,780
This is, your last chance.

89
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,980
Boss, tell us what's on your mind already.

90
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm so nervous.

91
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,340
Yeah!

92
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,740
Just tell us.

93
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,880
Do you want to know your own ranks?

94
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,280
Boss, don't tell us yet,

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,460
keep it for a bit.

96
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,140
Or it'll be boring to compete.

97
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,620
Yes, don't tell us now.

98
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:44,700
Okay.

99
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,100
Except for DT,

100
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,360
you should all consider yourselves as

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,160
the bottom of the list

102
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,260
to compete.

103
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,300
You will have a one on one match

104
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,140
with me.

105
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,060
What?  -No way.

106
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,790
Boss, you're the best on that,

107
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,060
nobody can beat you.

108
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,660
Yes, that's true.

109
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,600
Scared?

110
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,680
I'm not scared.

111
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,130
If we all lose,

112
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,520
then how will you grade it?  -Yeah.

113
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,820
Okay, no trash talking,

114
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,460
compete Backward Analysis,

115
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,260
that okay?

116
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,980
I agree.

117
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,060
Okay, okay, okay.

118
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,820
Fine by me.

119
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,220
Game on.

120
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,580
I won't get in the way.

121
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,220
Okay.

122
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,380
One at a time.

123
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,140
Who's first?

124
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,180
I can be the first,

125
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,060
early death, early respawn.

126
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,060
Come on.

127
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,460
Relax, relax.

128
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,500
Who's next?

129
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,540
It's okay, don't worry.

130
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,540
Don't lose heart.

131
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,460
Next.

132
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,100
I'll do it.

133
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,380
His skill

134
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,940
can compete with DT.

135
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,380
Of course,

136
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,300
he's ranked fourth after all.

137
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,340
Who's next?

138
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,140
Not bad at all.

139
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,800
You wanna go first?

140
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,940
Coward.

141
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,300
Good luck.

142
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,300
Come on.

143
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,580
Demo.

144
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,280
Boss,

145
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,500
if I score the lowest,

146
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,700
don't be mad at me.

147
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,900
Chill. Just be cool.

148
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,170

You think everybody is like you?

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,390
My players

177
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,860
will never give up.

178
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,690
♪ So many times I wish I could leave ♪

179
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,860
You are only twenty,

180
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,650
keep at it.

181
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,200
Be like Buff and compete until you're 31.

182
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,900
There are four games each year

183
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,690
which means four world champions.

184
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,290
11 years means

185
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,770
44 world championships are yours for the taking.

186
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,470
Who cares if you lose one?

187
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,780
Buff may compete 2 years at most

188
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,950
and he'll probably retire.

189
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,620
At that time,

190
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,910
if you lose to someone

191
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,920
with less experience than you.

192
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,930
Let's see how I will punish you.

193
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,390
Got it, boss.

194
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,550
One year is enough.

195
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,890
In one year,

196
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,620
I'll get my spot back.

197
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,340
Shouldn't you be training then?

198
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,980
Yes.

199
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:47,490
♪ So many times I wish I could leave ♪

200
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,540
See you around.

201
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,960
Stop using your SP tactics,

202
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,780
K&K needs courage and strength.

203
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,370
Okay, courage and strength.

204
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,220
See you.

205
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,240
Hello, I'm out.

206
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,860
That was scary,

207
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,540
I thought he wanted to retire.

208
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,740
It's not that dramatic.

209
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,380
They're young

210
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,340
and still have chances.

211
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,360
I feel like your speech is like brain washing.

212
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,060
You say one word and they're okay.

213
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,010
You haven't seen Ai Qing's ability.

214
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,300
According to the list,

215
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,100
you already decided

216
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,340
who the players will be, right?

217
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,660
And the substitute is either One or Demo.

218
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,100
You learn quick.

219
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,220
Then why take so much effort

220
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,510
to hold a competition?

221
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,430
What people say is not important

222
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,770
what they believe is.

223
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,820
They're all professionals.

224
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,310
The competition is far more important

225
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,860
than any silly list.

226
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,560
Tong Nian, did you buy this?

227
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,060
Yes, I bought that.

228
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,770
Wait, I'll handle it.

229
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,700
What is it?

230
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,060
A coffee machine.

231
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,040
Very expensive.

232
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,760
Why did you buy that?

233
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,580
We already have one.

234
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,920
That one is not good.

235
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,940
Not enough.

236
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,230
Mine is way better.

237
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm coming!

238
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,860
Seriously.

239
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,780
Let me show you.

240
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,340
What is this?

241
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,340
Come on, move it out.

242
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,900
Here, one, two, three.

243
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,900
Slowly, not so fast.

244
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,420
Tong Nian,

245
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,780
wow it's so heavy.

246
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,500
Slow down.  -It's a coffee machine.

247
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,280
Yep, coffee machine.

248
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,460
Move the box here.

249
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
So sweet.

250
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,460
This amazing machine

251
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,780
is just what we needed.

252
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,220
Tong Nian, you're so amazing.

253
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,060
Not bad huh?

254
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
How much was it?

255
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,300
Well,

256
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,860
it was not cheap,

257
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,540
but I bought it with my own money.

258
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,710
Where should we put it?

259
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,420
Well, uh...

260
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,540
This table is a bit small.

261
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,010
We could get the huge table over there.

262
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,060
Okay.  -Okay.

263
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,900
I'll go with you.

264
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,580
Sure, sure.

265
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,500
Let's go.

266
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,290
Check out my amazing coffee machine!

267
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,940
Shangyan, you set the date yet?

268
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,700
This girl is great,

269
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,020
don't let her go.

270
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,460
Mrs. Zhou,

271
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,900
you really think,

272
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,850
I'm dumb enough to lose a girl like her?

273
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,300
I'm afraid your bad temper

274
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,930
will scare her away.

275
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,140
Treat her well.

276
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,740
What are you trying to do?

277
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,380
You'll see in a little bit.

278
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,380
Help me get some coffee beans.

279
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,900
That's enough,

280
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,940
That's way too much.

281
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,800
They'll get moldy if you put in too many.

282
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,620
It's okay.

283
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,780
Those knuckleheads

284
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,780
go through a tin a day.

285
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,300
That's really not okay.

286
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,180
We don't drink that much!

287
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,100
That's enough.

288
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,580
Okay.

289
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,940
Now to grind it into powder.

290
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,740
I'll use this.

291
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,060
There we go.

292
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,500
Wanna see something cool?

293
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,820
Chill out hot stuff.

294
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,500
This makes foam.

295
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,460
Check it out.

296
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,660
This is the last step,

297
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,570
a pattern.

298
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,420
Cool huh?

299
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,860
Tong Nian,

300
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,100
could I have that coffee?

301
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,380
This one?

302
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,730
Sure, come and get it.

303
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,390
Easy now, It's very full.

304
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,460
Thank you Tong Nian.

305
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,060
Do you need brown sugar?

306
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,070
No, no,

307
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,010
it'll ruin the pattern.

308
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,630
The pattern is really pretty!

309
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,870
You just gave it to him?

310
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,880
Yeah,

311
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,120
you didn't say you wanted it.

312
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,310
He wanted it so I gave it to him.

313
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,780
Tong Nian.  -Tong Nian.

314
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,660
I want one!

315
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,340
I also want one!

316
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,240
We want it, too.

317
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,360
Okay, just a second, I'll make you one.  -Thank you.

318
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,060
Thank you.

319
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,960
Tong Nian, the pattern is so pretty!

320
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,940
How do you know everything?

321
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,660
It's not a big deal.

322
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,780
I want the prettiest one,

323
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,500
thank you.

324
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,260
The prettiest? Okay.

325
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,740
Yes, yes.

326
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,540
I'll make more patterns for you.

327
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,060
Thank you! Thanks.

328
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,580
You're so amazing.

329
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,540
Amazing.

330
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,260
Tong Nian!

331
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,220
Incredible, Tong Nian!

332
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,380
You're so skillful!

333
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:16,900
It's okay.

334
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
So pretty!

335
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,140
I want this one.  -I want this one.

336
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,060
Take whichever one you like.

337
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,980
I want the bear.

338
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,100
Thank you Tong Nian.  -Thank you.

339
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,260
No worries, no worries.

340
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,580
Then, we'll get back to training.

341
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,140
Okay, if you want more come get it.

342
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,440
Okay.

343
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,500
Bye!  -It smells amazing!

344
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,300
This is great!

345
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,860
Do you want one?

346
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,340
If it's not too much trouble

347
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,900
could you make me one?

348
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,920
Okay,

349
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,020
I make you one.

350
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,540
Just a second.

351
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,580
It's done.

352
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,140
Tong Nian,

353
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:27,750
hello there.

354
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,640
What?

355
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,980
Why are you drinking me?

356
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,830
You, you drank me?

357
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,300
No, no, it's not me.

358
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,500
I'm not a piggy.

359
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,620
This piggy is you.

360
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,860
You just drank yourself.

361
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,880
This is not bad.

362
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,900
Stop drinking,

363
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,460
it's not a pig anymore.

364
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
What if you finish it all?

365
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,660
Then the pattern will be gone.

366
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,420
If I drink one

367
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,470
then you can make me another.

368
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,020
I...

369
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,420
I make you another one,

370
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,860
no more drinking.

371
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,540
Make one with your face on it.

372
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,580
That's you,

373
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
the pig is you!

374
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,180
The pig is Han Shangyan!

375
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,420
The long-faced Han Shangyan!

376
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,140
Guys, did Tong Nian just confess

377
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,540
her love for the Boss?

378
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,660
Let me tell you

379
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,940
Tong Nian is really good

380
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,140
at dealing with him.

381
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,040
To express her love

382
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,380
she buys a coffee machine.

383
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,140
She's so romantic.

384
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,300
Do you want it?

385
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,780
Thank you.

386
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,340
No problem.

387
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,020
Team SP has just

388
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,120
defeated Australia's LP team one minute earlier.

389
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,320
This qualifies them to advance to the semifinal

390
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,120
and move up in the ranks.  -Yes.

391
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,980
This Saturday which is tomorrow afternoon,

392
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,000
the semifinal will be held in Shanghai.

393
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,500
Yes, there are four teams

394
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,640
and two of them are Chinese teams.

395
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,610
Actually the most terrible scenario

396
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,420
is for K&K to face SP.

397
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,580
Yes, if that happens,

398
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,350
it'll be a competition between two Chinese teams.

399
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,340
We'd prefer,

400
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,160
to see the two fight in the finals.

401
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,730
But if unfortunately they are going to meet

402
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,910
in the semifinals instead of the finals,

403
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,070
it will be difficult for fans to accept.

404
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,980
Whatever will happen

405
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,060
is decided by the result of the lots.

406
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,410
Yes.

407
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,620
Let's look forward to

408
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,980
watching the results of the lots.

409
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,280
= PL 58 Asia Pacific Quarterfinals =

410
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,080
= No.1 =

411
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,220
Get over here, it's starting.
= No.2 =

412
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,910
= No.3 =

413
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,480
= No.4 =

414
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Now we can see

415
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,740
the results from here.

416
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,620
SP versus K&K,

417
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,890
and Australia versus Thailand.

418
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,060
Oh my!

419
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,540
If this is the result then

420
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,860
it's just like what we talked about,

421
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,560
it's like Mars crashing into the Earth.

422
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,140
This semifinal will feel like

423
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,160
a final in advance.

424
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,400
I believe fans in China wouldn't want to see this.

425
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,090
These two teams are at the top

426
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,220
of our country's bracket.

427
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,500
If these two must compete,

428
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,460
no matter who wins

429
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,820
and enters the final round,

430
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,260
the audience will feel sorry for

431
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,420
the other team.

432
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,040
Anyway, everyone is looking forward to

433
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,960
an amazing competition

434
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,960
between SP and K&K.

435
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,600
I believe it'll be amazing.

436
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,360
Let's look forward to it.

437
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,700
Our luck sucks.

438
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,820
The semifinals.

439
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,620
And both Chinese teams must fight.

440
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,380
Yeah.

441
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,900
Enough, get over it.

442
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,600
Get your things together

443
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,020
and go to the training room.

444
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,340
I thought first and second place

445
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,620
could all be Chinese.

446
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,700
That breaks my heart.

447
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,180
You said it man.

448
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,500
Everyone do your best.

449
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,890
Don't forget last time we lost to SP.

450
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,340
But now it's different.

451
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
We have a new player,

452
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,460
isn't that right?

453
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,140
Yeah right.

454
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,420
Let's finish up.

455
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,780
Then we can start practicing.

456
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
I'm full.

457
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,540
Me, too.

458
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,820
I'm not hungry anymore.

459
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,620
Let's go.

460
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,980
You have any ideas?

461
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,260
I do.

462
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,620
Like what?

463
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,420
We must win.

464
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,820
You know it's cold on a plane

465
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,180
and you wore shorts?

466
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,940
What's wrong? You sad?

467
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,340
Are you uncomfortable

468
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,190
or are you mad at me for sending you to Norway,

469
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,500
to your mom's place?

470
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,760
I asked to see mom myself.

471
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,700
You didn't force me.

472
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,060
So then why the long face?

473
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,500
I just don't get it.

474
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,260
You're so busy because of

475
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,140
the upcoming semifinal.

476
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,420
So why are you here babysitting me?

477
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,540
You always think about others.

478
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,040
Has anybody ever thought about you the same way?

479
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,900
All these years,

480
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,340
I never noticed

481
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,540
how much you've grown up.

482
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,580
You know how to take care of people.

483
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,660
Maybe one day,

484
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,860
you will

485
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,980
take good care of yourself.

486
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,900
And secretly have a boyfriend.

487
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,180
And then you'll

488
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,060
fall deeply in love.

489
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,020
Then you two,

490
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,220
will hold hands together

491
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,860
and walk down the aisle.

492
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,860
You know,

493
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,020
that'd be the happiest moment

494
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,700
of my entire life.

495
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,740
I only hope that

496
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,940
everyone I love

497
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,420
will be happy,

498
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,060
very happy.

499
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,900
I don't wanna grow up.

500
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,020
Also don't wanna be with mom.

501
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,290
Time runs out fast,

502
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,050
and it doesn't wait.

503
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,210
Go be with your mom.

504
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,610
She needs you more.

505
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,690
Study hard over there.

506
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,170
I'll go find you

507
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,370
after the competition.

508
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,050
Dad, promise me,

509
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,160
you'll defeat K&K

510
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,650
and be the champion.

511
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,680
You don't like Mr. Han that much?

512
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,810
Not that,

513
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,570
I just hope that

514
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,010
you can be the world champion.

515
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,230
You're the best father in the world,

516
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,200
you're my No.1.

517
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,080
There is nothing out there,

518
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,920
nothing at all, that can replace you.

519
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Okay?

520
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,040
I don't want to eat.

521
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,080
Just one bite.

522
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,480
Nope.

523
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,290
Do me a favor, sweetie.

524
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,800
I don't want to do you a favor.

525
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,680
You're not gonna help daddy?

526
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,920
Not one little favor?

527
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,480
Nope.

528
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,760
If you finish your food,

529
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
daddy will play a game with you, okay?

530
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,880
I don't want to play a game.

531
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,240
You don't want to?

532
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,560
Then what do you want?

533
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,640
I want my mom.

534
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,120
You want your mom?

535
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,400
Then, after you finish eating

536
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,110
I'll take you to find Mom, okay?

537
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,560
I don't want to eat.

538
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,560
Then why do you want mom?

539
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,640
I miss her.

540
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,400
Boss, time to eat.

541
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,080
No thanks.

542
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,800
Boss, it's fine don't worry,

543
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,520
I know we can beat SP.

544
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,040
Do I look like I'm worried?

545
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,040
Oh no, I'm not saying that.

546
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
I meant the kitty.

547
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,520
He, looks scared.

548
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,840
Hey, kitty,

549
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,840
don't worry, it's going to be okay.

550
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,760
So cute, boss, look at it.

551
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,480
Time to eat, Han Shangyan.

552
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,480
Boss says no.

553
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,840
Could you please

554
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,320
not ask me the same thing

555
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
one by one as you come in?

556
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,160
We're worried.

557
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,280
I'm not a pet,

558
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,560
no need to worry.

559
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,520
Go on.

560
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,640
We knew this was coming sooner or later.

561
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
I just didn't think it'd be so soon.

562
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,040
I thought our two teams

563
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
could get both gold and silver.

564
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,760
You're so confident.

565
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,160
The time has come.

566
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,720
I never thought

567
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,260
we would be facing off so soon.

568
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
I always wanted

569
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,400
but also dreaded

570
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,320
having to compete with them.

571
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,400
It's a pity,

572
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,120
the first and second place

573
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,480
could've been both Chinese.

574
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,850
It's weird, you're starting to sound

575
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,320
a lot like Han Shangyan.

576
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,840
Solo, I need to talk to you.

577
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,880
I'll leave you to it.

578
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,680
What is it?

579
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,600
I just got a phone call from headquarters.

580
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,280
And?

581
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,330
You're the best leader in China,

582
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,080
your team can not lose.

583
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
If your team loses,

584
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
then you're not the best.

585
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,520
That means

586
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,720
if you really end up losing,

587
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,440
they will find somebody else

588
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,960
to lead China's SP.

589
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,250
= Asia Pacific Semifinal =

590
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,440
Tong Nian you finished yet?

591
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,640
I'm over here.

592
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,840
What are you doing?

593
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Yaya, my heart is pounding so fast.

594
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,280
I'm so nervous.

595
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,280
Me, too!

596
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm also nervous!

597
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,400
I gotta ask,

598
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,280
do you support K&K or SP?

599
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,120
K&K!

600
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,120
You sure about that?

601
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,120
Absolutely sure.

602
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,160
Say it with me:

603
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,560
K&K is like a dragon,

604
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,400
they will always win!

605
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,920
K&K is like a dragon,

606
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,480
they will always win!

607
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,680
Will win...

608
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,870
I was a fan of team Solo way back,

609
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,200
I like Solo so much!

610
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,040
You know,

611
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,500
he was so hot when he led the team.

612
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
Han Shangyan,

613
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,720
is not his match.

614
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,800
I'm Appledog's fan,

615
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,400
I'll support her team.

616
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,360
Yep.

617
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,960
SP game on! SP game on!

618
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,280
K&K is like a dragon,

619
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,680
they will always win!

620
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,080
SP game on! SP game on!

621
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,240
They will always win!

622
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,640
K&K is like a dragon,

623
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,440
they will always win!

624
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,080
I'm telling you two,

625
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,680
if SP loses today,

626
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,210
I'll eat those things you have there,

627
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,560
sound good?

628
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,400
Thank you.

629
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,240
You're welcome.

630
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,960
Wait.

631
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,440
She wants to eat these

632
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,920
but I answered you're welcome?

633
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,200
Gosh.

634
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,280
Yaya,

635
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,840
give me your lipstick.

636
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,840
Now they're all stable.

637
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,760
Tong Nian,

638
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,080
why are you walking that way?

639
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,400
One, two, three.

640
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,840
K&K Game on!

641
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,720
Come on.

642
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,040
No...

643
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
Tong Nian insisted.

644
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,040
We were competing

645
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
with the other ladies in the bathroom.

646
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,240
She wanted to win

647
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,040
so she copied their makeup.

648
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,520
We are happy you're both here.

649
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,240
Wipe that off.

650
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,580
You might be allergic to it. Here we go.

651
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,360
No need, my lipstick is good quality.

652
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,160
I'll be fine.

653
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,800
What's that look?

654
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,240
I look super cool right?

655
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,440
I'm your biggest fan.

656
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,480
Do whatever you like.

657
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
You're not going to the VIP seats?

658
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,880
Of course not.

659
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,680
It's too quiet there.

660
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,560
I'll stay with everybody else.

661
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,720
So long as you are happy.

662
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,440
You,

663
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,760
you guys need to play hard!

664
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,040
K&K will definitely win.

665
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,800
Game on, game on!

666
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,560
Game on, game on!

667
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,080
We will win, we will win!

668
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,840
We are Champions!

669
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,320
We are Champions! We are Champions!

670
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,040
Game on!

671
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,520
Will you treat us if we win the game?

672
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,520
If you win,

673
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,640
I'll treat you to anything you want.

674
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,520
Check this out,

675
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,680
my scholarship money for 6 years

676
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,600
is all right here.

677
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,760
Impressive!

678
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,240
Guys,

679
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,960
we can't use up all the money

680
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,040
for the marriage.

681
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,200
She still needs it.

682
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,360
In about two years,

683
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,280
the boss will get pretty old.

684
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,360
Right, boss is like super old,

685
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,920
he's more worried than us.

686
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,280
Yes!

687
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,680
Alright you rascals,

688
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,000
just wait and see

689
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
how I kick your butts.

690
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,480
Alright now.

691
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,080
Five minutes left,

692
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,560
everyone game on!

693
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,160
Game on! Game on!

694
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,920
Listen up,

695
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,240
I always thought

696
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,800
your way of celebrating was childish.

697
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,520
But today,

698
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,880
I hope this can help you.

699
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,520
Come on!

700
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
One, two, three!

701
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,080
Game on!

702
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,120
Game on! Game on!

703
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,200
♪ When your dream is coming true ♪

704
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,210
♪ All right ♪

705
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,040
Every time they compete against each other,

706
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,760
I just can't handle it.

707
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,080
I want K&K to win

708
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,280
but also want SP to win.

709
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,960
I know the feeling.

710
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,830
Now All is the only player left of Team Solo.

711
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,000
If he doesn't win,

712
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
doesn't that mean

713
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,320
that Team Solo loses?

714
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,680
Yes.

715
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,320
The second round of the semifinal is about to begin.

716
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:54,960
Yes.

717
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,060
As the host of this competition

718
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,320
today we will have

719
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,470
two Chinese teams competing for the semifinal.

720
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,960
I hope both team SP

721
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,840
and team K&K

722
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,140
can show us an amazing competition.

723
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,160
Okay, everyone,

724
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,970
please give our clubs a moment longer.

725
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,320
We'll be back in a minute.

726
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,440
How do you feel?

727
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,320
What do you mean?

728
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
I've got a lot of mixed feelings about this match.

729
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
SP and K&K

730
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,120
are both my favorite teams,

731
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,400
but only one of them

732
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
can enter the finals.

733
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,720
That's so unfair.

734
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Wish them both luck then.

735
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,720
Do you like K&K or SP?

736
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,840
Whoever wins,

737
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,720
they are both Chinese.

738
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,600
Alright gentlemen,

739
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,720
no need to panic.

740
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,240
I got you some refreshments.

741
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,630
Let's just play our very best, okay?

742
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,840
Shut it.

743
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,080
I'm over here.

744
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,120
Han Shangyan!

745
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Gun!

746
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:26,960
Game on!

747
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,860
Alright, welcome back

748
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,800
to the CTF Asia Pacific

749
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,800
semifinals live broadcast.

750
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,960
Thank you Dong Peng beverages

751
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,310
for providing drinks for our players.

752
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,320
30 minutes ago,

753
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,520
the first round

754
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,720
was finished.

755
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,440
The winner was team VIPO from Australia.

756
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,200
And next

757
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,030
are the two teams from China.

758
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,960
K&K and SP.

759
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,000
Alright boys, this is the last round,

760
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,640
let's bring it home!

761
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,560
Yes Captain.

762
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,040
I should mention that

763
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,520
team K&K recruited

764
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,960
a new member who

765
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,880
is in the top four,

766
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,480
an experienced player Buff.

767
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,720
After Buff joined in,

768
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,270
the overall strength of K&K has risen up

769
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,280
to amazing heights.

770
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,840
Correct.

771
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,120
So compared to what we saw only

772
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,960
a month ago,

773
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,560
these two are

774
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,280
now the very best China has to offer.

775
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:45,960
Come on.

776
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,960
Excuse me, excuse me.

777
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,480
Honey, what were you doing?

778
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,630
Why are you so late?

779
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,550
Who won, who won?

780
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,070
It's not over yet, hurry up!

781
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,960
Let me tell you

782
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,360
that client was so annoying.

783
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,800
If I hadn't borrowed a bike from my colleague,

784
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,960
I wouldn't have made it.

785
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,920
Hurry up, over there.

786
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,440
I'll put it there.

787
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,000
This match is too important,

788
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,320
I shouldn't have waited for you.

789
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,110
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

790
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,960
Let's go, quickly now.

791
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,520
Hurry up.

792
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,880
What are you doing?

793
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,630
Hurry up.

794
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,520
Don't stop your bike here!

795
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,480
Forget it.

796
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,070
Let's go.

797
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Both teams of the CTF Asia Pacific semifinals,

798
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,600
K&K and SP have the same scores

799
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,720
in the first and second rounds.

800
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,680
Now begins

801
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,120
final session of the game.

802
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,360
The last four nodes,

803
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,240
only four nodes left.

804
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,480
That's one down,

805
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,000
SP lost one node.

806
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,040
DT defeats Hua Ti, amazing!

807
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,480
Inin was also blocked.

808
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,960
No, it's a trap.

809
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,320
Bug sacrificed Inin

810
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,360
to hide himself from Grunt.

811
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,720
Bug got in.

812
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,200
K&K is in danger.

813
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,920
Demo discovers Bug's trick.

814
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,000
Bug's hiding,

815
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,000
looking for a loophole.

816
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,800
He defeats Demo.

817
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,520
Bug!

818
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,320
It's a shame that DT caught him.

819
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,200
The last one node.

820
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,200
Four of K&K are on guard,

821
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,120
they plan to have DT one versus five.

822
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,560
DT passes through.

823
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,580
Hua Ti also out!

824
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,980
Only All is there, amazing!

825
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,610
DT wins the game!

826
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,920
Congrats K&K!

827
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,230
K&K wins the semifinal!

828
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,480
Han Shangyan! Han Shangyan!

829

831
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,840
It's over, all your fault.

832
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,010
Hey, excuse me, which team won?

833
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,200
K&K, K&K won!

834
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,430
K&K won!

835
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,280
K&K is the winner!

836
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,270
Great! Amazing!

837
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,710
I want to cheer them on.

838
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,570
Wait for me.

839
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,300

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,420
cheer for the winners.

870
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,280
Game on!

871
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,320
Game on!

872
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,480
Let's give our applause

873
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,020
once again to our winners Team K&K !

874
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,960
Bravo!

875
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,040
Congratulations, K&K.

876
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,720
I hope they can take

877
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,450
the best wishes and expectations

878
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,640
of the Chinese audience,

879
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,520
and bring home the gold

880
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,760
in tomorrow's Final!

881
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,480
Let's go, go.

882
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,880
Let's go.

883
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,160
Quickly.

884
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,720
Hi, man.

885
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,240
Han Shangyan, my old friend.

886
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,040
On our home turf,

887
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,480
we will be the winners.

888
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,160
But you may visit

889
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,560
Shanghai after the game,

890
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,360
it's on me.

891
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,120
You haven't changed,

892
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,360
so confident.

893
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,480
See you in the Final.

894
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,840
See you then.

895
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,600
How do you know him?

896
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,560
A decade ago,

897
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
before you and I were friends,

898
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,960
I competed against him.

899
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,520
Your boss,

900
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,280
never once lost to them.

901
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,160
So you should also win.

902
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,520
Understand?

903
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,160
Don't worry, boss.

904
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,320
Let's go.

905
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,700
= Love =
= Career =

906
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,880
What should we do?

907
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,760
The members of K&K,

908
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,960
their horoscopes are not so good

909
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,060
especially Han Shangyan's.

910
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,100
There isn't any good luck for them.

911
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,000
What are you browsing for?

912
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,120
Horoscopes.

913
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,120
I'm searching horoscopes

914
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,040
for every member of team K&K.

915
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,160
Everyone?

916
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,560
Five players plus Gun and Xiaomi,

917
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,210
you did 7 signs?

918
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,810
Is it correct?

919
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm not sure.

920
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,120
Just thought I'd look.

921
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,560
I think I have

922
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
a set of Tarot cards.

923
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,080
Let's use the Tarot cards.

924
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,960
Tarot cards?

925
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,600
I don't know that.

926
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,880
I know a bit.

927
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,400
Where did I put them?

928
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,450
Can you please not be so nervous?

929
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,120
You don't understand.

930
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,160
I read the news,

931
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,520
do you know

932
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,400
that K&K's rival

933
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,080
might win the the finals?

934
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,560
So I can't relax.

935
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,480
I'm so nervous.

936
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,680
Relax,

937
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,760
you need to think like this

938
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,680
the first three can all advance to

939
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,730
the world finals.

940
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,640
That means K&K

941
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,760
already has an entrance ticket

942
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,280
to the world finals.

943
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,560
So no need to worry.

944
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,760
But tomorrow,

945
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,810
SP should be nervous.

946
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,190
If they lose,

947
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,720
there's no chance for them

948
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,000
to enter the world finals.

949
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,320
I hope SP can enter the final,

950
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,440
or Han Shangyan will

951
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,080
be very upset about it.

952
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,640
Yes.

953
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,080
I'll never get to sleep tonight.

954
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,480
I won't be able to sleep either.

955
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,840
