for this match,

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,370
you two are the key,

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,520
so you have to coordinate.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,520
And you two should practice more on the binary system.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,680
Please leave, boys.

32
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,070

to the match in Norway?

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,320
I did.

36
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,370
Sorry.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,010
Do you know that K&K's leader is Han Shangyan?

38
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,320
Yes.

39
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,360
So why did you propose that?

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,640
Do you know how guilty and scared I am

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,320
every time I see him?

42
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,360
You might not have known that

43
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,940
for the match in Singapore,

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,470
but you clearly know it this time!

45
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,400
And you want Shaofei and Ou Qiang to go with me?

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,440
You were once friends and should always be.

47
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,542
Then why don't you go

48
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,440
and face that awkward situation yourself?

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,490
Ten years ago you cowered,

50
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,360
and now you're still the same?

51
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,590
I know I'm the reason the team disbanded.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,070
Ai Qing,

53
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,840
I just don't want you to keep living

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,070
with this burden.

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,320
If it's possible,

56
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,670
I hope you can all make peace with Han Shangyan.

57
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,070
After all you were all once friends.

58
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,680
You want us to make peace with him,

59
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,570
but how about you?

60
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,450
I've been waiting for it.

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,610
Me, too.

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,320
Tomorrow is the national final,

63
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,520
are you nervous? Worried?

64
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,240
How can you still think about it?

65
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,490
I don't even know what we're fighting for.

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,720
For honor, success and victory of course!

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,310
After the match, Solo plans to leave,

68
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,240
leave this Solo team named after him.

69
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,430
So what's the point even if we win?

70
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,360
You've already forgiven him?

71
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,990
I don't know.

72
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,270
But I think if I were in his situation,

73
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,780
I wouldn't know what to do either.

74
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,820
But you're the victim here!

75
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,530
He has hurt everyone in the team,

76
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,770
and also damaged your relationship!

77
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,380
Don't you love each other deeply?

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,190
If you forgive him for being a coward,

79
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,070
then you're a fool!

80
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,720
My husband said that Gun is short-tempered,

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,950
but he's a good fellow!

82
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,420
You should try dating him.

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
When you find a good guy,

84
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,080
grab hold of him!

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,610
They're rare!

86
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,780

96

why do you want to register this?

Of course he has!

He is his super fan!

But he doesn't have his photo or signature.

136
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,730
He said Han Shangyan hates taking photos.

137
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,420
You can only find him in group photos.

138
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,150
Does he have any female fans?

139

Yes,

140

but not many.

141
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,910

It feels weird.

When I was hiding my exam papers in my bag,

So cute!

160

When I was 11,

161
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,240
I read martial arts novels in class,

162
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,900
and imagined I was a hero!

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,320
it's fine.

165
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,490
You were hiding papers at 11,

166
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,980
but you're a postgraduate at age 19!

167
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,700
11?

168
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,600
I was playing in the mud.

169
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,530
I was in 5th grade at age 11,

170
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,360
and won first place in my class.

171

172
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,780
I was the tallest in my class

173
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,520
and started to play basketball.

174
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,610
I'm 21 now,

175
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,900
and dream of marrying Squid!

176
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,740
Notice what she wrote?

177
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,950
Who is this "someone"?

178
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,560
Our Princess Squid is emotionally distracted!

179
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,630
I agree!

180
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,610
Someone?

181
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,600
Who is this "someone" ?

182
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,320
Wait!

183
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,760
Who is this "someone"?

184
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,850
What?

185
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,780
Someone?

186
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,190
No, no, no, Princess Squid!

187
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,860
You can't fall in love!

188
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,200
Nobody else deserves you!

189
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,780
Who is this "someone" exactly?

190
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,450
I'll be abroad for a few days.

191
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,830
Here's my number.

192
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,010
= Here's my number: 18400990+your house number. GN. =

193
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,110
What's going on?

194
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,190
What's happening?

195
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,450
Someone is causing trouble?

196
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,450
Hey, dude,

197
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,650
how could you know her house number?

198
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,240
Stop pretending, okay?

199
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,530
What is this all about?

200
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,950
What's going on?

201
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,640
Someone's gonna steal our Squid?

202
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,200
Why give her your number?

203
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,030
You want Squid to call you?

204
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,110
Hey, who are you?

205
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,450
Who is this guy?

206
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,610
Who are you?

207
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,950
What's wrong?

208
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,190
Han Shangyan!

209
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,240
Han Shangyan left me a comment!

210
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,030
Which one is he?

211
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,740
-This one...  -Why didn't I see it?

212
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,070
-GN! GN!  -GN?

213
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,950
Do you see it?

214
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,740
GN is Han Shangyan?

215
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,700
He has an account, too?

216
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,850
I thought that he only knew about CTF!

217
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,120
This is a new account! He just registered!

218
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,370
Whoa!

219
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,740
He actually left you a message like this!

220
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,450
Goodness! It's super romantic!

221
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,090
How do you play on here?

222
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,480
Just leave comments?

223
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,950
Yes.

224
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,230
But you can also send private messages

225
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,280
to people you know.

226
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

227
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,650
You didn't ask me!

228
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,740
Boss, listen to me,

229
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,700
you can follow Tong Nian.

230
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,360
Here,

231
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,860
follow her account,

232
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,650
then you can see everything that she posts.

233
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,720
It's just like Wechat.

234
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,080
See, she posted her new songs,

235
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,620
the places she's gone to, etc.

236
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,570
You can see it all here!

237
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,110
I got it,

238
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,580
you can go to sleep.

239
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,800
OK.

240
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,700
= Squid =

241
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,180
= Follow =

242
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,320
I should follow his account, right?

243
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,160
= Mobile User 3023033 =

244
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,400
I'll follow his account.

245
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,740
Did I see that correctly?

246
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,100
Why Squid just followed a new account?

247
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,900
A mobile user without an avatar ?

248
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,750
Squid, when will you follow me?

249
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,660
Why? Why would Squid follow this guy?

250
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,010
I want to be followed by her, too!

251
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,650
I've been following you forever, Squid,

252
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,740
could you please follow me back?

253
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,570
Squid, watch out for bad guys!

254
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,330
Princess Squid, he has no avatar,

255
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,400
he could be a bad guy!

256
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,880
Squid followed an account without an avatar?

257
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,990
Alright,

258
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,200
I should follow him, too!

259
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,630
I will figure out what their relation is!

260
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,820
You're already his girlfriend.

261
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,990
How come a follow and a comment

262
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,900
gets you so excited?

263
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,070
Don't say that!

264
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,200
I was just his fake girlfriend!

265
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,110
It'll become real eventually!

266
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,690
Emotions need to be cultivated!

267
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,190
See!

268
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,560
-He followed me back, right?  -Yes!

269
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,240
We followed each other, right?

270
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,960
Perfect! Nice!

271
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,930
Give it to me! Let me see!

272
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,990
Stop, stop!

273
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,510
I'll go call him in the bathroom!

274
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,350
You're so secretive!

275
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,880
I want to listen as well!

276
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,730
No, no, no!

277
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,840
OK, OK.

278
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,900
-Don't eavesdrop!  -I won't!

279
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,860
Is this Han Shangyan?

280
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,960
Hello, is this Han Shangyan?

281
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,200
Or did I dial the wrong number?

282
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,200
Tong Nian?

283
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,700
Han Shangyan, it's me.

284
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,570
Oh, you're sleeping?

285
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,240
I'll fly to Norway in the morning.

286
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,150
Oh, tomorrow morning?

287
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,120
I'll come back at 16:20 on March 2.

288
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,680
Got it.

289
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,820
I'll remember.

290
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,780
We can talk when I'm back.

291
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,490
OK.

292
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,400
So... you want to keep sleeping then?

293
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,880
Should I hang up now or not?

294
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,650
Then... I'll hang up.

295
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,240
So... good night!

296
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,960
Have a nice dream.

297
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,890
Bye-bye.

298
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,190
What did you say?

299
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,560
Tell me! Why are you so secretive?

300
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,480
Tell me! Just give me something! Come on!

301
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,160
Come on! I'm really curious.

302
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,450
No! Sleep!

303
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,150
I don't want to sleep!

304
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,990
-Get up!  -OK!

305
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,490
Let's watch TV then!

306
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,150
I don't want to watch TV either!

307
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,780
Why are you so annoying?

308
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,440
You're in love, don't you want to talk about it?

309
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,780
Just tell me two words, OK?

310
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,400
No, no, no! No way!

311
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,660
You have no desire to talk at all?

312
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
-Tell me!  -No! No!

313
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,490
Talk with me! Will you? Will you?

314
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,350
-Talk! Quickly!  -No! No! No!

315
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,420
Tell me! Tell me!

316
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,740
-OK! OK!  -Good, now talk.

317
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,030
He said...

318
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,520
He said he'd fly to Norway tomorrow.

319
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,810
He also told me when he would get back.

320
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,450
He wants you to meet him at the airport?

321
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,490
You're not a fake girlfriend,

322
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,740
you're 100% real!

323
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,360
Don't tickle me! Are you happy?

324
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,110
Are you happy?

325
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,740
Don't tickle me!

326
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,570
Boss, we've checked in.

327
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,160
Mr. Han, we've upgraded you and your friends

328
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,400
to business class.

329
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,240
Thank you!

330
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,490
Do you want to have a rest in the business lounge?

331
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,510
No, thanks, we're fine.

332
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,190
Your tickets.

333
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,820
Shangyan, sorry.

334
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,290
Traffic jam.

335
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,680
Shangyan, you're more handsome!

336
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,150
This is Gun! Introduce yourselves.

337
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,720
G... Gun, I'm Inin, hello!

338
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,150
Here are the tickets,

339
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,580
go check your luggage.

340
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,190
Thanks.

341
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,650
Let's go.

342
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,600
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

343
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,550
We'll see him later!

344
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,860
Here, your tickets.

345
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,300
Check your seats!

346
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,360
Business class?

347
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,740
K&K paid for that?

348
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,720
-Business class?  -Nice, he's still so generous!

349
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,610
What would you like to drink?

350
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,840
I'd like... this please.

351
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,740
OK!

352
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,560
When was the last time we were sitting

353
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,240
and eating together?

354
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,150
I can change seats

355
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,730
if you feel this is awkward.

356
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,490
It's fine.

357
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,490
It's pouring!

358
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,280
You're back?

359
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,780
Guys, time to eat!

360
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,780
You're totally soaked!

361
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,530
It's pouring out!

362
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,280
Hey, there's hardly any meat!

363
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,650
You don't like it?

364
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,320
It's not enough!

365
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,530
Good grief!

366
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,500
Eat it! Here you are!

367
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,640
Bonus!

368
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
You're soaked!

369
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,450
Are you OK?

370
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,000
Come here.

371
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,750
Why? My food!

372
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,060
You're now the first lady of our team.

373
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,530
Don't get a cold!

374
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,990
We can't afford that.

375
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,710
Blah blah... I know, give it to me.

376
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,720
All done! I'm going to eat!

377
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,040
Come back! You're not dry yet!

378
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,060
Sit down.

379
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,310
Why?

380
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,740
Sit down.

381
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,980
Why?

382
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,150
I'm the captain,

383
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,560
I have to take care of everyone's health.

384
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,190
We've just started performing well,

385
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,860
all of you have to stay healthy.

386
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,780
Understood?

387
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,960
Yes, sir!

388
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,080
Why do you sound like my mom?

389
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,940
It's fine if you want to call me "mom".

390
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,740
Mom!

391
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,300
Yes, dear?

392
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,950
That's weird!

393
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,700
I have an idea!

394
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,210
I know how to defeat that terrible Monster guy!

395
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,840
We're having a meal,

396
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,490
don't talk about that now, okay?

397
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,950
What about you?

398
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,650
Enough, keep eating.

399
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,070
Ai Qing, drink this.

400
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,640
All of you must take care of yourselves.

401
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,560
Cap, where's our medicine then?

402
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,070
You gave her the last box.

403
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,450
Why look at me like that?

404
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,290
Eat!

405
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,280
Eat! Eat!

406
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,320
Are you OK?

407
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,140
Here you are, I think,

408
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,840
you need this more!

409
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,240
Take care!

410
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,360
Excuse me.

411
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,450
Sir, what can I do for you?

412
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,070
I want a glass of warm water.

413
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Ok, wait a moment.

414
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,820
Thanks.

415
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,400
Shangyan, you don't feel well?

416
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,410
I have some cold medicine.

417
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,490
Do you remember

418
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,520
before Solo told us to...

419
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,820
I just didn't sleep well.

420
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,550
Those with a good memory always suffer more,

421
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,900
don't they?

422
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,400
We are the champions!

423
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,110
We entered the final!

424
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,990
Cheers!

425
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,360
-Cheers!  -Cheers!

426
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,400
It's already midnight!

427
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,530
Stop shouting!

428
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,240
I'm trying to sleep!

429
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,320
Keep it down! Keep it down!

430
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,650
Cap,

431
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,710
I'm curious about something.

432
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,240
If we become national champions,

433
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,070
will we get a cash reward?

434
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,490
Will we?

435
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,400
Yes, we'll get a really nice reward.

436
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,780
Why?

437
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,800
Why do you ask?

438
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,740
I just love this roof so much!

439
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,440
I must buy it if I become rich one day.

440
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,190
Then every time we win a competition,

441
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,600
we can drink and sing up here

442
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,860
without worrying about the landlady!

443
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,320
This will be our future home!

444
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,990
Shaofei, are you an idiot?

445
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Even if you own the whole roof,

446
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,490
she can still throw you out for being too noisy!

447
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,480
Right, Shaofei, forget it.

448
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,280
I don't think the national champion reward

449
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,890
is enough money to buy a roof!

450
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,140
But we should keep fighting and fighting

451
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,110
until we become world champions.

452
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,570
Right, when we become world champions,

453
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,990
we can buy all the houses here

454
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,610
and shout as loud as we want!

455
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,990
Yes, that's right!

456
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,530
World champions!

457
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,700
World champions!

458
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,150
Are you done yet?!

459
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,860
Will you shut your mouth?!

460
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,860
I'll calling the police!

461
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,110
Shangyan, let me ask you,

462
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,400
what else do you want to do

463
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,380
if we become world champions someday?

464
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,700
Me first! Me first! OK?

465
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,190
I'll open a huge supermarket for my grandma,

466
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,390
and hire tons of staff to work for her.

467
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,410
She'll just sit back and enjoy the profits!

468
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,860
Well, I want to tour the world with you guys.

469
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,450
You idiot!

470
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,820
You'd better practice more.

471
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,650
Don't always drop the ball

472
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,700
so we can get to the world final, alright?

473
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,440
We'll tour the world and stay several days

474
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,990
in every city we compete in!

475
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,860
Anything is fine with me.

476
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,690
I just want to hang out with you guys.

477
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,320
Ai Qing.

478
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,300
And you?

479
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,490
My dream?

480
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,770
My dream is that

481
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,520
the dreams of those I love will come true.

482
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,740
Those you love?

483
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,610
Do you love us as well?

484
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,740
Of course!

485
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,170
I love you all!

486
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,070
No, no! Gross!

487
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,400
No, no, no!

488
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,240
How about you, Shangyan?

489
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,070
My dream is simple.

490
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,490
World champion.

491
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,360
I want the world to know

492
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,780
there's nothing we Chinese people can't achieve!

493
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,900
Awesome, Shangyan!

494
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,680
But will you regret if you don't have a wife

495
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,640
or even a girlfriend at the end?

496
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,080
Ou Qiang, you're worrying about him?

497
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,200
He has way more female fans than you do!

498
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,610
Just worry about yourself!  -Right!

499
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,720
Hey, you looking down on me?

500
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,360
Yes!

501
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,240
Say it again!

502
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:30,780
Yes!

503
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,550
How dare you!

504
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,250
Wang Hao, he's shouting at me!

505
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,780
Ok, ok, ok, stop it!

506
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,300
Hit him!  -Stop, stop!

507
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,110
Cap, what's your dream?

508
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,860
As the captain,

509
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,610
I dream of

510
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,280
helping all of you

511
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,110
realize your dreams!

512
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,190
Isn't that nice?

513
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,860
Yes, bravo!

514
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,650
That's our captain!

515
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,070
A toast to world championship!

516
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,190
World champions, cheers!

517
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,490
Lower your voices!

518
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,490
I finished mine!

519
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,220
I finished mine!

520
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,540
Me, too! Bottoms up!

521
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,780
Look at that star!

522
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,820
That's a plane!

523
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,360
No way, that's a star!

524
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,410
We'll become the brightest stars

525
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,100
once we're world champions, right guys?

526
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:37,820
Yes!

527
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,590
We'll become the brightest stars!

528
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,700
That will be my star, see it?

529
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,450
Shaofei's star.  -The brightest one.

530
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,150
Ai Qing's star.

531
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,990
This star.

532
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,370
What about Shangyan's? Which one is his?

533
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,200
His will be called Grumpy Star!

534
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,100
Exactly! He's grumpy all the time!

535
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,160
Yes, he scolds me all the time!

536
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,450
Solo is the gentle and nice one!

537
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,130
Don't go getting all mushy here!

538
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,820
It's nauseating! I can't take it.

539
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,610
Hello! Anna! Oleg! Long time no see!

540
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,530
Hello, Gun, welcome back!

541
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,030
Hello!

542
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Hello!

543
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,400
Nice to meet you!

544
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,490
Nice to meet you!

545
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,030
My name is All!

546
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,920
Hello!

547
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,190
Let's go!

548
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,950
Well done, Shangyan.

549
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,320
I see I should've joined K&K!

550
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,110
Ou Qiang!

551
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,260
Hello, everybody!

552
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,990
Long time no see!

553
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,110
Long time no see!

554
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,280
Long time no see!

555
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,610
Hello! Hello! Hello!

556
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,190
Nan Wei!

557
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,900
You're still alive?

558
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:30,480
Hi!

559
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,960
Hello!

560
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,010
Hello! Hello!

561
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,820
Long time no see! Long time no see!

562
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,900
Nice to meet you!

563
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,490
Shangyan is amazing.

564
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,300
He built up such a successful club from nothing!

565
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,840
I bet you've suffered a lot, Shangyan!

566
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,110
Let me introduce

567
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,450
my partner, Nan Wei.

568
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,000
Hello!

569
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,700
Everyone, I'm Nan Wei, welcome to Norway!

570
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,740
Lincoln, Kitty!

571
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,520
Are you that best female geek of China?

572
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,820
Nice to meet you!

573
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,610
I've heard a lot about you!

574
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,450
I was a player in the past, too,

575
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,900
but I'm retired now.

576
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,560
He's the husband of Su Cheng.

577
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,200
They've been married for many years.

578
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,400
It's ok, I don't care.

579
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,960
I know that Su Cheng used to date Solo,

580
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,970
but everyone has a history, right?

581
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,280
Yes.

582
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,740
Su Cheng is married?

583
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,760
I thought she was Gun's girlfriend!

584
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,030
Are you joking?

585
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,820
Yes, you must be joking.

586
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,120
Don't you know his girlfriend

587
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,860
went to their last match?

588
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,960
You've got a girlfriend now?

589
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,720
What idiot would agree to date you?

590
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,020
It's not true.

591
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,490
We're just friends.

592
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,070
Look at him!

593
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,780
Don't play with her feelings, ok?

594
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,400
Get lost!

595
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:52,920
Me?

596
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,200
I'm not going anywhere without you!

597
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,200
Come here, sit down.

598
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,860
Come and have a seat.

599
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,950
I want to talk with you

600
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,270
about this invitation tournament, ok?

601
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:00,820
Come on!

602
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,990
This is our training room.

603
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,780
Hello, welcome!

604
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,280
Hi!

605
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,700
Hi, boss, hi!

606
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,160
Hello!

607
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,990
Please open the door.

608
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,050
Thank you!

609
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,190
Welcome! Welcome!

610
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,530
Welcome here, guys!

611
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,120
All the computers here are at your disposal!

612
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,280
Here, go and practice.

613
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
OK, thank you!

614
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:19,980
You're welcome!

615
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,610
Ou Qiang, study hard!

616
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,570
Don't worry!

617
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,450
I never expected

618
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,540
you and Han Shangyan would come together.

619
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,160
I thought SP and K&K were rivals.

620
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,530
You won't get along.

621
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,530
Of course we are rivals.

622
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,530
There can only be one champion!

623
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,950
It's an invitation tournament, be nice.

624
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,690
No, no, you've misunderstood.

625
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,100
I mean Han Shangyan and Solo aren't...

626
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,570
Oh, I see.

627
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,400
I know Han Shangyan.

628
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,920
He's better than that.

629
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,160
He wouldn't start a club for his personal issues

630
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,370
or mess with people's dreams just to get revenge.

631
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,900
Yes, that's right.

632
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,640
He's here for the world championship, yes.

633
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,600
Hey, we're here for the same reason!

634
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,790
Alright, alright, keep practicing.

635
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,610
Call me if you need anything, okay?

636
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,280
Thanks!

637
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,620
Sure.

638
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,950
It's only an invitation tournament,

639
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,240
don't be so nervous, ok?

640
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,240
Shall we go to the hotel now?

641
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,990
Why?

642
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,100
K&K is staying at the same hotel,

643
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,490
we can go there together.

644
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,360
But it feels so awkward...

645
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,610
Kids these days worry too much!

646
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,030
Why would you care about that?

647
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,070
Let's go!

648
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,030
Nan Wei.

649
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,150
Yes?

650
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,650
Thanks for welcoming us here.

651
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,200
We're going back to the hotel.

652
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:08,970
See you at the competition!

653
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,580
See you!

654
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,150
Forgive me if I forgot anything!

655
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,110
Good luck!

656
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,780
Good-bye!

657
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,780
It's such an honor!

658
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,960
That kid is afraid of you!

659
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,900
What's so scary?

660
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,400
Boss, your room is huge!

661
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,700
Flowers and wine?

662
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,200
They smell so good!

663
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,400
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

664
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,650
Could it be that the hotel misunderstood

665
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,990
when Su Cheng booked the room?

666
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,400
Since you have no girlfriend,

667
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,150
can I have the wine?

668
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,360
Oh right, you like candy best!

669
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,570
You keep the chocolates!

670
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,400
Bye-bye!

671
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,860
Is that ok, boss?

672
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,660
Get out!

673
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,990
Bye!

674
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,640
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day and your birthday!

675
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,080
Do you like the gifts I prepared for you?

676
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,700
Very much.

677
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,700
I'm calling you not just to say happy birthday.

678
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,650
The important thing is

679
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,760
I reserved a necklace at a friend's last week,

680
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,900
you must get it for me today!

681
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,700
I'm busy!

682
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,200
Han Shangyan, you're always busy

683
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,450
when I ask a favor from you!

684
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,780
You are becoming ruder and ruder!

685
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,320
I'm here for a competition,

686
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,210
not to collect your jewelry!

687
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,770
But I'm too busy to go to Norway!

688
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,150
Just do me a favor.

689
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,280
I've transferred the money to you,

690
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,980
and I'll send you the address later.

691
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,990
Pick it up for me tonight,

692
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,030
or they'll sell it to someone else,

693
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,290
do you hear me?

694
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,320
Anyway,

695
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,530
you know what to do! Bye!

696
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,780
We followed each other.

697
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,450
And I'm the only one he's followed!

698
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,480
The flight from Norway arrives at 16:20 p.m.

699
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,280
on March 2.

700
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,780
I'll check the flight number.

701
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,740
Today is February 14,

702
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,290
so how many days are there before March 2?

703
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,070
Isn't today Valentine's Day?

704
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,380
Should I prepare a gift for him?

705
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,490
I'm just a fake girlfriend,

706
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,700
but should I still prepare something?

707
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,200
What if he bought something for me?

708
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,140
1920, it's original.

709
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:48,240
Our car was made in Zhejiang Province.

710
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,200
Yeah, yeah.

711
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,950
It's probably Qing Dynasty?

712
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,150
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

713
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,110
Welcome!

714
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,280
Wait a moment!

715
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,140
How can I help you, sir?

716
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,830
I'm here for Han Jiajia's necklace.

717
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,970
You must be Mr. Han, right?

718
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,470
Yes.

719
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,600
OK, wait a moment.

720
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,110
This is the one.

721
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,110
You can have a look.

722
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,700
It has been here for a long time,

723
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,200
I'm glad she can get it now!

724
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,400
Thank you very much!

725
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,610
What is he doing right now?

726
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,760
Tong Nian. Tong Nian!

727
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,650
It's breakfast time.

728
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,820
Stop staring at your phone!

729
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,950
What's keeping you so busy?

730
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,820
I'm reading today's weather forecast.

731
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,240
I'm full.

732
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,820
You haven't finished up yet!

733
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,620
Look at her, she barely touched her food!

734
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,070
Could he be sleeping?

735
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,530
Bye-bye!

736
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,200
Should I call him now?

737
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,280
The number you have reached

738
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,110
is not in service at this time...

739
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,900
Is he still working?

740
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,070
I shouldn't disturb him.

741
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,200
Hi, I have the necklace.

742
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,610
Thank you!

743
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,440
I knew you would help me!

744
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,030
Anything else?

745
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,930
Take a photo of it and send it to me!

746
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,330
Remember, make sure you don't lose it!

747
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,960
I'll give it to Wu Bai if you don't trust me.

748
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,570
I do trust you,

749
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,410
but you've always lied to me

750
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,560
since you were a kid,

751
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,450
don't you think I should...

752
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,190
Little jerk!

753
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,820
Han Shangyan!

754
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,320
What?

755
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,150
Are you free?

756
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,920
Let's go drink something!

757
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,280
Where?

758
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,170
Here!

759
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,740
Hello, may I help you?

760
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,450
2 cups of Americano, thank you!

761
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,070
OK.

762
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,400
♪ I always want to leave here ♪

763
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,740
This is beautiful,

764
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,130
is it for your girlfriend?

765
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,740
What do you want?

766
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,650
I don't want anything.

767
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,240
Today is your birthday,

768
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,220
so I want to celebrate with you.

769
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,860
See, it's midnight.

770
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,840
I haven't forgotten!

771
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,150
You know what?

772
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,280
I've always thought

773
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,240
that your birth date was very romantic.

774
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,950
One year,

775
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,570
Solo and I went out for Valentine's Day,

776
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,720
but you kept following us

777
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,200
and asked us to treat you to a meal.

778
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,150
I was so angry.

779
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,530
I thought you were just causing trouble,

780
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,200
but then you told us your birthday

781
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,600
was on Valentine's Day!

782
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,950
For people like you and him,

783
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,200
only love matters,

784
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,450
friendship is meaningless.

785
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,490
Han Shangyan, we were...

786
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,780
What? Am I wrong?

787
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,800
Excuse me, 2 cups of Americano, please.

788
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,190
Thanks!

789
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,360
A private meeting?

790
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,360
Why didn't you invite me?

791
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,490
Excuse me!

792
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,190
What's wrong?

793
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,070
Catch him, go!

794
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,680
Thank you!

795
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,070
Han Shangyan!

796
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,320
-Uh... How much?  -Sir, 14 dollars.

797
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,150
14 dollars, please.

798
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,770
Hey lady, can't find your friend?

799
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,510
Yeah.

800
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,570
We can be your friends!

801
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,020
Come on!

802
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,450
Han Shangyan! Han Shangyan!

803
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,420
Hey lady!

804
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:00,970
Hey girl.

805
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,110
Han Shangyan! Where are you?

806
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:02,820
Come on!

807
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,030
Hi. What are you doing?

808
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,610
I'm here to drink.

809
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,240
Come on with us?

810
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,650
Leave me alone!

811
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,380
Let's have a drink.

812
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,320
Release me!

813
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,060
What are you doing?

814
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,700
What do you want? Release me! Release me!

815
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,320
No! No!

816
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,400

817
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,610
