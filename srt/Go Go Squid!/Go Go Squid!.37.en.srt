and let's get out of here!

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,960
The game will start soon.

Okay.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,880
Come on.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,320
Let's go!

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,280
What's wrong?

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,120
What were you talking about upstairs

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,400
that made you guys so happy just now?

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,040
We were talking about,

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
talking about your charm!

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,840
Oh stop.

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,040
Just kidding.

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,480
We are very happy to see that

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
you and Solo can still be friends.

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,090
So we wanted to give you two space and not disturb you.

42
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,040
That's really kind of you.

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,040
I know it is.

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,120
Let's go!

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,520
Wait!

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,960
It's Yaya's message!

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,520
Look!

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,240
You must watch the game at the auditorium

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,640
and cheer loudly!

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,320
Don't forget to cheer loudly!

Gun is coming!

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,640
Gun, we have been waiting for you.

54
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,400
We all support you!

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
Gun,

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
we're from the northeast.

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,960
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,160
It took us forever to get here.

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,080
Thank you, that's nice!

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,320
Gun, go! We will always stand by your side!

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,760
Game on!

62
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,720
Game on!

63
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
I remember you!

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,240
I met you in Guangzhou in 2009, right?

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,200
Yeah, it's me, it's me!

66
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,040
-Game on!  -Thank you.

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Game on, Gun!

68
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,840
Gun, I took a train from Shenyang,

69
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,480
it took more than 20 hours to come see you.

70
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,640
I will always support you!

71
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,320
Thank you.

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,640
Gun, you can do this!

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Good luck, Gun!

74
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
Life is not a destination,

75
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,240
but a journey.

76
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
We take this journey together,

77
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,520
I remember you all.

78
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,760
Thank you so much.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,360

Thank you for never giving up on us

83
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,640
and never doubting us.

84
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
Thank you for always supporting us.

85
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,160
We will work hard

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,320
and stay the course.

87
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,000

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,230

Cool!

121
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,320
We all dreamed of becoming champions.

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
We all dreamed of standing on the world stage

123
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
draped in our national flag!

124
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,100
But that is never possible in my life.

125
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,970
This will be my only regret in life,

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,120
I can't change that.

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
On the bright side,

128
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,700
we are treated like legends and are remembered.

129
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,360
But the truth is,

130
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,600
we're too old for this!

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,440
We have to retire!

132
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,430
But China's CTF competition

133
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,240
will never stop!

134
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,360

135

136
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,720
we will always have newcomers.

137
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,880
And team Solo

138
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,880

165
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,440
You hugged me in front of them,

166
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,560
aren't you shy?

167
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,000
No, not at all!

168
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,280
Get down!

169
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,600
We can talk back at the hotel.

170
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,480
No!

171
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,080
I have to say everything right now!

172
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,120

00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,720
you're a genius!

175
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,960
Yeah, he is also a genius to me!

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,600
Shouldn't you guys be training or something?

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,480
That's not cool, Han Shangyan,

178
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,960
stop trying to hide it!

179
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,680
Yeah, don't be shy!

180
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,360
Tong Nian, you think that

181
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
he's especially charming tonight?

182
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,360
So you wanted to tell the world about your love?

183
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,080
Well yeah, she does!

184
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
You'll understand when we go outside.

185
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,520
There are tons of his fans out there!

186
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,200
Okay, okay.

187
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,760
Stop making fun of them.

188
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,400
Shangyan is shy!

189
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720
You know,

190
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,270
Shangyan finally has a girlfriend,

191
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,900
we shouldn't ruin it!

192
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,440
That's right!

193
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,120
Get down now.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Come on, get down!

195
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,490
No!

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,320
If you keep hugging me like this,

197
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,640
I will kiss you in front of them.

198
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,920
Turn around. Turn around!

199
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,750
Naughty!

200
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,160
So it's only when I scare you

201
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,160
that you listen to me.

202
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,600
They're not strangers.

203
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,400
Yeah, we're not strangers.

204
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,800
Don't be shy!

205
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,920
Kiss her! Now!

206
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,320
Kiss! Kiss!

207
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,440
Don't be shy! Don't be shy!  -Kiss! Kiss!

208
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,640
Enough, enough,

209
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
stop making fun of us.

210
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,160
She is really shy, cut it out.

211
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,960
Come on.

212
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,040
Listen up,

213
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,080
tonight

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,480
everyone should come to my place.

215
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,370
Cause we will have a crazy party!

216
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,840
Dance! Dance! Dance!

217
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,560
Cool!

218
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,800
Solo,

219
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,880
you go first.

220
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,040
I will come to find you later.

221
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,520
What, why?

222
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,100
I will tell you later.

223
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,560
Cool man.

224
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,400
Let's go!

225
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,480
What's wrong?

226
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,620
Come with me right now!

227
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,600
To where?

228
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,000
Beijing Railway Station!

229
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
This is my first time coming here.

230
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,750
The first time I ever came to Beijing

231
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,560
was to join Solo's team.

232
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,360
And then,

233
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,310
my life has changed beyond expectation.

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,550
On that day, I took the train for ten hours.

235
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,440
When I finally arrived in Beijing,

236
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,400
I was tired and sleepy.

237
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,480
But when I met Solo and his team,

238
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,280
I was immediately refreshed.

239
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,070
And all of us felt the same way.

240
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,840
We had to make a team

241
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,400
for the competition and win!

242
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,000
Although we made a team, we didn't have any money.

243
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,840
So I went back home and

244
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,960
I took out the education fund

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that my father had left before his death

246
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,200
as our entrepreneurial fund.

247
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
I heard of this.

248
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,520
Let me finish this.

249
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,400
Okay, I'm listening.

250
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,120
On the day we disbanded the team,

251
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,360
Solo wanted me to take over as captain.

252
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,120
But I refused.

253
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,920
Why?

254
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
How should I say,

255
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,720
if we changed the captain,

256
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,880
then the team would not be what it was anymore.

257
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,720
I was very angry,

258
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,600
and very upset.

259
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,120
I blamed everything on Solo,

260
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,520
and I went back to Norway.

261
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,760
And then I founded K&K.

262
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,960
Actually, I only ever wanted one thing.

263
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,560
I just want to make up for what I had done.

264
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,230
I wanted to start a club with some influence,

265
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,740
and call back all my older team members.

266
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,880
And start chasing our dream with a fresh start!

267
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,960
3 years ago,

268
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,040
when the HQ perked up a bit,

269
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,120
I couldn't wait to set up a China branch.

270
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,240
Do you know why?

271
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,120
Because they were getting older,

272
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,640
they might have retired if it took so long.

273
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,600
Yeah.

274
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,680
I was really anxious about this.

275
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,720
I was afraid I would be too late.

276
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,240
But I didn't expect that

277
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,960
all four of them went to team SP.

278
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,400
So you were alone

279
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,760
running the team K&K.

280
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,080
Silly story huh?

281
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,560
Not at all!

282
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm glad you shared this with me.

283
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,450
When the five of us won the championship,

284
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,240
I felt that the sky was the limit

285
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,560
and the world was ours.

286
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,600
As long as we work together,

287
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,520
there is nothing we couldn't do.

288
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,990
Do you know why the earth turns?

289
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,120
Because of the gravity of the sun.

290
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,920
No.

291
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,626
Because it doesn't want everyone

292
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:18,810
to stay in one place forever.

293
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,710
Whether you're happy or sad,

294
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,560
we all have to keep looking ahead.

295
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,080
After all,

296
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,880
your dreams have all come true.

297
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,760
Those past experiences

298
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,600
will only make you better.

299
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,210
But I still have one dream.

300
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,520
What it is?

301
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,320
This is the prize I got

302
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,400
when I first won the championship.

303
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,960
The championship ring.

304
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,520
It might be too big for you.

305
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,120
Who says that?

306
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,640
I can put it on my bracelet.

307
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,770
Or I can just buy another bracelet especially for this.

308
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,870
Then find a way, so you can wear it.

309
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,360
Tong Nian,

310
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,840
let's get married?

311
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,800
Let's get married,

312
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,880
alright?

313
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,840
How should I...

314
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,960
How should I tell my parents?

315
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
If we want to get married now,

316
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,760
and they don't accept you,

317
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,720
what should we do?

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,620
I already have their permission and blessing.

319
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,520
It's all true, I'm serious.

320
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,880
Last time, my stepmother came back to see your parents.

321
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,040
They met each other.

322
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,440
They already discussed it all,

323
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,960
I got permission from your parents.

324
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,800
And I promised them,

325
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,440
I would take care of you.

326
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,360
You're not ready for this?

327
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,520
It's just...

328
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,000
Nobody's ever proposed to me before.

329
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
Wait, I can't breathe now.

330
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm so nervous.

331
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,640
I feel like I can't even see things clearly.

332
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,760
Sorry, I just need a bit of time.

333
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,880
I need to...

334
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,280
Relax, I won't hurt you.

335
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
Hold my hands,

336
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,520
they are so cold.

337
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,560
I just didn't...

338
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,000
I just didn't expect that...

339
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,560
Breath! Don't be nervous.

340
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,400
It's fine.

341
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,760
Relax, it's fine.

342
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,640
It's fine.

343
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,160
Why did you take it back?

344
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm too impulsive.

345
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,960
Maybe next time.

346
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,040
When is the next time?

347
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,180
Didn't you propose to me just now?

348
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,440
We'll talk about it.

349
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,840
Let's eat something first.

350
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,380
Then when will you propose to me again?

351
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,150
I will wait until you have no doubts or won't hesitate,

352
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,850
I will wait until you want to say yes immediately.

353
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,880
Let's go and grab something to eat.

354
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,120
I didn't say yes to his proposal,

355
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,040
is he all right?

356
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,840
You didn't eat anything,

357
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,640
aren't you hungry?

358
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,480
Not at all.

359
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,040
Are you thinking of

360
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,950
your days when you first came to Beijing?

361
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,360
Why did she refuse to my proposal?

362
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,600
Between us,

363
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,740
do we still have things that need to be solved?

364
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,570
Why didn't I say yes at that time?

365
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,520
I don't know.

366
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,880
Is it because it was too sudden for me?

367
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,660
Or it's because deep in my heart, I'm still afraid.

368
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,010
I have to go to the party with my old buddies.

369
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,080
The party will last whole night,

370
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,640
so I can't keep your company.

371
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,960
You can stay here,

372
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,000
or sleep at your place,

373
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,600
it's up to you.

374
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,120
Okay, then I'm leaving.

375
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,120
Han Shangyan!

376
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
Yes?

377
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,600
Are you afraid of the dark?

378
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Are you in the good mood?

379
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,880
Yeah, I am.

380
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,320
Then it's okay.

381
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
I'm heading out then.

382
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,680
Have a good time.

383
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,480
Bye!

384
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,240
Bye!

385
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,200
What?

386
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,000
Han Shangyan proposed to you,

387
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,920
and you refused him!

388
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,040
No, I didn't want to refuse him.

389
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,800
I just...

390
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,320
You know, it was such a shock...

391
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,320
I just...

392
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,080
I blanked out, you understand?

393
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,560
But you didn't say yes,

394
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,160
which means that you refused him.

395
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,240
Come on, it's not like that!

396
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,080
What should I do!

397
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,840
Give me some advice!

398
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,120
Tong Nian,

399
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
tonight

400
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,600
your boyfriend just came back to the stage,

401
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,720
and brought a farewell match,

402
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,620
and he also defeated the five strongest players ever.

403
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,320
Do you know that his fans were crazy about this?

404
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,480
And at this time,

405
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,120
he proposed to you, Tong Nian.

406
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,800
He proposed to you with his championship ring.

407
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,920
Do you know how precious that ring is?

408
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,860
Gun got the ring when he first won the championship,

409
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,520
there is only one in the world.

410
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,200
Besides, his name GUN is carved out on it,

411
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,320
do you know what does that mean?

412
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,320
I was blank at that time.

413
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,640
And I just felt that

414
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,520
there was something missing before this.

415
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,280
Okay, then how about this?

416
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,120
In order to cheer him up,

417
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,870
I will go ask him for the ring right now!

418
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,520
Are you crazy?

419
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
How can you just ask for his ring back?

420
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,120
Then what should I do?

421
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,520
Stop blaming me!

422
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,280
I'm already super upset about this.

423
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,440
Well, I don't know either!

424
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,040
Okay, bye!

425
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,160
What should I do?

426
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,920
Gun, you're finally here.

427
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,480
Hi.

428
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,320
What were you up to?

429
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,320
Why are you so mysterious?

430
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,600
You know what?

431
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,760
If you came later,

432
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,760
I'd already be drunk!

433
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,400
Yeah!

434
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:04,940
Where did you go?

435
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,560
Drink this as punishment.

436
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,440
Drink this as punishment.

437
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,040
Hurry up!

438
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,840
Tell us.

439
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,560
Old rules, come on.

440
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,200
So serious?

441
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,080
Did you propose?

442
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,800
Propose?

443
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,000
Propose?

444
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,240
Propose!

445
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,320
Wow, not bad man!

446
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,400
You serious about marriage?

447
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,840
That's enough?

448
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
You were rejected?

449
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,160
Look at his dumb face,

450
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,680
maybe he was!

451
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,960
You talk too much!

452
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,760
Come on.

453
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,640
We're all bros!

454
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,280
Yeah!

455
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,920
Be honest with us.

456
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,920
Han Shangyan, you got a no?

457
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,640
Didn't she chase you at first?

458
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,680
It was the girl who chased you?

459
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,560
Yeah, he's lucky dog.

460
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,080
How could she say no to you?

461
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Tell us about it.

462
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,520
Maybe we can give you some advice.

463
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,400
Who says I got rejected?

464
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,680
It just wasn't good timing.

465
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,360
Not good timing?

466
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,440
Why?

467
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,920
You regret it?

468
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,520
Han Shangyan,

469
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,680
proposal is a really big thing,

470
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,760
it's not a game.

471
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,200
I know it's serious.

472
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,200
She was too nervous!

473
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,880
She was sweaty and pale.

474
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,440
If you were me,

475
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,240
would you still want her answer?

476
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,880
You are such an idiot!

477
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,040
Are you crazy?

478
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,050
How do you know she wasn't happy and thus sweaty

479
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,920
am I right?

480
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,720
Yeah!

481
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,130
Girls all get nervous when they're proposed to.

482
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,600
You don't understand!

483
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,350
I'm just afraid she agreed without enough consideration,

484
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,840
and that she would regret her decision later.

485
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,920
The course of our love

486
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,440
never did run smooth.

487
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,280
Come on, just tell us already!

488
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,920
When she got nervous,

489
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
I thought that maybe...

490
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,200
I was too impulsive.

491
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,960
Since tonight we had a farewell match,

492
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,720
I was really excited!

493
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,800
Besides,

494
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,800
she is the only love of my life.

495
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
We can just take it slow.

496
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,120
Why are you all staring at me?

497
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
That's all I have to say.

498
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,040
Come on, you can't leave us.

499
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,680
If you don't want to talk about it,

500
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,600
we won't ask you again.

501
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,440
Come on, man,

502
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,880
just drop the act already!

503
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
We all heard that

504
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,600
your heart went pit-a-pat, like a little drum!

505
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
He's nervous.

506
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,000
You're afraid to lose her.

507
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,490
Come on!

508
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,320
Han Shangyan, you're such a coward,

509
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,440
you don't even have the courage to express your love!

510
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,080
Coward!

511
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
Shame on you!

512
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,400
You wanna play this?

513
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,160
It hurts!

514
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,080
I will teach you a lesson

515
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,760
to let you know who the boss is!

516
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,890
Han Shangyan, you're wrong!

517
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,520
It hurts!

518
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,680
Who's the boss in this room?

519
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,360
Boys,

520
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,280
let him know who is the captain!

521
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,920
Come on!

522
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,720
Who's the boss?

523
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
You little boy!

524
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,440
Say you're wrong!

525
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,500
You take it out on us after heartbreak, huh?

526
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,560
You can't move, can you?

527
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,320
Let's see his face,

528
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
so beautiful!

529
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,880
Beautiful like a girl!

530
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,000
Now kiss me!

531
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,800
Kiss me! Kiss me! Kiss me!

532
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,600
Alright,

533
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,480
what do you want?

534
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,160
Let's play a game!

535
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,320
Okay!

536
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,080
Here we go!

537
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,590
May you be happy and prosperous!

538
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,280
A red envelope, please!

539
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,880

540

What should I do?

546
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,280
Wu Bai, sorry to disturb you so late.

547
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,160
I have a few questions for you

548
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,720
about Han Shangyan.

549
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,640
Do you have time?

550
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,560
Yes, I do.

551
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,640
I want to ask you if

552
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,710
your brother has been rejected before?

553
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
I mean, in love.

554
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,720
No, he hasn't.

555
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,720
You're his first love.

556
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,840
Before you, he didn't fall in love with anyone.

557
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,440
Then, during these years,

558
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,180
he didn't have a crush on any girl?

559
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,120
Why does he love me?

560
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,920
Maybe,

561
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,000
you're the first girl

562
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,420
who likes him because of his achievement in CTF.

563
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,080
Normally, when girls see his poker-face,

564
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,800
or get to know his temper, they will quit.

565
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,680
Why do you like him?

566
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,120
Me?

567
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,240
I fell in love with him at first sight!

568
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,680
This might sound crazy for you, right?

569
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,720
But when I first saw him,

570
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,480
I thought that he was the most special guy on the earth.

571
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,370
Yes, he's handsome,

572
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,080
more importantly, he's charming,

573
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,840
he is so different from others

574
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,720
and I really admire him.

575
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,120
The more time I spend with him,

576
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,360
the more I find out that

577
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,580
he looks indifferent because of the lack of affection

578
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,280
in his childhood.

579
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,240
So he doesn't know how to love others,

580
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,120
I feel sorry for him.

581
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,240
So he is lucky to have you.

582
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,280
I also found that

583
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,400
he's become much gentler since he met you.

584
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,800
To be honest,

585
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,360
I really like him like this.

586
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,040
Well,

587
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,320
if he is rejected by others for some reason,

588
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,840
will he bear grudges?

589
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,800
Or will he become more fragile?

590
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,960
Or sensitive?

591
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,000
Solo disbanded the team,

592
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,160
he held a grudge for a long time.

593
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,360
Yes.

594
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,640
What's going on with you two?

595
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,600
Speak frankly.

596
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,320
He proposed to me,

597
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,400
but I didn't say yes.

598
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,240
It happened so suddenly,

599
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,000
so I was shocked

600
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,200
and I didn't know how to answer him.

601
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,960
Do you think that he will be mad at me?

602
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,440
It's fine.

603
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,960
Let him know that marriage is really serious,

604
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,600
and then he'll be more responsible.

605
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,970
I guess he still doesn't understand love right now.

606
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,200
44,

607
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,240
45,

608
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,560
46,

609
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,880
46,

610
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,160
46.

611
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,050
Come on,

612
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
stop joking.

613
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,080
Come on, you can do this.

614
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,360
We just did 200 push-ups,

615
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,160
and didn't complain once.

616
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,640
You haven't even done 50 yet.

617
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,600
Go on.

618
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,320
47,

619
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,400
48,

620
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,560
49,

621
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,720
50.   -41.

622
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,760
Xiaomi!  -Finished!

623
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,040
You did 200 push-ups,

624
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,620
it's because you lost 4 times.

625
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,960
Sounds like you want to play again.

626
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,520
Yes, he does!

627
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,800
Let's have another round?

628
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,560
Come on!

629
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,880
-Come on!  -Let's play!

630
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,320
Go on!

631
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,840
So how many push-ups did you do?

632
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,960
It was very close.

633
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,880
Maybe 200 or 300.

634
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,640
300!

635
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,600
Your noodles are ready.

636
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,440
-Here we go!  -Noodles are ready!

637
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,040
I'm sorry, only 3 packs left,

638
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,320
please forgive me.

639
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,120
Thank you.

640
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,120
You can keep the change.

641
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,800
No, it's my treat.

642
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,080
You're the team Solo, right?

643
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,600
I just saw your competition,

644
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,600
you guys are awesome!

645
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,360
Exciting, right?!

646
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,000
Definitely!

647
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,760
Great!

648
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,840
Really great!

649
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,640
Thank you.

650
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,080
It's my treat!

651
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,950
Come on!

652
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,320
Thank you. Thank you.

653
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:16,800
Bye!

654
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,920
Old rules.

655
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:20,960
Lady first!

656
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,560
And the youngest second.

657
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,690
I'm not young anymore, captain!

658
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,880
The rules are the rules.

659
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
You are still the youngest out of us,

660
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,760
just eat.

661
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,960
That's right!

662
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,440
Come on, we will share the snacks!

663
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,880
These few days are like a dream to me.

664
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,520
I'd like to go back to the past when I was only twenty,

665
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,640
when I was hanging out with you guys.

666
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,520
You know,

667
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
life is really short.

668
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,760
It's over before you know it.

669
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,800
Come on, don't say that!

670
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,360
Yiqian,

671
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,970
I remember you didn't wear glasses a few years ago,

672
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,960
what happened these couple of years?

673
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,520
I got a job

674
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,720
selling medical equipment.

675
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,690
That's a good job!

676
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,680
The salary is really high!

677
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,640
It's a good job!

678
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,560
I have to make money!

679
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,920
Why did you sigh?

680
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,040
What do you do?

681
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,360
I'm only a salesman for the equipment.

682
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,670
I don't have an awesome life like you guys do.

683
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,960
The job is the job, there is no difference!

684
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,760
Of course there's a difference.

685
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,960
At least, you have a dream.

686
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,480
You're all 30 years old

687
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,960
but you still stay young like you're 20.

688
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,960
That's so cool.

689
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,950
When you asked Mi Shaofei and the others to come back,

690
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,090
you posted on Weibo on behalf of the club.

691
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,120
I still remember

692
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,160
what you said that day!

693
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,160
Listen.

694
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,760
Our dream

695
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,360
has been sleeping for so long.

696
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
All the experience and glory

697
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,720
will be renewed

698
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,640
starting from this moment.

699
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,000
Great!

700
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,360
Yeah!

701
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,880
We're leaving now.

702
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,320
Stick to your dreams.

703
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,400
On this trip,

704
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,720
we are most happy to see that

705
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,280
you and Shangyan have always adhered to your dreams.

706
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,800
The captain will always be our captain!

707
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
When you two have time,

708
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,440
you should come to visit us, okay?

709
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,100
The SP club

710
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,240
will always be the home of our team Solo.

711
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,360
We will!

712
00:31:59,560 --> 00:31:59,960
Safe journey!

713
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,360
Thanks.

714
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:03,920
Take care!

715
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
I will miss you guys!

716
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,840
Have a safe trip!

717
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,440
Bon voyage!

718
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,680
Take care!

719
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,480
Bye! Bye!

720
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,040
You two take care of yourselves!

721
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,840
You too!

722
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,680
All good things must come to an end.

723
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,200
Don't be so sentimental.

724
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,640
We will see each other again!

725
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,920
You're back!

726
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,320
You must be very tired.

727
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,040
Nah, I'm fine.

728
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,560
Do you want to go for breakfast?

729
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,800
Okay, I'll go wash up.

730
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,280
Tong Nian, don't be upset.

731
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,960
Try to be good to him,

732
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,430
so he can't help

733
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,720
but propose to you again.

734
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,480
To be honest,

735
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,640
you should not spoil your boyfriend,

736
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,440
but you rejected him on his farewell match,

737
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,810
of course you need to make it up to him.

738
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,830
That's right!

739
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,080
Try to be good to him.

740
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,320
Tong Nian, in my opinion,

741
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,720
men are always proud.

742
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,910
Since you refused him,

743
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,600
you should give him an out.

744
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,560
Silly girl.

745
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,200
I'm almost ready!

746
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,240
I'll brush my teeth.

747
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,280
No rush!

748
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,680
There's no rush!

749
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,640
I'll go and get changed.

750
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,160
Yeah, change my clothes.

751
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,830
No rush.

752
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,240
But,

753
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,120
the door is transparent,

754
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,800
I can still see you.

755
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,000
What do you want? I'll get it for you.

756
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,680
No, you sit.

757
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
I will go get it for you.

758
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,140
It's better I serve you.

759
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,600
The thing is

760
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,440
you stayed out late last night,

761
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm afraid that you are so tired!

762
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,440
What do you want?

763
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,280
Omelets?

764
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,000
If I were tired,

765
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,600
I wouldn't come down for breakfast.

766
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,830
I thought you came because of me.

767
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,000
I don't want you to think that

768
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,640
I came down to eat because of you.

769
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,490
I hope you can have your own ideas,

770
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,800
and make your own decision.

771
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,600
I'm good with anything.

772
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,400
Do you want coffee,

773
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,080
or milk?

774
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,000
I can do it myself.

775
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Why do you want to serve me?

776
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,300
I heard Tong Nian rejected our boss's proposal yesterday.

777
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,960
Oh my, what was going on!

778
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,480
Oh my god!

779
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,600
So,

780
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,000
they had a fight just now.

781
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,680
How can you believe him?

782
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,000
I guess Tong Nian wanted to get married,

783
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,800
but our boss made a bunch of rules.

784
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,560
What kind of girl can bear that?

785
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,160
Tong Nian told me that.

786
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,520
Coach, testify for me.

787
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,110
We outsiders won't understand it.

788
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,800
Poor boss.

789
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,920
But he needs a lesson!

790
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,880
I'm happy to see that

791
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,440
Tong Nian can teach him a lesson for us.

792
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,720
Wow, you're not kind!

793
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,400
Let's go!

794
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,440
Okay, let's have our breakfast.

795
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,000
It's so good.

796
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,600
Hello, would you like something to drink?

797
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,600
No, thank you.

798
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,600
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold,

799
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,920
I don't know how to adjust this,

800
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,120
so I want to give you a blanket.

801
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,880
Thank you.

802
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,520
You don't wanna take a nap?

803
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,760
No, I don't. But you should sleep.

804
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,360
Tong Nian,

805
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,800
let's get married?

806
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,520
Let's get married,

807
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,320
alright?

808
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,320
How should I...

809
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,480
how should I tell my parents?

810
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,840
If we want to get married now,

811
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,800
and they don't accept you,

812
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,640
what should we do?

813
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,400
You're not ready for this?

814
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,520
Nobody's ever proposed to me before.

815
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,080
Wait, I can't breathe now.

816
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,920
I'm so nervous.

817
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,240
I feel like I can't even see things clearly.

818
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,920
I'm too impulsive.

819
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,680
Maybe next time.

820
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,640
When is the next time?

821
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,500
Do you think that I'm good for nothing?

822
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,480
That I'm not unique and have a lot of flaws?

823
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,520
Also,

824
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,040
are you still mad at me because I didn't say yes

825
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,560
to your proposal?

826
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,680
I'm not mad at you.

827
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,520
Just a little sad is all.

828
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,600
I don't think that you have a lot of flaws.

829
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,040
I'm the one who has flaws.

830
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,530
I know that since we're together,

831
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,410
you always put me before yourself.

832
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,560
That's how you lose your own personality,

833
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,480
am I right?

834
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,120
It's because,

835
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,720
in my eyes, you're so perfect.

836
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,840
I'm afraid that I'm not good enough for you.

837
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,400
So I wish I could

838
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,440
support you in silence behind you.

839
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,160
I don't wanna be a useless person!

840
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,720
How could you be useless to me?

841
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,280
You helped me a lot.

842
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,860
It was you who taught me how to love.

843
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,200
You didn't notice that?

844
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,960
I have also been trying

845
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,880
to become a better me.

846
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,880
So I need to thank you.

847
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,200
And I wish that you could wait for me,

848
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,800
okay?

849
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,520
Okay!

850
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,880
Get some sleep, it's a long-haul flight.

851
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,360
I'll take a nap.

852
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
You don't feel cold?

853
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,320
I'm fine!

854
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,400
Are your parents home?

855
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,240
No, they are not off yet.

856
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,680
Okay, then I won't go in.

857
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,520
