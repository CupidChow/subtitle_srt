53
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,030
Laugh out loud,

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,240
yell out loud,

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,520
and having fun together.

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,320
It's been a long time.

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
The memories

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,120
are still fresh.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,120
But all of a sudden,

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,000
they feel so distant.

61
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,640
I wish I could go back to the old days,

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,000
when we shared the same goal

63
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,520
and worked towards it together

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,860
through thick and thin,

65
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
when we still believed that

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,220
we could accomplish anything together.

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,880
My dearest friends,

68
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,920
after all these years,

69
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,800
have you

70
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,720
realized your dreams?

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,840
Where are you going?

72
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
This is so beautiful!

73
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,960
Guys, guys! Check it out!

74
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,320
Hey! Don't do that!

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,680
Hi! Hello!

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,480
What are you doing? You could fall!

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,840
I'm not a child. Relax!

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm not like you,

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
serious all the time.

80
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,780
This place is awesome, I'm just excited is all!

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,740
Shangyan.

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,250
Yeah?

83
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,730
How did you find this place?

84
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,960
Back when I left team Solo,

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,680
I went off to Norway.

86
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,800
But I wasn't happy there.

87
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
One day,

88
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,070
Nan Wei brought me here.

89
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,320
He wanted to show me how big the world is.

90
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,770
He told me that I shouldn't give up on my dream easily.

91
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
I know you too well.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,530
It'd kill you if you couldn't compete in matches.

93
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,360
Then I realized

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,400
that I shouldn't have given up

95
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,520
just because Solo decided to quit.

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,280
So,

97
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
I went back to Norway

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,600
and founded K&K.

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,920
Solo promised me that

100
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,040
he wouldn't lead any teams ever again,

101
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,480
and now what?

102
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,440
He didn't keep his word.

103
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,440
He just wanted to create a better environment

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,660
for China's CTF.

105
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,140
CTF in China needs a strong leader

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,080
and fresh new blood to grow.

107
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,200
Come on, you can't blame him for that.

108
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,040
Him being the leader?

109
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,240
He walked out on us, remember?

110
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,200
That doesn't mean he doesn't deserve a second chance.

111
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,250
Xiao'ai has grown up now.

112
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,680
He wants to come back,

113
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,310
what's so wrong about it?

114
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,440
He is not worthy!

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,760
Enough, both of you!

116
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,440
Do you know

117
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,130
why I refused to go back home and be a farmer?

118
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,620
I did everything I could to stay here.

119
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Because I believed that my life

120
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,280
didn't have to be so boring.

121
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,350
A lot of people can do better at farming,

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,000
but when it comes to CTF,

123
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,240
few can do better than me!

124
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,080
CTF is the only thing

125
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,520
that I am passionate about!

126
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,330
It makes me feel that I'm alive!

127
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,080
So even if you,

128
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,530
the people that I trust the most all leave,

129
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,880
I'll still be here!

130
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,960
Shangyan,

131
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,400
I know you are angry with Solo and Ai Qing.

132
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,600
But we are also angry with you!

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
Have you considered our feelings?

134
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,360
Okay, chill.

135
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,800
Do we mean anything to you?

136
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,520
You are the genius of CTF.

137
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,030
You are our Gun, our hero.

138
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,040
But you just up and left us.

139
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,280
You were my best friend!

140
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,520
Guys, let me introduce to you.

141
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,800
Han Shangyan, our newest member.

142
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
I'm Ou Qiang.

143
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,000
You can also call me All.

144
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,200
I come from a village in Sichuan,

145
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,680
they all call me...

146
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,000
Pride of the village?

147
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,120
One day in the future,

148
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,720
we'll establish a giant club.

149
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,720
We will gather dozens

150
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,680
or even hundreds of players.

151
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,560
We will make CTF

152
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,560
known to the whole country,

153
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,480
get them to accept it and support it.

154
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,960
I don't care.

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,930
As long as I have your guys here,

156
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
I'm happy.

157
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,480
World champions!

158
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,040

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,440
He can't compare to Solo at all.

173
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,000
Back when you guys were on the same team,

174
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,360
did you fight a lot?

175
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,560
That's just what he's like.

176
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,640
The more he cares about you,

177
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
the meaner he is to you.

178
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
I feel sorry for his friends,

179
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,680
if he has any.

180
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,680
We're all products of our own experiences.

181
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,070
His mother died giving birth to him

182
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,520
due to postpartum hemorrhage.

183
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
Not long after that,

184
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,960
his father passed as well.

185
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,630
He was raised by his stepmother.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,040
I guess

187
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,250
that's why he's become like this.

188
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,880
You sure love these candies.

189
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Always carrying them with you.

190
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,800
All of you think

191
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,000
I eat candies because I'm angry.

192
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
You are wrong.

193
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,000
Then, then why?

194
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,790
Well,

195
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,960
with a candy in your mouth,

196
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,080
you can't speak clearly,

197
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,960
which makes it inconvenient

198
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,480
if you want to insult someone.

199
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,130
Also,

200
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,000
the candy is sweet,

201
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,800
and it helps remind me

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,470
to try to be sweeter and nicer to others.

203
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,600
So,

204
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
candies can cheer me up.

205
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,720
You don't believe me?

206
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,360
Try it for yourself.

207
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
Try yell at me with a candy in your mouth.

208
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,360
Sure, why not?

209
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,400
Have two more.

210
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,400
No thanks.

211
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,290
Come on.

212
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,260
I don't think one is enough to calm you down.

213
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,640
Man, you're so hot.

214
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,080
It's true!

215
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,880
Shangyan, you suck at this game.

216
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,800
Yeah.

217
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,600
Sourpuss.

218
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,400
Yeah.

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,120
Sour-puss!

220
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,760
I can still say it!

221
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,440
Have two more and see how it goes.

222
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,120
Anyone who needs a boyfriend?

223
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,800
Hi! Hello!

224
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Look this way!

225
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,240
This guy is single!

226
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,440
I'm available!

227
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,640
Here, here, I'm single too!

228
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,640
Excuse me,

229
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,710
could you drive a little bit faster?

230
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,760
The airport express is packed with cars,

231
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,840
and it's raining today,

232
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,960
I can't go faster.

233
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,480
You are in such a hurry,

234
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,680
but you aren't carrying any luggage.

235
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,480
Let me guess.

236
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,200
You're picking up your boyfriend huh?

237
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,820
One time,

238
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,270
I waited at the airport for my wife

239
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,760
without telling her,

240
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,220
she was thrilled when she saw me.

241
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,520
It's good to be young.

242
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,680
My boyfriend wouldn't do that.

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,330
He likes to keep things to himself.

244
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,760
He's not a romantic guy at all.

245
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,480
But I can feel

246
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,400
his love for me.

247
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,120
I can tell from his eyes.

248
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,600
It's pouring today.

249
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,640
Sir,

250
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,370
could you try to drive faster?

251
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,920
But not too fast, safety first.

252
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,800
Sure.

253
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
Thank you.

254
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
So what about your cousin, Wu Bai?

255
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,550
What do you think of him?

256
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,960
The last time a Chinese player

257
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,140
won the world championship

258
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,440
was many years ago.

259
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
So to be honest,

260
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
I'm very happy that he won the championship

261
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,920
on behalf of China.

262
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,560
Also, his personal ranking

263
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,880
has been greatly elevated.

264
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,290
It's a good thing that he was able to solidify his place.

265
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,280
Okay, thank you.

266
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,000
Wu Bai!

267
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,400
What are you doing here?

268
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,320
Congratulations on the championship!

269
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,600
Thank you!

270
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,040
Where's Han Shangyan?

271
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
He's on the bus.

272
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,720
Then why are you here?

273
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,360
I don't like being surrounded by reporters,

274
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
so I came out later.

275
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,380
Does that mean I can't see him today?

276
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,800
You want to see him?

277
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,640
Yeah!

278
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,440
I want to see him.

279
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,640
Then come with me.

280
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,080
Thank you.

281
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,440
K&K! K&K!

282
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,520
Thank you

283
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
for accepting our interview.

284
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,560
Gun,

285
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,280
can I take a picture of you?

286
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,440
No, please don't.

287
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,240
Okay, I understand.

288
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,920
You don't like taking pictures.

289
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,520
Okay, I guess that's all it is.

290
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
When the article is ready,

291
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,400
I'll send it to you.

292
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,200
Okay.

293
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Your girlfriend is here.

294
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,800
Hey, Boss.

295
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,800
your girl is here!

296
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,800
Tong Nian.

297
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,280
That hat you're wearing...

298
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
It's hideous.

299
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,510
It goes with my scarf and my skirt.

300
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,400
What's up?

301
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,680
I wanted to see you.

302
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,050
= Welcome Back, Champions! =

303
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,920
Get on the bus.

304
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,460
He's not gonna carry you in.

305
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,760
You heard him.

306
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,840
Are you cold?

307
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,760
No.

308
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,040
I've got a long coat,

309
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm fine.

310
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,720
The scarf keeps me warm, too.

311
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,710
Put on more clothes next time.

312
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
You don't like the way I dressed today?

313
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,760
Don't get me wrong.

314
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,410
You can wear whatever you want.

315
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,240
Let me know if you have any preferences,

316
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,120
and I'll dress the way you like.

317
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,800
What do you like me to wear?

318
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,840
I'll wear it for you next time.

319
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,200
Okay.

320
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,280
Do you have any idea

321
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,040
what you just said implies?

322
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,960
What?

323
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,080
No idea?

324
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,500
Don't say things like that in the future,

325
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,600
especially with men.

326
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,950
Understood?

327
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,220
Yeah.

328
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,920
I'll go sit at the back.

329
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,320
Xiao'ai.

330
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,520
Your mom's talking to you.

331
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
It's okay.

332
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,560
Hello, what can I get for you?

333
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,880
Thank you.

334
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,280
Mm... Cranberry juice.

335
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,720
Okay.

336
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,600
An Americano, no milk.

337
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,080
Thanks.

338
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,720
Sure.

339
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,200
I'll take the same, please.

340
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
Okay, one moment please.

341
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,680
Congratulations

342
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,120
on the singles championship.

343
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,480
Thanks.

344
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,520
Xiao'ai,

345
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,650
your dad sends me photos of you every year.

346
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,600
Don't send them anymore!

347
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,360
Don't be rude.

348
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,200
They are my photos.

349
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,640
You should have asked me first!

350
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,000
She's your mom.

351
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,120
Don't be rude, okay?

352
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,240
Excuse me.

353
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,320
Thanks.

354
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,760
You're welcome.

355
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,400
Where are you going?

356
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,600
I want this,

357
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,120
this,

358
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,920
and this.

359
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,840
I want to take her to the doctor's

360
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,080
and see if there's other ways

361
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,720
to improve her hearing.

362
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,680
You ordered four cakes?

363
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Can you finish them?

364
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,120
I like cakes.

365
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,680
It's fine.

366
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,480
Order whatever you want.

367
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,820
My dad is the manager of SP China.

368
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,250
Do you still think he's

369
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,440
that guy who came from nothing and had nothing?

370
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,960
He can afford them!

371
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,920
I know.

372
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,820
I know what he's been through.

373
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:32,960
Xiao'ai,

374
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,680
Dad has training for a few days.

375
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,430
Why don't you stay with your mom for a few days?

376
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,630
I'm talking to you!

377
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,760
Put these on.

378
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,160
Xiao'ai!

379
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,580
Hey!

380
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,480
Don't.

381
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,250
Don't you see she's already upset?

382
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
It's all right.

383
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,320
Wu Bai,

384
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,560
team 1's average performance is not good enough.

385
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,560
We need new blood.

386
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,720
I'm also looking.

387
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,700
Our priority for now is CTF,

388
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,730
so whatever you need, ask away.

389
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,080
Okay.

390
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,200
Take a break.

391
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,880
I'm on a cool bus,

392
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,800
and that makes me cooler!

393
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Nobody said if I could come in or not.

394
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,000
Wu Bai, you're back.

395
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,200
Why isn't the boss with you?

396
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,320
He's busy.

397
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,750
Busy? With what?

398
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,920
Look!

399
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,240
Follow me closely.

400
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,460
Okay.

401
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,480
Watch where you are going.

402
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,440
Okay?

403
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,800
Okay.

404
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,560
Let's go.

405
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Boss, you go ahead.

406
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,400
We've got your stuff.

407
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,200
Take your time!

408
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,040
Wow... This is my first time at K&K.

409
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,920
Here, have some juice.

410
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,080
Thanks.

411
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,880
Wait for me here.

412
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,800
I need to make a call.

413
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,280
Okay.

414
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,380
Wow!

415
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,380
Hey there, having fun?

416
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,800
Don't be shy.

417
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,960
We do this all the time.

418
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,720
Hello.

419
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,400
Okay this is awkward.

420
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,000
You're making her feel uncomfortable.

421
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,480
Let's go, come on.

422
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,160
Let's go.

423
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,360
Mm. I know.

424
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,960
Can I take a picture of him?

425
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,560
It should be fine.

426
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,240
He wouldn't notice it anyway.

427
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,000
No problem.

428
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,320
I'll just take one.

429
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,480
If he just turns my way a little bit...

430
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:16,960
Sure.

431
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,400
One more time.

432
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:19,880
Okay.

433
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,080
Sure.

434
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,800
Wait.

435
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,760
Delete it.

436
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,320
Do it.

437
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,800
Please go on.

438
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,200
My goodness.

439
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,200
He knows this WeChat account is mine?

440
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,090
That means he got all the messages I sent before?

441
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,410
My goodness. He knows it was me!

442
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,760
This is so embarrassing...  -Hold on.

443
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,040
Come in.

444
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,160
Oh, okay.

445
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,080
The phone.

446
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,640
Wait, what?

447
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,160
Now.

448
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,920
Your phone.

449
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,000
Oh... my phone.

450
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,970
I've deleted all the photos. See?

451
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,480
I've deleted them all.

452
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,640
All of them.

453
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,120
You have a message.

454
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,480
What is going on?

455
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,360
Did you meet Gun?

456
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,240
Was he totally smitten with you?

457
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,760
You have a great figure.

458
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,400
You need to show him what you've got!

459
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,760
Funny, huh?

460
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,000
Gun, are you still here?

461
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,680
You are the host.

462
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,240
Sign into the conference call first

463
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,120
and lead the conference.

464
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,720
Gotta go.

465
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,160
Do you talk to your friends about me a lot?

466
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,000
No.

467
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
No, no! Not at all!

468
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,840
Don't get it wrong.

469
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,480
Well, sometimes,

470
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,560
I talk a little bit about you.

471
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,240
Just a little bit, you know.

472
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,880
Really?

473
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,400
What do you say?

474
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,880
They are curious about you.

475
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,840
I'd tell them what you did

476
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,750
when you were with Solo and stuff like that.

477
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,920
That's it?

478
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,520
That's it.

479
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,720
Really?

480
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,760
Yeah.

481
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,000
Hello everyone, this is Gun.

482
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,200
I'll leave you to it.

483
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,000
Hi, hi Gun.

484
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,960
Long time no see.

485
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,360
How's the weather in Shanghai?

486
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,740
Terrible weather.

487
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,360
Heavy rain in Shanghai.

488
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,320
Well, that wasn't too bad.

489
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,800
He's so cute.

490
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,280
RAP got rich overnight.

491
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,960
They took 6 of the top 10 places in the world.

492
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,960
Boss has brought over his girlfriend.

493
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,320
This is the first time

494
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,640
a single woman has visited K&K.

495
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,760
Where is she?

496
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,200
In his room?

497
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,120
In the meeting room.

498
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,440
Meeting room?

499
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,580
He's in a meeting with his girlfriend?

500
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,120
Dinner is here.

501
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,600
Wash your hands and eat.

502
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,440
Thank you, Mrs. Zhao!

503
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,080
OK, fine. See you.

504
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,560
Anyone there?

505
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,320
Boss, are you done?

506
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,120
Tell everyone to come inside.

507
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,080
Bring me two boxed meal.

508
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,680
Okay.

509
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,800
No problem.

510
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,800
Why did he want us there?

511
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,800
To eat... together?

512
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,720
Boss.  -Boss.

513
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,720
Boss.  -Tong Nian.

514
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,280
Boss.

515
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,640
Hi Tong Nian.

516
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,240
Boss, why are we...

517
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,440
Sit and eat.

518
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,120
Oh. That's it?

519
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,800
Come on let's eat.

520
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Yeah, yeah, eat.

521
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,840
He's developed a new hobby?

522
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,080
Eat, eat.

523
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,080
Guys.

524
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,400
This is

525
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,120
the first time he's brought Tong Nian to eat with us.

526
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,360
Right.  -Yeah.

527
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,960
This is our home.

528
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,400
You like it here?

529
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,560
Ah? It's great. Yeah.

530
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,440
Here, eat, come on.

531
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,680
This is my favorite.

532
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,360
If you don't like it,

533
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,940
I've got snacks in my dorm.  - It's great.

534
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,700
I wouldn't even give them...  - Demo.

535
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,580
Yeah?

536
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,240
I remember last time

537
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,960
you ranked third to last in the speed test.

538
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,480
Well, boss,

539
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,160
I've been practicing.

540
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,640
And,

541
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,710
the second to last and last place guys are both here.

542
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,880
Why are you being so hard on me?

543
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,560
Demo!

544
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,200
Am I?

545
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,960
You know what, Boss?

546
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,520
I tested myself using the software

547
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,440
and I scored 201.

548
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,040
Not bad huh?

549
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,760
I remember

550
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,720
DT scored 106.

551
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,280
I'm sorry, boss.

552
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,880
I will keep practicing.

553
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,040
Can I ask something?

554
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,320
Tong Nian, good timing.

555
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,320
You just saved us.

556
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,720
Yeah?

557
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,280
What's that software he mentioned?

558
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,680
97,

559
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,800
explain.

560
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,660
Oh. It's a software we use to test reaction speeds.

561
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,320
It's really easy.

562
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,680
You just turn it on,

563
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,600
and when you hear a beep in your headphones,

564
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,960
you click the mouse.

565
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,200
It tests your reaction speed.

566
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,760
Does 106 means milliseconds?

567
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,040
Yes, exactly.

568
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,920
A second equals 1,000 milliseconds.

569
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
201?

570
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,800
That's not bad at all!

571
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,880
Right?

572
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,600
Yes.

573
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,200
I knew I was amazing.

574
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,240
What's so special with this software?

575
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,040
Aren't there other ways to train yourselves?

576
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,520
In the beginning we just did it for fun.

577
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,240
Then someone uploaded it online

578
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,800
and have us compete against each other.

579
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,160
Who else could it be?

580
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,240
It's our dear Boss torturing us.

581
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,360
I have an idea.

582
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,400
We can design a software which can help

583
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,090
train our hand-eye coordination.

584
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,610
In the beginning,

585
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,160
the screen is green

586
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,200
and then it turns blue.

587
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,700
You need to click the mouse when the color changes.

588
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,160
Isn't that more efficient?

589
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,440
Well...

590
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,840
It's already available abroad.

591
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,560
Really?

592
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,020
Why don't you download it and have fun together?

593
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,920
No no no.

594
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,360
That's way too easy for us!

595
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,040
Seriously!

596
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,400
Boss you must be kidding us.

597
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,760
We don't need that.

598
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
That's way too easy.

599
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,880
I can make a more advanced version.

600
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,990
One color might not be enough to test speed.

601
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,720
We can have multiple colors.

602
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,560
For example...

603
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,800
I'm listening.

604
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,000
For example what?

605
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,770
It doesn't have to be colors.

606
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,670
I can completely redesign it if you want.

607
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,120
Do you need a ranking table?

608
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,560
One with real-time update?

609
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,400
Do you need it?

610
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,920
It's easy to say.

611
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,760
But can you do it?

612
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,540
If you are interested,

613
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,640
I can write a program tonight.

614
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,480
No no no!

615
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,280
Not interested, not interested.

616
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,040
It's too much trouble.

617
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,960
No thanks, really.

618
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,840
I'm happy to help!

619
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,400
I can do it!

620
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,840
Really, there's no need.

621
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,880
What....

622
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,160
What is going on?

623
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,760
That's so sweet, huh?

624
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,320
Are you going to eat or not?

625
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,320
Get back to training if you are not!

626
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,840
We'll eat, we'll eat.

627
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Eat, eat.

628
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,720
Miss, why don't you eat?

629
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,560
Oh, no,

630
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,880
I've been eating.

631
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,480
Is it not good?

632
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,640
No it's great.

633
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,520
I'm just not hungry.

634
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,560
I'm pretty full.

635
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,280
You're not hungry?

636
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,840
I had a lot of cakes before I came here,

637
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,360
so I'm not hungry at all.

638
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,880
Then let's get going.

639
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,560
Thanks.

640
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,520
Hey sir,

641
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,760
please drop her off at Jiaodong Uni.

642
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,200
Okay.

643
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,760
I'll call you as soon as the software is ready.

644
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,630
Yeah.

645
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,560
Your WeChat name,

646
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,840
when will you change it?

647
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,120
Don't you think it's too long?

648
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,440
How did you know that was me?

649
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,280
Instinct.

650
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,320
Let's go. Drive safe.

651
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:03,920
Okay.

652
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,040
Bye-bye.

653
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,470
I'll call you when the software is ready.

654
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,200
Go back inside, it's too cold!

655
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,400
Tong Nian, why are you still up?

656
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,640
What are you doing?

657
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,760
Go back to sleep.

658
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,590
I'm making something really cool.

659
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,480
Oh.

660
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,400
Don't stay up too late.

661
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:48,890
Yeah I know.

662
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,200
Jeez, you stayed up all night?

663
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,840
Who made you

664
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,130
stay up all night writing this?

665
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,400
I'm done.

666
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Do you want to

667
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,320
get some sleep now?

668
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,920
I'm fine. Thanks.

669
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,730
I need to go wash my face.

670
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,200
Okay.

671
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,360
Hey, Xiao'ai, wait up!

672
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Xiao'ai!

673
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,280
Time for breakfast.

674
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,640
Xiao'ai!

675
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,240
Xiao'ai!

676
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,950
Why don't you eat your breakfast?

677
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,520
I will if you come down.

678
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,120
I'm wearing a skirt. I can't.

679
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,640
Hey! Han Shangyan!

680
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,920
What are you doing?

681
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,160
Where are you taking me?

682
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,360
Han Shangyan!

683
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,200
I...

684
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,240
Eat.

685
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,960
I won't!

686
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,640
Suit yourself.

687
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,040
Are you Gun?

688
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,920
And you are Solo's daughter?

689
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,960
What's your name? Xiao'ai right?

690
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,840
I thought you hated my dad.

691
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,440
How do you know my name?

692
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,640
The first time we met,

693
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,000
you were about this tall,

694
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,040
still a toddler.

695
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,200
You were politer back then.

696
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,320
Boo... I know better now.

697
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,960
Han Shangyan, what were you doing?

698
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,600
I was playing with her.

699
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:26,960
Xiao'ai,

700
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,720
eat whatever you want.

701
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,960
I'll have the rest.

702
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:30,890
Oh.

703
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,720
How did Solo raise her?

704
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,560
She's such a brat.

705
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,880
Don't you dare badmouth my dad!

706
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,840
You'll regret it!

707
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,960
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?

708
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,740
Han Shangyan,

709
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,960
that's enough.

710
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,480
She's just a kid.

711
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,360
She needs to be disciplined.

712
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,760
She's my daughter.

713
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,280
Leave her alone.

714
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,560
Xiao'ai,

715
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,360
want to go to the amusement park?

716
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,320
No, I've been there too many times.

717
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,080
Mom hasn't been there.

718
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,320
Can you go with me?

719
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,520
I don't want to.

720
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,460
Obviously Solo didn't raise her right.

721
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,220
You could probably have done a better job.

722
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,320
What's your problem?

723
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,080
You don't like your mother,

724
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,490
but you need to be polite to your seniors.

725
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,920
Didn't your dad teach you that?

726
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,880
If he didn't, then he's not a good dad.

727
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,920
What do you mean? I'm not polite?

728
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,720
I will go.

729
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
You said it.

730
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,680
You have to go now.

731
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,240
You need to come, too.

732
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
Why should I?

733
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,320
Give me a reason.

734
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,760
If you can convince me, I'll go.

735
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,640
When you first started,

736
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,680
my dad helped you a lot.

737
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,960
It's about time

738
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,520
to repay his kindness.

739
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,220
Fine,

740
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,640
if that's what you want.

741
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,440
I'll see you downstairs in 10 minutes.

742
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,800
Han Shangyan, you tricked me!

743
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,960
