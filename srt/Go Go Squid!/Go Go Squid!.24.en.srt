Tong Nian,

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,480
Tong Nian.

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,640
Tong Nian?

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,800
Why... Why are you here?

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,720
Is he all right?

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
He's alive, anyway.

Has Han Shangyan pissed you off again?

36
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,600
You know what happened.

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,400
If Han Shangyan says something bad,

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,280
it's because of me.

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,400
Don't take it to heart, Tong Nian.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,160
What's wrong? Don't cry.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,400
It's okay, it's okay.

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,120
Don't cry, don't cry.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
Stop crying, okay?

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
Are... Are you all right?

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,600
Are you okay?

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,760
You... You...

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,120
You take good care of him,

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,320
I'm gonna go back alone.

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,160
Hold on! Idol!

50
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,680
Hold on.

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
Tong Nian.

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,800
Tong Nian.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,360
Tong Nian?

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
Tong Nian!

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Slow down!

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,720
All right.

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,960
Stop, stop, stop.

58
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,680
What did he say to you?

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,160
He said...

60
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,200
He said he went to Norway for a blind date.

61
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,560
A blind date?

62
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
I think he's kidding.

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,760
No, it's true.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
All right, all right, all right.

65
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,760
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,680
It's true.

67
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,360
He went to Norway for a blind date.

68
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,440
He didn't.

69
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
He must have been drunk to tell you such things,

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,280
and...

71
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Anyway, that's nonsense.

72
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,360
My good girl, don't cry.

73
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,440
Are you okay?

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,360
Do you need any help?

75
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm fine.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
You're drunk as hell and you're fine!

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,600
I held it in for half an hour.

78
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm finally comfortable after purging it.

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,440
The worst.

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,160
Why did you hold it in?

81
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,240
You know why.

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,080
How could I throw up in front of a girl?

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,040
I didn't think you cared so much about your image.

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,640
Not everyone is like you.

85
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,160
No matter what you do,

86
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,480
girls like you because you have a pretty face.

87
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,680
What's on your mind?

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,120
Did you bully her?

89
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,040
I know you're upset,

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,840
but you shouldn't take it out on a girl.

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,160
Be a man, okay?

92
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,080
It's not what you think.

93
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,280
Then tell me!

94
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,440
Come on!

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,720
Her parents don't like me.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,960
Our families have a good relationship,

97
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,520
so, they know all the shitty things

98
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,960
I've done since I was a kid.

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,920
I thought about it that day.

100
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
So many stupid things.

101
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,960
No wonder her parents don't like me.

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,720
You chickened out?

103
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,440
Have you ever seen me chicken out?

104
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,800
I haven't.

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,280
I just don't think it's necessary.

106
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,440
They're a close family,

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,720
and they're very happy.

108
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,840
It's not worth it if I make them unhappy.

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,360
Just to be with me,

110
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,280
it's not worth it.

111
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
Don't say that.

112
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,640
You deserve the best friend,

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
and the best wife.

114
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,040
We're not married,

115
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,520
she's not my wife.

116
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,920
Hypocrite.

117
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,480
I bet you're gonna call her.

118
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,440
Designated driver!

119
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,000
All right, designated driver.

120
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,040
All right, all right.

121
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,560
What's wrong?

122
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,480
Why are you stopping?

123
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
I think we'd better wait for them here.

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
They're drunk,

125
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm afraid they'll drive and break the law.

126
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,400
Okay.

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,720
Let's wait for them.

128
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,400
Speak kindly to her.

129
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,160
Let me help.

130
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,680
Get in.

131
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,800
Go, go, go.

132
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,800
Why are you still here?

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,000
We're both really drunk,

134
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,360
we can't drive you back to school.

135
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,480
We can go back ourselves.

136
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,080
We were afraid you'd drive,

137
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,480
after all, you're drunk.

138
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,960
So, we waited here for you.

139
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,240
It's not your problem.

140
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,760
Thank you.

141
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,120
Hello.

142
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,400
Excuse me, are you Mr. Han?

143
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,520
Yes.

144
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm your driver.

145
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,280
I think I should give you a moment.

146
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,760
No.

147
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,840
Go to Jiaodong University.

148
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,520
No.

149
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,960
I'll take a cab.

150
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,040
Tong Nian.

151
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,080
Tong Nian.

152
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,600
Tong Nian!

153
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,560
Don't leave.

154
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,880
This place is too remote to take a cab.

155
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,640
We'd better go with them.

156
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:31,980
No.

157
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,520
Look, both of them

158
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,840
are super drunk,

159
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,680
what if they run into a thug?

160
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,080
We'll go downtown with them,

161
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,720
and then we won't worry

162
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,560
even if they meet a thug.

163
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,480
Look at them,

164
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,560
they are the thugs.

165
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,800
But...

166
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,130
What if they fall asleep?

167
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,080
They'll be taken to the middle of nowhere,

168
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
and get robbed.

169
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,200
All right, be a good girl.

170
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,680
Go with them, okay?

171
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,760
Go, go, go, let's go.

172
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,120
Go.

173
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,680
Get in, get in.

174
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,040
Hey, wait.

175
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,440
You sit in the backseat.

176
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
You sit in the back, I sit in the front.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,640
Get in!

178
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm the only one in the right mind.

179
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,240
Thank you.

180
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,560
Could you give Tong Nian some room?

181
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,400
Don't be sad.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,520
I'm not worth being sad about.

183
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,680
A man like me

184
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,560
with a bad personality,

185
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,760
snappy,

186
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,640
unromantic,

187
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
and have no time to spend with you.

188
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,360
Well, all that aside.

189
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,000
The worst thing is that

190
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,480
I'm unfaithful.

191
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,600
As soon as I was asked on a blind date,

192
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,040
I couldn't help but go.

193
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,880
A man like me

194
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,160
doesn't deserve your love.

195
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,560
Also...

196
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,520
is there nothing else for you to do in your life

197
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,000
except falling in love with a bad man?

198
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,240
I have to go. I have a headache.

199
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,080
♪ I have reasons I feel too embarrassed to say ♪

200
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,600
♪ I'm used to being lonely ♪

201
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,280
Let's go back to the dorm.

202
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,600
♪ I could avoid your caring eyes ♪

203
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,280
Tong Nian, drink some water.

204
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,920
Thank you.

205
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,320
What are you doing?

206
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm working on that...

207
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,360
the facial-recognition program for a bank.

208
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,800
It occurred to me that there were a few bugs.

209
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,470
I wanted to get back here quickly.

210
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,930
I was afraid I'd forget about the bugs again.

211
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,720
Let it pass. Stop it, okay?

212
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,040
I'm fine, it's OK.

213
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,720
I'll be fine if I'm busy.

214
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,640
Doing nothing will make me sad,

215
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,360
so I might as well work.

216
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,320
All right, all right.

217
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,840
Stop it and go to bed, okay?

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,840
I'm really fine.

219
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Do you want me to help you fix any of the bugs?

220
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,110
Tell me and I can help you.

221
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,480
Stop it, Tong Nian.  -Yeah.

222
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
It's OK.

223
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,560
Don't worry about me.

224
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,700
Leave me alone and I won't feel bad if I keep busy.

225
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,520
No, we're here with you.

226
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh, that is pungent!

227
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,720
Boss, where did you drink?

228
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,280
Yeah.

229
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,920
Is there a problem?

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,120
If not, I'll go to bed.

231
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,680
There is.

232
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,720
And...

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,760
it's a difficult one.

234
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,640
Yeah, yeah.

235
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,200
Tell me!

236
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,320
Demo's mother

237
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,680
has been here several times.

238
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,200
She heard you were coming back tomorrow

239
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,240
and said she would be here in the morning

240
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,600
and wouldn't leave unless she sees you.

241
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,030
Right?

242
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,480
Yeah.

243
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,460
And she called you a coward.

244
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,000
What are you talking about?

245
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
What did you tell her?

246
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,010
I said our boss is like a fierce tiger.

247
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,640
How...

248
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,680
how could you be a coward?

249
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,720
Well, boss,

250
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,360
there's something else.

251
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,760
Demo...

252
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,120
He's been worried sick all day,

253
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,160
and he's waiting for you in your room.

254
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,520
He is waiting to ask for help.

255
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,920
Boss.

256
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,760
Well, don't cry.

257
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,520
You've been crying all day.

258
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,520
Your boss is back.

259
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,640
Don't cry.

260
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,720
Don't scold him.

261
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,320
He has been crying all day.

262
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,920
He's just a kid,

263
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,240
you should comfort him.

264
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,520
What's this crying about?

265
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,680
Are you a man or not?

266
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
I'm so pathetic,

267
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,640
but you scold me, boss.

268
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,520
There are a lot of people worse off than you,

269
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,700
and I've never seen anyone cry as much as you.

270
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,640
Who is worse off than me?

271
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,280
Someone older than you,

272
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,370
spent many years preparing for his comeback,

273
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,480
but he was forced to retire

274
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,200
due to poor grades.

275
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,080
Do you think he's miserable?

276
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,840
Anyone else?

277
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
It's not a big deal.

278
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,760
Boss, I've been under a lot of pressure.

279
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,680
I can't get higher on the rankings

280
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
and I'm afraid of dragging our team down.

281
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,160
My parents are divorced,

282
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,120
and my mother doesn't support me.

283
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,520
Today she came here

284
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,320
and said she would take me home no matter what.

285
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,410
Besides, she said I had no future staying here.

286
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,400
She knows you'll be back tomorrow,

287
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,160
and she'll come here to make trouble.

288
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,280
You can't hold on?

289
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,320
No.

290
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,600
If you haven't given up,

291
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,080
then get on with it.

292
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,800
You hear me?

293
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,640
Ma'am, drink some water.

294
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,840
Hello, ma'am.

295
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,400
Hello, ma'am.

296
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,550
Ma'am,

297
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,240
Demo and I are teammates,

298
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,160
I'm the vice-captain.

299
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,310
Me, too.

300
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,840
Demo and I are close.

301
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,310
Come on, say it.

302
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,640
Ma'am,

303
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,960
Demo often talks about you

304
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,550
and misses home a lot.

305
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,080
Yeah.

306
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,420
Demo is the youngest one of our team.

307
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,960
He tears up when he talks about you.

308
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,400
Well, ma'am,

309
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,000
you may misunderstand

310
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,760
what our job is

311
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,880
and how our club works.

312
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,160
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,760
But that is to be expected

314
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,400
because our business is often misunderstood.

315
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,680
Have you two graduated from college?

316
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,800
Yes... Yes, yes.

317
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Yes, ma'am,

318
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,000
I graduated from a Project 985 university.

319
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,880
He's better than me,

320
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,080
he graduated from a world-famous university.

321
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,800
So, it's normal for elite students like you

322
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,960
to idle away.

323
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,440
But Dai Feng is different.

324
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,400
He graduated from a vocational high school.

325
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
If he doesn't find a job quickly

326
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,640
and get experience,

327
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,440
he'll likely become a loser.

328
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,040
Ma'am,

329
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,400
you're making it sound worse

330
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,760
than it actually is.

331
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,960
Well,

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,760
Dai Feng he's not idling around.

333
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,760
Yeah.

334
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,840
We're all professionals,

335
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,000
and serious people.

336
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,840
It's just

337
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,600
our profession is unconventional.

338
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,800
But like people you know,

339
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,520
such as swimmers,

340
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,880
or divers,

341
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
we also need daily training,

342
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,680
and regular competition.

343
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,600
Yeah, ma'am.

344
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,880
And if we win, we get a bonus.

345
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,440
Right.

346
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,640
We get paid every month.

347
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,520
Well, tell me.

348
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,640
How long will this last?

349
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,120
Will you still do it until you're 30?

350
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,000
But...

351
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
this is living our dream, right?

352
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
So, your dream is gonna support you?

353
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,200
Well,

354
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,280
yeah, it's okay.

355
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,280
For example, we can work for an Internet company

356
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,440
or develop software or something else.

357
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,360
There are more than twenty of you,

358
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
can you all go to Internet companies

359
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,560
or develop software?

360
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,520
Do you all have a way out?

361
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,800
I think only a few will succeed.

362
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Don't try to trick me.

363
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,880
Your mother is so eloquent,

364
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,200
very strong-minded.

365
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,040
We can't beat her argument.

366
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,000
Leave it to boss.

367
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,360
Shangyan?

368
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,920
Shangyan?

369
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,640
Dai Feng's mother is here,

370
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,400
she's been waiting for a while.

371
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,240
Are you still not feeling well?

372
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,680
Well, sit up.

373
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,440
Here, drink some water to sober up.

374
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,560
Do you want me to ask her to leave?

375
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,000
Mrs. Zhou,

376
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,440
please get me my suit.

377
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,560
OK.

378
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,440
Mom,

379
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
please eat something.

380
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,320
Look, mom, the food here is good,

381
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,320
and the accommodation is good too.

382
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,000
You don't have to worry about me.

383
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,240
Mom.

384
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,680
Hello, ma'am.

385
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm the owner of this club,

386
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,960
Han Shangyan.

387
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,680
Hello.

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,320
Ma'am, have you eaten yet?

389
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
No, I'm not hungry.

390
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,320
It seems you don't like the food.

391
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
I've only just got back,

392
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,480
if you have time,

393
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
I'd like to take you out to dinner

394
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,800
so we can talk.

395
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,440
Well,

396
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,920
thank you, Mr. Han.

397
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,080
Let's talk here.

398
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,400
This is the first time we've met,

399
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
please allow me to honor that.

400
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,200
Right, mom.

401
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,640
Let's have dinner together.

402
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,480
Son, listen,

403
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,660
this time you have to come back with me.

404
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,680
Mom,

405
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,400
let's go inside and eat...

406
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,280
Do something serious from a young age.

407
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,690
You think I'll allow you to stay here

408
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,720
after your boss treat me to dinner?

409
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,520
That's not gonna happen.

410
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
I won't eat, if necessary.

411
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,840
Mom.

412
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,120
You piss me off.

413
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,440
Ma'am,

414
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
the food is served,

415
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,960
let's eat and talk.

416
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Talk over dinner.

417
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,320
Let's eat first.

418
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,720
Mr. Han, to be honest with you.

419
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,160
I came here

420
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,320
to take my son back.

421
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,920
Ma'am,

422
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,270
I certainly understand what you're asking.

423
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,410
This is not the first time I've faced this kind of thing,

424
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
and it won't be the last time.

425
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,400
Can I tell you something first?

426
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,360
OK.

427
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,480
I was a CTF competitor,

428
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,440
and I had been in the industry for ten years.

429
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,200
I've seen the development of this industry,

430
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,480
it bloomed out of nothing.

431
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,370
You were a game player when you were young?

432
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,960
Exactly, a competitive CTF player.

433
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,400
What competition?

434
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,360
I don't know.

435
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,000
And we were state-certified CTF players.

436
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,320
It's our profession.

437
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,480
Shall I continue?

438
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,560
OK.

439
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,000
I used to be a professional CTF player,

440
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,210
so I understand your concerns.

441
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,340
I am in charge of

442
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,760
the Chinese branch of our club.

443
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,820
I selected every player and sign contract with them,

444
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,080
including Dai Feng.

445
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,440
I think he's qualified

446
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,680
and has great potential.

447
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,250
I want him not only to turn pro,

448
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,210
but also to see him standing on the top of the podium,

449
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,760
draped in the national flag

450
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
with the national anthem playing.

451
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,520
Mr. Han,

452
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,250
the leader of your team has told me this this afternoon.

453
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,120
But it's my job to think about his future.

454
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,480
There's only one world champion.

455
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,360
Besides,

456
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,200
he's my son and I know him.

457
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,040
He isn't talented.

458
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,800
You're wrong. He is.

459
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,480
But he ranks around 70th.

460
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,320
That's his ranking in the whole world.

461
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,000
Although he is the youngest,

462
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,280
he has great potential.

463
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,960
We're a team.

464
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,000
The ranking of individuals is important,

465
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,360
but the overall quality of the team is more important.

466
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,800
These kids,

467
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,720
I appreciate them.

468
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,680
I think the five of them

469
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,360
have the ability to win the championship.

470
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,000
But...

471
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,200
Well, ma'am,

472
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,360
let's stop talking about dreams.

473
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,080
let's talk about something practical.

474
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,160
Let's do the math from your point of view.

475
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,880
Dai Feng graduated from a vocational school,

476
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
and even if he gets a job now,

477
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,960
he will hit a pay ceiling at work.

478
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,760
Well, let's say he started working now,

479
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,560
works for 30 years until he is 50.

480
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,760
How much do you think he can make in total?

481
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,360
You ask me to answer it right way,

482
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,960
I can't do that.

483
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,540
I can sign a contract with you right now.

484
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,440
Before he is 30,

485
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,880
if his income, including standard wage,

486
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,720
competition bonus,

487
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,120
and personal endorsement income,

488
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,720
if it doesn't reach the contract figure,

489
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,470
I'll personally pay him the rest.

490
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,160
Boss, I won't sign it.

491
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,120
Even the captain didn't get that treatment.

492
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,480
Now you know you're different,

493
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,640
so work hard.

494
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,640
Ma'am, after signing the contract,

495
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,200
I can't take it back,

496
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
and I won't.

497
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,160
When I get back to our club,

498
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
I'll ask the leader to draw up the contract right away.

499
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,160
Sign it and you can take it home.

500
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,840
Sounds good?

501
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,720
Well, Mr. Han,

502
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,420
will your club make a lot of money from these kids?

503
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,480
The branch in China has been losing money

504
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
since its establishment two years ago.

505
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,440
Then why are you doing this?

506
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,360
My son is not the best here.

507
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,640
What's in it for you to keep him here?

508
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,320
I won't benefit at all.

509
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,800
But for him,

510
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,040
it's very beneficial.

511
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,650
A good friend once asked me,

512
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,160
do you have a dream?

513
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,960
I said, yes.

514
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,600
I want to win the championship.

515
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,700
I want to get the world title for China.

516
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,880
Money would be nice

517
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,320
because you can live a good life with money.

518
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,360
But people are great because they have dreams.

519
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,280
These young men have their dreams.

520
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
And the most important thing is

521
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,360
they are working hard to make their dreams come true.

522
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,470
So, my dream has not changed.

523
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,120
I want to help them

524
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,040
claim the world title for China.

525
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,040
And I'm sure

526
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,400
that you can do it.

527
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,600
Boss, you're so handsome.

528
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,600
Boss, how'd it go?

529
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,060
Did you work it out with Demo's mother?

530
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,880
Have you ever seen him in a suit before?

531
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,680
I don't think I have.

532
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,040
He's handsome in a suit.

533
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,100
Do you think we should buy a suit?

534
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,160
Boss!   -Boss!

535
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,000
What's up, boss?

536
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,760
Boss, are you all right?

537
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,040
Are you okay, boss?

538
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,440
I'm okay.

539
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,720
Do you need a doctor?

540
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,160
I'm fine.

541
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,200
You guys go to practice.

542
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,160
Don't worry about me.

543
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,480
You're not feeling well, we can't leave you alone.

544
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,000
Instead of staying with me,

545
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,870
you'd better take the time to practice.

546
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,920
Stop talking, okay?

547
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,910
Your health is more important than training.

548
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,960
Leave.

549
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,840
Well,

550
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,920
call us if you need help, boss.

551
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,280
We'll be downstairs.

552
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,200
Got it.

553
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,360
Come in.

554
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,120
Boss, why are you up so early?

555
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,200
You're not feeling well

556
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,440
and you should get more sleep.

557
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,440
I got you this.

558
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,640
Put some of this on your temples,

559
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,440
it will provide some relief.

560
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Will you try it?

561
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,080
No need, I'm fine.

562
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,520
I'm not that weak.

563
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,000
Well, I'll put it here.

564
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,760
When you need to,

565
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
you can use it.

566
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,520
Boss,

567
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,160
thank you.

568
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,800
I didn't know

569
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,840
you weren't feeling well when you met my mom.

570
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,640
If that's all, go to practice.

571
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,800
Stop standing here and talking.

572
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,160
Remember to use it.

573
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,130
Dai Feng's mother has signed the contract,

574
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,960
take a look.

575
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,880
No need, leave it here.

576
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm leaving,

577
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,280
but I'm quite worried about you.

578
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,560
No need to worry.

579
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,280
K&K China has been running for a long time,

580
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,560
and it won't collapse.

581
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,370
The quarterfinal's the day after tomorrow in Beijing.

582
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,920
The flight is at three tomorrow afternoon.

583
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,640
Don't forget.

584
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,960
OK.

585
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,410
= Lan Mei's husband =

586
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,200
Hello.

587
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,880
This is Han Shangyan.

588
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,280
Do you remember me?

589
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,520
Of course.

590
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,680
Gun.

591
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,320
Of course, I remember you.

592
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,160
My hero.

593
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Well, what's up?

594
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,680
Look, honey,

595
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,190
when we get in, be nice, okay?

596
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm begging you.

597
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,040
Why?

598
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
He's here to catch up with me.

599
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,360
Without Tong Nian,

600
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,720
you'd never have met him in real life.

601
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,400
Catch up?

602
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,400
What kind of friendship do you two have?

603
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:28,880
Wait, wait!

604
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,600
Honey, honey.

605
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,000
Please, please.

606
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,570
Please be sure not to embarrass me later, okay?

607
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,880
He didn't even invite you,

608
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,760
but you insisted on coming with me.

609
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,480
I don't know how to explain it when I meet him.

610
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,160
Listen to me,

611
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,800
he must feel bored

612
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,960
after breaking up with Tong Nian,

613
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,070
and want to see how miserable she is, you know?

614
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,720
How long have they known each other?

615
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,600
About three months.

616
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,240
How many times have they broken up?

617
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,060
Twice!

618
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,230
He pisses me off.

619
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,560
Don't be angry.

620
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,280
Don't be angry.

621
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,320
Calm down, calm down.

622
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,000
Well, all right.

623
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,760
Let's take this meeting as a chance

624
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,640
to spy on him, okay?

625
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,040
Don't be angry, let's go.

626
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,000
Come on, we're late.

627
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,760
Go, go, go.

628
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,400
It pisses me off.

629
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,640
Honey, don't be angry.

630
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,280
Gun, I'm sorry,

631
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,320
we're late.

632
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,200
I'm so sorry.

633
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,040
It's okay.

634
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,520
I'm free today anyway.

635
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
Would you like something to drink?

636
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,760
Honey,

637
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,080
what would you like to drink?

638
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,040
Get me something bitter.

639
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,640
Waitress!

640
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,160
An espresso

641
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,240
and a cappuccino.

642
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,400
How dare you drink the sweet while I drink the bitter?

643
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,800
Actually, two cups of espresso.

644
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,000
Well, Gun,

645
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,400
I thought you said

646
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,720
you needed my help.

647
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,440
Between Tong Nian and I,

648
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,200
you should already know what happened.

649
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
I'm asking you to take care of her

650
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,760
and keep her company.

651
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,960
We'll keep her company,

652
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,680
because we're her friends.

653
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,240
You don't need to tell us that.

654
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,200
If you feel sorry for her,

655
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,840
make it up to her yourself.

656
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,800
Give this to Tong Nian for me, please.

657
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,640
What is it?

658
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
So little.

659
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,800
It's 2,000 yuan, not much.

660
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,120
Don't tell her.

661
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
You take her to eat

662
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,840
whatever she wants.

663
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,880
You buy her

664
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,960
whatever she wants.

665
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,440
I'm just trying to make her happy.

666
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,360
Breakup tax?

667
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,360
This isn't enough.

668
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,280
As the boss of a club,

669
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,800
aren't you ashamed to give such a pittance?

670
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,400
This is all the savings in my account.

671
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll give you more when I have it.

672
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,000
It's a very nice gesture,

673
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,440
it's good to have dinner together, right?

674
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,520
I'll give it to her for you.

675
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,440
What are you doing?

676
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,000
Tong Nian can afford a meal herself.

677
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,400
Your two families are close,

678
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,400
so you should know

679
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,680
her family is wealthy,

680
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,520
and she makes a good wage herself.

681
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,080
The lab pays her

682
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,640
a lot more than this.

683
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,240
I know she isn't short of money,

684
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,800
but I insist on giving her this.

685
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,910
This is how you get rid of your girlfriends?

686
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,680
2,000 yuan a person?

687
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,600
Besides her,

688
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,520
I haven't had any girlfriends.

689
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,560
No girlfriends?

690
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,160
Ask him.

691
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,920
Well, look,

692
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,360
I have a question.

693
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,970
You mean she's your only girlfriend,

694
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,880
why did you break up with her?

695
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,240
I have to say,

696
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,960
stop breaking up, okay?

697
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,480
It hurts both of your feelings.

698
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,650
Or is there a reason that you can't tell her?

699
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Or is it

700
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,840
you regret it and want to make up with her?

701
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

702
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Not at all.

703
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,000
Hello, here's your coffee.

704
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,000
Okay, thank you.  -Thank you.

705
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,920
What's he thinking?

706
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,840
I'm confused.

707
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,520
Well,

708
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,560
does he want Tong Nian to hear this from you?

709
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,360
Oh, are you sure you heard it right?

710
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,920
Did Tong Nian dump him?

711
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,430
I think I heard it right.

712
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,760
No, I have to ask her.

713
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,430
No, wait.

714
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,560
-What?  -Sit down.

715
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,000
But you promised him to keep it a secret.

716
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,560
I didn't sign a confidentiality agreement.

717
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,200
I don't care.

718
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,430
I'm gonna tell her.

719
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,040
Tell me the truth,

720
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,840
did you break up with him this time?

721
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,280
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

722
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,830
Not okay.

723
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,240
Tell me, come on.

724
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Yes or no?

725
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,390
I said I didn't want to talk about it.

726
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,960
Let me show you something.

727
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
What is it?

728
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,680
Han Shangyan gave it to you.

729
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,390
He gave me what?

730
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,280
Breakup tax?

731
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,430
But it's only 2,000 yuan, pretty small.

732
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,000
Who knew he's really poor or pretending to be poor?

733
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,480
How could you take his money?

734
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,520
Why wouldn't I?

735
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,760
I needed to show it to you,

736
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,350
it's evidence.

737
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,570
Did he do something wrong or cheat on you?

738
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,800
No, he didn't.

739
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,800
I'm going to return the money.

740
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,000
No, no.

741
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,040
I promised him I wouldn't tell you.

742
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,430
Come on.

743
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,720
You took the money.

744
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,160
You think he's stupid?

745
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,480
He must have known you'd tell me.

746
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,200
Hey!

747
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,760
How could I have known that?

748
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,040
I'm not as smart as you.

749
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,520
Hi 97,

750
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,110
I'm on my way to your club.

751
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,600
Is your boss there?

752
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,560
Didn't he tell you?

753
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,080
We're going to Beijing for a competition,

754
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,720
we're checking in at the airport.

755
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,520
He didn't tell me.

756
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,580
So which airport are you at now?

757
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Thank you, thank you.

758
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,120
Here is Tong Nian.

759
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,800
Tong Nian.

760
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,320
Tong Nian.

761
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,800
Have a seat.

762
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,400
What are you doing standing there?

763
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,520
Have a seat, Tong Nian.

764
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,440
Here, come here.

765
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,120
Come on.

766
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,760
Boss, she's here for you.

767
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,440
You called her here?

768
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,000
No.

769
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,880
She was looking for you,

770
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,840
so I told her we were at the airport.

771
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,040
Can we talk in private, please?

772
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,480
Boss, we'll get out of here.

773
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,160
No need.

774
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,880
We'll go.

775
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,240
Something strange is going on here.

776
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,800
What's the deal?

777
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,440
Go ahead.

778
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,080
Why did you give Lan Mei money

779
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,400
and told her it's a breakup tax?

780
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,600
If that's what you want to believe.

781
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,040
Didn't you say before

782
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,120
we just spent some time getting to know each other?

783
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,880
I'm a good man,

784
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,000
I did what I had to do.

785
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,880
Why didn't you just give it to me?

786
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,520
Why did you ask Lan Mei to keep it from me?

787
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,760
I think she misunderstood.

788
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,100
I asked her to help me give it to you.

789
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,120
Since it's breakup tax,

790
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,560
I have no reason to ask her to keep it from you.

791
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,080
I think it's weird, too.

792
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,120
I think

793
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,700
she said that to make you happy.

794
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,680
Or

795
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,290
she misunderstood me from the very beginning.

796
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,320
What else did she tell you?

797
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,880
Nothing.

798
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,600
I've explained it to you,

799
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
you should go back now.

800
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,040
I have something to tell you.

801
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,280
Han Shangyan,

802
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,660
we've been together only for a short time,

803
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,000
but I was happy during that time.

804
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,120
You're my first boyfriend.

805
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,080
You said we were not right for each other,

806
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
and I don't think

807
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,560
you have a positive attitude towards our relationship.

808
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,840
But in other respects,

809
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,280
I think you're a good man.

810
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,640
I'd like to continue to support you,

811
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,640
support you and K&K

812
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,800
until the day you win the championship.

813
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,520
And

814
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,680
I don't want this,

815
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,480
I'm giving it back.

816
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,560
Let's go.

817
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,080
It's so early.

818
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,400
We have nothing to do in there.

819
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,240
Just let us sit here a little longer.

820
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
Go or leave for good!

821
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Substitutes will replace you.

822
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,360
Go, go, go.

823
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,640
Goodbye, Tong Nian.

824
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,480
Bye, Tong Nian.

825
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,040
Be careful on your way back

826
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,160
and don't take an unregistered cab.

827
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,280
97.

828
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,880
Call a cab for her.

829
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,640
Okay.

830
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,150
Tong Nian, well,

831
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,160
boss asked me to call a cab for you.

832
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,440
Let's go.

833
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,800
It's okay, don't worry about me.

834
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,320
You should go with them.

835
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,360
Come on.

836
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,120
I'm okay.

837
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,000
Come on, come on.

838
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,040
Tong Nian, I've booked the car,

839
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,800
it's gonna be here soon.

840
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,920
Here's the license plate number.

841
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,920
Can you remember it?

842
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
I'll text it to you.

843
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,720
No need, 97.

844
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,720
I'll just take a cab by myself.

845
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,680
Don't worry about me.

846
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,800
Don't say that,

847
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,360
we're friends, Tong Nian.

848
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,560
We often rent cars from this car-rental company,

849
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,160
really.

850
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,840
Go back inside,

851
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,560
or you'll miss your flight.

852
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,720
I'll wait here for a cab.

853
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,840
All right.

854
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,840

865
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,200
Shangyan, why are you hiding in here?

866
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,280
You aren't watching their preparations?

867
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,960
Aren't you worried about them losing?

868
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,440
It's just a quarterfinal,

869

why should I worry?

870
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,920
You're too big for your britches.

871
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,320
Shanyan, I want to talk to you about something.

872
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,280
What?

873
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,040
I want to invite you

874
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,240
and your girlfriend

875
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
to shoot a video for me,

876
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,400
or make a live show

877
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,560
for publicity.

878
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,760
No.

879
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,520
You can refuse,

880
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,360
don't stare at me, okay?

881
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,400
Don't go asking her.

882
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Why?

883
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,160
Well, you're her boyfriend,

884
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,920
but you can't control her.

885
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,040
First,

886
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,680
it does great harm to her study.

887
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,960
Second,

888
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,480
I'm not her boyfriend.

889
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,800
Really?

890
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,960
If you don't love her, I'll chase her.

891
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,880
Who did you say

892
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,640
you would chase?

893
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Just kidding, just kidding.

894
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,320
