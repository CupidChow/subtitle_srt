I'm alright.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,040
I see now that you

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,200
worked very hard for your dream

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
more than anyone else.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,720
You've had many challenges

00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,120
along the way.

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,760

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,440
But I'm your grandpa.

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,320
How could I not know that?

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,240
You know recently

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,519
I've been visiting websites

39
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,080
and online forums

about you.

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,960
I know now that you have many people

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,760
that admire you and support you.

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,200
You've helped them

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,680
realize their dreams.

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240

and very proud of you.

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,210
Being a hero is not an easy task.

Don't push yourself so hard.

51

Grunt,

72
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,800
don't talk back to your boss.

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,400
Understand?

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
97, keep an eye on him for me.

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Don't worry, Su Cheng.

76
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,120
Take care of yourself.

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,360
That's my boy.

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,080
And you, little Demo.

79
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm not little.

80
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,880
Remember to show me your grades, okay?

81
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,240
I'll pay close attention to you from headquarters.

82
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,920
You should always be alert.

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
Coach,

84
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,040
will you come back and visit us?

85
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,560
I suppose it's you who should come and see me.

86
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,090
I really hope that every one of you

87
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,320
can go abroad and compete on behalf of K&K.

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,040
Come to headquarters.

89
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
That would make the boss

90
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,000
very proud of all of you.

91
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
Drop by for a visit when you come.

92
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
Don't worry, Coach.

93
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,560
We will definitely

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,360
go abroad for competition.

95
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,520
And maybe,

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,360
win some titles.

97
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,400
One,

98
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,660
always my star player right?

99
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,120
And you two,

100
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,120
be good now okay?

101
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,840
Take care.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,560
Su Cheng.

103
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,040
Everybody,

104
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,440
thank you for all your help over this last year.

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,680
Thank you so much.

106
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,840
Take care.

107
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,200
Back to training.

108
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,760
Su Cheng. Su Cheng.

109
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,560
Take care, Su Cheng.

110
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,500
Take care.

111
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,550
We won these together.

112
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,400
You remember?

113
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,130
I remember I hung this up by my own hands.

114
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
May I have it as a souvenir?

115
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,360
Yes.

116
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,040
When's your flight?

117
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,640
I'll ask the receptionist to call a taxi for you.

118
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,160
No need. My flight is in the afternoon.

119
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,040
I'm meeting a friend.

120
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,120
Solo?

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
I think I don't need to see him.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,520
Coming.

123
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,160
They're not here.

124
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,560
I just want a glass of water.

125
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,960
Here, come in.

126
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,240
Make yourself comfortable.

127
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,450
Here.

128
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,980
This old thing?

129
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
I'm leaving.

130
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,310
So I'm taking it as a souvenir.

131
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
Here have this one.

132
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,720
Thank you.

133
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,920
Something urgent?

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
Solo or Han Shangyan?

135
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't worry.

136
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,720
It's not about them.

137
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,480
We're not best friends,

138
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
we hardly speak.

139
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,080
So it will be a little awkward.

140
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
Last time we saw each other

141
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,120
was when your team was about to break up.

142
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,040
You came to me because of Solo.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,930
You wanted me to persuade him not to dismiss Solo.

144
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,640
I remember.

145
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,150
But I was a mess back then,

146
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,200
how could I persuade him?

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,680
Okay.

148
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,640
Let's not talk about the past.

149
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,170
I have something to tell you.

150
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,520
My flight is at 4 p.m.,

151
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,800
so I can't stay here for very long.

152
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,480
Han Shangyan and I had a big dispute

153
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,410
over whether to include you in K&K.

154
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,880
He even wanted to establish a second team for you

155
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,590
regardless of K&K's current situation.

156
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,900
I know this.

157
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,360
But, that's probably not the reason

158
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,570
come here today.

159
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,080
I have retired.

160
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,500
There's no way I can come back.

161
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,040
They're my bros.

162
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,840
Not my patrons or my superiors.

163
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,240
So don't worry,

164
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,820
I would never cause trouble for my bros, ever.

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,530
It's about you.

166
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,950
But I'm not asking you to resume your profession.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,350
I'm going to go back to headquarters.

168
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,320
Now K&K needs a coach.

169
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,490
Are you interested in it?

170
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,560
You want me to be the coach of K&K?

171
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,480
But I just retired from SP.

172
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,720
That doesn't matter.

173
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,880
Do you think that you are betraying SP?

174
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
You've retired.

175
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,880
Wait just a minute,

176
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,210
you are confusing me.

177
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,400
This all feels very weird to me,

178
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
I can't make sense of it.

179
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,560
K&K was founded by Han Shangyan and my husband.

180
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,460
K&K in China was the result of a joint effort

181
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,720
between me and Han Shangyan.

182
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,680
To me, K&K is like my own child.

183
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,840
I want to find a suitable person

184
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,640
to take my place

185
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,230
and work with Han Shangyan.

186
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,000
Of course, he's the boss.

187
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,370
I'm only responsible for selecting members.

188
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,480
I know.

189
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,040
This is Han Shangyan's idea, right?

190
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,760
Of course not.

191
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,040
The two of us aren't close.

192
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,880
In my eyes,

193
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
you, Mi Shaofei,

194
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,670
are not an old friend,

195
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
you are the best choice.

196
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
But I don't think I'm capable

197
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,180
to take on this position.

198
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,879
When you won the national championship years ago,

199
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,880
I had already retired.

200
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,990
My best score was the champion of Chengdu.

201
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,220
I am nothing

202
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,220
when compared to your ability.

203
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,680
You have the skills.

204
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,240
Moreover, I'm trying to find a coach,

205
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,480
not a contender.

206
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,920
Many people don't know

207
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,540
what is CTF really is.

208
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,120
But you know.

209
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,790
You understand the pressure they are facing,

210
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
and the difficulties

211
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,480
they have to overcome in the competitions.

212
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,840
You've given your best years to CTF.

213
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,410
Don't you want future participants to be even greater?

214
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,360
You have a point.

215
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,510
You know how to deal with

216
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,820
Han Shangyang's bad temperament.

217
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,580
That is most important.

218
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,440
Sometimes even I

219
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
want to smack him with the blackboard eraser.

220
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,740
Actually he's quite a simple person.

221
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,070
You just need to pacify him for a while,

222
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,680
then everything will be okay.

223
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,640
Is it that easy?

224
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,800
It is that easy.

225
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,020
Way back then we were the ones that calmed him

226
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,040
and helped him change into a well-rounded man.

227
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,720
The easiest thing in the world is working

228
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
with a person who cares about others.

229
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,160
Aren't you the same too?

230
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,260
You are a lot of fun in normal life.

231
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,030
I wish I had known you sooner.

232
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,760
I have to go.

233
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,250
I hope you can give us a chance,

234
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,640
and come join us.

235
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,760
Good luck.

236
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,440
Still hesitating?

237
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,020
I just need some time to think.

238
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,640
We're all grown up now.

239
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,840
We're not grown-ups.

240
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,800
People with dreams

241
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
are always young.

242
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,600
Many people don't know

243
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,910
what is CTF really is.

244
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,520
But you know.

245
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,190
You understand the pressure they are facing,

246
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and the difficulties

247
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,879
they have to overcome in the competitions.

248
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,080
You've given your best years to CTF.

249
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,700
Don't you want future participants to be even greater?

250
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,320
Dad.

251
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,540
Oh so you recognize my voice?

252
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,370
Now you listen up,

253
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,440
don't you think you can stay Shanghai forever

254
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,150
just because your mother said yes.

255
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,920
You get your butt back here!

256
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,580
I've asked mom to give me half a year.

257
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Half a year?

258
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,270
I don't care, come back now!

259
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,850
Go to the street office for your internship.

260
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,840
It took me quite a lot of effort

261
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,760
to get you a position there.

262
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,160
You can stay there first.

263
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,560
And prepare for the exam,

264
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,600
when you're passed,

265
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,920
you can be a full-time employee.

266
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,240
Enough, give me the phone.

267
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,440
Here.

268
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,320
Shaofei,

269
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,890
do you still have money?

270
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,130
The rent in Shanghai is expensive, right?

271
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,040
Don't blame your father.

272
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,960
Your mom is sick again a few days ago,

273
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,530
she couldn't stand up straight,

274
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
couldn't tend to the store.

275
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,850
Your father has had to take care of everything,

276
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,000
and even found you a job,

277
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,180
it wasn't easy.

278
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,800
Your father is yelling at you,

279
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,600
but you are in his heart

280
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,810
no matter where you are.

281
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,040
You're his only son,

282
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,840
he's worried about you.

283
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,160
I know.

284
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,910
It was not easy for you to go there,

285
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
if you need to stay, then stay.

286
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,320
Do what you need to do.

287
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,560
If you come back now,

288
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,580
it will be difficult to go back again.

289
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,570
Every place you go when you're young

290
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,680
leaves an impression.

291
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,670
Look at your father.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,050
He still wants to

293
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,800
go to the countryside where he once lived.

294
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,920
Granny, I'm kind of busy here.

295
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,920
When I finish my work,

296
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,080
I'll go back and take care of you, alright?

297
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,600
Take care of me?

298
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,830
I'm even healthier than you are.

299
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,280
I know, I know.

300
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,960
I miss you.

301
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,440
I miss you, too.

302
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,200
I really want to be a champion.

303
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440
I really want to be a champion.

304
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,600
Who knows you? Do you know me?

305
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Don't hang up!

306
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,480
Come back and explain it to me!

307
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,920
Han Shangyan, you can't leave!

308
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,120
I begging you!

309
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,120
Team Solo can't live without you.

310
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,520
Please!

311
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,600
If you leave,

312
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,200
then we're over.

313
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,640
Look at you. You're a big boy now.

314
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,200
Be responsible for yourself.

315
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,760
I know, Granny.

316
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,740
I'll come back with a gold medal.

317
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,980
Good, I'll wait for you.

318
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,200
Today,

319
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,320
will be the last time

320
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,800
that I play professionally.

321
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,160
Over the last 10 years,

322
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,840
I've had ups and downs.

323
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,380
But I always thought if I worked harder,

324
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,920
I'd get the end result I wanted.

325
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,720
But it didn't work out that way.

326
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,720
I can't keep up with all these young guys

327
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,790
and that's it.

328
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,200
I really tried!

329
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,580
Let me end things on a high note, alright?

330
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
I regret it.

331
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,000
I regret it so much!

332
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,960
But it's too late!

333
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,800
If I had kept playing

334
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,920
without retiring,

335
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,770
my scores would've been like this!

336
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,300
But what can I do now?

337
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,920
Look at me now.

338
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,160
Enough.

339
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,160
Han Shangyan, why would you...

00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,190

97.

346
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,600
Boss.

347
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,320
Talk to me about

348
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,400
your rivals in the semifinal.

349
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,730
You mean Buff?

350
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,450
Yes.

351
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,330
I know you all feel uneasy

352
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,630
after Su Cheng left.

353
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,200
Buff is a competitive and experienced team.

354
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,280
You feel pressured?

355
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
Of course.

356
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,120
Buff was your old enemy, boss.

357
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,800
So, are you scared?

358
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,400
No, not really.

359
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,370
I beat them all those years ago.

360
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,839
And today,

361
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,120
you will too.

362
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,920
Good luck.

363
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,360
No problem, boss.

364
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,230
Hey...

365
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,800
The four teams

366
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,350
are all very competitive.

367
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,650
K&K and SP need no introduction.

368
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,120
No, they don't.

369
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,040
The other two.

370
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,120
The other two teams

371
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,710
are Buff

372
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,130
and CL.

373
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,380
The former is the rival of K&K in the semifinal.

374
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,270
The latter is that of SP's.

375
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,080
So, talk about Buff first then.

376
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,480
Where should I begin?

377
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,840
There's a popular saying,

378
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,640
"Solo is the pioneer,

379
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,080
but Buff is the dominator."

380
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,840
Why?

381
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,800
It is because Solo was the team

382
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,610
that unveiled the new era of CTF.

383
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,140
Before Solo's breaking up,

384
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,800
Buff was their strongest enemy.

385
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,600
Both teams had victories and defeats.

386
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,770
The competition which Han Shangyan retired from

387
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,200
the winner was team Solo.

388
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,680
But the silver medal winner was Buff.

389
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,960
Moreover, Buff once

390
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,500
defeated Han Shangyan.

391
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,240
Are you serious?

392
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,820
That was a sensational competition

393
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,760
in the history of the CTF circle.

394
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,950
Solo was absolutely unstoppable.

395
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,380
They had defeated many of the top domestic teams,

396
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,470
Solo and Buff faced off for the championship.

397
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,680
In the beginning,

398
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,400
Buff looked down on Solo.

399
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,600
When Solo made it to the final,

400
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,340
everyone was watching the final

401
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,420
and thought Buff was about to lose.

402
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,330
Gun would beat them for sure.

403
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,510
But to everyone's surprise,

404
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,700
Gun was not on his game that day,

405
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,280
and lost the most important match.

406
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,020
Everybody was stunned.

407
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,950
People said Gun was not that amazing.

408
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,240
We won! We won!

409
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,120
Finally!

410
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,320
Buff! Buff! Buff!

411
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,170
Congratulations to the champion.

412
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,000
Thank you.

413
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
To our surprise,

414
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,570
we actually defeated Gun this time!

415
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,680
Unbelievable!

416
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,880
This is so amazing!

417
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,680
What are your plans and goals for the future?

418
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,120
We're the champions this time.

419
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,080
And for the next ten years,

420
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,260
we will be champions!

421
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:44,980
Isn't that right?

422
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,760
Yes!

423
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,640
Champion, champion!

424
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,600
But Han Shangyan is still the strongest.

425
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,880
Their score is eight to two now.

426
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,800
Eight to two?

427
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
Only after Han Shangyan retired

428
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,640
and Solo's split up,

429
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,640
did Buff have the chance to dominate the game.

430
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,360
Have they ever been world champions?

431
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,240
No.

432
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,950
Chinese teams on the world stage

433
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,390
aren't even top three.

434
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,590
But Buff,

435
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,060
his personal ranking

436
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,440
was once in the top three.

437
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,600
He's that amazing?

438
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,250
If Han Shangyan didn't retire,

439
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,440
Solo would be in the top three.

440
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,960
Of course.

441
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,520
But this time, K&K

442
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,160
is under a lot of pressure.

443
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,860
There are only two vacancies for the Asia final.

444
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,540
If they are defeated by Buff,

445
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,870
they're out.

446
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,540
And if they really lose to Buff

447
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,520
Han Shangyan will be crushed.

448
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,600
It won't happen.

449
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,960
Han Shangyan won't lose.

450
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,690
How are you so confident?

451
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,440
Of course.

452
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,640
Who is Han Shangyan?

453
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,200
-He is the No.1 of CTF.  -No.1

454
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,440
No.1.

455
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,560
My idol.

456
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,640
But I'm still a little worried.

457
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,420
Don't worry.

458
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,470
We'll be cheering for K&K!

459
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,880
Go K&K!

460
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,920
Let's continue.

461
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,720
Shangyan, do you want me to order you some food?

462
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,360
No thanks, I'll go out to eat later.

463
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,960
Don't forget to have dinner.

464
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,460
Okay.

465
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,240
Mrs. Zhou,

466
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,380
this is the menu for next month.

467
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,000
Please check it.

468
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,720
Now that Su Cheng is gone,

469
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,360
you have to worry about this too?

470
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,560
Yes.

471
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,150
And also,

472
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,470
their sheet and quilts

473
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,860
and other bedding should be changed.

474
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,680
Okay.

475
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,990
When she was still here, I didn't realize

476
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,480
how these things felt like

477
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,820
what a kindergarten principal should do.

478
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,840
These dishes are all settled?

479
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,350
They are your recommendations.

480
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,000
No need to change them.

481
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,800
What?

482
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,400
Shangyan, someone for you at the reception.

483
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,450
Shangyan.

484
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,190
Who wants to see me?

485
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,720
Your friend.

486
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,600
Well fancy seeing you here.

487
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,670
Tell me, what do you want to do?

488
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,920
Nothing.

489
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,550
I heard from Mrs. Zhou that you haven't had dinner,

490
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
let's grab something to eat.

491
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,400
I forget my wallet,

492
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,160
I'll go get it.

493
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,040
It's on me.

494
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,440
Go.

495
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,039
Do you know why

496
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,559
I loved to invite everyone to eat pot chicken before?

497
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,680
It's because you like to eat it.

498
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,600
What other reason is there?

499
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,120
In the past,

500
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,900
people in Hongze Lake in Xuzhou

501
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,230
would gather around

502
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,310
in front of the stove at dinner time.

503
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,300
I love the feeling of reunion.

504
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,640
The first chicken leg

505
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,000
will be going to our winner today,

506
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,280
Ai Qing!

507
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,460
Thank you, captain!

508
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,720
The second chicken leg,

509
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,440
goes to our new team member

510
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,680
Han Shangyan.

511
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,890
This is your reward.

512
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,780
Welcome.

513
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,180
We will stick together through thick and thin.

514
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,079
-And eat chicken legs together.  -Yes!

515
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,520
Here we go. Time to feast.

516
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,470
Come and try my skills.

517
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,420
I learned this from my mom.

518
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,280
Come on.

519
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,480
Come on.

520
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,610
Today is the second time

521
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,280
we celebrated the Spring Festival together.

522
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,220
Let's have a whole new start in Shanghai.

523
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,760
Happy New Year!

524
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,600
Happy New Year!

525
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,640
Cheers.

526
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,920
Here we go.

527
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
I always remember the time

528
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,240
when we had meals together.

529
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,580
You're so nostalgic.

530
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,920
Some things I just don't want to change.

531
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,780
Tell me, what do you want?

532
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,760
I'm here for a job position.

533
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,720
A job position?

534
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,960
What position?

535
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,600
Don't tell me you want to resume your profession.

536
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,950
Are you unhappy?

537
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,800
I know you won't do that.

538
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,100
So there's no reason to be happy.

539
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,480
Ah crap, you know me well.

540
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,760
Cut the small talk,

541
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,610
tell me straight.

542
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,640
I heard that your coach has left,

543
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,080
I wanna fill that position.

544
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,880
You've asked me for three times before,

545
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,060
now I come to you on my own.

546
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,840
I know this field.

547
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,480
I was once a top player at a top club,

548
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,260
I competed many times.

549
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,770
I know this game very well.

550
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,110
Yes I retired for many years

551
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,470
and kept myself away from the world of CTF,

552
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,960
but I think I know this game better

553
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,880
Su Cheng who's now gone.

554
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,010
The point is, your teammates

555
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,220
were all my rivals in the past.

556
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,519
I've done thorough research

557
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,000
about their styles and personalities.

558
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,920
And Han Shangyan,

559
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,160
I know you well.

560
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,400
Su Cheng told me this is very important.

561
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,910
Su Cheng visited you?

562
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,020
I didn't think that you would like this.

563
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,640
I thought you'll be much happier

564
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,800
in competition instead.

565
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,060
Why didn't I think of this?

566
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,240
Excuse me,

567
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,010
ten more fried pancakes please.

568
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,519
Come.  -Okay, ten more fried pancakes.

569
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,920
To our future!

570
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,320
Nobody here?

571
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,680
They just finished the quarterfinal,

572
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,080
I gave them a half day-off.

573
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,120
Different from last time?

574
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,710
I feel like I've betrayed SP.

575
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,070
Cut it out.

576
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,480
Here

577
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,460
is the training room for formal team members.

578
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,350
That is the break room.

579
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,440
The rooms with numbers

580
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,310
are their dorms.

581
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,620
It's a little small.

582
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,200
Of course, it can't compare with the wealth of SP.

583
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,600
Chill out man.

584
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,880
Only you can create a place like this

585
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,970
in only a few years.

586
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,960
There's a studio?

587
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,880
I hope they can have

588
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,780
the feeling of a competition when training here.

589
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,040
What about the small one?

590
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,680
The reflection room.

591
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,920
Any team member

592
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
who has done something wrong

593
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,960
reflects on their actions in there.

594
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,760
You're the same as before.

595
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,760
I was in this competition.

596
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,600
You must spend years finishing this, right?

597
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Don't remember.

598
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,520
But I spent a lot of time on it.

599
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,260
I used to not care about it,

600
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,080
now I obsess over it,

601
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,690
I can't put it down.

602
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,400
So? Still want to drink more?

603
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,120
Drink more.

604
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,160
Bring it on, man.

605
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,840
Here.

606
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,200
Is drinking this much ok with you?

607
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,440
I'm retired now.

608
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,640
Being drunk occasionally is okay.

609
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,080
Here.

610
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,680
Not so fast, we just ate.

611
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,440
Who cares?

612
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,760
Pace yourself, we have the whole night to drink.

613
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,440
Han Shangyan,

614
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,350
you're really getting old.

615
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,240
You even have wrinkles around your eyes.

616
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,390
You're not far behind.

617
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Here.

618
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,920
To the end of our youth.

619
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,600
Xiaomi,

620
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
drink more.

621
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,000
I raise my cup to the moon,

622
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,800
the moon and my shadow are my friends.

623
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,600
No.

624
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,880
Wait it's just us.

625
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,240
Let's enjoy the full happiness of life,

626
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,400
and fill the cup in my hands.

627
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,000
Han Shangyan.

628
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,880
Han Shangyan.

629
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,880
I've been looking for you,

630
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,600
I thought something happened to you,

631
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,500
I was worried about you.

632
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,240
What's the matter?

633
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,980
Is it because of that thing with Buff?

634
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,079
Actually, I watched

635
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,250
some of the footage of your competitions.

636
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,770
And the online forums.

637
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
If I were you,

638
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,760
I would be upset, too.

639
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,800
Buff hadn't beat you,

640
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,000
hardly any of the times before.

641
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,200
If you hadn't retired,

642
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
he couldn't have been the national champion.

643
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,560
You must be remembering the past.

644
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,840
What's the matter?

645
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Are you okay?

646
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,100
Are you crying?

647
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,530
Don't cry, don't cry.

648
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,370
Wu Bai is an outstanding player,

649
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,050
he can help you to win the competition.

650
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,200
Don't be upset.

651
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,520
How long are you going to play this act?

652
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,560
I can't pretend anymore.

653
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,840
I hate you!

654
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,720
You two are just...

655
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,960
Why didn't you two tell me anything?

656
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,799
Why did you just fool me with that

657
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,920
this whole time?

658
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,480
He was not going to tell you,

659
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
he wanted to laugh at you.

660
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,520
Mi Shaofei,

661
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,000
you are such a jerk!

662
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,880
Sorry. I'm sorry.

663
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,590
I'm just curious.

664
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,680
Han Shangyan, good for you.

665
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,560
Hurry up and take a shower,

666
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,440
you smell like beer.

667
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,520
I won't take a shower here.

668
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,790
I'll go back.

669
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,230
Six o'clock this afternoon, be here.

670
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,600
You two go on, Squid.

671
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,600
What's the matter?

672
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,840
Nothing.

673
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,480
Are you angry?

674
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,280
Don't be angry with me.

675
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,400
Don't touch me.

676
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,040
Don't be mad at me.

677
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
I hate you.

678
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,850
You two drink all of that beer?

679
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,980
Help me to clean it up.

680
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
I don't want to bother Mrs. Zhou with it.

681
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,710
You asking for my help?

682
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,600
You two drank the beer,

683
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,720
I'm not helping.

684
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,920
Look at you.

685
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,200
You're so lazy.

686
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Hurry up and tidy the room.

687
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,760
Alright, alright,

688
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,040
I have nothing better to do.

689
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,120
I guess I'll help you.

690
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,960
Because I'm such a nice person.

691
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,880
How much beer did you drink?

692
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,360
Was Mi Shaofei in a bad mood?

693
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,040
No.

694
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,760
Why did you drink beer together?

695
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,880
Little girl,

696
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,040
you shouldn't ask so many questions.

697
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,350
Come on tell me.

698
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,190
You'll know soon enough.

699
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,170
Tell me now, so I don't have to wait.

700
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,030
You're that curious?

701
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,980
Oh come on, tell me.

702
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,000
Where are you going?

703
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,280
To sweep the floor.

704
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,200
Let me help you.

705
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,720
No.

706
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,790
Who told you about Buff?

707
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,760
Yaya?

708
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,360
Did she tell you about

709
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,120
our miserable past and all the details?

710
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,360
No, no.

711
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,440
It was just a little bit depressing.

712
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,040
Move your foot.

713
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:51,840
The other foot.

714
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,360
Now it's dirty again.

715
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,190
Then...

716
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,390
Then I'll have to hang on this pole.

717
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,480
You can mop now.

718
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,040
Alright, come here.

719
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:03,960
Come here.

720
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,640
What?

721
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,440
Have a seat.

722
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,520
Don't move.

723
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Why are you staring at me?

724
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,800
I think you're handsome.

725
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,280
Boys who can do chores are all handsome.

726
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,520
Let me help you.

727
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,590
Hey, hey!

728
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,200
I just mopped the floor,

729
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,480
and now you got it dirty again.

730
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,670
Alright, alright.

731
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,440
No.

732
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,760
I don't see any footprints.

733
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,530
Go downstairs.

734
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,450
You can have whatever you want downstairs,

735
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,600
I just need you to stay away for a bit.

736
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,900
And the floor is wet right now,

737
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,080
what if you fall down?

738
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,510
But what if you need my help?

739
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,800
I don't need your help.

740
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,190
Come on, give it to me.

741
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,190
That's mine.

742
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,320
Halt!  -I bought that.

743
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Tong Nian!

744
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,360
Are you two on a date right now?

745
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
Please continue,

746
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,190
we won't bother you.

747
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,000
We should go first.

748
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,840
Looks like you guys are free.

749
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,520
Demo, come here.

750
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,040
Keep her company.

751
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,840
How come I have to?

752
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,240
Shouldn't you be doing that?  -Right.

753
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,280
Yeah I have some free time,

754
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,330
but I can't do this.

755
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:15,960
Yes.

756
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,560
Right, Tong Nian?

757
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,890
Well, seeing as you are free,

758
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,760
then after lunch,

759
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,610
you can help me clean the clubhouse.

760
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,120
97, you're free, right?

761
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,080
I'm very busy, boss.

762
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,760
You see...

763
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,560
Clean the keyboards in training room area.

764
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,320
Oh man!

765
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,680
One.

766
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,160
You're tall,

767
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,020
you can polish all the glass in the clubhouse.

768
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,680
Boss!

769
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,800
Don't, boss!

770
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,200
Tong Nian!

771
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,720
Looks like Demo wasn't very lucky.

772
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,000
Is that funny?

773
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,080
Run along downstairs.

774
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,920
Make sure to fill all of it out.

775
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,860
If you have any questions, let me know.

776
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,160
You're back.

777
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,520
Is everything okay?

778
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,480
Yes.

779
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,960
What are you doing?

780
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,320
Is today Labor Day?

781
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Ask him!

782
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,480
What?

783
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,000
How is this my fault?

784
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,400
You can't blame me.

785
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,080
Shut up.

786
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,480
Alright, get him!

787
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,960
Wait a minute!

788
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,960
Lift him up!

789
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,000
Grab him!

790
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,840
Don't touch me!

791
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:19,800
Dude!

792
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,080
Help me!  -Come on!

793
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,840
Three, two, one!

794
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,240
Catch him!

795
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,040
Don't touch me!

796
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,960
Alright, alright.

797
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,720
Let him go.

798
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,200
Let him go.

799
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,370
Boss said meeting at 6 p.m.,

800
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
hurry and get this done.

801
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,160
What meeting?

802
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,600
He didn't say anything about a meeting.

803
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,360
It's just a meeting.

804
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,680
Just now I saw Mi Shaofei.

805
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,280
That's normal.

806
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,400
He's been here before.

807
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,320
Look,

808
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,540
he was filling out an application.

809
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,040
What?

810
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,600
Our boss decided to recruit him?

811
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,080
Obviously.

812
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,520
He must be crazy!

813
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,079
He's so reckless when it's come to things

814
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,639
involving his former teammates.

815
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,680
You shouldn't say that!

816
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,360
What else can I say?

817
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,480
He ranks beyond top 100.

818
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,500
Now he wants to be our team member?

819
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,200
Are we trash now?

820
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,680
Wait, are you serious?

821
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,600
Did you really see Mi Shaofei?

822
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,880
Why would I lie to you?

823
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,960
Where's he now?

824
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,800
At the reception?  -Yeah!

825
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,280
Everybody, to the front.

826
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,160
Come on.

827
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,800
Let me introduce our new member.

828
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,770
New member?

829
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,159
I believe

830
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,170
you're all familiar to him, right?

831
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,200
Your old rival.

832
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,520
Xiaomi.

833
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,040
Isn't he retired?

834
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,520
Yes, he is.

835
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,310
Today, me and managers from the HQ

836
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,570
all agreed to

837
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,250
hire Mi Shaofei

838
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,870
to be our new coach.

839
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,680
Coach?

840
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,000
Coach?

841
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,519
Grunt,

842
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,119
as the vice captain,

843
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
introduce everyone to Shaofei

844
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,160
since Wu Bai is not here.

845
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,790
Why me?

846
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,020
Let's wait for the captain.

847
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,500
Yeah.

848
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,240
Why wait for him?

849
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,430
You should get familiar with each other first.

850
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,570
I'll go arrange our dinner.

851
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,880
No need, boss.

852
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,840
We just ate our dinner.

853
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,120
It's okay.

854
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,890
I've also just had dinner.

855
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,560
Okay.

856
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,170
You should have a chat first.

857
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,160
Okay, everybody, hurry up with the cleaning.

858
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,120
Then we should start our training.

859
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,800
Let's get to it.

860
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,840
It's okay, don't mind me.

861
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,040
I'll handle it.

862
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,200
Go on.

863
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,720
Wu Bai.

864
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:03,910
Wu Bai.

865
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,640
What?

866
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,280
Do me a favor.

867
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,450
I want Mi Shaofei to be our coach.

868
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,650
But the guys don't like it.

869
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,360
Help me change their minds.

870
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,140
I feel like they don't want to talk to Mi Shaofei.

871
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,360
You think it's an easy job being the coach?

872
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,880
These kids come from across the country

873
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:01,679
with different backgrounds,

874
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,570
everyone has their own personalities.

875
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,800
It's difficult to discipline them.

876
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,880
Since you're worried about him,

877
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,470
why don't you go down to help him?

878
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,770
They already think I'm being unfair,

879
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,679
it's easy for me to ask them

880
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:16,280
to hold a welcome party.

881
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,760
But the more I ask,

882
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,440
the more rebellious they will be.

883
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,400
Mi Shaofei must rely on himself

884
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,240
to conquer these boys.

885
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,590
If he can't finish his task,

886
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,160
I can't help him either.

887
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,680
Listen,

888
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,180
team DT and I will have a meeting.

889
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,720
The rest of you stay here and continue training.

890
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,940
Okay.  -Got it.

891
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,450
Coming.

892
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,000
Boys, we have a meeting.

893
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,079
Hurry up.

894
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,680
You guys deaf or something?

895
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
We have a meeting!

896
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,510
Captain's orders.

897
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,600
Time for a meeting.

898
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,160
Go, go, go.

899
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,880
What if he can't handle them?

900
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,190
Ai Qing can conquer those guys in SP.

901
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,920
I believe Xiaomi can conquer these boys, too.

902
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,880
