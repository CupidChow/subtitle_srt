Alright.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,720
That covers everything I wanted to talk about today.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
Thank you everyone.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,920
Thank you.

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,880
This is my old classmate.

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
His name is Zheng Hui.

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,430
He works in medical business.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,320
At the moment,

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
he is working with

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,070
dozens of radiology departments across the country.

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,640
In December 2017,

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
he was invited to attend

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,120
The Annual European Congress of Radiology.

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Please give him a proper welcome.

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Everybody do your best

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
and I'll see you in the future!

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,920
What about criminal investigation?

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,080
Who's in charge of that?

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
I'll answer that question for you.

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,360
SunYaya and myself are both

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,120
in charge of that.

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,000
You're both so pretty.

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,240
I want to work with you.

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,560
Actually Sun Yaya and I

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,800
mainly focus on portrait bayonet.

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,560
It's the facial

52
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,400
recognition program.

53
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,130
Everybody's seen the old Hollywood movies right?

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,420
When there was a huge crowd of people and faces,

55
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,920
there was a program that could

56
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,600
pick out the people you're searching for.

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,360
Excuse me.

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
Isn't this old technology?,

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,840
Like in "Mission: Impossible".

60
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,560
That's right.

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
Just like in "Mission: Impossible".

62
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,040
But at that time, that technology

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,600
was only in theory,

64
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
and was not at all in day to day use.

65
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,120
But now this technology

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,840
has become a reality.

67
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,160
Particularly in China,

68
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
it's very well developed.

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,920
How good is it?

70
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,500
These stands for the American National Institute

71
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,660
of Standards and Technology.

72
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,380
In 2017,

73
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,380
these two organizations

74
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,300
held a facial recognition competition.

75
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,220
In the contest,

76
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,300
China won the first place in the world.

77
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,460
I also want to say a few words

78
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,100
that are not related to AI technology.

79
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,780
In recent years,

80
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:18,020
there's something that really impressed me.

81
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,620
I often went abroad for competitions.

82
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,480
One time I went to the UK.

83
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,740
At the time I was envious of their life.

84
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,540
Why?

85
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,140
Because with a credit card,

86
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,700
they could do so many things.

87
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,900
I thought

88
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,660
when can we live like that?

89
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,060
But I never thought that,

90
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,660
in only a few years,

91
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,060
that in China,

92
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,850
with only a smart phone,

93
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,980
you could do all of those things.

94
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,700
We can use it

95
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,140
to go out and eat, order coffee,

96
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,740
and even go to the hospital

97
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,540
by just scanning the QR code on your phone.

98
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,740
We can do it all.

99
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,060
The one popularized this kind of life

100
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,860
was China.

101
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,380
This makes me very proud.

102
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,780
Are you guys proud too?

103
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,380
Yes.

104
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,280
The future is in your hands.

105
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,020
We are all counting on you!

106
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,860
Good luck.

107
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,140
Come on!

108
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,100
Come on!

109
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,460
Tong Nian.

110
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,780
Tong Nian.

111
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,540
Hurry up!

112
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,260
Tong Nian.

113
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,140
Slow down would you?

114
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,900
Come on, hurry.

115
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,459
Come on.

116
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,060
Tong Nian.  -Slow down.

117
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,580
I gotta get my bike.

118
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,500
Slow down, I'm tired.

119
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,380
Hurry up.

120
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,860
Slow down.

121
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,420
-What's up with you?  -Tong Nian.

122
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,060
Why the rush?

123
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,860
Are you busy?

124
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,860
I almost lost you back there.

125
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,380
I'm in a hurry to get my bike.

126
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,020
What's the matter?

127
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,980
Well.

128
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,170
I, I have a new project to discuss with you.

129
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,340
Right now?

130
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,020
No, no, no.

131
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,380
After the holiday.

132
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,180
Or, when you have time.

133
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,140
Then let's meet next semester,

134
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,420
or you can call me later.

135
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,860
OK.

136
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,340
What time works best for you?

137
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,220
Or, which is easier for you?

138
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,780
Just use WeChat to keep in contact.

139
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,580
Yes, WeChat.

140
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,740
I'll send you a WeChat later.

141
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,300
WeChat.

142
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,140
And you have my email.

143
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,340
You can just send me an email.

144
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,340
OK.

145
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,420
Go on.

146
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,220
Tong, Tong Nian.

147
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,180
What's it?

148
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,580
Is there something else?

149
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,940
No, no, not really.

150
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,300
Then I'm going to get my bike.

151
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,940
Hey. Wait for me.

152
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,100
Let's go get some milk tea.

153
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,180
Tong Nian.

154
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
What now?

155
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,660
I, I just wanted to say, to say...

156
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,500
Say what?

157
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,820
I wanted to say

158
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,700
Happy New Year.

159
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,820
Uh... Happy New Year to you too.

160
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,300
Going home for the holidays?

161
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,860
I won't go home for the holidays.

162
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,900
I'm trying to save some money.

163
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,680
You know for the project next year.

164
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,820
And will you go...

165
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
What a coincidence.

166
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,260
So you are not going home.

167
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,170
Yaya is not going home either.

168
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,400
You guys can celebrate the Spring Festival together.

169
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,620
See you.

170
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,340
I...

171
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,040
Why can't you just ask her already?

172
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
Ask her what?

173
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,540
Tong Nian only thinks about studying.

174
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,700
Studying.

175
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,460
If you don't ask her up front,

176
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,500
she won't understand.

177
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
We can take it slow.

178
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
Slow and steady.

179
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,940
You, you...

180
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,610
Hey.

181
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,980
Yaya,

182
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,700
can I ask you something?

183
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,300
Lately I've been feeling

184
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,740
a heavy weight on my shoulders.

185
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,740
And I feel terrible.

186
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,420
Tell me,

187
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
is that heartbreaking?

188
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,860
What's the matter?

189
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,100
I'll get you a napkin.

190
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,820
Are you okay?

191
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,340
Who broke your heart?

192
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,020
You were single before the winter break.

193
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,180
We aren't even halfway through vacation.

194
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,180
How's that possible?

195
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,740
It's only been a few days.

196
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,300
And you've been dumped already?

197
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,740
I wasn't dumped.

198
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,460
I'd hardly call it a relationship.

199
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,420
It's more like a...

200
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,460
a secret crush I've kept to myself.

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,760
Well, is, is that guy out of his mind?

202
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,860
No.

203
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,460
He said he wanted to

204
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,700
chase his dream first.

205
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,180
He doesn't want a girlfriend right now.

206
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,980
And you believed that crap?

207
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,140
Even movies aren't that dramatic.

208
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,180
He's full of it.

209
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,100
-I trust him.  -You...

210
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,460
He's not that kind of guy.

211
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,660
He wouldn't lie to me.

212
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,980
Oh my God.

213
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,540
Now I'm sure

214
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,460
that he's an experienced playboy.

215
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,700
What else did he say?

216
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,460
Tell me everything,

217
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,740
let me figure it out for you.

218
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,660
Heartbroken?

219
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,540
Don't wanna talk about it?

220
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,860
Alright, alright, alright.

221
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,700
Let's go home.

222
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,540
Let's shoot off some fireworks

223
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,140
and scare away all the negative vibes.

224
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,740
We can't shoot fireworks in city limits.

225
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,660
Here it is.

226
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,100
Excuse me. Sorry to intrude.

227
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,060
I was just wondering

228
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,460
is this place called

229
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,860
the K&K Club?

230
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,260
Are you a fan?

231
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,340
Kind of yeah.

232
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,780
Am I not allowed to stand here and watch?

233
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,180
No no no. Suit yourself.

234
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,700
Are they all on holiday?

235
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,620
You could say that.

236
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,620
Until tomorrow.

237
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,060
Many people already left.

238
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,610
Then could I leave my bike here

239
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,730
for just a moment?

240
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,700
Sure. I'll keep an eye on it for you.

241
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,780
Go ahead.

242
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,780
Thank you.

243
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,300
Go ahead.

244
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,180
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

245
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,580
I'm sorry.

246
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,860
I'm sorry.

247
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,420
Do you want to go inside?

248
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,740
No no. No need.

249
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,140
You can meet your idols.

250
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,260
I'm friends with them.

251
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:50,940
I'll show you inside.

252
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,220
Really, there's no need.

253
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,220
They often

254
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,660
receive their fans here.

255
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,820
It's okay. I can show you inside.

256
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,860
I don't want to be any trouble.

257
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,820
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

258
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,540
You're leaving?

259
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,900
Grandpa.

260
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,180
Do you really need to stay for six months?

261
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,380
Won't your friends in Norway

262
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,660
start to miss you?

263
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,180
Furthermore if you come,

264
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,420
Wu Bai and I have to stay at the K & K,

265
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,460
you'll be all alone.

266
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,900
What are you writing?

267
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,380
All dreams come true.

268
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,460
All dreams come true.

269
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,420
You're daydreaming!

270
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,900
Dreams do come true sometimes.

271
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,540
What is that?

272
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,700
Everything goes well?

273
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,060
No. Leave me alone.

274
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,100
Come on, show me.

275
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,980
I'll write a very creative one.

276
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,980
That's amazing.

277
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,260
You idiot.

278
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,420
What's going on here?

279
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,380
Nothing.

280
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,540
-Nothing.  -Nothing.

281
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,540
I permitted everyone

282
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,100
to write the Sprig Festival Couplets here.

283
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,820
The holiday is almost here anyway.

284
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,260
No need to be so harsh.

285
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,500
We're giving them red packets right?

286
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,660
Yes I am going to.

287
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,440
Not sure why they're so nervous.

288
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,050
Wow!

289
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,970
Hey boss, when did you become so generous?

290
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,540
The boss rules, we love you boss!

291
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,700
Happy New Year.

292
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,500
Thank you boss.

293
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,500
Can you rank among the top twenty?

294
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,500
Yeah yeah yeah, sure.

295
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,980
Although a love affair

296
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,340
is not allowed to go public here,

297
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,540
you should find a girlfriend anyway.

298
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,100
Or your mom won't stop nagging me.

299
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,810
Boss, you should introduce me to somebody.

300
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,180
I don't mind arranged marriages.

301
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,620
I'm already giving you accommodations.

302
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,860
And now you ask for a girlfriend?

303
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,580
Thank you boss.

304
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,420
Boss.

305
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Happy New Year.

306
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,820
Stop being such a pushover.

307
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,020
Don't worry, I will.

308
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,740
Happy New Year.

309
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:08,980
Pass them around.

310
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,660
One for everyone.

311
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,380
Yes, boss.

312
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,500
So nice of you.

313
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,180
I didn't get you one.

314
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,820
Good one.

315
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,860
But I already knew that.

316
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,340
I'll get the car.

317
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,420
I'll be back soon.

318
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,100
If you must, then you better do it right.

319
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,340
You should all be ashamed.

320
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,860
How could you have such bad handwriting?

321
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,060
You're right, boss.

322
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,800
We get it.

323
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,980
Thank you boss.

324
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,100
Thank you boss.

325
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,860
-Bye boss.  -Thank you boss.

326
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,320
= Every dog has its day =

327
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,420
Too high.

328
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,140
Little bit lower.

329
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,100
-Too high?  -Yes.

330
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,850
What about here?

331
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,540
Here, in the middle.

332
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,580
-Here?  -Right, perfect.

333
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,380
It's nice there.

334
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,300
How could you hang that

335
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,740
on the boss's door?

336
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,980
What do you mean?

337
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,730
We saved the best for our boss.

338
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,540
Right.

339
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,460
He just found a girlfriend.

340
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,660
During the Spring Festival,

341
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,460
they have the chance

342
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,540
to carry out the wedding,

343
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,740
and have a new baby by next year.

344
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,460
Do you know what's this?

345
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,060
The more children, the more blessings.

346
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,820
Right.

347
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,150
Come on, just let us have fun with it, okay?

348
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,580
We'll take it down after we get a photo.

349
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,140
Yeah, yeah. Come on, 1, 2, 3.

350
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,830
Don't you want to

351
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,980
go home for the holiday?

352
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,660
Yeah, yeah, we do.

353
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,180
Traffic will get really bad.

354
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,300
If you miss your train,

355
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,780
I'm not saving your butts from that.

356
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,140
Well boss,

357
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,020
can we leave now?

358
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,750
Go on.

359
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,580
Okay.

360
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,140
Bye, boss.

361
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,140
Happy New Year, boss.

362
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,820
And you too.

363
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,540
Hurry it up.

364
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,180
Stop taking your sweet time.

365
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,780
Go home for the holiday.

366
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,940
Don't come back until the sixth,

367
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,500
you hear me?

368
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,900
Yes, boss.

369
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,040
= Every dog has its day =

370
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,460
Mrs. Zhou,

371
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,220
leave it.

372
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,420
Go pack your stuff

373
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,420
and hurry home.

374
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
I'm almost done, won't be long.

375
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,820
Mrs. Zhou, this is for you.

376
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,780
Thank you, Shangyan.

377
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
I appreciate your kindness.

378
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,310
My son Zhou Yi and I

379
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,380
can share one red packet.

380
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,860
What's more,

381
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,100
I should give you a red packet.

382
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,420
I'm much older than you after all.

383
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,180
Mrs. Zhou, listen to me.

384
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,380
Yes you and Zhou Yi are a family.

385
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,980
But you two do different jobs.

386
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,860
You each deserve a red packet.

387
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:42,900
Take it.

388
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,420
-Take it.  -No, no, thanks.

389
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,180
Take it. Come on.

390
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,740
Here, here.

391
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,340
Just take it.

392
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,020
Accept it for my sake.

393
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,460
You are so generous to us.

394
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,900
Thank you. Thank you so much.

395
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,339
Let me.

396
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,380
I'll take care of the rest.

397
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,300
Let me finish it.

398
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,780
If you don't let me do it,

399
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,180
I won't feel right.

400
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,180
The boys of K&K

401
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,060
are lucky to have you.

402
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,660
They're lucky to have you.

403
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,100
See you, Mrs. Zhou.

404
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,260
-Bye bye. Bye.  -Bye.

405
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,620
Boss, boss.

406
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,300
Happy New Year. Best wishes.

407
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,180
Wish you good health and good luck.

408
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,940
I heard you. Now go.

409
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,140
See you next year, boss.

410
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,980
Grunt, come on.

411
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,500
We'll miss the train.

412
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,180
Stop rushing me.

413
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,100
Boss, Happy New Year.

414
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,700
See you after the holiday.

415
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,700
Shut it.

416
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,740
Boss, if you meet someone,

417
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,660
don't let her go.

418
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,180
When we get back,

419
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,060
we'll help evaluate her for you.

420
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,580
Evaluate her?

421
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,180
He's too old to be picky.

422
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,900
If you don't leave right now,

423
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,140
you'll lose your vacation time.

424
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,740
No no no, we're leaving.

425
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,620
Wait.

426
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,740
Boss, we're sorry.

427
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,060
I apologize on his behalf.

428
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,260
Just spare us this time.

429
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,770
I haven't been home for a year, boss.

430
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,460
Who is not going home this year?

431
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,460
Just Demo.

432
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,500
Why?

433
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,860
I heard his parents divorced,

434
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,220
so he has no place to go.

435
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,340
So he'll go back

436
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,300
in May for a visit.

437
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,300
Right?

438
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,180
Just about.

439
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,340
Boss, we are leaving.

440
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,140
The driver is waiting.

441
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:12,859
Stop pulling me.

442
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,740
Boss, best wishes.

443
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,100
See you after the holiday.

444
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,140
Don't pull me.

445
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,180
You're stretching my sweater.

446
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,820
Bo, boss.

447
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,820
Forget the rules?

448
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,980
No, I didn't.

449
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,260
Tell them to me.

450
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,460
The computers in the training room

451
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,700
are not for watching movies.

452
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,500
Good memory.

453
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,540
I thought that since it's a holiday,

454
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,620
that you already went home.

455
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,480
So if I leave that means

456
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,300
you can watch movies in here?

457
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,420
I'm sorry.

458
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,140
I'll start training right away.

459
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,420
Get up.

460
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,220
Boss.

461
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,660
It's the Spring Festival.

462
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,340
Can you just let it go this one time?

463
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,660
Go pack your stuff.

464
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
Pack what?

465
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,940
Pack some clothes.

466
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,500
I don't have any that fit you.

467
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,140
You are coming home with me.

468
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,820
You can't stay here

469
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,620
and waste my resources.

470
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,980
Go home with you

471
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,100
for the holiday?

472
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,820
Hurry and pack your things.

473
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,180
Oh.

474
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,500
Captain.

475
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,540
Demo.

476
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:56,979
Yeah.

477
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,980
Put your luggage in the trunk.

478
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,060
OK.

479
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,660
He's going home with us?

480
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,460
If he stays here by himself,

481
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,260
we'll waste water and electricity.

482
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,900
It's better to have him come home with us.

483
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,820
Furthermore, Grandpa is back.

484
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,100
You don't talk much,

485
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,100
and I get yelled at.

486
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,550
Better to have a new face to amuse him.

487
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,780
We could use him.

488
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,420
Boss, I always thought

489
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,700
you didn't have a house here,

490
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,980
only the clubhouse.

491
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
The house is a distraction.

492
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,170
Distraction?

493
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,020
He is lying to his family about getting married.

494
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,170
Otherwise they wouldn't have let him

495
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,620
to come back to Shanghai for K&K .

496
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,620
Oh, now it makes sense.

497
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,860
Boss, you are brilliant.

498
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,020
Boss,

499
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,500
thank you for taking me with you.

500
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,500
You can't live

501
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,860
at my place for free.

502
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,220
Spending the new year here

503
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,940
is going to be awesome!

504
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,140
You have this?

505
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,380
I loved playing this game.

506
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,740
My room is on the 3rd floor.

507
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,620
There are two rooms on the second floor.

508
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,420
That one is for Wu Bai.

509
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,740
You can take the empty one.

510
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:50,750
OK.

511
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,420
Grandpa is living on the ground floor.

512
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,610
Oh.

513
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,700
Can you cook?

514
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,820
A little bit.

515
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,740
I often helped my mom in the kitchen.

516
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,290
Then don't be idle during the holiday.

517
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,860
Take care of cooking and cleaning.

518
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,780
No problem.

519
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,580
You good with old people?

520
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,740
What do you mean?

521
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,220
Talk more than Wu Bai.

522
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,820
And be cuter than me.

523
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,860
That's so easy!

524
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,620
Good, get settled in.

525
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,660
I'm going up.

526
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,620
Boss,

527
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,780
is the refrigerator stocked?

528
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,980
Enough for two days.

529
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,780
Good.

530
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,580
You two can relax a bit.

531
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,620
I'll have dinner ready by 6 pm.

532
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,780
Let's go.

533
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,860
This is how you are.

534
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,180
You never say anything nice.

535
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
What do you mean?

536
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,380
You can cook,

537
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,860
but why ask Demo to cook?

538
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,760
I can't let him stay here

539
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,260
all for free.

540
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,470
Then why not charge him rent?

541
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I think

542
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,620
you want to help him

543
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,900
be more independent, right?

544
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,140
Since when did you become so talkative?

545
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,220
Boss, Captain.

546
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,020
Come here. Come here.

547
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,980
Check it out. Not bad right?

548
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,780
You are good.

549
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,140
Sit down.

550
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,740
Come on.

551
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,700
One chicken leg for every person.

552
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,580
Captain, try this.

553
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,620
Boss.

554
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,740
Boss.

555
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,980
Captain,

556
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,700
what did I do ?

557
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,460
Nothing. Eat.

558
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,140
Did I cook something

559
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,660
that he hates a lot?

560
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,780
He can't not eat anything.

561
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,700
I'll take some food

562
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,860
to his bedroom for him.

563
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,940
If you wanna get yelled at, then go ahead.

564
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,280
Is it because he doesn't like these dishes?

565
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,180
I can go make him something else.

566
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,100
You eat first. I'll be quick.

567
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,300
Magnificent motherland.

568
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,300
Sisi, do you notice that

569
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,060
in recent years,

570
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,660
the sky above us

571
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,700
is becoming bluer.

572
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,820
The river water

573
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
is becoming more cleaner.

574
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,860
The mountains

575
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,820
are becoming greener.

576
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,500
And the air we breathe in

577
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,100
is becoming fresher.

578
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,140
It means our pace of

579
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,780
the construction of a beautiful China...

584
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,860
Han Shangyan, here, over here.

585
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,020
Wang Hao.

586
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,980
Welcome to Beijing.

587
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,340
You must be tired.

588
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,020
You rode the train all night.

589
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,100
The sun is about to rise soon.

590
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,540
Did you wait long?

591
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,700
For you, I'd wait forever.

592
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,740
Let me introduce you.

593
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,180
Hello, I'm Ai Qing,

594
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,500
the future main attacker.

595
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,820
Main attacker?

596
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,300
She? Main attacker?

597
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,700
You... This is our first meeting.

598
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,380
What's up with that?

599
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,860
No wonder Wang Hao told me

600
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,580
that you had a bad temper and a long face.

601
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,700
Hey, I didn't say that.

602
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,540
Yes you did.

603
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,700
He only has a long face.

604
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,340
But he is kind-hearted.

605
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,180
Wang Hao.

606
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,700
You couldn't find any men

607
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,420
so you brought a kid

608
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,620
to make up the number?

609
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,550
You can test her talent later by yourself.

610
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,460
What's the use?

611
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,860
I don't want to play with her.

612
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,820
Listen carefully,

613
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,140
when you lose you better not cry.

614
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,580
You are just a baby,

615
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,700
don't be so proud.

616
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,270
How can he be such a...

617
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,260
Alright. Alright.

618
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,540
Let's go have breakfast.

619
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,540
When we get home,

620
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,420
it will be daytime.

621
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,580
Come on.

622
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,660
Check it out.

623
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:32,860
Isn't Beijing a big city?

624
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,340
This is our own world.

625
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,940
Hurry.

626
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,740
That's it. We are here.

627
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,580
OK.

628
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,420
Watch your step.

629
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,220
Thank you.

630
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,900
Thank you.

631
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,459
My pleasure.

632
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:51,420
Easy now.

633
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,500
Mind your step.

634
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,300
Han Shangyan,

635
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,860
Luogu Yuan Ally No. 2.

636
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,500
I know it's small,

637
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,200
but I cleaned it up inside.

638
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:01,980
Come on.

639
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,540
Please, allow me.

640
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,220
I can take it.

641
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,860
Let me take it.

642
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,980
Stop arguing over it.

643
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,580
I've cleaned it up real good.

644
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,580
It's small, but multi-functional.

645
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,940
Come here, Shaofei, Ou Qiang.

646
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,540
Ou Qiang, Shaofei,

647
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,620
the new guy is here!

648
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,860
Wait. I'm chasing the chicken.

649
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,420
Have you caught it?

650
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,660
Got it, got it!

651
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,260
I got the fattest one.

652
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,880
Allow me to introduce you guys.

653
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,240
This is the guy

654
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,260
I often told you about

655
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,260
our new member, Han Shangyan.

656
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,540
Introduce yourself.

657
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,460
Gum, I've heard a lot about you.

658
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,860
It's Gun, not gum.

659
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,660
Gun, Gun, Gun.

660
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,140
I'm Ou Qiang.

661
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,140
You can call me All.

662
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,780
I'm the cute guy from a village in Sichuan.

663
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,019
The pride of the whole village.

664
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,580
Have some water.

665
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:50,860
Hand me your luggage.

666
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,100
I'm Mi Shaofei.

667
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,980
My family owns a small grocery.

668
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,980
You can call me Shaofei.

669
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,020
A great pleasure.

670
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,740
Can you cook Double Cooked Pork Slices?

671
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,140
Well, no I can't.

672
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,380
He can't, but I can.

673
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,340
If you wanna eat it,

674
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,460
then I can make it.

675
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,140
But to celebrate your arrival,

676
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,060
I had them catch a chicken.

677
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,620
I'll make Plain Chicken.

678
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,220
The winner gets the legs!

679
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,740
You are versatile.

680
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,580
Absolutely.

681
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,460
A leader should

682
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,700
be capable of everything.

683
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,500
Ai Qing, get me my apron.

684
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,860
Okay, here you are.

685
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,220
Let's compete first.

686
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,340
Let's cook first.

687
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,580
Lame excuses.

688
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,940
Excuses?

689
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,500
He said I'm making an excuse.

690
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,380
You are so arrogant.

691
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,900
Stop fighting you two.

692
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,460
Make a bet.

693
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Bet?

694
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,180
You set it.

695
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,860
If I set it, it won't be fair.

696
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,940
Gun, don't be too confident.

697
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,700
Or you'll get schooled.

698
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,500
If I lose,

699
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,180
I'll do all of the chores.

700
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:53,660
For how long?

701
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:54,380
Forever.

702
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,340
Did you all hear that?

703
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,020
For your welfare,

704
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,860
I'll defeat Gun today.

705
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,900
K.O.

706
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,540
Come on then.

707
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,300
Go.

708
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,540
Ai Qing, beat him.  -Beat him!

709
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:06,920
Go.

710
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,100
Chicken time.

711
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,780
Welcome to our training room.

712
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,220
Here, this is the little turtle.

713
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,100
And then,

714
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,140
a stray cat too.

715
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,620
There.

716
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,260
You can pet him.

717
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,700
Hi there.

718
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,460
Get up and play with me.

719
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,540
You got sharp claws.

720
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,620
Good boy.

721
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,220
I'm ready. What's the rule?

722
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,100
Ten nodes. The one who loses six looses.

723
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,340
OK.

724
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,020
Here we go.

725
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,100
Good luck.

726
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,900
Let me take the kitten.

727
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,020
Let's do it.

728
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,260
Get him, get him!

729
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,620
Kitty's rooting for you!

730
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,660
You gotta win it for him!

731
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,420
Keep steady. Keep it up.

732
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,740
Congratulations to our main attacker.

733
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,620
You got lucky.

734
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,860
Is it really that hard to admit

735
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,820
that I'm good?

736
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,900
Listen,

737
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,500
he won't say it, but he respects you.

738
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,340
Fine.

739
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,060
We'll assume that

740
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,380
you're tired from the trip,

741
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,980
so you're not in top shape.

742
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,140
So from now on,

743
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,500
you handle the chores.

744
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,740
What have you cooked?

745
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,180
Check it by yourself.

746
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,540
Who won?

747
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,820
Me, of course.

748
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,220
Gun, you don't have to admit it,

749
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,900
as long as you do the chores.

750
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,540
Enough. Stop boasting around.

751
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,380
Come on.  -The chicken leg is mine.

752
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,420
Come on. Time for dinner.

753
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,900
Thank you.

754
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
The last dish, Plain Chicken.

755
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,220
Here.

756
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,580
The first chicken-leg

757
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,860
will be going to our winner today,

758
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,060
Ai Qing.

759
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,340
Thank you, Captain.

760
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,620
The second chicken leg

761
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,380
goes to our new team member

762
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,580
Han Shangyan.

763
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,860
This is your reward.

764
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,660
Welcome.

765
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,100
In the future,

766
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,700
as long as we can win,

767
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,060
we'll all have chicken legs,

768
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,180
and everything we could want.

769
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,019
Here,

770
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,120
I propose a toast to our success.

771
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,140
Cheers.

772
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,620
-Cheers.  -Cheers.

773
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,820
Come on, hand me the bowl.

774
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,220
Eat.

775
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,780
In the future, if you do well,

776
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,980
we'll have chicken legs all the time,

777
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,220
enough to make you sick.

778
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,620
Come on.

779
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,020
Here, help yourself.

780
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:22,640
= Half a year later =

781
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,900
Morning.

782
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,820
Wake up, everyone up.

783
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,420
It's almost noon.

784
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,900
Get up.

785
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,700
Get up.

786
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,980
It's almost noon.

787
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,560
Solo.

788
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,140
Hmm?

789
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,900
Is your back hurt?

790
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,740
Yes.

791
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,540
I'll sleep on the couch tonight.

792
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,140
Captain,

793
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,460
you don't have to

794
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,020
make yourself suffer.

795
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,540
Shangyan, you are too tall

796
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,140
to sleep on the couch.

797
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,180
Trust me,

798
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,180
if you sleep on the couch,

799
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,820
you'll feel much worse than me.

800
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
Is it crowded?

801
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,020
No, not really.

802
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,180
But can you really stand

803
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,580
Ou Qiang's loud snoring?

804
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,140
Be patient.

805
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,260
When we get new payment

806
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,740
from the sponsor,

807
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,940
I promise

808
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,380
to get a bigger bed for you.

809
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,820
And Shaofei,

810
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,780
don't shove Han to the edge.

811
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,500
I didn't.

812
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,740
Why would I do that?

813
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,260
Stop complaining.

814
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,740
Earthquake. Earthquake.

815
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,340
If you keep snoring like this,

816
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,990
then you'll never get a girlfriend.

817
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,300
Shangyan, tell me,

818
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,300
do you have a girlfriend?

819
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
Work comes first.

820
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,620
Love comes second.

821
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Han Shangyan,

822
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,180
I'll find you a girlfriend.

823
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,740
Not interested.

824
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,260
I don't care if you are or aren't.

825
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,450
I just don't want you to be the third wheel

826
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,940
every time we go out.

827
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,770
Especially today.

828
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,580
You can enjoy your date.

829
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,450
If I have time,

830
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,660
I'll go check the buildings.

831
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,380
Buildings?

832
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,260
Why would you do that?

833
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,780
To buy a house

834
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,340
and set up a club.

835
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,420
A club?

836
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,700
In the future,

837
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,310
we will set up an immense club

838
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,180
with dozens or even hundreds of members

839
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,700
eating and training together.

840
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,410
Except for participating in CTF,

841
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,340
we'll help the whole country

842
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,460
to understand this industry,

843
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,140
to accept it, and support it.

844
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,260
What do you say?

845
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,300
Stop daydreaming, guys.

846
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,620
Whatever,

847
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,250
I hope your dreams come true soon.

848
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,380
Come on.

849
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,500
Wash up, brush your teeth, time for breakfast.

850
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,980
Go go go.

851
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,620
Shaofei, you took my slippers again.

852
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,580
Your feet stink.

853
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,900
Here, Shaofei.

854
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,700
Where's my kitten?

855
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,100
-Captain.  -Hmm?

856
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,340
Is CTF

857
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,980
really that influential?

858
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,180
Trust me.

859
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,740
We'll make it.

860
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,370
Do you mean that in the future

861
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,300
I'll become

862
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,620
the top Chinese female Geek?

863
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,020
Of course.

864
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,780
Really?

865
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,780
Come on guys.

866
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,260
Could you be gentler?

867
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,700
Look at your tiny claws.

868
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,060
Slow down,careful.

869
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:37,740
If you polluted the water,

870
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,940
how can others use it, Shaofei?

871
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,940
Shaofei!

872
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,740
Disgusting.

873
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,280
Ou Qiang.

874
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,819
Yeah?

875
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,500
I need you to go and buy

876
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
some breakfast for us.

877
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,580
I want to eat Big Sarcosourus.

878
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,540
What?

879
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,660
Big Sarcosourus.  -Get him two Big Sarcosourus.

880
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,100
No problem.

881
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,600
Solo, why did you finish so quickly?

882
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,040
Yeah.

883
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,460
Did you brush it carefully?

884
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,700
My teeth are shining.

885
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,260
Have you taken the money?

886
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:00,980
Got any money on you?

887
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,260
Well, I'll pay with my face.

888
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,220
I'm handsome enough for that.

889
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,140
-Shaofei, take the money.  -Your face is worthless.

890
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,820
Money. Where is the money?

891
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,140
Does he always

892
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260
buy breakfast on credit?

893
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:09,700
Yes.

894
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,140
Solo lost again.

895
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,020
What a pity.

896
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,340
Yes, I think so.

897
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,660
I think there's some problem

898
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,540
with their strategy.

899
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,480
Gun's attack was too aggressive.

900
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,460
His other four members

901
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,580
failed to catch up with him.

902
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,420
Yes.

903
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,030
So their flaw was easily discovered by Buff.

904
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,450
Especially on server No. 2.

905
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,310
Gun made a big mistake in his analysis,

906
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,650
so the best attacker for Buff

907
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,580
gained three nodes by passing him.

908
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,900
No wonder they failed.

909
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,660
Say something.

910
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,339
Let's go.

911
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,060
You are right.

912
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,730
How do you feel about defeating Gun?

913
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,290
Thank you.

914
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,140
Go home.

915
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,020
Hey, Solo.

916
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,770
What the hell was that?

917
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,290
I flew all the way

918
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,900
from Guangzhou to watch you play.

919
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,420
You guys are a disappointment!

920
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,060
Come on.

921
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,380
Team Solo?

922
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,250
More like team losers!

923
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,730
How dare you even compete?

924
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,290
Just give up and go home.

925
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,250
Then why don't you play?

926
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,250
If I knew how to play,

927
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,380
you'd be out for sure.

928
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,350
Please don't talk to my members like that.

929
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,660
I'm responsible for our loss.

930
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:21,980
If you didn't get enough food

931
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,060
or enough sleep,

932
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,540
you wouldn't do well either.

933
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,500
Especially this Han Shangyan.

934
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,660
And you call yourself Gun?

935
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,220
Even I could beat you.

936
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,700
You losers need to leave.

937
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,620
Just go home.

938
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,220
I want my ticket money back.

939
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,420
Yea, me too.

940
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,820
Do it!

941
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
How could they join the CTF?

942
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,140
Go.  -Come on, Shaofei.

943
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,620
Go get the ticket money back.

944
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,220
Do it!  -Stop it, Shaofei.

945
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,100
Shaofei!

946
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,940
Don't argue with them.

947
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,620
It's enough, come on.

948
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,420
Get your money back!

949
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,300
Go win the game if you can.

950
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,580
I told you,

951
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,500
I have no money for you.

952
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,460
Mr. Lin,

953
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,950
look, we already signed the contract.

954
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,620
And Team Solo will surely

955
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,710
win the national championship this year.

956
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,180
Your sponsorship fee

957
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,140
hasn't been paid yet.

958
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,980
Perhaps you have...

959
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,700
Boss, the fruit for the guests is ready.

960
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,700
Secretary Liu, get them out.

961
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,940
Also, I want to take

962
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,380
their dorms back too.

963
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,300
Mr. Lin,

964
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,580
cyber security is a promising industry.

965
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,130
And Solo is the best in China.

966
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,020
This is also a rare chance for you.

967
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,820
Please think this over.

968
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,280
Out.

969
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,040
Come on, just leave.

970
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,020
Mr. Lin is busy.

971
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,250
He has no time to deal with you.

972
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,020
Get ou.

973
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,540
Mr. Lin,

974
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,060
we signed the contract.

975
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,100
If you can't fulfill the contract,

976
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,740
we'll take you to court.

977
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,700
Do you have the money

978
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,620
to actually find a lawyer?

979
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,750
Screw you.

980
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,390
Shangyan. Shangyan.  -What are you doing?

981
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,420
Stop it, calm down.

982
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,260
Shangyan, calm.

983
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,940
Calm down. Calm.

984
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,660
Let's go.

985
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,180
You'll regret this.

986
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,820
I can't stand to see you begging.

987
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,100
It's just some money.

988
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,100
It's not as easy as what you think.

989
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,740
There are so many members in our team.

990
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,680
Everyone needs money to survive.

991
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,220
Think about it.

992
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,700
We have to pay for rent,

993
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,880
water, electricity, gas,

994
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,660
registration fees and transportation.

995
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,980
It's a lot of money.

996
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,020
If I don't beg for help, who will?

997
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,300
I'll figure it out for you.

998
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,580
How will you do that?

999
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,860
Don't push yourself.

1000
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,000
The education fund left to me by my dad

1001
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,000
is free to be used by me.

1002
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,180
Shangyan, I appreciate your help.

1003
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,500
I'll return the money

1004
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,740
when our team wins

1005
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,820
and gets bonuses.

1006
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,260
Let's go to Shanghai.

1007
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,580
There are more talents

1008
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,500
and more teams there.

1009
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,580
We can start over in Shanghai,

1010
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,620
and give it another try.

1011
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,220
Let's welcome our new members,

1012
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,660
Xiaoyou and Yiqian.

1013
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,590
Welcome.  -Welcome.

1014
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,390
Thank you. Thank you.

1015
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,020
Welcome.

1016
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,740
Thank you guys.

1017
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,860
Not bad, Captain.

1018
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,940
You are rich now.

1019
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,700
In Shanghai you have

1020
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,300
such a big house.

1021
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,330
Thank you.

1022
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,580
I can't

1023
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,940
let you guys stay cramped together

1024
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,660
in a small and tiny house.
= Yiqian, Xiaoyou =

1025
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,340
Besides, Ai Qing is a girl,

1026
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,980
I can't let her down.

1027
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,360
Did you not get your food on time today?

1028
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,140
Shangyan,

1029
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,540
I always thought

1030
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,700
you would prefer large dogs,

1031
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,140
like a Tibetan Mastiff.

1032
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,060
Yes, yes.

1033
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,020
I didn't expect

1034
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,900
you'd like a small animal

1035
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,580
that always sticks itself to you

1036
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,300
and is always attached to you,

1037
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,820
and who would gently scratch you

1038
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,140
with its little claws.

1039
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,740
You don't understand.

1040
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,700
It's called contrasted loveliness.

1041
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,500
I never would have expect, Han Shangyan,

1042
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,340
a man like you

1043
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,670
would be so gentle with a kitten.

1044
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,340
Here we go. Time to feast.

1045
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,580
Come and try my skills.

1046
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,180
I learned this from my mom.

1047
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,260
Looks good.

1048
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,140
Come on.

1049
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,380
Come on.

1050
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,780
Today is the second time

1051
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,300
we celebrated the Spring Festival together.

1052
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,180
Right now,

1053
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,260
I want to express my gratitude towards

1054
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,980
Han Shangyan.

1055
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,060
Thanks to his generosity,

1056
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,460
or our team would have been dissolved

1057
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,020
and we would not be here today.

1058
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,740
Thank you, Shangyan.

1059
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,380
Thank you, Shangyan.

1060
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,540
Thank you.

1061
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,580
It's okay.

1062
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,660
He said it's okay.

1063
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,780
Then,

1064
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,940
I wish you all a happy new year.

1065
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,940
Let's have a whole new start in Shanghai.

1066
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,260
Happy New Year.

1067
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,940
Happy New Year.

1068
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,220
Cheers.

1069
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,220
