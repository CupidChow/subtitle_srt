I'm fine.

28
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,910
Boss, please have some food.

29
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,050
You're the heart and soul of K & K.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
You have to eat for us.

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,070
I made this for you.

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,780
I'll just leave it here.

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,490
I don't know

34
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,110
why you suddenly won't eat with us,

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,740
but I made this for you specially.

36
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,240
Hope you like it.

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,400
Let's eat together.

39
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,740
OK.

40
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,570
Have a try.

41
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,400
Is it any good?

42
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,030
Try this,

43
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,900
and these eggs too.

44
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,610
I just bought them this afternoon.

45
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,820
If you don't like it,

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,950
I can make you an omelet.

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,760
I don't know if you like spicy food.

48
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,150
So I didn't put a lot of peppers in there.

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,150
But if you like spicy food,

50
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,280
I'll add more peppers next time.

51
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,110
Also if you don't like the rice,

52
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,320
I can...  -Stop nagging.

53
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,610
Okay, take your time.

54
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,900
Not bad.

55
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,280
I told you I was a good cook.

56
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,650
= Mr. Han, welcome back! =

57
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,150
Hello, Captain,

58
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,150
I can't find your grandpa.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,190
Could you tell me

60
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,610
what he looks like,

61
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,860
or what he's wearing?

62
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,570
I've been looking,

63
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,150
but couldn't find him.

64
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,700
Okay, I'll check.

65
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,200
Keep holding the board up!

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,880
He might not have noticed you.

67
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,860
Haven't found him yet.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
Aren't you waiting for him at the exit?

69
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,990
Whatever happens,

70
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,570
he won't be satisfied with me.

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,930
Rather than waiting to be yelled at in public,

72
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,990
I'm saving my energy in the car.

73
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,900
Why won't you come?

74
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,110
Well,

75
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,990
I thought Demo was good at this.

76
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,700
Where is he?

77
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,190
Mr. Han, it's just over there.

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,030
We're almost there.

79
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,990
Han Shangyan,

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,650
how could you do this to me?

81
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,900
why didn't you meet me at the exit?

82
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,360
Grandpa,

83
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,110
here I am, waiting for you.

84
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,030
It's difficult to find a parking space here.

85
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,490
Could you please just save this for home?

86
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,450
You don't want a scene,

87
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,530
then you should listen to me.

88
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,530
Grandpa.

89
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,200
Wu Bai.

90
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,740
Here, let me take a look.

91
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,570
Why are you so thin?

92
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,650
Has your brother

93
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,650
been starving you?

94
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,530
If that were true,

95
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,610
how would he be so handsome?

96
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,740
Don't blame this on me.

97
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,360
I know you too well,

98
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,360
you're a workaholic,

99
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,360
always working,

100
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,740
that's all you care about.

101
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,320
Mr. Han,

102
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,900
he cares a lot about us.

103
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,200
You see, I'm well-fed.

104
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,030
You good kid.

105
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,860
Let's go.

106
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,990
Come on, Wu Bai.

107
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,900
Let's go. Get in.

108
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,650
Captain,

109
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,700
this is the first time

110
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,070
I've seen the boss

111
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,110
talking like a child.

112
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,070
It's been a long time.

113
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,200
Well,

114
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,900
what's your name again?

115
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,360
Mr. Han, my name's Demo.

116
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Demo,

117
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,360
what kind of name is that?

118
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Well, it's my nickname.

119
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,190
After the competition,

120
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,150
you should look for a job.

121
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,070
You shouldn't

122
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,820
fool around with

123
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,070
Han Shangyan.

124
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,700
No no,

125
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,360
boss doesn't fool around.

126
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,190
Boss?

127
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,800
Yeah.

128
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,570
How can he be your boss?

129
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,360
By the way, it's Spring Festival,

130
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,780
why aren't you at home?

131
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,360
My parents are getting a divorce.

132
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,820
They're selling the house.

133
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,450
So I'd have no place to stay.

134
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,680
Hey, Han Shangyan,

135
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,990
take care of this kid.

136
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,200
He's so young.

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,070
Mr. Han, I'm not a kid.

138
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,610
I just look like one.

139
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,530
Mr. Han, you must be very tired.

140
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,450
Let me give you a massage.

141
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,860
Wu Bai,

142
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,190
would you buy something for me?

143
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,700
And wait for us

144
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,540
at the restaurant for the family reunion.

145
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,320
OK.

146
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,110
Han Shangyan,

147
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,110
you take my luggage to my room,

148
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,240
and come with me.

149
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,610
Got it.

150
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Mr. Han, is that comfortable?

151
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,190
Yeah.

152
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,190
Dounan, Dounan, come down.

153
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,280
Your sister's here.

154
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,110
Do you hear me?

155
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,150
Come down!

156
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,400
Auntie.

157
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:57,820
Look,

158
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,400
this is the gift I got for you.

159
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,030
You see, that's my girl.  -It's good for you.

160
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,360
She brings me a gift me every time she comes.

161
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,450
It's really nice of you.

162
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,070
Sis, you two still playing games?

163
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,900
No.

164
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,070
You don't like him anymore?

165
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,740
You changed your mind?

166
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,570
It's not!

167
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,070
Don't lie in my bed!

168
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,950
I'm just worried.

169
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,150
Tell me everything.

170
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,110
He told me

171
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,990
he doesn't want a relationship now,

172
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,900
he wants to focus on his career.

173
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,950
So he turned me down.

174
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,070
And you believed that crap?

175
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,240
There's only one reason,

176
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,950
he hasn't fallen in love with you.

177
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,700
Come on,

178
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,900
to be honest with you,

179
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,240
he's too old for you, really.

180
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,320
Hu Dounan, have you finished?

181
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,740
Take your laptop.

182
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,030
It's time for our family reunion.

183
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,200
Don't call me that.

184
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,820
Also, I'm not coming to the dinner.

185
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,450
Every time my sister comes back,

186
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,290
everyone starts criticizing me.

187
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,900
All of you study hard,

188
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,240
except for me.

189
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,650
How can you say that?

190
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,490
Every time she comes,

191
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,570
she brings you a gift.

192
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,780
The more expensive the gift is,

193
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,650
the more my mom thinks I'm a disappointment.

194
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,190
Your mom's right about you.

195
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,450
You really are good for nothing.

196
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,400
Right, Auntie,

197
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,520
Tong Nian and Dounan are both upstairs.

198
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,570
What are they doing?

199
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,570
You know Dounan

200
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,150
is teaching Tong Nian to play that game.

201
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,390
They must be playing games together up there.

202
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,400
Mum, you should pay attention to him.

203
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,070
He might get addicted to those games.

204
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,360
Okay, I know.

205
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,740
I'll talk to him when we get home.

206
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,070
When will they be here?

207
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,860
It's about time.

208
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,650
They're already on their way.

209
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,780
I'm telling you,

210
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,190
this time it's the grandson of a family friend.

211
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,900
You'd better behave yourself.

212
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,900
I know.

213
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,860
See, my mum's so nagging.

214
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,280
Of course.

215
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,780
She'll behave. She's a good girl.

216
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,240
Only you buy that.

217
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,150
Yeah, you are the best.

218
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,900
I believe in the potential of CTF.

219
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,030
I know K&K China
= Owner of K&K: Han Shangyan =

220
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,200
is still making a loss.
= Owner of K&K: Han Shangyan =

221
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,700
but that's normal at this stage.

222
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,900
K&K Norway also has lost money for three years

223
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,200
before it started making a profit.

224
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,280
I believe in DT.

225
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,850
You all know him very well.

226
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,440
He has always held the No. 1 position.

227
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,110
As for the other team members,

228
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,740
like Grunt and 97 and others...

229
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,780
What are you watching there?

230
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,400
What am I watching?

231
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,820
What do you mean?

232
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
You're obviously using headphones

233
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,450
to hide whatever it is.

234
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,950
Why would I need to hide it?

235
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,320
Who knows?

236
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,280
Me, what?

237
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,650
I need to go the bathroom.

238
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,860
Move your feet.

239
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,990
So annoying.

240
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,780
Little girl, you're wrong.

241
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,400
You said you liked me?

242
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,240
How do you not know

243
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,240
that I'm single and

244
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,360
not interested in women?

245
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,900
Go away!

246
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,700
Why are you invading my privacy?

247
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,650
The girl he was talking about,

248
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,280
was you, right?

249
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,110
That's none of your business!

250
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,450
You are with that guy!

251
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,200
There's no guy.

252
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,150
Who's that guy?

253
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,040
-Which one?  -Let me see.

254
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,650
It isn't real. It's a character I made up!

255
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,650
I saw a real guy!

256
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,860
But he's a comic character I created.

257
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,200
I don't think so.

258
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,780
Are you in love?

259
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,280
-You are so annoying!  -Are you in love?

260
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,200
-No, I'm not!  -You're in love!

261
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,900
-No, I'm not.  -Yes, you are.

262
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,450
She's in love! She's in love!

263
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
-Okay okay.  -Get out!

264
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:43,920
Okay, I won't say it.

265
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,840
-You're so annoying!  -Sorry, I'm sorry.

266
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,650
It's here?

267
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,450
Yes, it's here,

268
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,150
that's what the GPS says.

269
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,780
Be careful.

270
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,190
Wait!

271
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,030
Why you wearing a black suit?

272
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,850
All the clothes I have are like this.

273
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,360
But you've got a date today.

274
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,150
Why couldn't you wear something nicer?

275
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,950
How could I know it was a date?

276
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,530
I thought,

277
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,740
you were here to meet an old friend.

278
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,570
Let me tell you, tonight,

279
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,150
you have to make an impression on this girl.

280
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,950
You're pretty bossy.

281
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,190
Why don't you just arrange a marriage for me?

282
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,150
Skip the dates.

283
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,490
You...

284
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,240
Take your time. I'm leaving now.

285
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,190
Call me later.

286
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,150
What's wrong?

287
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,530
I'm having a heart attack.

288
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,740
Save it.

289
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,990
Just move. Let's go.

290
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,320
Here he is.

291
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,780
Mr. Han, there you are.

292
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,030
Hi there.

293
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,780
Sorry to bother you.

294
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,780
Not at all.

295
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,920
We are all so happy to meet you, right?

296
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,490
Sure.

297
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,740
Mr. Han, after all these years,

298
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,200
you're still so charming.

299
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,110
Yeah, right.

300
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,530
After all these years, you're still getting taller.

301
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,700
How can I be?

302
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,070
-I'm so old.  -Yeah, you are.

303
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,900
Say hello.

304
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,200
Sir, ma'am.

305
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,860
Mr. Han.

306
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,990
Hi there.

307
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,190
Where's your daughter?

308
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,150
She's making tea for us.

309
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,740
Come on in.

310
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,900
Here, please.

311
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,320
Be careful.

312
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,530
Yuejiao.

313
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,150
Mr. Han, be careful.

314
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,820
Mr. Han, here.

315
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,490
OK.

316
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,740
Hello.

317
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,360
Hi there.

318
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,400
You should call him Mr. Han.

319
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
Hello, Mr. Han.

320
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,400
Hello.

321
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,950
This's your girl?

322
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,570
Yes.

323
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,490
She's my daughter.

324
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,450
Mr. Han.

325
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,360
the air's getting dry,

326
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,190
so I bought some fruit for you.

327
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,570
But I don't know whether you'll like it.

328
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,280
Come in.

329
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,490
Say hello.

330
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,490
Hello, I'm Hu Yuejiao.

331
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,450
Han Shangyan.

332
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,360
Mr. Han, take a seat, please.

333
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:29,950
Okay, okay.

334
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,950
Take a seat.

335
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,400
You've just got back from Norway,

336
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,540
I expect it'll be hard to get used to Chinese tea.

337
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,490
So I got some flower tea for you.

338
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,190
Hope you like it.

339
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,240
Thank you.

340
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,820
You must be tired from the journey.

341
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm fine.

342
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,030
Please enjoy it.

343
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,610
Thank you.

344
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,900
Have a try.

345
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,450
Smells good.

346
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,640
She got this for you specially.

347
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,820
Come on, Tong Nian.

348
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,820
Coming.

349
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,110
Calm.

350
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,190
Tong Nian, what's wrong?

351
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,030
We've got guests.

352
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,610
You can't wear that.

353
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,650
Go upstairs and get changed.

354
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,150
Quick.

355
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,320
Hold on.

356
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,450
This is your home?

357
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,400
Yeah, what a coincidence!

358
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,990
Tong Nian, what are you doing?

359
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,990
That's so rude.

360
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,070
Could you tell me

361
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,780
where the bathroom is?

362
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:51,950
There.

363
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,190
Over there.

364
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,070
Thanks.

365
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,780
You're welcome.

366
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,150
Tong Nian.

367
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,860
Go and get changed now.

368
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,320
Have some fruit.

369
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,200
No, I'm fine.

370
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,530
Have some tea.

371
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,950
I'll have juice.

372
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,950
You...

373
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,490
Tong Nian, come on.

374
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,990
This is Mr. Han.

375
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,110
Hello, Mr. Han.

376
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,590
My daughter's studying...  -Why is he here?

377
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,150
...computer science at university.

378
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,280
I don't know.

379
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,950
She is really good.

380
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,200
Oh right,

381
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,450
I have a grandson who's very good-looking.

382
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,610
He's studying

383
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,860
computer science as well.

384
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,860
Maybe later,

385
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,860
you two can get to know each other.

386
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,610
I'm sure

387
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,110
you'll have plenty to talk about.

388
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,240
He'll be here later, right?

389
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,990
Yeah, right.

390
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,900
You heard that?

391
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,990
Isn't Wu Bai a good match for her?

392
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,820
I don't know.

393
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
If you think so, then sure.

394
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,200
Tsh.

395
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,190
Give him a call.

396
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,650
He can't be late for dinner.

397
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,900
OK.

398
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,610
Mr. Han, be careful.

399
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,530
Okay, okay.

400
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,280
Mr. Han, go in this car.

401
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,360
It's really comfortable.

402
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:23,950
This one?

403
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,610
Yeah, this one.

404
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,610
Okay, okay.

405
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,700
Later, you should go out on a limb

406
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,950
and ask that girl back there

407
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,570
about her height and weight.

408
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,950
And what kind of thing she likes?

409
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,360
Is that clear?

410
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,700
Mr. Han, let's go.

411
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,490
Okay, okay.

412
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,610
Let me help you.

413
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,030
Be careful.

414
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,490
Okay.

415
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,610
My goodness.

416
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,280
Tong Nian,

417
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,280
what should we do?

418
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,570
I'm off now.

419
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,360
Hey, Tong Nian.

420
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,860
Here's a mission for you.

421
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,990
Your cousin Yuejiao

422
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,200
is having a date with that guy.

423
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,030
You'll take the same car with them,

424
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,030
and listen to what they talk about.

425
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,650
Is that clear?

426
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,530
A date?

427
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,700
What?

428
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,700
Dounan.

429
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,650
You take the car behind, okay?

430
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,070
OK.

431
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,570
Tong Nian, hurry up.

432
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,490
Do I have to take that car?

433
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,650
Excuse me.

434
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,360
They arranged for me to take this car.

435
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,070
I don't want to go in that one.

436
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,030
Why not?

437
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,900
Then do you want to take a taxi?

438
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,820
Yeah, I'll take a taxi.

439
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,110
No, of course you won't.

440
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,450
This is the first time I've met him.

441
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,450
If it's awkward,

442
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,570
I can chat with you.

443
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,400
Otherwise, what will I do?

444
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,190
Yeah,

445
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,530
be good. Go go go.

446
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,610
Go go go. We're family friends.

447
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,150
Don't worry.

448
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,200
Didn't he say

449
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
that he's not interested in woman?

450
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,570
You sit in back and I'll sit in front.

451
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,360
You fool.

452
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,530
It's not that he doesn't want a girlfriend,

453
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,610
it's that he doesn't want you.

454
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,240
Sorry, your jacket.

455
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,240
Move.

456
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,200
You know,

457
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,450
after all these dates,

458
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,950
all these guys,

459
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,490
he's gotta be the rudest.

460
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,070
Let's go.

461
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,070
We're all adults here,

462
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,240
let's be frank with each other.

463
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,820
Let me introduce myself first.

464
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,780
I'm in marketing,

465
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,570
and also responsible for brand management.

466
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,950
What's your job?

467
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,030
I don't have one.

468
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,900
Then what do you do for a living?

469
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,070
My aunt says

470
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,650
that you're starting your own business.

471
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,820
For a living?

472
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,240
Playing computer games.

473
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,740
Playing computer games?

474
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,250
Sounds like you're living off your parents.

475
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,400
Now I know.

476
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
Actually...

477
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,150
actually, he does have a job.

478
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,610
He does have a real job.

479
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,200
Playing computer games is a job?

480
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,740
They work for the cyber security.

481
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,570
And there're competitions and prizes.

482
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,280
It's also an emerging field with state funding.

483
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,030
And if they win a competition,

484
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,900
they get money,

485
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,860
lots of money.

486
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,530
But, they don't play for that,

487
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,030
they play for the honor.

488
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,780
In China,

489
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,700
many of our networks

490
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,570
are actually world-leading.

491
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,610
We've won a lot of medals.

492
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,360
But they can't

493
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,820
play games their whole life.

494
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,240
Here we are?

495
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,200
Why are we stopping here?

496
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,780
I think we should

497
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,110
make it clear before we go in.

498
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,280
I have no interest in you.

499
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,840
And I will not have any interest in the future.

500
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,450
And you, of course,

501
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,900
have no interest in me.

502
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,570
Since we are all adults,

503
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,400
we'll have a civilized meal together,

504
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,150
okay?

505
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,610
And,

506
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,860
you don't need to pretend that you don't know me.

507
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,570
Aren't you tired?

508
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,950
What's going on here?

509
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,610
Tong Nian, you two have met?

510
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,190
Yeah, not long ago.

511
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,820
Didn't he just get back?

512
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,490
And you were at school,

513
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,280
you don't have a job.

514
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,070
Where did you meet?

515
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,150
In an internet café.

516
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,950
Online?

517
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,030
No.

518
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,820
I met him at your internet café.

519
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,150
Yes.

520
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,320
Yes what?

521
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,200
You must be hiding something.

522
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,200
Finally, we're here.

523
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,030
Finally, fresh air.

524
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,190
Nice place.

525
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,320
Yuejiao,

526
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,900
how's it going?

527
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,900
Please, he's so arrogant.

528
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,700
I don't know

529
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,110
how he can be so proud

530
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,950
without a decent job?

531
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,740
How can he be like that?

532
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,070
Let me tell you.

533
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,950
Later, at the table,

534
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,650
you put on a bit of a show.

535
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,280
Tonight, it's a festival,

536
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,700
don't upset Mr. Han.

537
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,860
I know, mum.

538
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,610
Later, when the diner is over,

539
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,450
you take these things to me.

540
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,990
They know each other?

541
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,070
Those two?

542
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,030
Did you know that?

543
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,240
If you have any problems,

544
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,360
feel free to get in touch.

545
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,490
Thank you.

546
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,360
Okay, thank you.

547
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,650
Yes, they know each other.

548
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,240
Let's go.

549
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,240
They're waiting for us.

550
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,780
Okay.

551
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,150
Why are you here?

552
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,780
They all went inside,

553
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,700
so I wanted to wait for you.

554
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,030
Just being polite.

555
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,650
I don't have any interest in your cousin.

556
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,780
So I won't encourage her

557
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,280
to take any interest in me.

558
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,320
So,

559
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,990
what you said in the car

560
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,240
didn't help me.

561
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,650
What's my job?

562
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,250
I don't need anyone to justify it.

563
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,700
Besides,

564
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,090
she's a total stranger to me and will always be.

565
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
So there's no need

566
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,700
to explain anything to her.

567
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,200
You get that?

568
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,740
Also,

569
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,650
the reason I said in the car

570
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,950
that we knew each other,

571
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,240
wasn't to embarrass you,

572
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,560
but because the lie

573
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,190
won't have to last long.

574
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,200
My cousin Wu Bai will be here soon.

575
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,530
He knows you.

576
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,280
And he only tells the truth.

577
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,570
So there's no need to pretend

578
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,600
we don't know each other to start off with.

579
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,320
Are we clear?

580
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,860
Yeah.

581
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,530
We're not strangers.

582
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,110
Now you feel better.

583
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,200
Let's go.

584
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,030
Here. Come here.

585
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,030
What's wrong, auntie?

586
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,150
Tell me,

587
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,320
you know Han Shangyan.

588
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,290
Yeah.

589
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,570
What do you think of him?

590
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,110
I only met him a week ago.

591
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,530
I just know he's good at computer games.

592
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,320
I want to know, is he a good man?

593
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,950
Does he really not have a job?

594
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,240
Or is he just pretending that he doesn't?

595
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,650
Playing computer games is a real job actually.

596
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,740
So do you think him and Yuejiao...

597
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,490
Do you think?

598
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,190
Auntie,

599
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,400
that's my phone.

600
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,530
It's my classmate.

601
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,530
I have to take this.

602
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,150
Hello, Yaya,

603
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,860
yeah, yeah.

604
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,360
I'm having dinner with my family.

605
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,150
Today?

606
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,030
Okay, when this is over...

607
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,820
Yeah, okay.

608
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm listening.

609
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,570
If so, can I send it to you later, okay?

610
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,070
I'm in the restaurant now.

611
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,190
Wu Bai, here you are.

612
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,450
Here, come here.

613
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,640
-This is my grandson.  -You mentioned him before.

614
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,070
-Yeah, Wu Bai.  -He's so tall.

615
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,780
And he's good looking.

616
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,900
Does he have a girlfriend?

617
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,280
Not yet.

618
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,200
You can find him one.

619
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,820
He brought this for you.

620
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,860
Thank you. Thank you.

621
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,240
I'll leave it here for you.

622
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,070
-Here have some space.  -Okay.

623
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,990
Come, come here.

624
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,530
Thank you.

625
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,400
Thank you.

626
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,900
It's very nice of you.

627
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,450
Take a seat.

628
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,280
What's going on?

629
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,650
What?

630
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,240
She's grown up!

631
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,150
Why is she here?

632
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,200
The girl who likes you.

633
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,610
We're family friends.

634
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,650
Grandpa wants you to have a date with her.

635
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,780
Are you kidding?

636
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,700
I told you.

637
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,860
Grandpa is a little crazy.

638
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,650
If anyone's going on a date, it should be you.

639
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,820
It's got nothing to do with me.

640
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
I've got a date.

641
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,190
And I've taken care of it.

642
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
You'd better take care of yours.

643
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,320
I can't help you.

644
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,110
Tong Nian, come here.

645
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,780
Come here.

646
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,950
Let me introduce

647
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,070
you two here.

648
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,900
This is my grandson Wu Bai.

649
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,780
This is Tong Nian.

650
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,400
Your parents met him when he was a kid.

651
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,190
Okay, go.

652
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,030
You two sit down.

653
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,820
Hurry.

654
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,490
Go. Go. Go.

655
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:26,530
Come,

656
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,190
you two have a talk.

657
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,280
He's doing computer science too.

658
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:33,920
Oh.

659
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,450
Yeah, Tong Nian,

660
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,900
you're studying the same thing,

661
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,950
you must have a lot in common.

662
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,450
Hey, boy. Say hello.

663
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,740
I know her.

664
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,150
You do?

665
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,200
It seems that

666
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,190
she's my brother's girlfriend.

667
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,860
Wu Bai, what are you talking about?

668
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,530
No, stop, stop.

669
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,530
I won't listen to him.

670
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,240
I'm listening to you.

671
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,150
Wu Bai, tell me.

672
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,900
Actually,

673
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,070
I don't know the details.

674
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,740
But everyone at the club

675
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,950
knows their relationship.

676
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,860
Really?

677
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,450
No, it's not like that.

678
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,650
Tong Nian,

679
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,650
don't you think you should explain

680
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,780
what's going on here?

681
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,950
Tong Nian, come here.

682
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,740
Come.

683
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,030
What is going on?

684
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,010
How do you suddenly have a boyfriend

685
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,110
that we don't know about?

686
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,860
I don't know either.

687
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,990
He's not my boyfriend.

688
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,030
-It's not like that.  -Tell me everything.

689
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,650
Mrs. Han,

690
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,150
I can explain it to you.

691
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,190
Enough!

692
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,780
You shut up.

693
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,360
One more word,

694
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,200
and I will break your legs!

695
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,400
Mr. Han, don't get angry.

696
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,570
You see, Tong Nian is upset too.

697
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,890
Do you know what is going on between them?

698
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,700
Dounan.

699
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,270
Yeah?

700
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,270
Since when did Tong Nian have a boyfriend?

701
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,400
I don't know the details,

702
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,650
but Tong Nian does like him.

703
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,320
It's not true.

704
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,610
I'm just being honest.

705
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,400
Wasn't it love at first sight?

706
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,990
Shut up now, okay?

707
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,110
Dounan.

708
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,030
But,

709
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,740
I really don't know when they started going steady,

710
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,320
maybe when they were in Guang Zhou.

711
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,150
Shut up, will you?

712
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,150
Enough, sit down.

713
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,030
Our family is welcoming.

714
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,190
If you two are in love,

715
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,360
we're fine with that.

716
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,400
But Shangyan,

717
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,610
you need to tell us first,

718
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,240
am I right?

719
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,530
Auntie, you've got me wrong.

720
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,170
I'm really not... -Enough. When we're taking,

721
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,160
don't interrupt.  -Because I'm not...

722
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,990
Alright, alright, enough.

723
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,490
Mr Han, it's okay.

724
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,780
They're all adults now, not kids anymore.

725
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,820
Shangyan,

726
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,240
this's the first time we've met.

727
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,860
When you next have time,

728
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,900
come and visit us again, okay?

729
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,860
Don't you know that Mr. Han is really busy.

730
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,900
So don't pressure him,

731
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,990
will you?

732
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,860
You know, you need to explain things to us.

733
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,030
If you can do that,

734
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,280
then we won't arrange this date for you.

735
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,280
Am I right, Mr. Han?

736
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,650
Yeah, right.

737
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,320
Go say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

738
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,720
This is an important introduction for you.

739
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,950
Go and say hello.

740
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,650
Grandpa is getting too old.

741
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,820
If I go against his wishes,

742
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,200
he might have a heart attack.

743
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,700
It's Spring Festival,

744
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,900
now everyone at the table

745
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,320
thinks that it was me who lied to Tong Nian

746
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,740
and is refusing to come clean.

747
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,450
Go!

748
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,240
Mr. Tong, Mrs. Tong, hello.

749
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,200
I'm Han Shangyan.

750
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,190
We've only just made things official.

751
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,400
So without her permission,

752
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,820
I didn't feel I could come and visit you.

753
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,030
Excuse me for my rudeness.

754
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,860
Okay, it's fine.

755
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,900
Okay, it's fine.

756
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,240
Have a seat.

757
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,900
Mr. Han.

758
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,990
Okay, come here.

759
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,190
It's the New Year's Eve.

760
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,400
Everyone should be happy,

761
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,740
be happy, okay?

762
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,950
Yeah, right, right.

763
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,650
If you have any worries,

764
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,280
save them for next year,

765
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,200
okay?

766
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,570
Sit.

767
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,780
Sit.

768
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,900
Sit over there.

769
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,900
Yes,

770
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,030
we should all be happy.

771
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,190
Come on, everyone, raise your glass,

772
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,110
okay?

773
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,530
Here we go!

774
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,190
Everything will work out,

775
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,900
okay?

776
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,610
Okay, cheers!

777
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,700
Excuse me!

778
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,170
Coming.

779
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,900
We're ready to order.

780
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,050
Okay, got it.

781
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,700
Hey, listen,

782
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,640
if he weren't Mr. Han's grandson,

783
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,320
I would....

784
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,070
You see, he's much older

785
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,320
than our daughter.

786
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,150
Yeah.

787
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,610
He is much older.

788
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,490
Don't just repeat what I say.

789
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,990
Wu Bai,

790
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,240
there was a call

791
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,740
from the office for you.

792
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,490
You should call them back.

793
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,820
Come with me.

794
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,990
Stop eating.

795
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,700
Come.

796
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,900
Are you out of your mind?

797
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,580
You said that I should sort things myself.

798
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,780
If it weren't for the timing,

799
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,150
I'd kill you.

800
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,820
But you do admit it.

801
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,320
Well, I had to.

802
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,030
It's the New Year's Eve,

803
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,110
and Grandpa is really old,

804
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:06,900
if something happened to him,

805
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,610
what would we do?

806
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,950
And Grandpa,

807
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,360
how is it he always

808
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,780
trusts you and not me?

809
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,150
Today is a special case.

810
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,400
You won't do it again,

811
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,320
hear me?

812
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,030
Bro,

813
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,240
I never expected I'd

814
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,400
end up with you as my brother-in-law.

815
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,530
Must be fate, right?

816
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,650
Why are you here?

817
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,450
Mr. Han wants you in for dinner.

818
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,860
He's so prickly.

819
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,650
Squid is going to suffer.

820
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,490
Time to eat!

821
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,950
Even though he's older,

822
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,530
he'll take good care of his girl.

823
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,070
I know that

824
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,450
my grandson Shangyan,

825
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,360
he always pulls a long face,

826
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,450
but he's actually

827
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,740
very responsible.

828
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,530
And also,

829
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,860
you see, his birthday

830
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,200
is the 14th February.

831
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,570
And her birthday is the 20th March.

832
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,860
It's so close.

833
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,360
That's a good sign, right?

834
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:05,740
Mr. Han, here.

835
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,990
Take this.

836
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,320
Okay, thank you.

837
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,900
Come here, Wu Bai.

838
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,110
Yeah.

839
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,990
You, it's you.

840
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,200
Come. You sit here.

841
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,070
Hurry.

842
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,820
Here.

843
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,650
Come on, eat.

844
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,610
OK.

845
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,740
Han Shangyan, you sit over there.

846
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,780
Yeah, there.

847
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,650
Go ahead.

848
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,110
Let's eat.

849
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,150
It's the New Year's Eve, be happy.

850
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,860
Why are you lying?

851
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,150
My cousin,

852
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,150
there's this girl he likes.

853
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,990
So he wants me

854
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,400
to help him get rid of his date.

855
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,150
It's really difficult,

856
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,360
so we have to tell everyone.

857
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,030
But after tonight,

858
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,740
you can break up with me.

859
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,530
You can say I'm selfish,

860
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,190
or that we don't have anything in common,

861
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,070
or I'm too old for you,

862
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,070
it doesn't matter.

863
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,700
Just find an excuse and break up with me.

864
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,070
OK.

865
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,400
Sorry.

866
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,950
It's okay.

867
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,280
So it's for him?

868
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,200
Hey, Shangyan.

869
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,030
serve your girlfriend.

870
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,740
It's okay, Mr. Han, I'm fine.

871
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,070
Hurry up.

872
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,240
Thank you.

873
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,240
Eat.

874
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,110
Thank you.

875
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,200
That's enough!

876
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,950
It's too much for me.

877
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,990
Take your time. You can do it.

878
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,610
Here,

879
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,700
get your girlfriend

880
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,990
some drinks.

881
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,360
Hurry.

882
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,990
OK, that's enough.

883
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,820
It's enough.

884
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,610
Enjoy it.

885
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,240
Wu Bai,

886
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,450
after this,

887
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,780
don't forget to pack up the leftovers.

888
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,400
Shangyan,

889
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,650
I didn't know

890
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,990
you ate so much.

891
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,740
We've got a kid at home.

892
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,610
You're divorced?

893
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,700
And you have a kid?

894
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,700
No, it's not like that.

895
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,860
It's a kid from his club.

896
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,110
He has no place to go,

897
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,700
so he lives with us.

898
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,700
Here, try this.

899
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,700
Mr. Han, be careful.

900
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,570
Watch your step.

901
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,780
Okay, thank you.

902
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,780
Tong Nian, let's go.

903
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,950
Wait, wait,

904
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,820
Tong Nian can sit with Shangyan.

905
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,780
You take her.

906
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,190
Her parents are here.

907
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,900
Yeah, and you should ask their permission.

908
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,450
Mr. Han, Mrs. Han,

909
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,110
would you let Tong Nian sit with me?

910
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,110
Don't worry,

911
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,820
my car is just behind yours.

912
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,190
Yeah,

913
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,490
please say yes, just for me.

914
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
-Okay, you go.  -Let's go. Let's go.

915
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,150
Here, let me help you.

916
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,610
Be careful with this.

917
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,150
OK.

918
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,780
Let's go.

919
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,080
♪ Thinking he's just pretending he doesn't care ♪

920
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,820
I have a question for you.

921
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,450
♪ I thought my guard would fool you ♪

922
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,360
Okay, go ahead.

923
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,360
When should we breakup?

924
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,110
We should set a date,

925
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,200
so I can tell my parents.

926
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,360
When do you want to do it?

927
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,700
Don't know yet?

928
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,820
How about,

929
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,820
how about next month?

930
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,730
It's just that the Spring Festival

931
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,820
isn't a good time.

932
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,070
Let's do this.

933
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,150
You're the one

934
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,270
who should decide when we break up.

935
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,610
You just let me know.

936
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,070
But until then,

937
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,740
you're still my girlfriend.

938
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,400
If there's anything you want, just tell me,

939
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,400
and I'll make it happen.

940
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,530
It's a deal.

941
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,110
Then go home.

942
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,780
Your mum's waiting for you.

943
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,110
Okay, I'll be off then.

944
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,740
Good bye.

945
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,570
Bye.

946
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,780
What are you talking about?

947
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,360
Nothing.

948
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,570
Let's go inside.

949
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,610
Let's go.

950
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,780
You know, our daughter,

951
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,450
this is her first love.

952
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,570
I don't want her getting hurt.

953
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,320
Here we go.

954
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,280
They're not getting married anyway.

955
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,570
I've already told you.

956
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,720
It's dangerous having a beautiful girl.

957
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,950
If I'd knew about this,

958
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,030
I'd have made her eat more.

959
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,190
Then she'd be safe.

960
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,490
When she met someone,

961
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,820
she could lose the weight.

962
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,400
Come on now.

963
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,190
We could have done that when she was little,

964
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,950
but now she's grown up.

965
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,360
If you made her fat,

966
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,530
it'd damage her self-esteem.

967
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,240
You see,

968
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,560
everyday I dress her up nicely.

969
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,740
Who knew

970
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,450
she'd end up with a boyfriend like that?

971
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,070
Enough. Let me tell you.

972
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,530
You're just prejudiced against him.

973
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,490
Beside his age,

974
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,740
he seems like a good guy.

975
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,560
You're right.

976
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,130
I've never seen Tong Nian so happy.

977
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,440
I really don't know what I should say.

978
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,110
Here we are.

979
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:43,190
You'd better just keep quiet,

980
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,950
until we find out more about him.

981
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,780
See, what do you think?

982
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,450
It's good.

983
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,820
Be careful not to burn yourself.

984
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,960
Try it.  -Go. Go. Go.

985
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,740
Bring it to her.

986
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,070
I'll talk to her.

987
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,780
Okay, okay.

988
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,280
Just go.

989
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,400

990
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,860
