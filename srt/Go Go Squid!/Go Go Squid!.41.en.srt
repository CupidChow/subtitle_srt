00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:17,970
What's going on?

176
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,130
Today is a very special day for me.

177
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,170
You may have heard

178
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,210
that I won the Chinese championship before.

179
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,840
But I've never won any international competitions before.

180
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,160
Today,

181
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,080
my team realized this dream for me.

182
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,450
They won the Asian championship.

183
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,330
It really means a lot to me.

184
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,450
We are very proud of you.

185
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,250
Yes.

186
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,090
Thank you for your support.

187
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,010
Just because we support you

188
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,490
doesn't mean you have to do that!

189
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,570
Stand up.

190
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,210
Han Shangyan.

191
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,070
On this special day,

192
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,010
I would like to ask for permission

193
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,770
to marry your daughter.

194
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,250
I didn't know.

195
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,770
He didn't tell me about this.

196
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,530
I am so lucky

197
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,330
to have Tong Nian in my life.

198
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,930
She taught me how to laugh.

199
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,530
Anytime I see her laughing,

200
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,220
I forget every trouble I have in my life.

201
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,690
If you could open your heart

202
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,130
just a little bit more

203
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,450
and leave more space for yourself?

204
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,690
And also me?

205
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,410
I know that

206
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,850
you are not satisfied with my past.

207
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,210
I totally understand.

208
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,890
I don't understand romance,

209
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,850
and I didn't know how to date before.

210
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,400
People around me are afraid of me.

211
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,730
But because of Tong Nian,

212
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,690
I learned what it meant to love someone.

213
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,250
Overnight.

214
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,050
I don't want to be your girlfriend.

215
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,210
I don't like you.

216
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,610
I was looking for you.

217
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,530
What's so special about me?

218
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,730
Young lady, your info is totally wrong.

219
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,330
You say you like me

220
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,610
without realizing

221
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm a bachelor by choice.

222
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,450
Do you want to end it?

223
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,890
Don't have an answer yet?

224
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,210
No.

225
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,810
I mean, I don't want to break up.

226
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,430
I don't mean to pry into your personal life.

227
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,850
But I'm new to this,

228
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,130
so I want to ask you.

229
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,490
Hey, do you have anything

230
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,250
to tell me?

231
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,050
I can't just see you when I want to?

232
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,130
You're my first boyfriend.

233
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,490
I hope that you can be braver

234
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,610
when you're with me.

235
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,930
Do what you want to do.

236
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,410
Don't be afraid.

237
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,810
Don't be scared of me, okay?

238
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,610
Fame and reputation are not real.

239
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,730
Except for you,

240
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,730
I, Han Shangyan, have nothing.

241
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,730
I have nothing,

242
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,330
and I'm all alone.

243
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,170
Only this is real.

Tong Nian,

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,370
although I am older than you,

252
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,030
you are more mature than me at times.

253
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,120
So I would like to switch roles with you now.

254
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,250
You don't have to cater to me all the time.

255
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,320
I want you to be the center of my life.

256
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,970
Let me take care of you.

257

You don't know?

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,530
It's your decision to make.

Don't ask me.

I...

266
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,850
I have some questions for you.

267
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,290
Tong Nian is my only daughter.

268
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,050
We tried our best

269
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,370
to make sure her life wasn't very hard.

270
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,010
Please rest assured.

271
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,210

275
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,410
I will take care of her and love her

just as much and even more than you do.

Don't cry, dear.

278
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:26,930
Alright.

279
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,530

I know you don't trust me.

284
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,330
I'm sorry, but

285
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,650
I can't change my age.

286
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,970
But I promise

287
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,930
I will love her for the rest of my life.

288
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,730
I'll treasure every minute

289
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,490
we spend together.

290
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,090
Glad to hear that.

291
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,090
Promise me,

292
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,770
you will take good care of her.

293
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,570
You must promise.

294
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,610
So,

295
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,130
if we're all agreed,

296
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,460
then I'd like to go register our marriage.

297
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,370
I'm here today

298
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,770
to get her documents.

299
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,450
Han Shangyan,

300
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,860
why do you always do this to us?

301
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,690
Why are you always in such a rush?

302
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,890
I understand that this is

303
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,970
sudden news for you to hear.

304
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,290
I am sorry for that.

305
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,090
But I've dreamed of marrying Tong Nian

306
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,010
after we became champions.

307
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,370
Alright. Go on.

308
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,290
Go and get our residence booklet.

309
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,330
You're the one who has it.

310
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,690
You should go get it.

311
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,730
Oh right! I know where it is.

312
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,690
I know where.

313
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,890
Why makes things so dramatic?

314
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,930
You should have told me earlier.

315
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,090
Who said she wanted to get married

316
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,330
before the match started today?

317
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,970
I don't think you were kidding.

318
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,490
As soon as you mentioned it,

319
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,090
I thought of coming here

320
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,650
to get your residence booklet.

321
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,130
Have you seen anyone else

322
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,050
who loves someone so wholeheartedly?

323
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,530
The prize for winning this competition is quite large.

324
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,570
Where shall we go for our honeymoon?

325
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,450
Honeymoon?

326
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,970
Don't people go on honeymoons

327
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,890
after getting married?

328
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,690
Is there any problem?

329
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,690
Honestly speaking,

330
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,730
I don't want to let her go.

331
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,610
Shangyan, remember,

332
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,530
feel free to come to us for help.

333
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,450
We are your family now.

334
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,370
Remember, call us anytime.

335
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:49,890
Thank you.

336
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,730
I almost forgot.

337
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,290
You must come here 3 times a week

338
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,370
and eat with us.

339
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,050
We will, mom.

340
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,610
Don't worry, Mrs. Tong.

341
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,330
I will bring her back here frequently.

342
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,530
Give it to him.

343
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,400
Shangyan, once you take this

344
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,090
and register with Tong Nian,

345
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,350
you will legally become her husband.

346
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,810
You must love her and treat her right.

347
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,640
Do you hear me?

348
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,400
Dad, mom. Stop it.

349
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,810
I'll always be your daughter.

350
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,770
Don't be sad.

351
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,330
I will come back frequently.

352
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,690
We are happy for you!

353
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,210
You are finally getting married.

354
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,970
Why are you standing there? Come here.

355
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,690
Stop crying.

356
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,650
Bye, summer.

357
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,410
What's wrong?

358
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,610
I forgot something.

359
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,850
What's that?

360
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,410
I'll go get it for you.

361
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,970
No, I forgot to do something.

362
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,850
What's that?

363
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,170
Don't do this.

364
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,170
There are so many people here.

365
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,610
They will see us.

366
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,570
Think of it as our wedding rehearsal.

367
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,090
If you feel shy,

368
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,450
just hide your face in my shoulder.

369
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,970
I won't.

370
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,170
Are you really sure about this?

371
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,650
There's no going back

372
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,810
after I announce it.

373
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,490
Are you really sure?

374
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,530
If you're really sure,

375
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,930
then I'm really sure.

376
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,530
Give me 10 seconds.

377
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:04,850
Why?

378
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,050
Look!

379
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:26,610
Look!

380
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,510
♪ Your eyes are like shiny stars ♪

381
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,470
♪ Filling my heart ♪

382
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,630
♪ I don't want to wake up ♪

383
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,050
I am 100% sure and ready now.

384
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,090
Did you enjoy that?

385
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,250
No!

386
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,330
Then don't watch!

387
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,170
Carry on, you two.

388
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,290
Boss, where have you been?

389
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,410
How can we celebrate without you?

390
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,650
He's right.

391
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,490
This is a special day for me.

392
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,530
I just got Tong Nian's residence booklet!

393
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,930
I want to get married too!

394
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,170
Did she say yes?

395
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,530
This booklet means...

396
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,930
Congratulations, you won't be single anymore!

397
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,090
Tong Nian! Congratulations!

398
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,410
I am so happy for you!

399
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,530
Miss Squid,

400
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,810
it's about time you two got married!

401
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,130
I am so happy for you.

402
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,010
Darling,

403
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,330
can you believe it?

404
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,490
She married Gun!

405
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,770
What's more amazing,

406
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,970
is that I know Gun personally now!

407
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,450
Congratulations to you, boss!

408
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,530
Have a happy married life.

409
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,290
A lucky life!

410
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,370
A long and healthy life!

411
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,610
And a lovely baby!

412
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,570
Congratulations!

413
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,810
Come here, Shangyan.

414
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,220
Your besties are waiting for you upstairs.

415
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,610
Take care of Tong Nian.

416
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,010
No problem!

417
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:25,050
Boss's wife! Boss's wife! Boss's wife!

418
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,450
Solo looks like a traitor wearing this.

419
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,810
This is definitely not my style.

420
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,650
Here he comes!

421
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,450
Don't waste too much of his time.

422
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,690
He is a married man now.

423
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,290
What did you say?

424
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,210
Shangyan,

425
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,560
so all that cheering downstairs

426
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,960
wasn't because you won the championship,

427
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,130
but because you...

428
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,210
You're the most serious of us all,

429
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,570
have a bad temper,

430
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,210
and aren't interested in love.

431
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,550
Plus, you spend all your money on your team.

432
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,650
Yet you somehow married first?

433
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,730
How could you get married before all of us?

434
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,570
It's unbelievable!

435
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,330
Kill me now!

436
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,650
Stop it, get back here.

437
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,410
Go ahead, jump.

438
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,570
-I was kidding!  -It's fine.

439
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,410
Alright. Knock it off.

440
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,130
I feel

441
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,850
with all of us here on this balcony,

442
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,890
that it's 10 years ago.

443
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,010
When we were in Shanghai

444
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,210
on the roof of that shabby place,

445
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,330
all together,

446
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,690
striving to achieve our dreams.

447
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,370
It was great

448
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,530
fighting for our dreams together.

449
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,330
Really great!

450
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,080
We've successfully passed

451
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,810
our dream to the next generation.

452
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,810
I believe K&K and SP

453
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,410
will keep fighting for our dreams

454
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,340
and ensure China dominates the CTF world.

455
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,010
That's right.

456
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,210
For the passionate times.

457
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,490
Cheers!

458
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,090
I am afraid I can't drink with you.

459
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,610
I have to drive Tong Nian somewhere later.

460
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,410
But...

461
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,250
I sincerely wish

462
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,130
that my best friends

463
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,930
will also be as happy as I am now.

464
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:01,890
He's changed.

465
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,690
-Drink with us!  -I'll have some juice instead.

466
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,770
Come on, cheers!

467
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,410
Cheers!

468
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,650
Where are you going later?

469
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,450
Good luck!

470
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,450
It's their wedding night.

471
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,130
See you.

472
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,130
I'll get some more beer.

473
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,890
Let's toast to Han Shangyan!

474
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,610
And winning the championship!

475
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,650
Cheers!

476

Hurry up.

522
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,770
There is no one here.

523
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,170
Of course not!

524
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,210
It's 6 in the morning!

525
00:27:59,210 --> 00:27:59,970
It's not open yet.

526
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,690
We came too early.

527
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,170
I remember I once saw on TV

528
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,350
that people were lined up waiting to register.

529
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,650
And came the night before to line up.

530
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,170
I thought we were going to be late.

531
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,930
I suddenly realized that

532
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,450
I've done many weird things

533
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,650
since I became your boyfriend.

534
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,970
What weird things?

535
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,210
Like what we are doing now.

536
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:26,730
I almost forgot!

537
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,170
Let's call grandpa.

538
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,050
He should be awake now.

539
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,050
Mr. Han,

540
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,650
Here is your tea.

541
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,930
Thank you.

542
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,970

Shangyan,

552
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,610
don't tell me you miss me?

553
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,220
Tong Nian and I are at the marriage registration bureau.

554
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,570
What? Right now?

555
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,010
Yes.

556
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,530
In 2 hours,

557
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,350
she will become my legal wife.

558
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,730
Fantastic!

559
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,170
Shangyan.

560
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,570
You finally did something

561
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,730
that makes me feel relieved.

562
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,970
Great.

563
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,290
Where is Tong Nian? Tong Nian?

564
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,010
Grandpa. I'm here.

565
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,530
Oh, good!

566
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,610
Tong Nian,

567
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,650
I will prepare a grand wedding ceremony for you.

568
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,290
Let's do one in Shanghai,

569
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,210
one in our hometown,

570
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,530
and one in Norway, too.

571
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,130
That will be expensive!

572
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,330
It's not a problem!

573
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,170
Let's do one Chinese style,

574
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,130
and one western style.

575
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,570
So 5 in all.

576
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,290
5 ceremonies.  -Yes, let's go big.

577
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,930
Okay, grandpa.

578
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,330
You will be very busy then.

579
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,410
Alright, I'll let you start planning.

580
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,010
Talk to you later.

581
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,650
See you, grandpa.

582
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,530
Go and register!

583
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,370
Diana.

584
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:05,970
Yes?

585
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,490
Come here.

586
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,570
Why are you so happy?

587
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,290
My grandson is getting married!

588
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,610
Congratulations!

589
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,530
Congratulations!

590
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,330
I am sorry.

591
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,290
Are you okay?

592
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,850
I'm okay. I'm okay.

593
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,150
Are you okay? Sure?

594
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,830
Yeah, sure.

595
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,070
Okay.

596
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,390
Yeah!

597
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,530
Yes!

598
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,450
Grandpa wants to have 5 ceremonies?

599
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,690
No way around it.

600
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,770
Grandpa always wanted a granddaughter.

601
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,690
He likes you so much.

602
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,410
There's no way to stop him.

603
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,520
Oh right, I forgot something important.

604
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,090
Hand.

605
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,010
Which finger should I put it on?

606
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,610
Middle finger or the fourth finger?

607
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,370
You fool!

608
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,050
The middle one is when you're engaged.

609
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,130
The fourth finger is for marriage.

610
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,850
It's too big.

611
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,130
Wear it on your thumb for now.

612
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,570
I'll buy you a wedding ring later.

613
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,090
It looks cool.

614
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,170
I feel like a king now.

615
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,530
Do you like it?

616
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:31,890
I do.

617
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,010
Thank you.

618
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,730
This is the only

619
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,180
championship ring that I have.

620
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,930
I actually won another championship ring

621
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,270
when I played for Solo.

622
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,610
But I threw it away.

623
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,130
I only have this one now.

624
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:55,930
I am sorry.

625
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,650
I retired too early.

626
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,270
I should have won several rings for you.

627
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,610
Why do I like this one so much?

628
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,490
It's clearly my favorite.

629
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,090
Let's queue up!

630
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:12,650
Let's go.

631
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:17,890
One more thing.

632
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,370
What else?

633
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,540
I am not an outgoing person.

634
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,490
I always hide my feelings inside.

635
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,300
I always thought being romantic was unnecessary.

636
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,370
But...

637
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,090
A life lasts a long time.

638
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,410
I will give you whatever you want.

639
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:55,810
I love you.

640
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,530
Why did you stop talking?

641
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,130
I'm done talking.

642
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,570
You didn't say anything.

643
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,370
I didn't hear anything.

644
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,090
Fool.

645
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,450
I am not.

646
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,290
Let's go.

647
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,570
Do you think

648
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,530
it will be crowded later?

649
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,170
Let's wait right here

650
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,250
so we are the first couple.

651
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,130
Where should I live after we get married?

652
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,930
You don't have to move.

653
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,010
What about you?

654
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,370
Me?

655
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,770
What do you think?

656
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,050
If you live at the club with me,

657
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,570
I will get a new bed

658
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,010
so we have a bigger one.

659
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,330
If you want to live at my home,

660
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,650
we don't have to change anything.

661
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,930
You can move right in.

662
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,080
Then I don't have to feed Little Squid anymore,

663
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,210
you can help me do it.

664
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,850
If you want to live at your home,

665
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:48,770
that's fine too.

666
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,710
I don't mind living with your parents,

667
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,450
because your parents are nice.

668
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,810
Then what about my doctorate?

669
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,490
This is a problem.

670
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,220
I can move into your dorm.

671
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,490
Into my dorm?

672
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,610
It's only for girls.

673
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,690
They won't let you in.

674
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,130
I can sneak in.

675
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,650
Didn't you think about where we should live

676
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,030
after getting married?

677
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,640
I just didn't have enough time

678
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,030
to think of everything yet.

679
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,450
No problem. Take your time.

680
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,760
How much time?

681
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,970
2 hours.

682
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,810
That's definitely not enough time.

683
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,200
In 2 hours,

684
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,870
you will become my legal wife.

685
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,200
You will have nowhere to run.

686
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,720
Don't scare me off.

687
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,010
I'm kidding.

688
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,930
Don't be scared.

689
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,510
I'll take the team to the world finals first,

690
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,810
and then we'll have our wedding ceremony.

691
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,850
We can think about where to live later, okay?

692
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,240
That's a good idea.

693
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,530
I was kidding too.

694
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,720
Let's rest a while.

695
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,010
There is no place to rest here.

696
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,570
What are you doing?

697
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:04,610
Sit.

698
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,130
Where are you going?

699
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,370
Have a sit.

700
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,130
Thank you. Then I'll sit on it.

701
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,690
This is comfy.

702
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,280
If someone sees us like this,

703
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,970
they will think that we are crazy.

704
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,130
They won't.

705
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,490
It's normal for couples

706
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,990
to wait a long time out here.

707
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,730
Thank you for staying by my side this whole time.

708
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,370
Thinking back,

709
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,290
this all feels like a dream.

710
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,210
As long as I am with you,

711
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,060
I will feel happy no matter what happens.

712
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,530
I am so lucky.

713
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,230
Even if we quarrel,

714
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,210
we will never part.

715
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,490
Am I right?

716
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,650
Why would we quarrel?

717
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,970
We won't.

718
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,930
No matter what happens,

719
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,250
we will always love each other.

720
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,690
I don't think I can put up with everything you do.

721
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,210
Let me be clear,

722
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,930
no matter what happens later,

723
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,170
don't drink too much.

724
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,410
When you're drunk, you're out of control.

725
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,080
Even if I get drunk,

726
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,770
I'll never stop loving you.

727
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,930
You have scary moments too.

728
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,450
You don't know how much I've done for you.

729
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:48,730
Thank you.

730
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,570
After all that's happened,

731
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,770
I'm finally your man.

732
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,450
This is destiny.

733
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,450
I'm happy you're mine.

734
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,330
They came here so early!

735
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,010
We should have come earlier.

736
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,050
They are so early!

737
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,770
Too early!

738
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,690
Yeah.

739
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,570
Tong Nian.

740
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,770
Tong Nian. Wake up.

741
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:25,690
Tong Nian.

742
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,090
When did all these people come?

743
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,170
This is so embarrassing.

744
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,250
Don't mind us.

745
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,490
You guys are so early.

746
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:34,930
Yeah.

747
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,490
We're second. Quick.

748
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,890
We were here before you.

749
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,410
We're third then.

750
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:38,810
Alright.

751
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,970
Step aside.

752
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,570
Who was here first?

753
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,650
We were.

754
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,610
What time did you come?

755
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,490
Five this morning.

756
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,290
So early?

757
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,130
Come on in.

758
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:04,450
= Changning District Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau =

759
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,170
K&K and SP will both be representing China

760
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,940
at the world finals.

761
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,937
I hope they won't be selected

762
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:12,120
to play against each other again.

763
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,890
Alright, it's time to make a call.

764
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,230
Let's call our old friend,

765
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,200
the coach of SP, Appledog.

766
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,380
Hello.

767
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:20,890
Hello, Ai Qing.

768
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,690
I can hear you.

769
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,580
Are you on the way there?

770
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:28,840
Yes, Han Shangyan was late again.

771
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,130
We are on the way to the airport.

772
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,930
It wasn't boss's fault.

773
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,810
His wife took forever with her makeup.

774
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,410
I think you took too long getting ready!

775
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,050
That's not true.

776
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,530
Not true.

777
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,290
Really?

778
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,570
Well, hurry up.

779
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,850
The plane won't wait for you.

780
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,890
Don't worry.

781
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,770
We're almost to the airport.

782
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,530
Bye-bye.

783
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,330
Bye.

784
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,970
Are you okay, Xiaomi?

785
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,290
Are you okay?  -Are we there?

786
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,810
Almost. Not yet.

787
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,730
But you should wake up now.

788
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,570
We are almost there.

789
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,370
We're here! Get your things!

790
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,530
You can use the rear door, too.

791
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,650
Shangyan. You're late again.

792
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,770
You don't have any substitutes?

793
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,930
I don't need any.

794
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,370
What if something unexpected happens?

795
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,570
Don't cry about it later.

796
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,400
I can borrow one from K&K.

797
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,930
Or I can just have you jump in.

798
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:56,690
No problem.

799
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,290
My fee is 100,000 yuan.

800
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,690
Plus a bonus if I help you win.

801
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,290
300,000 if I won bronze.

802
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,210
500,000 for silver.

803
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,320
And gold?

804
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,770
You won't win, don't ask.

805
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,170
