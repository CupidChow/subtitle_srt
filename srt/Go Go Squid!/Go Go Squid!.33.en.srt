OK.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,080
And,

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,740
I don't know how to make girls happy.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,400
When Solo got money,

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,160
he would buy snacks for his girlfriend.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,200
I thought a girl like you

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,520
might like snacks too.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,520
So, I bought you

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
strawberries,

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,200
strawberry cake

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,400
and strawberry macaroons.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,200
The shop assistant said

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,530
the cake should be eaten quickly,

39
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,760
if it melts it won't be tasty.

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,840
Or give me a list of your favorite snacks.

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,430
I'll buy everything on it, alright?

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,560
I want to eat now.

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,440
I'll get them for you.

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,120
What are you doing, Tong Nian?

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,240
Strawberries.

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,120
I wanna eat this strawberry.

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,040
Have you been drinking?

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,160
See!

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,370
I had a whole bottle of this.

50
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,440
Amazing, right?

51
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Who let you drink...

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
Shh. Don't talk.

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,920
Answer a question first.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,880
Am I really your

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,120
first girlfriend?

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,040
Yes.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,520
Han Shangyan, you are mine.

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,720
All mine.

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
Tong Nian, stop.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,200
Han Shangyan, do you know

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,440
how much I like you?

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,840
Do you know how cute you are?

63
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,640
How can you be this cute?

64
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,880
Little piggy.

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,000
I like you so much that

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,260
I want to stay with you 25 hours a day.

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,040
I like you when you lose your temper.

68
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,400
I like you when you're working.

69
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,840
I like you no matter what,

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,160
really.

71
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,160
I like you so much.

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
Stop it, Tong Nian.

73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,400
Stop.

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,640
Tong Nian?

75
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,920
Tong Nian?

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,050
I really, really like you,

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,320
Han Shangyan!

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,880
You're so cute.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,320
So cute.

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,480
Boss, we're ordering lunch.

81
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,440
Shall we order one for you?

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
No need.

83
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,190
Then, shall we order one for Mrs. Han?

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,920
She's sleeping.

85
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,520
No need.

86
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,720
Hey, wait.

87
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,560
Order one.

88
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,320
OK, Boss, we'll help you out.

89
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,660
Your, your mom just had an operation

90
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,440
so she needs to rest.

91
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,320
Make sure she rests.

92
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,600
And buy some supplements for her.

93
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,520
That way your mom can recover faster,

94
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,480
OK?

95
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,250
OK.

96
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,350
So, you two must be hungry, right?

97
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm starving.

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,160
We're fine.

99
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,560
I knew you were hungry.

100
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,010
I, I'll go to the kitchen

101
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,000
and ask Tong Nian's mom

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,840
what we have to eat,

103
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,560
and then

104
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,800
let's eat together, OK?

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
That's too much bother.

106
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,080
Zheng Hui and I should go.

107
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,160
Have a seat.

108
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,640
Please you're my guests.

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Stay here and

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,000
chat with your mom.

111
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,200
OK.

112
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,200
I'll go talk to my wife.

113
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,600
Sorry to bother you.

114
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,600
No worries.

115
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,840
Thank you, Mr. Tong.

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,960
Mom, it's fine.

117
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,920
Let's just hang out here.

118
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,400
It' not good to trouble them.

119
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,200
We're all friends.

120
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,960
Well?

121
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,400
She still hasn't answered?

122
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,030
I'm calling her friend Lan Mei

123
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,480
to see if they're together.

124
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,280
I need to answer this.

125
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,030
Hello?

126
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
Lan Mei, it's me.

127
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,240
Is Tong Nian with you?

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,360
No, she's not here.

129
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,120
Here's the thing,

130
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,590
I've been calling Tong Nian,

131
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,160
but she's not answering.

132
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,280
I'm worried about her.

133
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,600
Don't worry, Mrs. Tong,

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,120
maybe the signal is bad

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,920
so she didn't hear it.

136
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,400
OK, sorry to bother you.

137
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,720
See you.

138
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,440
Call Tong Nian again.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,560
Once more.

140
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,200
Who was that?

141
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,760
Tong Nian's mom,

142
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
she can't find her.

143
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,520
She's probably with your idol right now.

144
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,720
No way.

145
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,720
Who knows?

146
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,720
Let me call him.

147
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,800
Mom, it's really good.

148
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,640
Eat up.

149
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,120
Have some more.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Here, try this.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,120
Who's Lan Mei?

152
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,240
How could I know?

153
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,280
Hello?

154
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,050
Hello?

155
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,440
Is Tong Nian with you now?

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,600
She drank too much last night,

157
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,520
and is sleeping now.

158
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,640
What?

159
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,520
She's drunk?

160
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
Well,

161
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,760
her mom's looking for her.

162
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,720
If she knows this, she'll be pissed off.

163
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,530
Don't let her answer her phone alright?

164
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,520
Thanks for warning me.

165
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,200
I understand.

166
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,160
She's drunk?

167
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,840
Yes!

168
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,080
But that's a good thing.

169
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,040
Things are moving along.

170
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,230
That's good.

171
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,400
Tong Nian, don't answer your phone!

172
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,100
Hello?

173
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,240
Wait! Don't.

174
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,800
Tong Nian, what happened?

175
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,840
I called so many times but

176
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,440
you didn't answer.

177
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,060
Where are you now?

178
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
I'm in...

179
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,280
Han Shangyan's room.

180
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,480
He's right here next to me.

181
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
What?

182
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,240
You.. you slept at his place?

183
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
How could you do that?

184
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm sleepy.

185
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,160
Let me sleep a bit longer.

Do you hear me?

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,550
Hello?

190
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,880
Hello? Uh, Mrs. Tong,

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,720
it's Han Shangyan.

192
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,320
She's not feeling well

193
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,440
so she's just resting here for a while.

194
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll bring her home soon.

195
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,400
I'll go with her

196
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,440
and explain everything to you.

197
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,040
So don't worry.

198
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
OK, bye, Mrs. Tong.

What's tasty?

204
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,980
Hey, hello?

205
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,960
She's sleeping where?

206
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,560
Tell me.

207
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,040
Whose place is she sleeping at?

208
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,000
Han Shangyan's!

209
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Han Shangyan?

210
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,640
They're back together?

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,720
Tong Nian had a change of heart?

212
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,120
What change of heart?

213
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,880
Of course she's been fooled by him.

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,240
Han Shangyan said that

215
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,480
Tong Nian is not feeling well,

216
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,640
so she's resting there

217
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,480
and he'll bring her back later

218
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,240
to explain it to us.

219
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,200
Actually, it seems he really likes Tong Nian.

220
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,280
And that's a good thing.

221
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,690
At least he will treat Tong Nian very well.

222
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,800
What do you think?

223
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,120
What's wrong with you?

224
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,720
Don't you worry about your

225
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,060
little girl sleeping over at a man's place?

226
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,920
Of course I'm worried.

227
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
But it's not as serious as you think.

228
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,600
Honey, we still have guests.

229
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,400
Let's talk about it

230
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,360
after they leave.

231
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,880
No way!

232
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,920
You should go there now

233
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
and bring her back immediately.

234
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,840
Go! Go! Now!

235
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,760
What are you thinking?

236
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,960
How can we do that?

237
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,720
Tong Nian is an adult

238
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,000
not a child.

239
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,720
Can you think about her feelings

240
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,280
before acting rashly?

241
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,080
Besides,

242
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,680
it's not like the old days.

243
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,600
This is the 21st century.

244
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,320
Don't be so old-fashioned.

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
Listen to me,

246
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,720
Tong Nian's sleeping at Han Shangyan's place,

247
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,520
I don't trust him.

248
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm a mom, you know.

249
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,960
Quickly! Go get her!

250
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,200
Honey, listen.

251
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,120
I've talked with Han Shangyan,

252
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,480
and I think he's a good kid.

253
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,320
So relax,

254
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,960
everything will be fine.

255
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,960
He will

256
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,600
take care of things properly.

257
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,440
Relax, relax.

258
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,600
Stop it.

259
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
What's wrong with Tong Nian?

260
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,480
Zheng Hui is so nice.

261
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,840
He took good care of his mom at the hospital.

262
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,640
He's such a filial child.

263
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,380
Why couldn't Tong Nian be with him?

264
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,240
I'm so pissed.

265
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,040
That girl.

266
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,940
Actually, Shangyan is also good.

267
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,370
At least he's patient with old people.

268
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:55,880
That's great.

269
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
What's wrong with you?

270
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,080
How come it seems

271
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,160
you've changed sides?

272
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,840
Have I ?

273
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,920
Choose one.

274
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,720
Whose side are you on?

275
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,720
Whose side?

276
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,120
Of course, I'm on your side.

277
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,640
I just wanted to share my opinion with you.

278
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,600
But you're the boss

279
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,360
and you're in charge of our family.

280
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
Your opinion is the most important

281
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,680
and we'll all listen to you,

282
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,400
OK, honey?

283
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,480
Save it.

284
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,240
We have guests,

285
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,880
let's go.

286
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,560
Quickly.

287
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,680
Let's go.

288
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,480
You're awake.

289
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,890
Your mom called you 47 times.

290
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,800
I didn't answer,

291
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,880
but you did.

292
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,200
Where's my phone?

293
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,200
Where's my phone?

294
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,230
Do you know what you told your mom?

295
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
What did I say?

296
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,720
Did I say anything wrong?

297
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,970
You said that you were sleeping here

298
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,520
and that Han Shangyan was next to you.

299
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,710
How could I actually say that to her?

300
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,920
Go wash up

301
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,160
so I can take you home.

302
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
You're taking me?

303
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
You mom almost went crazy on the phone

304
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
and wanted to eat me alive.

305
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,560
I need to explain things to her.

306
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Gosh, I'm so screwed!

307
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,920
What are you looking at?

308
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,080
You look so handsome in a suit.

309
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,640
Why are you wearing a suit?

310
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,880
Hungry?

311
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,800
Alright,

312
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,320
then let's appease your parents first.

313
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,320
My bag.

314
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,840
Wait a second.

315
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,680
Let me help you.

316
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Maybe

317
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,080
you shouldn't go inside.

318
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,560
If my mom was mad on the phone,

319
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,960
she'll probably yell at you now.

320
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
Now you know you messed up?

321
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,440
I didn't do it on purpose.

322
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,040
I think you did do it on purpose.

323
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,280
It'll be fine.

324
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,000
Dad, Mom.

325
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,680
What happened?

326
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,540
How could you sleep at his place?

327
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,080
Didn't you two break up?

328
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,880
Tell me right now.

329
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,040
Explain yourself.

330
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,040
Tong Nian, go upstairs.

331
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,000
If I go upstairs,

332
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,200
then how can I protect him?

333
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,500
They're so mad at him already.

334
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
Upstairs,

335
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,040
do you hear me?

336
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,560
No way, I can't leave him.

337
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,160
I'll say nothing and do nothing,

338
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,920
I'll just sit here and listen, OK?

339
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,160
Mr. Tong,

340
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,360
Mrs. Tong,

341
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,040
I'm so sorry.

342
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,160
Please allow me to explain.

343
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,840
Have a seat.

344
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
Summer, get down.

345
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,480
I believe you have

346
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
misunderstood Tong Nian and me.

347
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,120
Two years ago,

348
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,590
right after I had established K&K club,

349
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,920
I met Tong Nian at an exhibition.

350
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,480
I just saw her once,

351
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,480
but I couldn't forget her.

352
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,790
Didn't we meet just before Spring Festival,

353
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,160
and I pursued you?

354
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,790
I thought we'd never

355
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,000
see each other again.

356
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,920
Luckily,

357
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,550
when I took my team to compete this year,

358
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,130
she was also there for an activity.

359
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,290
That's when we first officially met

360
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,360
I was so excited to see her again.

361
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,940
Maybe you think I'm exaggerating.

362
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,920
How can a thirty-year-old man,

363
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,040
act like a teenager?

364
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,840
But please believe me,

365
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,320
I'm genuine.

366
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,000
I was the one crazy about you.

367
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,600
You just ignored me all the time.

368
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,840
At the beginning,

369
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,600
Tong Nian wasn't very accepting

370
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,560
of an old man like me,

371
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,280
because there's quite a big age gap.

372
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,790
That's why things didn't turn out well

373
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,000
on New Year's Eve.

374
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,240
I'm so sorry

375
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,640
and feel guilty that

376
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,800
I've kept all this from you.

377
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,070
Tong Nian didn't want to accept that I liked her.

378
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,840
So,

379
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,350
I didn't dare come and talk to you.

380
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,240
What is he talking about?

381
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,150
I thought the most important thing

382
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,840
for a man was his career.

383
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Career first, and marriage next.

384
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,320
But nothing else matters to me anymore

385
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,760
after I met Tong Nian.

386
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,440
We just got back together

387
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,960
when she broke up again with me.

388
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,090
I was devastated and that's why

389
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,200
Tong Nian was at my place.

390
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,880
I took Tong Nian to the club.

391
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,520
I told her,

392
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,420
if you can't accept how busy I am,

393
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,550
then I'll give up all my shares in my company

394
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,120
and switch industries.

395
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,120
For you,

396
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll give up K&K, the club I founded myself

397
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,560
Tong Nian is still young.

398
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,120
So she may think that

399
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,320
I'm nothing but a small part of her life.

400
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,600
But for me,

401
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,910
she's already a huge part of my life.

402
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,960
So today,

403
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,090
when I brought her home,

404
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,440
I wanted to talk with you both

405
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,480
and hope you will give me a chance.

406
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,260
If Tong Nian's not willing to be with me

407
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,220
and wants to break up,

408
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,120
I will walk out of here right now

409
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,260
and disappear forever.

410
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,440
But if she's willing to be with me,

411
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
I hope you two

412
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,920
will allow her to be with me.

413
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,090
I'll take care of her

414
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,770
for the rest of her life.

415
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,080
Actually, this guy

416
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,990
is more complicated than I thought.

417
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,600
Oh yeah?

418
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,650
He's quite charming.

419
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,720
Shangyan,

420
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,520
although Tong Nian's mom and I,

421
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,800
don't quite understand

422
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,100
how playing on the computer can be a career,

423
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,030
I heard your career is going very well, right?

424
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,480
Emerging industries

425
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,280
require more time and energy

426
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,760
than other established industries.

427
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,840
I

428
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,600
just want to ask you one question.

429
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,800
Where do you plan to

430
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,240
develop your career?

431
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,920
I heard your company's HQ is in Norway, right?

432
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,840
China.

433
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
Mr. Tong, don't worry.

434
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,250
I'll spend most of my time in China.

435
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,760
That's good.

436
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,270
Long distance relationships are hard.

437
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,480
Shangyan, you still haven't

438
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,910
explained why Tong Nian slept at your place.

439
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,320
Mr. Tong, Mrs. Tong,

440
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,440
please believe me.

441
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,810
I sincerely like Tong Nian.

442
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,920
So until you allow us to officially date,

443
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,700
I'd never do anything I shouldn't with her.

444
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,520
Listen to me,

445
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,920
I don't care if you're sincere or not,

446
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,520
Tong Nian wasn't like this before.

447
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,680
After she met you,

448
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,720
she plays on the computer

449
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,430
and follows you around all the time.

450
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,280
And now,

451
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,110
she, she even slept at your place!

452
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,330
I feel like I don't even know my daughter anymore.

453
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,080
Tong Nian, go upstairs.

454
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,520
Look at yourself!

455
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,640
Go clean yourself up.

456
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,920
Go, now!

457
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,640
Get in there.

458
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,600
Think about this seriously!

459
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
You aren't married yet

460
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,800
but went to a guy's place to sleep!

461
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,880
How will others look at you!

462
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,850
I don't even know what to say to you!

463
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm so mad.

464
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,280
Shangyan,

465
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,920
Tong Nian's mom

466
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,150
has never talked to her like that before

467
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,990
and has never gotten so upset at her.

468
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,360
Tong Nian must be feeling hurt,

469
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,070
go upstairs and comfort her.

470
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,280
Go ahead.

471
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,880
I trust you.

472
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,320
Now what, Mom?

473
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,120
It's you?

474
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Your dad asked me to comfort you.

475
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,880
Come in, come in.

476
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
It's not appropriate.

477
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,840
My mom is next door.

478
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,720
Don't let her know.

479
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,560
Come in.

480
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,240
How did you know this was my room?

481
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,520
I guessed.

482
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,440
Don't all the bright colors in here

483
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,040
hurt your eyes?

484
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,640
Nope.

485
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,840
I think it's great.

486
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
Why are you standing there?

487
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,960
Have a seat. Sit anywhere.

488
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,080
I'd rather stand.

489
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,200
I don't know

490
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,320
where I should sit.

491
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,000
Seems your mom doesn't like me.

492
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
No, she does.

493
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,430
Cuz my mom gave birth to me when she was 36.

494
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,560
So she loves me too much

495
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,520
and has high hopes for me.

496
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,660
May I ask you a question?

497
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,360
Yes.

498
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,720
You said that

499
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,500
you first saw me two years ago.

500
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,680
I lied.

501
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,520
And you fell for me while in Guangzhou?

502
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,560
I lied.

503
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,320
And you said

504
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
that you had me pretend

505
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,520
to be your girlfriend on New Year's Eve?

506
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,760
Also a lie.

507
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,760
In that special circumstances,

508
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,270
if I didn't admit our relationship,

509
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,000
then just like my brother said,

510
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,860
I would be an adult man

511
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,160
messing with a young girl

512
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,080
and refusing to admit it.

513
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,000
In that case,

514
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,280
I'm sure your parents

515
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,640
would want to kill me.

516
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,040
That makes sense.

517
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,270
I just feel that everything is fake.

518
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,720
You made everything up?

519
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,280
I...

520
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,220
I have another question for you.

521
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,880
Is it about me taking care of you for life?

522
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,200
I like this.

523
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,080
It's so pretty.

524
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,520
Thank you.

525
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,520
Tong Nian.

526
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,680
Do you know what?

527
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,080
Actually at that time,

528
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,640
I wanted to say,

529
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,520
"Tong Nian,

530
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
I think

531
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,800
I'm in love with you."

532
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,080
Fame and reputation are not real.

533
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
Except for you,

534
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,340
I, Han Shangyan, have nothing.

535
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,320
I have nothing,

536
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,080
and I'm all alone.

537
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,800
Only this is real.

538
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,640
You believe that?

539
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,110
Few people are as dumb as you are.

540
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,920
Excuse me?

541
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,360
My IQ is 140.

542
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,720
Then you're very smart.

543
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,960
Of course.

544
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,760
You should believe that

545
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,920
I'd never lie to you

546
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,560
about loving you.

547
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,240
It's my first time to your room.

548
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
I shouldn't stay long.

549
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,080
Otherwise,

550
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,200
your parents will get mad at me again.

551
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,320
Are you leaving now?

552
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,160
Don't want me to go?

553
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,840
Then I'll video chat with you later.

554
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,640
But I need to take a shower first.

555
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
I can wait a while,

556
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,720
it's fine.

557
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:01,960
See you.

558
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,920
Drive safe.

559
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,560
Mr. Han,

560
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,920
you finally remembered

561
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,960
you have a stepmother.

562
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,960
I'm all alone in a foreign country,

563
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,320
you should feel bad for me.

564
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,120
I raised you all those years,

565
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,600
and it was very difficult for me.

566
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,040
But look at you.

567
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,590
You only call me on holidays.

568
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,920
You never call me

569
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,960
if I don't call you first.

570
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,560
So ungrateful.

571
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,160
Can we talk about this later?

572
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,840
I'm listening, go ahead.

573
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,040
Can you do me a favor?

574
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,680
Visit my girlfriend's parents.

575
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,320
What?

576
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,640
V...visit whom?

577
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,040
Whose parents?

578
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,760
What parents?

579
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,240
Can you let me finish first?

580
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,680
Go ahead.

581
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,927
Do you remember the girl

582
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:14,060
I drew for you last time?

583
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,560
You made it happen?

584
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,680
Son,

585
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,720
you're so efficient!

586
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,000
If you get married,

587
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,680
I may have

588
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,760
some grandsons to hold.

589
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,480
Great!

590
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,160
Thank God.

591
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,270
I didn't disappoint your father.

592
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,720
Don't get carried away.

593
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,080
I can say whatever I want to you.

594
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,200
Wait,

595
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,360
let me think,

596
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,520
if you marry this year,

597
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,600
you'll have a baby next year.

598
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,440
Should I buy some baby products

599
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,360
for you to look at?

600
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,360
What do you two need?

601
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,400
Just visit her parents first alright?

602
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,240
No need to tell me.

603
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,240
I'll definitely go there.

604
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,360
Don't you need to

605
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,200
tell your husband first?

606
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Why should I?

607
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,340
His job is to make me happy.

608
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,600
And now

609
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,440
I have something else to make me happy.

610
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,680
There's no reason for him not to let me go.

611
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,440
Your husband is nice,

612
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,600
commendable.

613
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,880
Of course,

614
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,520
I chose him.

615
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,440
I'll go to Beijing

616
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,920
to attend the national finals next month.

617
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,200
Can you visit them this month?

618
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,360
OK, sure.

619
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,080
Then I'll check flight tickets tomorrow.

620
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,760
OK.

621
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,120
Wait, wait.

622
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,300
What does that little girl like?

623
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,360
Don't bring anything.

624
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,840
You already gave her a gift,

625
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,120
but I paid for it.

626
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,800
Bye.

627
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,120
Wait, I, I...

628
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,360
I've sent her a gift?

629
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,720
Shaofei.

630
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,920
All yours.

631
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,800
Seriously?

632
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,320
Otherwise it'll be wasted.

633
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,320
Aren't you afraid of getting diabetes?

634
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,400
I was poor and starving years ago.

635
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,980
So now whatever I got to eat,

636
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,680
I think it tastes amazing.

637
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,120
You're right.

638
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,120
You guys are all single,

639
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,160
so I'll feel sorry for you

640
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,360
if I get married.

641
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,840
Earlier today you worried

642
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,480
you couldn't convince Tong Nian's parents,

643
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,040
but now you're planning to get married?

644
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,280
Is that surprising?

645
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,640
Not at all,

646
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,720
you're amazing.

647
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,000
But I think

648
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,600
if you two get married,

649
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
Tong Nian is so unlucky.

650
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,680
Why?

651
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,960
Put yourself in her shoes.

652
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,920
Besides being in Sanya together,

653
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,600
have you seen movies together?

654
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,720
Have you hung out a lot together?

655
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,920
Have you travelled together?

656
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,760
Nothing at all.

657
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,520
Then I shouldn't even bring up

658
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,480
what it's like to fall in love in college.

659
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,600
Holding hands while

660
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,240
walking along the river.

661
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,880
Watching the sunrise

662
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,760
or going to the library,

663
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,320
or reading books you like together.

664
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,760
She reads Romeo and Juliet

665
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,350
and you read Snow White, right?

666
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,360
In the library,

667
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,200
you whisper to each other

668
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,680
and go to the canteen together,

669
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,320
right?

670
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,600
While smiling at each other,

671
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
she picks out dishes for you

672
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,320
and you grab two free seats.

673
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,240
You see?

674
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,840
Have you done any of that?

675
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,720
That's the reason

676
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,680
why she's so unlucky

677
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,440
to have an older boyfriend.

678
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,960
Especially one like you.

679
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,640
You got any plans tomorrow?

680
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,830
Tomorrow?

681
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,000
I'll help my teacher proctor an exam.

682
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Got it.

683
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,350
Be a good help.

684
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,510
OK.

685
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,120
Eat up.

686
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,800
OK.

687
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,840
Sun Yaya, get up!

688
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,200
No, let me sleep for a while.

689
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,880
Nope.

690
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,720
What time is it now?

691
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,000
Don't we have a test to proctor?

692
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,000
You go first.

693
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,720
They said one person is enough.

694
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,920
The teacher will be there.

695
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,560
You must go, got it?

696
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,920
Sun Yaya, get up! Get up!

697
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,440
You're annoying.

698
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,200
I'll leave you alone, but hurry up.

699
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:27,920
Sun Yaya,

700
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,120
why are you lying there?

701
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,600
It's so comfortable.

702
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,080
Why don't you try it?

703
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,200
No need.

704
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,000
Enjoy it yourself.

705
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,640
But you're going to be late.

706
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,720
It's your own business.

707
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
I need to go now.

708
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,520
Bye, Sun Yaya.

709
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm late.

710
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,700
-Sorry, sorry.  -What're you doing?

711
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,160
What's wrong with you?  -We're already late!

712
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,240
What's your problem?

713
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,000
Don't you know how to park?

714
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,360
You damaged my bike.

715
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,280
Sorry, sorry.

716
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,840
Why aren't all of you in class?

717
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,800
Don't you know how to park?

718
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,440
Look at my bike, it's damaged.

719
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,600
If it falls down, pick it up.

720
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,800
If it's damaged, I'll repair it.

721
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,160
Or just buy you a new one.

722
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,560
All that matters is no one's hurt, right?

723
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,080
Just go to class, OK?

724
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,720
I'll take care of it.  -I'm sorry.

725
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,040
I'm sorry, forgive me.

726
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,760
Sorry, sorry.

727
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,160
You're such a cool boyfriend.

728
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,720
Why are you here?

729
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,120
Can't I go to your school?

730
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,320
Of course you can.

731
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,560
I just didn't expect

732
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,560
you to come today.

733
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,920
Don't you have an exam to proctor?

734
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,720
Yes!

735
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,760
I'm late!

736
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,880
See you later.

737
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm in Classroom 405.

738
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,120
Wait for me outside.

739
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,760
Grab my bag, would you?

740
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,000
You can start the exam now.

741
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,680
You only have 60 minutes.

742
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,840
So don't delay.

743
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,520
Your teacher said the questions

744
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,760
this time might be easy,

745
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,200
but there are a lot.

746
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,980
So you may not

747
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,160
finish within 60 minutes.

748
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,640
Make sure you go fast.

749
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,240
I need to stay in here for 60 minutes,

750
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,840
so go wander around.

751
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,040
See you later.

752
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,600
How did you do?

753
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,240
No clue.

754
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,000
It was hard.

755
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,160
Yes, so many question I don't know.

756
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,000
I didn't know what to write.

757
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,040
He's hot.

758
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,280
Add him on WeChat.

759
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,400
Go, ask him.

760
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,880
Hey, what's your major?

761
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,730
I'm majoring in Girls Flirting 101.

762
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,200
Just kidding.

763
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,600
I'm in the same major as your proctor.

764
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,400
Can I add your Wechat?

765
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,840
Girls,

766
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
please leave after the exam,

767
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,920
don't linger near the classroom.

768
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,720
Let's go, let's go.

769
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,200
Almost finished,

770
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
one more minute.

771
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,320
Alright, time's up.

772
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,720
Hand in your papers now.

773
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
Sorry to keep you waiting.

774
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,240
We're not allowed to pick flowers at school.

775
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,840
Not even wild flowers?

776
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,680
Have you heard the song

777
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Don't Pick Wild Flowers on the Road?

778
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,040
Nope.

779
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,000
Seriously?

780
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,920
Sing it for me.

781
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,320
Wildflowers on the road, you...

782
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,000
Tong Nian,

783
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,560
where did our professor say to wait for him?

784
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,510
In this classroom.

785
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,200
OK.

786
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,800
We're meeting in this classroom.

787
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,560
Do you know

788
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,960
which department

789
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,000
is that guy in?

790
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,880
Our monitor's heart may be broken.

791
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,480
She has a boyfriend!

792
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,100
Yes!

793
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,360
He's here to say she's not available.

794
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,310
Later I'll send some photos to him

795
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,720
to break his heart.

796
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,840
Not just him,

797
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,120
don't forget about Zheng Hui.

798
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,160
Yes, yes.

799
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,320
What about Zheng Hui?

800
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,030
You may need to wait even longer.

801
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,440
I need to give the papers to our professor.

802
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,600
And he's not here yet.

803
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,640
OK, I'll just wait.

804
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,440
I'll go inside.

805
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,080
May I go in with you?

806
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,360
I think it's OK.

807
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,800
It's not a real class,

808
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,560
so I think you can go inside.

809
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,320
Let's go then.

810
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,480
Hi.

811
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
Hi, hi.

812
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,040
Sit here.

813
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,200
Here, sit here.

814
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,050
Hey,

815
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,640
do you have anything

816
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,400
to tell me?

817
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,440
I can't just see you when I want to?

818
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,000
Of course, you can.

819
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,880
It's fine.

820
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,360
Tong Nian, I'm here.

821
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,820
Hey.

822
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,520
What are you doing here?

823
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,200
What's he doing here?

824
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,200
The professor's here.

825
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,240
I saw you rushing in here.

826
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,680
You're late again.

827
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Got up late again?

828
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,600
No, I didn't...

829
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,590
I just went to get breakfast after the exam.

830
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,200
Breakfast?

831
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,960
Alright, give me the papers.

832
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,960
You can just say that you're my brother

833
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and came to take me home.

834
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,880
No, wait.

835
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,760
Say you went to the wrong classroom.

836
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,440
You've all written your names?

837
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,560
Just make up an excuse.

838
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,440
Any excuse.

839
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,600
OK.

840
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,560
Professor.

841
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,240
Who are you?

842
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,320
Why are you here?

843
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,320
