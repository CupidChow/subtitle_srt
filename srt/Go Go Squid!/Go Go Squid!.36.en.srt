Wait for me.

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,040
Dry your hair.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,080
It's all wet.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,320
Did you pay for it yet?

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,360
I'll buy it in a bit.

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
No cold drinks.

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
You might catch a cold.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
I'm getting it for the kids.

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,480
Alright, I'll go check out then.

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Here, drink this,

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,320
it's warm.

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,080
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
I lost control today.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
That's okay.

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,180
I think it's good to drink every once in a while.

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,880
Why is that?

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,400
Because

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,320
you can finally speak your mind

44
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,920
about everything you want.

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,440
You kept a lot of that to yourself for a while now right?

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,600
Han Shangyan,

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,360
I told you once,

48
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,170
I am quite rich.

49
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,570
I have my luck money,

50
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,170
my commercial performance payments,

51
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,450
and my scholarship in here,

52
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,730
as well as the money from selling discs.

53
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,530
In total there is

54
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,050
around 67,952 RMB.

55
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,290
So now, I give it to you.

56
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,570
That's a lot of money.

57
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,770
You look so well dressed and beautiful every single day,

58
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,050
and you still managed to save so much,

59
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,930
that's not easy.

60
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,170
I just want to tell you,

61
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,610
even if your grandpa goes against you,

62
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,450
your mom doesn't support you,

63
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,890
I'll always be by your side.

64
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,120
I put all my trust in someone before

65
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,290
like she did.

66
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,890
This is something that is easy to say,

67
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,530
but only a few can actually do it.

68
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,370
It is necessary

69
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,490
to have some safe space

70
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,450
in a friendship,

71
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,490
or in love.

72
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,890
You looking for candy?

73
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,690
I'll buy some for you.

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,010
Wait.

75
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,130
Don't leave.

76
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,050
Sit down.

77
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,610
Why?

78
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,330
Keep the money.

79
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,290
You are all I need.

80
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,330
When you are ready to get married,

81
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,450
drop me a hint.

82
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,690
This is not a proposal.

83
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,890
I just want to let you know,

84
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,770
I'm lucky to have you.

85
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,810
I hope in the future

86
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,290
that I will always have you.

87
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,380
Hey!

88
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,810
Boss.

89
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,490
What are you doing here?

90
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,610
The coach said,

91
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,770
you want to talk to us before the contest.

92
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,370
We just bought these drinks,

93
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,530
you guys help yourselves.

94
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,050
Thank you Tong Nian.

95
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,090
You guys talk,

96
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,210
I'll go inside,

97
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,130
call me if you need me.

98
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,410
Where's Wu Bai?

99
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,250
Captain said you were busy with your date,

100
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,850
so he went back to his room.

101
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,530
So, should we

102
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,290
keep waiting here,

103
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,810
or leave you too?

104
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,410
The big day is coming. How do you feel?

105
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,250
Like fighting of course.

106
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,210
K&K will win.

107
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,770
Sit, sit, sit.

108
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,730
Enough empty words.

109
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,330
He has changed today,

110
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,330
he is talking to us before the contest.

111
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,530
No wonder the captain didn't come.

112
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,850
This is rare, don't interrupt him.

113
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,410
Thank you, boss.

114
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,290
Listen up.

115
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,690
Go ahead boss,

116
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,890
we are listening.

117
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,290
First,

118
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,970
congrats for making it this far

119
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,170
with honor and the pressure of winning.

120
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,770
It's very difficult

121
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,690
to get in national finals.

122
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:28,970
In truth,

123
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,890
I really don't have much to say.

124
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,360
As a professional player,

125
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,430
I achieved some good records.

126
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,790
But I cannot say that I was successful.

127
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,650
Because I gave it up.

128
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,580
So I sincerely hope that

129
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,370
none of you will give up half way.

130
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,060
In facing every challenge in your life,

131
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,650
you must always try your best.

132
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,090
In the circle of CTF,

133
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,170
talent goes fast.

134
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,570
The requirements for APM, age

135
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,600
and brain power are all extremely strict.

136
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,050
If we look back,

137
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,760
previous champions were beaten one by one.

138
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,210
Nobody wanted to leave,

139
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,620
all of them were forced to make that choice.

140
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,050
A hero's end is a real tragedy.

141
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,090
So,

142
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,160
I hope you can cherish these valuable years

143
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,650
and fight hard,

144
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,690
fight until the very end.

145
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,130
So in life,

146
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,290
you won't have any regrets.

147
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,810
Fight!

148
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:43,930
Fight!

149
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,890
Fight!

150
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,650
Fight!

151
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:50,930
Game on!

152
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:51,570
Game on!

153
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,250
What did you hear?

154
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,690
Your eloquent speech.

155
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,810
Are they still outside?

156
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,450
Maybe they're nervous,

157
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,570
so they want to stay a little longer.

158
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,120
Why do I feel like you are just like my mom?

159
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,170
Just like a kindergarten teacher taking care of kids.

160
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,490
You are not wrong.

161
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,620
Oh yeah,

162
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,410
I have to tell you something tomorrow.

163
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,210
Why tomorrow?

164
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,410
Why not tell me now?

165
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,530
I just said tomorrow.

166
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,400
So why tell me this now?

167
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,850
If you don't tell me now,

168
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,970
I'll be up all night wondering what it is.

169
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,730
Hey come on.

170
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,290
Tell me, tell me, tell me!

171
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,890
Hey!

172
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,530
Be a good girl,

173
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,090
or I'll have to do something about it.

174
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,050
Boss, I...

175
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,090
Sorry,

176
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,450
never mind.

177
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,290
I told you we should wait,

178
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,330
why did you have to push me?

179
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:12,970

Be a good girl.

190
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,370
Tonight,

191
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,010
I have to prepare for the contest.

192
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,050
Stop being so restless.

193
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,580
I guess you can't fall asleep tonight.

194
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,650
Am I that fragile

195
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,410
in your eyes?

196
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,610
No.

197
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,960
When I went abroad to participate in

198
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,460
the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest,

199
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,770
I was too excited to sleep

200
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,410
the night before the contest.

201
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,950
So I understand exactly what you're feeling right now.

202
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,330
Listen,

203
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,450
I'll go get my laptop

204
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,610
and stay up with you.

205
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,290
Wait for me.

206
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,650
Are they...

207
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,290
Do you think they...

208
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,010
Ever since he met Tong Nian,

209
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,770
the boss is acting more human than ever.

210
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,810
How is he more human?

211
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,050
Little things.

212
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:32,930
You don't understand.

213
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,970
You're a bachelor,

214
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,130
you wouldn't know such things.

215
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,370
How dare you mock at me, kid?

216
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,730
Don't call me a kid.

217
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,810
Enough guys.

218
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,050
I guess it's here.

219
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,170
Are you sure?

220
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,730
No. I'm not sure.

221
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,570
Excuse me, Miss.

222
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,650
Hello.

223
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,410
Are there any players staying here?

224
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,330
Players for the CTF contest.

225
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,090
Yes.

226
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,050
Who are you looking for?

227
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,090
Han Shangyan.

228
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,330
The boss of K&K. We come to visit him.

229
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:55,730
Yes.

230
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,490
Does he owe you money?

231
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,530
Of course not.  -No, no.

232
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,290
You misunderstand us.

233
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,570
We are his friends.  -Yes.

234
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,890
I see.

235
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,210
He's here,

236
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:03,770
I'll lead you there.

237
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,290
Thank you.

238
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,250
Okay, thank you.

239
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,610
They want to meet you.

240
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,410
Shanyan!

241
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,850
Hello, Shanyan!

242
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,610
I miss you so much.

243
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,130
How did you get here?

244
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,450
Appledog called us,

245
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,730
we had to come.

246
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,810
I took time off

247
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,090
just to see your contest.

248
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,560
Come on in, please.  -Okay, thanks.

249
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,610
Hello.

250
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,570
Let me introduce.

251
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,690
My former team members,

252
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,570
Xiaoyou and Yiqian.

253
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,570
I'm Yiqian.

254
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,650
No, no, we were just substitutes.

255
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,650
The substitutes of team Solo.

256
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,730
We never played in the competition.

257
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,490
Still counts.

258
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,130
Hello, I am 97.

259
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:36,970
I'm Grunt.

260
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,810
I'm Demo.

261
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,250
I'm One.

262
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,250
I know, you are celebrities.

263
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,730
I've heard a lot about you.

264
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,850
We are flattered.

265
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,330
Come on, have a seat.

266
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:44,810
Okay.

267
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,610
Boss,

268
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,930
then we'll go back and get ready.

269
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,570
Don't be nervous.

270
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,170
Last minute practice won't do you any good.

271
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,730
Your task today is to have a good night's sleep.

272
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,730
Okay.

273
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,040
Game on.  -Bye. Bye Tong Nian.

274
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,570
Bye boss.  -Bye Tong Nian.

275
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,970
Then, I'll leave too.

276
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,090
Just sit over there.

277
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,090
Hello.

278
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,810
Nice to meet you.

279
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,530
Hello.

280
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,090
Hello. Hello.

281
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,490
Sit down.

282
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,570
When did you arrive?

283
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,450
I didn't expect to see you.

284
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,650
We wanted to surprise you.

285
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,410
We arrived in the afternoon,

286
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,690
not much earlier than you.

287
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:16,970
I told my colleagues that

288
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,170
I came to watch the contest.

289
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,880
Those goons insisted on

290
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,010
asking me about my past.

291
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,930
When I mentioned team Solo,

292
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,250
they were practically stunned.

293
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,250
You were just a substitute.

294
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,650
Why does that matter?

295
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,410
I was still a player right?

296
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,430
How many could be Shangyan's sub player?

297
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,570
How many could do that?

298
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,640
It's weird hearing you say that.

299
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,610
What impression did I leave you guys?

300
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,170
Did I ever beat you or abuse you?

301
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,410
If I'm being honest,

302
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,170
it was mental torture.

303
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,080
Right.

304
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,330
How is your temper these days, Shangyan?

305
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,210
Nowadays, young kids are very sensitive.

306
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,890
No one can stand your hot temper.

307
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,250
Why should I change?

308
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,290
They have to stand it,

309
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,210
or they can quit.

310
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,330
You haven't changed at all.

311
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,290
Your girl will have to knock that out of you.

312
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,330
Get him, Tong Nian.

313
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,850
You eavesdropping again?

314
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,930
Stop spying on us.

315
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,650
Here, have some fruit.

316
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,250
No, thank you.

317
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,130
Xiaomi.

318
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,370
You're back.

319
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,970
What's up, got your encouragement?

320
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,930
Not for encouragement.

321
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,210
We went there for passion, got it?

322
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,170
Passion?

323
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,770
All right. Come on, sit down.

324
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,210
Captain, you are earlier today.

325
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:22,850
That's rare.

326
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,250
Come on, check it out.

327
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,050
Our old rival SP.

328
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,290
While we are familiar to them,

329
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,330
as your coach,

330
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,370
I have to fulfill my duty.

331
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,540
Let's go through this one last time.

332
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,370
Thank you, Xiaomi.

333
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,650
Let's get started.

334
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,010
Okay.

335
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,760
SP's captain Hua Ti.
= Name: Hua Ti, Position: Main attacker =

336
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,770
He started his career

337
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,090
as a CTF player at your age.

338
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,850
12 years ago, as a captain,

339
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,290
he led his team to win the Asian Championships.

340
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,570
He's good at detecting bugs,

341
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,320
he finds a bunch of them every game.

342
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,130
He broke up with his girlfriend recently.

343
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,250
Will this influence his performance?

344
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,490
I guess.

345
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,370
He's in bad mood I guess.

346
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,010
Take it easy.

347
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,170
I'm your silver bullet,

348
00:14:59,170 --> 00:14:59,930
I'll get rid of him.

349
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,450
No problem.

350
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,530
No problem? Great.

351
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,010
Focus, focus, focus.

352
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,710
Okay, next, Ou Qiang.

353
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,200
Team Solo's former player.
= Name: All, Position: Sub-attacker =

354
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,980
Ten years ago,

355
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,050
he won the national CTF championship.

356
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,410
He was a captain as well.

357
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,690
I'm scared of him.

358
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,090
He's as fierce like a lion.

359
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,930
Be more confident.

360
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,250
You've got to play your best.  -We can make it.

361
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,850
Take care of him okay?

362
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,090
I'll try.

363
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,170
Alright.

364
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,170
Next one.

365
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,210
Inin.

366
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,960
We are familiar with him.
= Name: Inin, Position: Planner =

367
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,510
He went with us to Norway for the individual games.

368
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,170
But I have to remind you this,

369
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,570
before he joined SP,

370
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,090
he was also a captain of another team.

371
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,610
Okay.

372
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,930
He has very good patience.

373
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,090
You guys hear that?

374
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,090
Even Wu Bai praised him.

375
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,420
Okay, I won't say much about the other two.

376
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,730
They were once captains too.

377
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,960
But I want to highlight one thing.

378
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,350
The captain of SP's team two,

379
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,810
the one who replaced me.

380
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,070
= Name: Bug, Position: Sub-defender =

381
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,290
Xiaomi, don't worry.

382
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,370
I will avenge you.

383
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,810
The captain of SP and Ou Qiang

384
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,610
are going to retire soon.

385
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,610
So this is their last chance to win.

386
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,610
They won't miss this chance.

387
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,210
Whether it's our first game,

388
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,530
or the last game,

389
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,330
we should always be

390
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,290
playing at our very best.

391
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,090
Well said!

392
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,370
Good luck.

393
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:21,770
Okay.

394
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,610
Okay, see you tomorrow.

395
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,490
Okay, we are leaving.

396
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,490
-Bye.  -Bye.

397
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,050
Bye.

398
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,890
Gun,

399
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,790
your dearest Squid is too tired to wait for you.

400
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,970
I know tomorrow is a big day.

401
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,290
But I believe,

402
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,650
you are the best!

403
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,690
What time did you set your alarm?

404
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,450
It's so early.

405
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,690
7 a.m.

406
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,410
The game is in the afternoon,

407
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,490
why did you set an alarm?

408
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,330
Go back to sleep.

409
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,690
No, I can't.

410
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,290
Why are you blushing?

411
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,090
No, I'm not.

412
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,970
I'm really not.

413
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,370
You are chuckling to yourself right?

414
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,770
You took advantage of me again.

415
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,290
No, I didn't.

416
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,170
I fell asleep last night,

417
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,490
why didn't you wake me up?

418
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,890
I did.

419
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,170
But you held my waist so tightly

420
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,450
and wouldn't let me go.

421
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:38,810
Me?

422
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,890
You lied.

423
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,930
You must be lying. Han Shangyan!

424
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,010
Why didn't you wake me up?

425
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,410
Stop it.

426
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,210
Why didn't you wake me up?

427
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:48,850
Why?

428
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,290
Don't worry.

429
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,730
I will be yours,

430
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,970
sooner or later.

431
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,290
You are

432
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,330
the only one for me.

433
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,810
What,

434
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,370
what did you say?

435
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,850
I said,

436
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,730
you are the only one who dares to wake me up.

437
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,370
Who else would dares to

438
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,610
except you.

439
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,130
I won't set an alarm in the future.

440
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,210
Go back to sleep.

441
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,650
Han Shangyan.

442
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,250
No talking.

443
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,130
Sleep.

444
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,370
I went to bed at 3 a.m.

445
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:07,770
Don't move.

446
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,650
I want to lay with you a bit longer.

447
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,010
When we live together in the future,

448
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,450
I will be the one who sets the alarm,

449
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,490
not you.

in the land of tenderness?

461
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,250
Coach, call him.

I'm not that crazy. You can try.

One minute left. Be patient.

Just one minute left.

There he is.

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,170

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:27,970

What a surprise.

477
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,800
This is the first time you've sent

478
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,950
a K&K's uniform to a girl.

479
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,570
Except for Mrs. Zhou and Su Cheng...

480
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,450
This is the first girl.

481
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,690
Wearing the same uniform means

482
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,050
Tong Nian has become one of us.

483
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,530
It's an announcement to the world

484
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,370
that Tong Nian is the boss's girl.

485
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,880
Well, if that's the case,

486
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,810
Tong Nian, here,

487
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,050
forefinger out.

488
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,710
I'll show you our special team chant.

489
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,450
You scared me.

490
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,210
Tong Nian, got it?

491
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,770
Let's try it once more.

492
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,010
Let's go.

493
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,850
Let's go. Let's go.

494
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:45,610
Come on.

495
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,370
= Beijing, National Finals =

496
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,090
You guys ready?

497
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,450
Ready enough to beat you.

498
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,210
Oh god, Xiaomi,

499
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,410
you only just joined K&K ,

500
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,370
and now you're totally on their side.

501
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,450
He's my boss, right?

502
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,530
Good luck to you.

503
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,370
Good luck to you too.

504
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,490
Let's wait and see.

505
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,410
Let's wait and see.

506
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,370
Do you remember,

507
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,330
this is the stadium

508
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,630
where we won the championship years ago.

509
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,570
What a coincidence.

510
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,650
We are now the national champions.

511
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,370
It's okay for Solo to fall apart.

512
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,410
It's all my fault.

513
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,930
But you are the MVP,

514
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,450
you can establish a team,

515
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,530
you can name your own team,

516
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,850
you can be a leader.

517
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,850
You have a promising future.

518
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,400
But you can't say you are going to retire, okay?

519
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,410
Yes.

520
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,890
Well, that's enough of that.

521
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,330
Today is my first day as a commentator,

522
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,610
I'm going to fix my make-up.

523
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,210
Now remember,

524
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,010
since it's your first time,

525
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,570
unbutton more buttons,

526
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,310
then no one will notice your mistakes.

527
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,380
Piss off.

528
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,370
Ai Qing.

529
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,130
Come on, it's time.

530
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,930
I'm going to appear on stage,

531
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,770
so I need to dress up carefully.

532
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,890
You are beautiful already,

533
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,010
no need to do anything more.

534
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,210
What color is your lipstick?

535
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:41,970
Magenta.

536
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,930
Isn't it suitable for me?

537
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,610
I'll buy you one as a gift.

538
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,690
Don't bribe me.

539
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,690
I hope the color

540
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,810
will bring me good luck.

541
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,370
You'd better wait outside,

542
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,690
this is the lady's bathroom.

543
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,370
Then hurry up, okay?

544
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,410
-I'm leaving.  -Okay.

545
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,130
Quickly now.

546
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,050
Coming.

547
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:10,770
Miss Ai.

548
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:12,290
Hello.

549
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,370
Nice to meet you, Miss Ai.

550
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,810
It's a pleasure to work with you.

551
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,170
No, no. It's my honor.

552
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:17,930
You see,

553
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,690
it's because of you,

554
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,650
that I joined this circle,

555
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,570
and ended up making it this far.

556
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,490
Thanks.

557
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,130
Thank you.

558
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,710
Miss Ai, you look gorgeous today,

559
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,370
and very attractive.

560
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,450
Yes?

561
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,240
Could you tell me the reason?

562
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,250
A lady's secret weapon.

563
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,850
What's this?

564
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,330
Lipstick. You don't know?

565
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,600
Can I get a girlfriend with this?

566
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,730
Of course.

567
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,050
Xiaomai, keep it cool alright?

568
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,210
Even if you are sitting beside Miss Ai,

569
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,290
you gotta stay cool.

570
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,530
She's your senior,

571
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,890
stop blushing, alright?

572
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,930
Alright, I got it.

573
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,610
Come on guys,

574
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,250
don't call me a senior.

575
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,970
He's much older than me okay?

576
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,730
I'm not old enough to be your senior.

577
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,930
Okay, you are our goddess.

578
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,050
If you are ready,

579
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,210
I'll let the players enter.

580
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,490
-Okay.  -Okay.

581
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,890
Relax guys.

582
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,210
Whether we win first place or second place,

583
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,210
we will be in the international games

584
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,290
on behalf of China.

585
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,290
A qualified boss should

586
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,530
encourage us to win the championship.

587
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,370
You are the best,

588
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,810
that's all I can really say.

589
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,810
Enjoy every single moment

590
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,250
in your professional career.

591
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,010
Because for you,

592
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,650
each contest is a countdown.

593
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,530
Every moment counts.

594
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,370
You know,

595
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,810
I retired three times.

596
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,010
I came back this time

597
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,970
in order to fight one last time.

598
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,090
Boys,

599
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,370
thank you.

600
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,130
Captain, captain,

601
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,690
you can cry after we win okay?

602
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,210
Don't worry, Captain.

603
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,690
We will win the championship for you.

604
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,650
-Yes.  -Yes.

605
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,290
Alright then.

606
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,050
-Guys.  -Come on, game on.

607
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,730
For the championship!

608
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,850
SP!

609
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,370
Boss.

610
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,570
You will win, or die trying.

611
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,250
Don't add pressure on them,

612
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,410
why haven't you changed at all?

613
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,970
You are a cold-blooded and merciless boss.

614
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,930
Go look yourself,

615
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:45,770
in the current society,

616
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,970
everyone's under a lot of pressure.

617
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,570
This is their career,

618
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,570
their profession.

619
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,970
I've already said what I needed to last night.

620
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,610
Go and win this

621
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,090
for your own sake.

622
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:55,810
Yes, sir.

623
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,490
Looks like Demo is the most confident,

624
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,410
can't wait to see your performance.

625
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,090
No, no, no, captain.

626
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,050
Hold on tight man.

627
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:10,490
Hold on!

628
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,170
Come on. Game on.

629
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,690
Be careful.

630
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,490
I get it.

631
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,770
Dear friends and esteemed viewers,

632
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,050
the CTF finals of China

633
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,450
will begin in seconds.

634
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,090
Good luck.

635
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,370
Good luck.

636
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,570
Good luck.

637
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,010
Shangyan, good luck.

638
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:45,930
Shangyan, good luck.

639
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:47,490
Tong Nian.

640
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:48,610
Hi, Tong Nian.

641
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,770
Everyone's here.

642
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,890
Now entering is team SP.

643
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,450
1, 2, 3...

644
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,850
SP!

645
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,570
Next, please welcome, the boys form K&K.

646
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,050
K&K.  -K&K.

647
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,050
K&K.

648
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:24,570
Come on.

649
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,570
-Good.  -Good

650
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,290
Come on.

651
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,730
A round of applauds for the host today,

652
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,650
Xiaomai.

653
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,970
Ladies and gentlemen,

654
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:42,690
good afternoon.

655
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,690
Welcome to the one and only CTF China finals.

656
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,910
Now allow me to introduce you my partner today,

657
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,690
Appledog.

658
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,610
She is the hottest new anchor,

659
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,690
and also the coach of SP.

660
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,640
I believe you are quite familiar with

661
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,010
the players from both teams.

662
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,090
Before the start of finals,

663
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,730
CTF launched an official vote.

664
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,130
What's the detail of that vote?

665
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,970
What about the rankings now?

666
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:15,810
Please look at the screen.

667
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,490
For the CTF China All-star exhibition game,

668
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,410
who do you expect to see?

669
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,810
I believe you are very familiar to these names up here.

670
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,210
= Most Expected Players =

671
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,770
The list includes

672
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,050
all leading players of team Solo

673
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,410
from years ago.

674
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,490
The votes have crossed

675
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,730
the one million mark

676
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,410
and are still raising.

677
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,690
As the top team of CTF years ago,

678
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,420
team Solo has left an unforgettable mark

679
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,210
in everyone's memory.

680
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,610
Their five players have surpassed

681
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,050
all the new champions,

682
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,830
and even surpassed the most popular player Wu Bai.

683
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,420
Do you want to see them in competition again?

684
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,170
Yes.

685
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,330
Thank you.

686
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,970
Thank you for remembering us.

687
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,090
Let's make a long story short,

688
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,730
and get back to the CTF China finals now.

689
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,690
We'll offer five minutes for the players to warm up.

690
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,250
Please look at the screen.

691
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,890
The countdown is about to begin,

692
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,490
let's wait and see.

693
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,090
This way.

694
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:29,650
Please.

695
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,170
I need some air.

696
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,650
Why did Shangyan leave?

697
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,410
I don't know.

698
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,930
Go with him.

699
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,850
Tell me, will you compete in the game?

700
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,890
You have announced it to the public,

701
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,170
how could I say no?

702
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,530
But always being remembered by the fans

703
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,930
is a wonderful thing.

704
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,730
That's my bro.

705
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,050
I'll go talk to Han Shangyan.

706
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,450
Thank you.

707
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,600
Why do I feel like you're a little bit nervous?

708
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,570
Well,

709
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,710
you appear on many of our desktop wallpapers,

710
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,010
and you're the best Chinese female Geek,

711
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,330
are you nervous for an exhibition game?

712
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,690
It was so sudden.

713
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,410
You didn't tell me in advance.

714
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,410
I almost cried out just now.

715
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,530
They asked me to do this on purpose

716
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,490
to give you a surprise.

717
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,650
Don't worry.

718
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,090
Till our dying breath.

719
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,970
K&K will win.

720
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,810
Demo, calm down.

721
00:32:59,210 --> 00:32:59,850
Game on.

722
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:00,970
-Game on.  -Game on.

723
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,810
How are you feeling?

724
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,850
Never better.

725
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,450
No problem.

726
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,730
We are the champions.

727
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,730
Captain, let's go eat hotpot

728
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,250
after winning the championship.

729
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,690
As you wish.

730
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,410
Okay.

731
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,290
Victory.

732
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:13,810
Victory.

733
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,050
Game on.

734
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:15,890
Game on. Game on.

735
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,730
You really didn't know in advance?

736
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,770
Surprise!

737
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,290
What a hit.

738
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,410
What a scene.

739
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,170
You're a grown-up,

740
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,410
stop playing such games.

741
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,410
I didn't play any games here.

742
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,210
The fans really voted.

743
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,050
Soon it will go public.

744
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,890
You're going to be in that game.

745
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,410
You really think I'm afraid of you?

746
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,970
Shangyan, come on,

747
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,690
I want to watch you play,

748
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,450
everyone wants to watch you play.

749
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,650
Just fulfill our dream.

750
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,170
And your dream.

751
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,290
Shangyan,

752
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,050
please.

753
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,090
Please.

754
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,570
If you stay quiet,

755
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,810
I'll take it as a yes.

756
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,130
See you later.

757
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,090
What are you laughing at?

758
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,280
Stop pretending to be so cool.

759
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,370
Try it all you want,

760
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,330
I'm not afraid of you.

761
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,620
Do you know how much I envy Yaya?

762
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,050
I want to watch you play too.

763
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,260
Didn't I play for you when we were in Sanya?

764
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,610
That's different.

765
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,890
This is a real competition.

766
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,690
The same place where you won years ago.

767
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,240
I'm old.

768
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,130
Not at all,

769
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,680
you're in the prime of your youth.

770
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,410
Just the right age.

771
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,490
That concludes the warm up.

772
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,650
It'll start.

773
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,850
Let's get in.

774
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,210
Come on, come on.

775
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:57,570
Come on!

776
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,490
Come on!

777
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,330
To watch the game.

778
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,730
Come on.

779
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,490
Come on.

780
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,050
Okay. Here we go.

781
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,130
Countdown.

782
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,530
9,

783
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,290
8,

784
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,010
7,

785
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:12,930
6,

786
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,690
5,

787
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,490
4,

788
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,330
3,

789
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:19,930
2,

790
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:21,690
1.

791
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,090
Start!

792
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,370
The winners are...

793
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,290
team SP!

794
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,130
The crack force, SP.

795
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,250
Congrats.

796
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,290
You are great too.

797
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,570
He's still not here?

798
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,130
Coming.

799
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,170
You are so late.

800
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,730
Welcome.

801
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,450
Welcome.

802
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,130
1, 2, 3.

803
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,970
Welcome.

804
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,370
Don't stand here.

805
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,050
Let's go inside.

806
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:23,490
Come on.

807
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,290
Help yourself.

808
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:24,730
Come on.

809
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,010
Sit here.

810
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,570
I see that

811
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,410
someone brought his girlfriend.

812
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,370
Shangyan, I've got a son already,

813
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,810
but I don't show it off like you.

814
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:36,410
Yes.

815
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,860
You finally found someone to love,

816
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,730
but do you have to bring her everywhere?

817
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,810
That's enough.

818
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,850
Don't mind these hooligans.

819
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,370
Mind your words.

820
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,250
We are not hooligans.

821
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,770
Everyone here

822
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,530
is concerned about your relationship

823
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,610
so so so much.

824
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,330
Come on. Let it go,

825
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,490
show some class for Solo.

826
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,410
Yes. Come on, eat.

827
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,290
Ou Qiang, come on.

828
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:01,930
Fill your cup with beers.

829
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,650
Captain, I think I'll pass on the beer.

830
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,210
There are bubbles,

831
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,210
I don't want to burp in competition.

832
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,480
Did you hear that?

833
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,720
You are the only one who's still in the game.

834
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,410
Come on, Mr. Ou,

835
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,250
let me massage you.

836
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,010
Massage. Massage.

837
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,050
On the back.

838
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,410
I'll use my hands, like this.

839
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,450
It hurts, it hurts.

840
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,850
Xiaomi, not so hard.

841
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:19,850
Oh yeah,

842
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,770
who are our opponents?

843
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,610
I didn't pay attention to the voting results.

844
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,370
There's nothing to it.

845
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,290
The top five players on the ranking

846
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,490
will be our opponents.

847
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,490
See, it has been so many years,

848
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,250
yet you guys are still the top five.

849
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,250
The ranking is not important.

850
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,090
Guys,

851
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,890
tonight, 9 o'clock,

852
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,570
we will face

853
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,960
the top five players in active service.

854
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,370
Our last battle, go all out!

855
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,850
Go all out!

856
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,770
For the last battle!

857
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:52,450
Come on.

858
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,610
-Cheers.  -Cheers.

859
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,010
Dig in!

860
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:13,220
♪ So many times I wish I could leave ♪

861
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,130
Shangyan,

862
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,170
have you noticed that this lane

863
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,650
has changed a lot?

864
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,050
Yes.

865
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,170
Remember ten years ago,

866
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,510
we had a good fight here?

867
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,420
Don't remind me of that.

868
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,370
That's wasn't a fight.

869
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,250
You kicked the crap out of me like I was a sandbag.

870
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,530
I miss it so much.

871
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,010
Miss what?

872
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,610
The days of being beaten by me?

873
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,930
Shut your mouth.

874
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,210
What I miss is

875
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,210
the happy days when we were

876
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,650
living in this lane.

877
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,770
I got drunk last night,

878
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,170
so I didn't get the chance to say this.

879
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,050
An ordinary fellow like you

880
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,090
running SP in China is amazing.

881
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,090
It's remarkable.

882
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,690
You are my idol.

883
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,620
It is not easy.

884
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,330
You are not bad yourself.

885
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,090
K&K is among the top national top teams.

886
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,530
It's hard, right?

887
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:19,730
Not bad.

888
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,850
But I gave Nan Wei a lot of trouble,

889
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,090
he has suffered a lot because of me.

890
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,530
Treat Su Cheng's husband kindly.

891
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,010
Because she once was your girl?

892
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,090
Of course.

893
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,170
Is Shangyan kind to you?

894
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,170
Yes, he is.

895
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,250
Really?

896
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:45,810
Really.

897
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,770
Come on.

898
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,490
You all get your lovers.

899
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,130
Try to understand my feelings.

900
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,330
Why are you smiling?

901
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,650
You are the worst buddy,

902
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,370
there's no doubt.

903
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,410
You know what?

904
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,570
One of Xiaomi's fans

905
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,410
is so beautiful.

906
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,770
She has a huge crush on Xiaomi.

907
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,890
Enjoy yourself.

908
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,290
Xiaomi, where are you going?

909
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,530
Where are you going?

910
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,310
I wonder why the girl likes Xiaomi.

911
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,650
What a relief to other girls.

912
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,610
She's my roommate,

913
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,770
she's really into Xiaomi.

914
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:30,850
Really?

915
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,090
Don't worry about others.

916
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,170
You should hurry up.

917
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,650
There's no need to be hurry,

918
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,330
I'm so handsome.

919
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,810
Mrs. Han, a toast to you.

920
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,930
Don't call me that,

921
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,130
just call me Tong Nian.

922
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,490
How did you and Han Shangyan met each other?

923
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,610
Am I his first girlfriend or something?

924
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,460
Why is everyone asking me this question?

925
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,090
You got that right.

926
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,090
The impact force of he's love affair

927
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,170
is the same as an earthquake.

928
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:57,810
Yes.

929
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,480
You boys are just terrible, it's not fair.

930
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,660
Why do you keep asking her this question?

931
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,290
If you have guts,

932
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,610
go ask Han Shangyan.

933
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,410
I will...

934
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,010
Go ahead.

935
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,130
No, I wouldn't dare.

936
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,290
I'm over thirty,

937
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,490
I don't want to be humiliated.

938
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,770
Honestly,

939
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,530
after all these years,

940
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,070
we feel the most sorry for Shangyan and Solo.

941
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,850
When team Solo fell apart that year,

942
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,690
and everyone left.

943
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,290
So we care about him the most,

944
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,330
please don't let it upset you.

945
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,050
I won't.

946
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:30,650
Yes.

947
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,290
We were too young then.

948
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,530
Yes.

949
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,410
Solo and Shangyan,

950
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,410
to be honest,

951
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,530
if it were not for Solo,

952
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,250
no one sitting here,

953
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,490
including Shangyan,

954
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,170
would come from all over the country

955
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,730
to form that team.

956
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,410
If it were not for Han Shangyan,

957
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,260
we would not have money for food,

958
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,650
nor kept the team running.

959
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,100
I knew they would reconcile.

960
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,890
Everyone used to be young

961
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,370
and impulsive.

962
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,050
When we calm down,

963
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,570
we are still friends.

964
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,570
Look at them.

965
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,770
That's a long story full of tears.

966
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,370
Come on.

967
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:24,690
Cheers.

968
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:25,650
Come on.

969
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,690
I'm about to go and compete.

970
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,450
We are expecting you all,

971
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,890
we are watching the network broadcast,

972
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,210
everyone's so excited.

973
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,210
Have you got the face masks?

974
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,250
Yes. I'm unpacking them.

975
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:46,930
A friend sent me two boxes.

976
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,610
So many face masks.

977
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,130
But 97 and other kids

978
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,210
stole one box when I wasn't looking.

979
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,780
So I kept this box just for you.

980
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,770
Why don't you keep them for yourself?

981
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,850
I'm a man,

982
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,250
I don't need them.

983
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,370
When I got these,

984
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:18,690
you were the first person on my mind.

985
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:19,650
I don't know why.

986
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,850
Do you know why?

987
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:22,970
Why are you so quiet?

988
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:25,770
I'm not.

989
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,530
I'm reading your note.

990
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,010
Your handwriting is so good.

991
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,530
Really?

992
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,570
You flattered me.

993
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,090
Have you had your meal?

994
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:41,010
They are still eating upstairs.

995
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,210
I'm so full.  -They are coming.

996
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:44,930
Yes.

997
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,530
You've talked so long.

998
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,890
What if your phone explodes?

999
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,250
I have to hang up now, we are leaving.

1000
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,170
Okay. Bye, my idol.

1001
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,380
Don't let your fans down.

1002
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,730
Game on!

1003
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,130
He's so cute.

1004
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,010
Sending face masks to bare his heart.

1005
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,850
This is so unique.

1006
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,770
