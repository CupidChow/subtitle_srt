Tong Nian, here.

27

What is it?

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
I made this for you.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,120
Thanks, dad.

30
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:51,910
Eat up.

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,970
Try it.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,410
Is it good?

33
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,440
Yeah, really good.

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,740
Honey.

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,990
The competition you took part in

36
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,320
last year...

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,840
It's called ACM-ICPC right?

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,170
Your team leader, is he

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,240
called Zheng Hui?

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,320
Yeah. What's up?

41
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,320
He's almost finished his masters right?

42
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,110
Going for a PhD actually.

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,190
You don't say.

44
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,360
That's impressive.

45
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,950
If you have some free time,

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,360
invite your teammates over to hang out.

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,280
Okay.

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,740
How about tomorrow?

49
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,110
Tomorrow?

50
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,700
But it's Spring Festival tomorrow.

51
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,020
It's not appropriate to invite them over.

52
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,620
You're right.

53
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,990
Next semester.

54
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,900
Okay. Okay.

55
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,200
Stealing food?

56
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,900
You're so busted.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,320
Boss, it's a midnight snack.

58
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,450
I cooked a lot.

59
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,490
Do you want some?

60
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,320
I was going to send some to Wu Bai.

61
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,070
New Year snack?

62
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,110
No.

63
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,650
Wu Bai brought a lot of tasty food

64
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,490
back for me earlier.

65
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,110
This is an extra meal.

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,190
My second meal tonight.

67
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,820
You're still hungry?

68
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,860
I'm just greedy for food.

69
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,820
Where's grandpa?

70
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,070
He went to bed

71
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,190
right after Wu Bai brought him back home.

72
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,360
He was in a pretty good mood.

73
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,110
Come up after you finish.

74
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm gonna test your APM.

75
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,110
Are you serious?

76
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,740
It's New Year's Eve.

77
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,650
It's bad enough I didn't make it to the reunion dinner.

78
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,030
Now you want to test my APM?

79
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,200
I'd reward you handsomely if you beat me.

80
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,490
How is that possible?

81
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,280
Who could beat you?

82
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,070
It's a long shot even for Wu Bai.

83
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,570
There's no way I could do that.

84
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,650
Say that again.

85
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,450
I... I'll go. I'm going now.

86
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,490
I'll take the test.

87
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,990
I wonder what he is doing now.

88
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,740
Should I message him again?

89
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,220
Why hasn't he responded to my messages?

90
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,150
Look at the result.

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,450
If I were you,

92
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,110
I'd be too ashamed to enjoy the holiday.

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,320
That's from Tong Nian, right?

94
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,820
Shut up.

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,990
Nice To Meet You Cafe wishes you

96
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,530
a happy New Year.

98
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,700
and watching our program,

99
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,650
are you ready for this?

100
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,820
Are you ready?

101
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,820

102
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,780

115
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,280

"Happy New Year".

117
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,820

you'll be in good health

127
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,200
Let me go.

128
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,030
You...

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,950
Happy New Year!

130
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,950
Happy New Year!

131
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,570
Go back and practice.

132
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,280
No rest for you until you reach 150.

133
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,320
Don't do this to me.

134
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,610
Go on.

135
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,190
It's Spring Festival.

136
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,950

Han Shangyan, get up. Get up!

141
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,110
It's seven o'clock.

142
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,280
Stop laying around all day!

143
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,990
Get up now!

144
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,450
I heard you.

145
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,530
Wu Bai is out for a jog.

146
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,030
Get up now!

147
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,740
Why did you lock your door?

148
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,570
Have you gotten up?

149
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,570
I have.

150
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,240
Han Shangyan, are you up?

151
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

152
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,030
You... You...

153
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,860
Why don't I hear any movement?

154
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,860
Are you up or not?

155
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,780
Open the door.

156
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,700
Get up! Get up!

157
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,950
Why are you up?

158
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,610
Why on earth are you jogging

159
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,610
On New Years day?

160
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,490
You're bored?

161
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,200
I like it.

162
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,900
I'm busy all year round.

163
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,320
Now is the only time

164
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,490
I can get some decent rest.

165
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,150
But you ruined it.

166
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,700
Come back.

167
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,360
Please run one more lap.

168
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,780
Why?

169
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,200
The longer you run,

170
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,400
the longer I can stay

171
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,200
outside the house.

172
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,860
Okay. Keep me company then.

173
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,490
Come on.

174
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,570
Thanks for the bike.

175
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,490
I'll give it back to you.

176
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,990
Dai Feng, you're up.

177
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,070
Morning, grandpa.

178
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,700
Come. Come here. Sit down.

179
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,450
Grandpa.

180
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,280
You like the Gala Evening this much?

181
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,110
You've been watching since you got up.

182
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,320
You don't understand.

183
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,400
Old people like this kind of thing.

184
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,700
It's Spring Festival.

185
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,650
Of course we'd watch the Gala.

186
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,740
Look. They're so happy.

187
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,110
Indeed.

188
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,320
Here. Try the tea I made.

189
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,320
Thank you, grandpa.

190
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,970
Is it good?

191
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,610
It's really good.

192
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,990
It tastes a little sweet.

193
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,190
Yeah, you're right.

194
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,490
There are rules when it comes to making tea.

195
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,110
What rules?

196
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,360
I don't understand.

197
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,610
Have you heard of the Tea Sage?

198
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,610
That's Lu Yu, right?

199
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,490
Good.

200
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,900
I know he once said that:

201
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,030
"Mountain spring is the best, river water comes next,

202
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,625
well water is the worst."

203
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:36,320
Am I right?

204
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,150
Yes, you're right.

205
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,280
The choice of tea is important.

206
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,780
Water also plays a major role.

207
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,990
I get it.

208
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,240
Good water makes good tea.

209
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,530
Boss, you're back.

210
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,860
Just finished running

211
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,490
and now you're off to bed again?

212
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,400
Are you really that tired?

213
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,650
Grandpa, don't be mad.

214
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
Here, have some more tea.

215
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,990
Okay, okay okay.  -Have some more.

216
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,150
Thank you.

217
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,030
Did you buy groceries?

218
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,990
No.

219
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,740
Grandpa told me yesterday

220
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,990
not to cook today.

221
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,110
What's your plan this time?

222
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,610
It's Spring Festival today.

223
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,240
I would like my granddaughter-in-law

224
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,860
to come here and make dumplings for me.

225
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,650
Do you have a granddaughter-in-law?

226
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,070
You have a girlfriend?

227
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,570
Not me.

228
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,110
That's enough.

229
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,740
Don't try to play dumb here.

230
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,400
I picked up on something last night.

231
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,070
You didn't care enough

232
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,240
about that girl from the Tong family.

233
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,900
I'm giving you an excuse now

234
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,990
to invite her over today.

235
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,400
Dai Feng, come with me.

236
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,240
You cook lunch. I'll cook dinner.

237
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,190
Hey. Who's going to pick up Tong Nian then?

238
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,320
I'll go pick her up.

239
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,280
Grandpa, I'll go then.

240
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,240
Go get changed first.

241
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,780
You just sweat in those clothes.

242
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,240
It's fine.

243
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,490
You...

244
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,610
Boss.

245
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,410
Are you afraid to meet your parents-in-laws?

246
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,070
It's been ten minutes.

247
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,480
I didn't do anything wrong.

248
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,490
I have nothing to be afraid of.

249
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,070
Follow me.

250
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,610
Boss. Boss.

251
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,280
It's not good to visit someone

252
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,610
on Spring Festival without gifts.

253
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,240
Aren't you gonna buy something?

254
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,780
Buy what?

255
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,320
Some typical purchases during the holiday.

256
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,780
Like peanuts, melon seeds,

257
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,740
snacks and so on.

258
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,450
Does Tong Nian have any younger siblings?

259
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,150
You could buy snacks for them.

260
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,450
If not that then

261
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,360
buy some useful groceries.

262
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,780
Go to the seafood market

263
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,030
and purchase some fish and shrimp.

264
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,030
That's better than not having anything.

265
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,320
That's what my mom did during holidays.

266
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,700
Besides, I don't think it's appropriate

267
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,860
to follow you in there.

268
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,240
Wait in the car.

269
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,020
Okay.

270
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,740
This tastes sweet.

271
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,700
Do you want one?

272
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:30,990
It's got good texture.

273
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,700
Do you want some mangoes?

274
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,900
It's from Japan.

275
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,900
Very sweet.

276
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,570
Do you want one?

277
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,650
It'll bring good luck

278
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,700
if you buy oranges on Spring Festival.

279
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,150
I'll take everything.

280
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,360
-As long as it looks good.  -Okay.

281
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,900
Would you like a gift box?

282
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,200
-I can wrap them up for you.  -OK.

283
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,360
Young man, you're visiting relatives?

284
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,240
You visiting family

285
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,780
or getting a bank loan?

286
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,360
Wearing all black.

287
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,070
Coming.

288
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,190
Who is it?

289
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,150
Who is it?

290
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,400
Han Shangyan?

291
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,700
Mrs. Tong.

292
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,320
I came to wish you a happy New Year.

293
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,190
Oh. Come in.

294
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,360
Who is it?

295
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,950
I'll go this way.

296
00:13:59,070 --> 00:13:59,780
Right.

297
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,950
I'll go...

298
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,610
What's wrong with you?

299
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,740
Who's here?

300
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,740
Who is this?

301
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,450
Han Shangyan?

302
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,190
What brings you here?

303
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,190
Hello everyone.

304
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,990
We just had dinner yesterday.

305
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,450
You don't need to come visit us today.

306
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,700
My grandpa likes Tong Nian very much.

307
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,190
He wanted me...

308
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,700
to come and invite her over for dinner.

309
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,780
Does Tong Nian know this?

310
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,280
No.

311
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,740
Come here, Shangyan.

312
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,530
Those must be heavy.

313
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,820
Put them down here.

314
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,610
Let me help you.

315
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,200
Shangyan, come here. Have a seat.

316
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,700
Sit down.

317
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,200
Go tell Tong Nian.

318
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,190
Hurry up.

319
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
You came all the way here.

320
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,570
You don't need to bring us fruit.

321
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,820
Just come visit us.

322
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,200
Shangyan.

323
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,650
Why don't you sit here for a bit?

324
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,360
I'll go upstairs

325
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,860
and ask Tong Nian to come down, okay?

326
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,780
That fruit basket looks familiar, right?

327
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,570
Of course.

328
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,650
He got the fruit

329
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,030
at the store right outside.

330
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,880
It seems that this man

331
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,240
doesn't cherish Tong Nian that much.

332
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,360
Tong Nian is such a sweet girl.

333
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,900
I'm sure he'd hurt her feelings.

334
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,860
Look. He's a grown man,

335
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,070
yet he's still playing games.

336
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,820
Aren't you two playing games as well?

337
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,620
You...

338
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,070
He's so rude.

339
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,360
Forget him.

340
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,360
I'll go this way.

341
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,990
Han Shangyan is here?

342
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,610
Yes.

343
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,110
Saying he's come to invite you over for dinner.

344
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,760
I don't know if it's his grandpa's idea

345
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,280
or if it's his idea.

346
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,900
How do I look now? Oh no.

347
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm a total mess!

348
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,530
I gotta wash my hair.

349
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,400
Didn't you just wash it last night?

350
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,030
You don't get it.

351
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,320
Us girls are all like this.

352
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,070
Okay, okay.

353
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,600
Dad, what do you think of this jacket?

354
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,700
Do I look good in it?

355
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,610
It's good.

356
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,950
Forget it. You don't understand.

357
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,030
Dad, go out now.

358
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,500
What now?

359
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,320
I'll change my clothes.

360
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,070
I'll change clothes.

361
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,950
When you took exams, you were never once this nervous.

362
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,900
Go on. Get out now.

363
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,700
Hurry up.

364
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,360
Hi.

365
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,530
You're here.

366
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,900
Grandpa misses you.

367
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,190
If it's convenient,

368
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,150
come have dinner with me.

369
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,900
It's convenient.

370
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,490
It's... it's convenient.

371
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,400
It's fine by me.

372
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,070
Mr. and Mrs. Tong,

373
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,400
I'll take Tong Nian with me then,

374
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,450
I'll bring her back after dinner.

375
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,110
Listen up now.

376
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,360
She must be back before seven.

377
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,150
Seven?

378
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,400
Look what time it is now.

379
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,190
It's okay. It's okay.

380
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,200
There's no need to rush.

381
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,820
Go have fun. Okay?

382
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,820
Thanks, dad.

383
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,620
Bye.

384
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,450
Tong Nian!

385
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,780
Why is there someone else?

386
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,780
Hi. Tong Nian.

387
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,610
It's me.

388
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,200
Dai Feng.

389
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,820
You heard my name only once.

390
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,950
And you still remember?

391
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,490
You've got a good memory.

392
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,260
Tong Nian.

393
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,400
You should know,

394
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,990
apart from you,

395
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,570
boss has never allowed anyone else

396
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,280
to take this passenger's seat before.

397
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,780
I can tell from this

398
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,240
that you mean a lot to him.

399
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,570
Hey, you two.

400
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,320
What are you mumbling about?

401
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,780
Nothing.

402
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,780
Tong Nian, the vegetables are here.

403
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,900
What kind of dumplings will we make?

404
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,780
Pork and bok choy dumplings,

405
00:18:58,781 --> 00:18:59,450
leeks and eggs dumplings,

406
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,110
and fennel dumplings.

407
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,610
Let's stick to that. Should be fine.

408
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,900
I like this bok choy best.

409
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,530
It's called cabbage.

410
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,150
The bok choy you said is this.

411
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,820
Really?

412
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,610
Let me pick one.

413
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,150
How about this?

414
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,780
It's delicate and pretty.

415
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,190
You have an eye for vegetables.

416
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,450
I think...

417
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,950
this is the best.

418
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,700
Do you think so?

419
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,860
Are you kidding me?

420
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,190
The leaves are wrinkled.

421
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,860
And they don't have enough water.

422
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,780
Always go with the bigger ones.

423
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,200
They have more water.

424
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,200
Got it?

425
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,900
Big ones.

426
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,030
Big ones have more water

427
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,880
-You like it?  -Yeah.

428
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,070
Take it then.

429
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,110
Okay.

430
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,110
What about this?

431
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,400
Good.

432
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,950
I always see the team eating this kind.

433
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,150
I guess it's good.

434
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,950
Okay. Okay.

435
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,400
Boss.

436
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,320
Why... why didn't you ask me what I like?

437
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,110
A grown man doesn't eat snacks.

438
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,150
A grown man also needs snacks.

439
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,400
I want to have this. Could I take it?

440
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,820
I want this.

441
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,530
Take whatever you want.

442
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,820
Okay.

443
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:46,990
Come on.

444
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,200
Tong Nian, you're awesome.

445
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,540
Tong Nian,

446
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,900
has he ever yelled at you before?

447
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,360
I knew it.

448
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
You knew what?

449
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,490
I heard that

450
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,570
men who're tough on others at work

451
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,320
are actually sweet and gentle at home.

452
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,280
And those tough at home

453
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,360
are actually cowards outside.

454
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,530
I never heard that before.

455
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,990
You sure he's never yelled at you?

456
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,820
I'm sure.

457
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,740
I don't think he ever did before.

458
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,820
He's been very nice to me.

459
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,190
What are you two

460
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,820
mumbling about this time?

461
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,070
Nothing.

462
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,990
Nothing.

463
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,950
You see?

464
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,030
He treats you differently.

465
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,150
He'd yell at me if you weren't here.

466
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,110
Really?

467
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,400
Let me carry some for you.

468
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,360

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,610
Let's stop by the vegetable market.

488
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,990
Boss, we're going to vegetable market?

489
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,950
Boss.

490
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,700
There are many kinds of vegetables here.

491
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,700
Which is fennel?

492
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,650
Young man, this is fennel.

493
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,450
Sir,

494
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,990
how much is this fennel?

495
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,820
Ten yuan per catty.

496
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,900
Ten yuan?

497
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,150
The price was eight yuan before.

498
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,860
I just got it today. It's fresh.

499
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,320
It's not. It's a bit yellow.

500
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,700
Give me one catty.

501
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,900
These green peppers

502
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,610
look fresher than those in the supermarket.

503
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,820
And they're bigger as well.

504
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,030
Should we buy some?

505
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Can't you see they're all shriveled up?

506
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,030
How much?

507
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,450
Tong Nian, here.

508
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:27,990
Thank you.

509
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,240
He's so good at buying groceries.

510
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,450
It's impressive.

511
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,280
Why are you staring at me?

512
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,030
Nothing.

513
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,700
I'll eat fifty dumplings today.

514
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,780
-Fifty?  -Yeah.

515
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,700
I didn't expect you to have such a large appetite.

516
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,570
You'd eat everything up

517
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,990
before I finish cooking.

518
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,450
Well...

519
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,190
Shouldn't we....

520
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,190
start making the fillings first?

521
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,950
Don't you know dumpling wrappers

522
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,900
made by a machine don't taste good?

523
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,900
But it's more convenient.

524
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,360
Didn't we buy flour?

525
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,860
Oh, here.

526
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,780
Here is the flour.

527
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,490
What to do next?

528
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,410
-Baidu it.  -Oh.

529
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,190
You two. Get out.

530
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,780
It's okay. We can help...

531
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,220
Get out.

532
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,190
Go chat with my grandpa.

533
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,610
Hurry up.

534
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,150
We're not helping him?

535
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,700
Wu Bai.

536
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,150
He's over there.

537
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,280
We'll eat dumplings today?

538
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,450
They don't know how to make dumplings.

539
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,860
Go chop the bok choy.

540
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,320
Why not order some food?

541
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,408
We've bought the ingredients.

542
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:54,070
I can't waste food.

543
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,280
Besides, it's Spring Festival.

544
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,610
Who'd deliver food for you?

545
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,780
Enough of chit-chat. Go on.

546
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,190
What are you doing?

547
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,860
Reading its face?

548
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,280
Didn't you say you're best

549
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
at detail work?

550
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,570
How is that relevant?

551
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,780
It's harder than I imagined.

552
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,900
In the next training,

553
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,650
I'll teach you guys

554
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,740
how to cook meals.

555
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,740
Step aside.

556
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,400
Come here.

557
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,150
Grandpa. Have some fruits.

558
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,320
Thank you. Sit down.

559
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,990
Thank you so much.

560
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,280
Tong Nian.

561
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,740
There are so many ways

562
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,280
of making dumplings online.

563
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,860
What exactly should we do?

564
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,570
People without cooking skills

565
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,700
couldn't make dumplings.

566
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,070
Yes, she's right.

567
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,950
Tong Nian,

568
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,700
what do you like to do

569
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,200
when you're not studying?

570
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,190
I like singing.

571
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,360
I like to record myself singing,

572
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,900
then post it on the internet.

573
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,420
Really?

574
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,190
Yes.

575
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I love to listen to people sing!

576
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,070
What kind of music do you like?

577
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,150
I could sing it for you.

578
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,450
Do you like to listen to

579
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,360
Tsai Chin's songs or Fei Yu-Ching's?

580
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,450
No no no.

581
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,820
I like Legend of the Red Lantern.

582
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,110
It's like this...

583
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,780
♪ Grandma, listen to me. ♪

584
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,950
You haven't heard of it?

585
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,990
When I was young,

586
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,360
this was my favorite song.

587
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,070
How about...

588
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,740
Taking of Tiger Mountain by Strategy?

589
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,200
You... you haven't heard of that either?

590
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,190
No...

591
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,190
Oh.

592
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,200
Grandpa, I didn't know anything

593
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,570
about Taking of Tiger Mountain by Strategy.

594
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,150
But I know a little bit of

595
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,990
Legend of the Red Lantern.

596
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,820
Would you like to hear it?

597
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,400
Really?

598
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,570
Go on. Sing it for me.

599
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,610
Come on. Come on.

600
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,700
-I'll get started, grandpa.  -Okay.

601
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,780
♪ Grandma, listen to me ♪

602
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,610

603

613
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,280
Good!

614
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,030
Come here. Drink some water.

615
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,280
It'll be ready soon. Be patient.

616
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,740
Put this

617
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,490
into one of the dumpling wrappers.

618
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,990
It's a New Year's gift for Tong Nian.

619
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,570
I've been keeping it from her.

620
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,110
I wanted

621
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,110
to surprise her.

622
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,490
That's not hygienic.

623
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,360
It's sterilized.

624
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,610
Hey. Take it.

625
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
Hey.

626
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,780
It's Spring Festival.

627
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,900
You want me to throw a fit?

628
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,450
Don't take it too seriously.

629
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,280
What if Tong Nian and I

630
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,400
break up in the future?

631
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
You say that again?

632
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,210
Go watch TV, okay?

633
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,110
Do as you are told.

634
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,030
Okay, okay. I got it.

635
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,540
I got it.

636
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,700
Is there any problem?

637
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,570
Why are you laughing?

638
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,820
It's all your fault.

639
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,570
Do as you're told.

640
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,990
Dai Feng. Dai Feng.

641
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,530
Go help them.

642
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,880
-Go on. Go on. Help them.  -Oh, okay.

643
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,110
I'll go help them as well, grandpa.

644
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,740
No, no, no.

645
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,950
Girls are supposed to enjoy a happy life.

646
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,950
Let the boys do the dirty work.

647
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,320
Come come. Have a seat.

648
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,490
Keep me company and have some fruit.

649
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,780
Okay. What would you like, grandpa?

650
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,030
Well... Orange.

651
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,280
Okay. I'll peel one for you.

652
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,110
Good.

653
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,460
Good.

654
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,530
This is yours.

655
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,740
Is there anything Tong Nian doesn't eat?

656
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,990
Or you made the fillings especially for her?

657
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,110
There isn't anything I don't eat.

658
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,300
That's good. I'll have hers.

659
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,020
Wait.

660
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,070
Han Shangyan made them especially for her.

661
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,400
Dare you eat them?

662
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,360
No.

663
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,780
Tong Nian, eat up.

664
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,450
Thank you.

665
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,280
I'm not a good cook.

666
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,150
Help yourselves and eat up.

667
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,110
It's alright.

668
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,030
You like it?

669
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,950
Yes.

670
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Eat more.

671
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,780
-No. Wait. Tong Nian.  -Hmm?

672
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,360
Did you find anything

673
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,820
inside the dumpling?

674
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,570
Leeks and eggs.

675
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,070
No, no. That's not what I mean.

676
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,820
I mean...

677
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,400
did you chewed on anything

678
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,400
that tastes a bit different?

679
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,400
Mm...

680
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,800
Hey.

681
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,780
What's going on?

682
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,740
A gift for you.

683
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,900
A gift for me?

684
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,150
A New Year present.

685
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,150
Look what you did.

686
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,530
You never listen to me.

687
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,860
I asked him earlier

688
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,490
to wrap your New Year present

689
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,990
in one of the dumplings.

690
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,650
Open it and have a look.

691
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,150
Thank you, grandpa.

692
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,570
I'll open it.

693
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
Hey it's the boss's initial!

694
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,490
Do you like it?

695
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,110
Yes. Thank you.

696
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,400
I didn't buy it.

697
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,650
It's from grandpa.

698
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,450
He's just a little brat.

699
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,280
Well...

700
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,200
Put it away.

701
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,780
Okay.

702
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,190
Give me that.

703
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,570
Let me do the dishes.

704
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,900
You cooked for us tonight.

705
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,240
Have you done any housework before?

706
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,030
A little bit.

707
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,150
I know how to wash dishes.

708
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,490
Go watch TV.

709
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,200
If grandpa knows

710
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,190
I let you wash dishes,

711
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,190
he'd yell at me.

712
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,990
Thank you then.

713
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,280
What did he say?

714
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,400
He didn't need my help.

715
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,200
It's okay.

716
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,280
When we're at the club,

717
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,070
he's the same.

718
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,820
He'd wash his own dishes.

719
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:02,990
Tong Nian,

720
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,570
just now you and the party pooper

721
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,240
said only a few words

722
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
during the meal.

723
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,320
Who is the party pooper?

724
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,740
Our team captain, Wu Bai.

725
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,700
There are three people

726
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,950
you dare not provoke in the club.

727
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,150
Haven't you heard about it through boss?

728
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,990
The first one is Grunt.

729
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,280
He's so mean.

730
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,900
The second is Wu Bai,

731
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,240
like what I just told you.

732
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,840
Our captain is the party pooper.

733
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,240
You get that right?

734
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,610
There is one more.

735
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,820
The last one...

736
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,490
What?

737
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,200
It's our boss.

738
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,490
He's definitely a monster.

739
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,280
Very persuasive.

740
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,780
Why didn't you go home for the holiday?

741
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,110
My parents got divorced.

742
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,900
They're fighting over the house.

743
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,490
I don't know where to stay if I go back.

744
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,860
So I stayed here instead.

745
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,820
I'm sorry.

746
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,320
I shouldn't have asked you that.

747
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,240
It's okay. I mean it.

748
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,400
Honestly, the boss is alone most of the time too.

749
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,400
I guess that's why

750
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,860
he knows all of these skills.

751
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,400
What are you two

752
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,860
mumbling about this time?

753
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,400
We're cleaning the table.

754
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,610
Have you finished?

755
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,200
I'll take these two first.

756
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,240
Thanks, Tong Nian.

757
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,650
Put them here.

758
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,950
Day after tomorrow I'll be back at the club.

759
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,570
So I won't have time to visit you.

760
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,200
It's still early.

761
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,740

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,360
I heard that you were coming today.

771
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,530
So I came here for you.

772
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,610
Come inside for some tea.

773
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,400
It's okay. Just ignore him.

774
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,190
You should leave.

775
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,190
Let's go.

776
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,070
Hey, invite him to come inside?

777
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,740
That's enough.

778
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,700
Keep walking.

779
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,780
He's handsome.

780
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,740

Good morning.

00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,110
Morning. Happy New Year.

787
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,030
How's your holiday?

788
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,200
Not bad.

789
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,700
Hello, everybody. Happy New Year.

790
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,360
Happy New Year.

791
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,360
You look more handsome.

792
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,110
Hello. Happy New Year.

793
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,700
Hi, Grunt.

794
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,400
Really? Who's gained weight?

795
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,110
-Hello.  -Hello.

796
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,070
Move it aside.

797
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,400
Is this okay?

798
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,360
Yeah. Good.

799
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,150
Done.

800
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,990
Guys, we should have a new start this year.

801
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,110
How many championships will we win this year?

802
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,650
We'll win the grand slam, of course.

803
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,070
In order to win,

804
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,320
I got myself a new keyboard and mouse

805
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,110
to bring good fortune

806
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,530
after I came back home.

807
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,240
That's clever.

808
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,150
Ling Shan,

809
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,740
what happened to you

810
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,530
during this Spring Festival?

811
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,900
You've got quite a few new ideas.

812
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,150
And now your wearing a facial mask.

813
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,190
What do you know.

814
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,530
It gives me a new start.

815
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,820
This facial mask will bring me good luck,

816
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,490
and help me be victorious

817
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,320
in every battle this year.

818
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,280
And apart from that,

819
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,150
it'll help me find a girlfriend.

820
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,280
Easy as pie.

821
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,360
Here. Please take this.

822
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,900
Oh, thank you.

823
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,490
Let me have a look.

824
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,030
Easy, easy. Slow down.

825
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,820
What do you think?

826
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,360
You do look more radiant.

827
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,360
But you still don't have a girlfriend.

828
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,610
Who told you that?

829
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,900
I don't mean to brag or nothing.

830
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:34,820
But during the Spring Festival,

831
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,070
a large number of people

832
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,400
wanted to introduce girls to me.

833
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,150
Come on. Stop showing off.

834
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,650
Hurry now, get the boss for a meeting.

835
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,110
Oh. Hey, why do I have to?

836
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,650
What's wrong?

837
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,530
Where's Dai Feng?

838
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,110
I hear that

839
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,900
he spent the Spring Festival at the boss's place.

840
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,780
I guess he's had a hard time.

841
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,700
Now he's hiding in the bathroom, crying.

842
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,740
He's singing?

843
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,740
Go.

844
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,780
Hello, Dai Feng.

845
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,820
Oh, oh, he's shy.

846
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,490
What are you doing?

847
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,110
Tell us,

848
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,570
how's your holiday at boss's place?

849
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,490
Did you have a hard time?

850
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,700
What are you talking about?

851
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,360
Tell you what?

852
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,820
You're wrong about him.

853
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,900
He's actually very caring and gentle.

854
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,240
He wouldn't let Tong Nian do any housework.

855
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,450
He bought groceries, made dumplings,

856
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,400
and in the end...

857
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,650
he even washed all the dishes.

858
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,900
He didn't even let Tong Nian touch the water.

859
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,860
I was thinking back then

860
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,490
that if I had a girlfriend,

861
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,030
I don't think I could be like that.

862
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,490
But the fact is,

863
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,900
I don't have a girlfriend.

864
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,780
So... Boss can cook?

865
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,400
And it was delicious.

866
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,780
Really?

867
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,950
You must be kidding.

868
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,200
Do you have the nerve

869
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,700
to eat the food he cooks?

870
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,610
To be honest,

871
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,570
I ate a lot of it.

872
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,780
It was really delicious.

873
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,190
Are you serious?

874
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,780
Hey. No more talking.

875
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,380
Leave me alone.

876
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,570
I'm taking a shower.

877
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,740
Come on. Let's go.

878
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,110
Let's go.

879
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,200
Boss.

880
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,780
We've finished cleaning up.

881
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,610
We're ready for the meeting.

882
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,450
I got it.

883
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,400
Boss,

884
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,740
I heard that...

885
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,490
Dai Feng stayed at your place during the holiday.

886
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,820
And you cooked for him.

887
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,900
Is this true?

888
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,190
You want some?

889
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,780
No, I don't.

890
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,740
This year's CTF is held

891
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,490
in the form of singles.

892
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,780
Those who signed up for competition

893
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,030
are Shen Zhe and Ling Shan.

894
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,610
The boss will go with them.

895
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,950
I'll stay and keep an eye on the rest.

896
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,240
How about Wu Bai?

897
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,360
He's got his own training methods.

898
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,860
After we leave,

899
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,950
everyone remaining here must be productive.

900
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,110
I'll watch all the surveillance videos

901
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,530
from beginning to the end.

902
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,700
Do you understand?

903
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,950
Yes, boss.

904
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,610
Shen Zhe and Ling Shan, you two stay.

905
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,150
The rest of you go back to your training.

906
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,650
On this trip to Norway,

907
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,820
in addition to the K&K, SP will be joining us.

908
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,450
They're sending four people.

909
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,200
One is the group leader Ai Qing,

910
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
One is Mi Shaofei,

911
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,650
The other two are Ou Qiang and Lin Yin.

912
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,190
There aren't that many spots,

913
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,030
so I booked

914
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,360
the same flight for all of them.

915
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,990
Are you okay with it?

916
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,320
If the boss is okay with it,

917
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,990
then I don't have any issues.

918
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,570
This is your itinerary.

919
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,320
Have a look.

920
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,030
Do you need me

921
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,030
to deliver something to your husband?

922
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,610
No.

923
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,530
What about you?

924
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,320
Wu Bai will be busy with the training.

925
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,150
Do you need me to help look after grandpa?

926
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,650
He's busier than me.

927
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,900
He's got relatives and friends to visit.

928
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,240
Right.

929
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,150
You are still single.

930
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,740
You don't need to share your life with someone else.

931
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,190
Hey, what's on your mind?

932
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,280
