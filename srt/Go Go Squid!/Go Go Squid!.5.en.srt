= Go Go Squid! =
= Based on the novel Stewed Squid with Honey =

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,810
= Episode 5 =

26
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,040
That is to say,

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,220
Han Shangyan liked Appledog.

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,000
That's why the team was disbanded

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,370
and he also retired.

30
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,670
Now he wants Appledog back,

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,700
so he established K&K.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,730
He must love her so much!

33
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,280
Right. You went to the stadium,

34
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,990
to see my hero today, right?

35
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,230
Did you get his autograph? Did you get it?

36
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,870
I didn't have a chance.

37
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,410
Nope.

38
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,840
I don't think he likes talking to me.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,040
You spoke to Han Shangyan?

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,420
About what? Tell me about it.

41
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,780
Tell me! Tell me everything.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,690
Quickly!

43
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,960
There was a misunderstanding, then

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,210
I went back to his hotel and ate with him.

45
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,660
Why?

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,620
Perhaps he wanted to comfort me.

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,950
Why comfort you?

48
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,290
How can I tell them?

49
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,350
I can't tell them he rejected my confession of love.

50
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,080
It's complicated.

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,370
I can't really explain it.

52
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,540
So you're not close?

53
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,360
Of course not, I've only met him twice.

54
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,750
Twice?

55
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,060
Right. I remembered.

56
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,850
See, they have another game tomorrow,

57
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,560
do you wanna go?

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,540
Wanna go or not?

59
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,330
Yes!

60
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,940
I need to get a flight back to work tomorrow.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,380
Lan Mei can go with you.

62
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,160
-For real?  -Sure.

63
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you, Lan Mei!

64
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,620
Look how happy you are.

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,750
Got it.

66
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,200
Stop being the go-between.

67
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,830
I've met that girl before.

68
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,120
At the ACM Competition.

69
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,480
ACM, you went there?

70
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,170
International College Student Programming Competition.

71
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,720
The most prestigious of all programming competitions.

72
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,250
You know I always wanted to go.

73
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,410
Did you do well?

74
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,700
A bit better than her.

75
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,830
But she's also good.

76
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,580
What's that look?

77
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,280
Hold on.

78
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,700
You knew she's not my girlfriend.

79
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,950
Why didn't you speak up?

80
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,870
I thought,

81
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,010
you didn't explain because that'd embarrass her.

82
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,210
So why would I bother speaking up?

83
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,000
None of my business.

84
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,330
Right.

85
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,660
Everybody in the world knows

86
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,610
if it doesn't involve your beloved Appledog,

87
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,200
it'd be of no interest to you.

88
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,290
Wait.

89
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,790
Why would grandpa come this time?

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,870
See family and visit tombs.

91
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,790
It can't be that simple.

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,290
He must have other reasons.

93
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,480
I'm the one to suffer every time he plans something.

94
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,660
We shall see.

95
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,120
Tong Nian,

96
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,320
this may be your last chance to meet him.

97
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,040
Cheer up, come on!

98
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,290
K&K, K&K, K&K.

99
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,410
K&K, K&K, K&K.

100
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,660
K&K, K&K, K&K.

101
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,040
K&K, K&K, K&K.

102
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,200
K&K, K&K, K&K.

103
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,870
So crowded just like my husband said.

104
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
What should we do? The tickets are sold out.

105
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,700
We can't get in.

106
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,400
Well then we can look around to see

107
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,320
if anyone's hawking tickets. Look around.

108
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,930
Nope, not scalped tickets.

109
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,200
We can't buy those.

110
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,660
What should we do?

111
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,290
Look!

112
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,910
So many K&K funs.

113
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,720
We should also have a banner.

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,309
We can't even get in,

115
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,280
what would be the point of a banner?

116
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,410
What should we do?

117
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,750
Today, team one will compete.

118
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,470
Team two won't compete,

119
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,830
but you still need to pay attention.

120
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,580
Everyone you meet today

121
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,240
may become your future opponent.

122
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,120
If you're familiar with their techniques

123
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,830
you'll have a better chance to defeat them.

124
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,620
Understand?

125
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,950
Yes, Boss!

126
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,100
DT, you take team one

127
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,500
to get familiar with the place.

128
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,080
Sure.

129
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,950
Let's go, bros.

130
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,830
Take all your stuff.

131
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,330
Let's go.

132
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,450
Are you alright?

133
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,370
Come on, get up.

134
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Are you alright?

135
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,580
Hurt your leg?

136
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,339
I'm fine.

137
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,080
Are you ok?

138
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,450
I'm fine.

139
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,080
Are you ok?

140
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,910
Listen to me,

141
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,620
we must be careful.

142
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,620
It's you.

143
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,330
Do you remember me?

144
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,750
I met you yesterday

145
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,080
and you took me in.

146
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,790
Of course I remember.

147
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,990
What a coincidence.

148
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,580
Yes.

149
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,910
You're here for K&K again?

150
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,090
I hope you can get K&K's autograph this time.

151
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,040
Thanks.

152
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,200
I hope everyone can wait in a line.

153
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,270
After we finish the game,

154
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,410
we'll sign autographs for every one of you.

155
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,960
Thank you for your support for SP. Thank you.

156
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,250
Take care of yourself.

157
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,450
Be careful.

158
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you.

159
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,330
Who's that?

160
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,080
She looks so cool.

161
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,950
I should've worn suits.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,500
Look, that's Boss's girlfriend!

163
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,830
It's her!

164
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,000
Go go go.

165
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,160
Look, it's K&K.

166
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,830
Han Shangyan! Han Shangyan!

167
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,790
Han Shangyan!

168
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,700
Come here.

169
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,330
Han Shangyan!

170
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,660
Attack Demo first!

171
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,660
Wipe out the weakest first.

172
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,990
Amazing.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,160
K&K is here.

174
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,500
Shangyan.

175
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,590
What do you mean? Han Shangyan!

176
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,160
Never mind.

177
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,580
Don't overthink it.

178
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,700
Grunt! Grunt!

179
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,760
-What?  -Come here.

180
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,950
There are snacks.

181
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,540
Forget it. We need to go.

182
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,000
But I'm a bit hungry.

183
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,000
Ok but only one bite!

184
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,990
Boss, Tong Nian is here.

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,290
At the door, did you see her?

186
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,870
I saw her just now.

187
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,610
Boss, you didn't even say hello to her,

188
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,410
that was a bit harsh.

189
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,840
Right.  -Girls don't like that.

190
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:17,950
I can teach you.

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
Right, Boss.

192
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,130
Tong Nian has brought a friend.

193
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,790
If they're not in VIP area, that'd be embarrassing.

194
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,160
Definitely.

195
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,410
I have a sore throat.

196
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,120
Enough chit chat.

197
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,700
Look, Boss.

198
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,880
We may bear your torture cause we can handle it.

199
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,030
But you shouldn't treat a girl like that.

200
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,000
She was waving at us all the time.

201
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,330
She's here to support us.

202
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,910
That's right.  -Right, Boss.

203
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,330
Please let her in.

204
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,990
Go now.

205
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,450
Ok.

206
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,870
Demo!

207
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,290
Let's go, Lan Mei.

208
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,060
Who is that?

209
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:46,950
I'll tell you later.

210
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,290
Mrs. Han!

211
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Hey careful.

212
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,500
Excuse me, excuse me.

213
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,760
It's ok. I'll sign it for them.

214
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,500
So many people.

215
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,120
Probably all his fans.

216
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:57,530
Thanks.

217
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,660
Please sign this for me, Demo.

218
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,000
You're hot.

219
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:03,950
Thanks.

220
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,990
Boss asked me to take you in.

221
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,410
Inside?

222
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,620
Who's the girl?

223
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,370
Mrs. Han, come over,

224
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,910
I can take you in, come.

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Squid, when did you get married?

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,870
Why don't I know?

227
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,630
I didn't. He's kidding.

228
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,950
We've been friends for three years,

229
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,000
yet you kept it a secret.

230
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,040
I'll ask him.

231
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,080
What're you doing, Lan Mei?

232
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,120
Who's your boss?

233
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,000
None of your business.

234
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,330
Sorry excuse us.

235
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,290
Mrs. Han,

236
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,080
I have five minutes left.

237
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Let's go and I'll explain later.

238
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,770
Well, Demo.

239
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,200
Right, Boss is not in a good mood.

240
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,620
Demo, that's my friend.

241
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,300
Can she join us and go inside?

242
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,990
Of course,

243
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,910
your friends are always welcome.

244
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,700
Sorry, excuse us.

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,580
Let's go.

246
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,330
Demo. We'll always support you.

247
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,000
Demo, we believe in you!

248
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,000
Come on.

249
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,120
So many people.

250
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,970
This is where we rest.

251
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,160
Look, that's SP.

252
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,750
Squid,

253
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,370
that's... that's Gun, right?

254
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,370
Can I have an autograph, just sign on my dress.

255
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,260
Then I won't wash it for a year.

256
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,330
An autograph?

257
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,370
Don't worry.

258
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,070
Our boss never signs for fans,

259
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,910
but you're Mrs. Han's friend.

260
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,580
And?

261
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,410
So I'm sure he will.

262
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,500
That's great.

263
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,160
What's he talking about?

264
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,290
Mrs. Han's friend.

265
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,660
Mrs. Han.

266
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,950
Mr. Han is Gun.

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,450
That means

268
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,160
you're dating my husband's hero.

269
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,940
You're dating Gun, my husband's idol.

270
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,880
What're you saying? I'm confused.

271
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,220
I... I've actually only met him twice.

272
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,790
Today is the third time.

273
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,700
Boss is impressive!

274
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,370
And he's already your boyfriend.

275
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,830
Only twice?

276
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,040
No, no, no. Well...

277
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,840
Mrs. Han, sit here.  -Where are you going?

278
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,190
No, I told you yesterday I'm not his girlfriend.

279
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,160
Impressive.

280
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,450
No, Lan Mei, listen to me.

281
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,640
Later when you see Gun, no questions.

282
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,360
He has a bad temper,

283
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,330
I'm afraid he'll get mad.

284
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,140
I'll explain everything to you when we get back, ok?

285
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,150
Relax, I'll keep my mouth shut.

286
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,990
I won't upset your private time with him.

287
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,960
No, we're not in a relationship.

288
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,200
Fine, fine, if you say so.

289
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,450
No, what?

290
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,500
Come here, come, come.

291
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,080
I'll tell you some gossip. Quickly!

292
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,250
Leader, come here.

293
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,600
Guess who I brought in?

294
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,260
Who?

295
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,790
Mrs. Han!

296
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,000
The girl wearing jeans.

297
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,750
You see her?

298
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,870
You know what?

299
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,290
Mrs. Han told me that

300
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,630
she's only met the boss twice.

301
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,290
Today is the third time.

302
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,870
No way!

303
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,000
Yesterday was the second time?

304
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,330
That means...

305
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,720
They started dating the first time they met.

306
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,750
So efficient.

307
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,160
Stop gossiping.

308
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,370
It's about to start.

309
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,250
Good for you, Boss.

310
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Ok bye.

311
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,950
Let me grab a snack. Go ahead.

312
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,720
-I'll ask him why bring me here.  -Sure.

313
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,660
You want me?

314
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,680
She's my friend. I brought her in.

315
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,990
Come, sit here.

316
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,160
You want some?

317
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,290
Just go.

318
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,250
Just pretend I'm not here.

319
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,990
Go, come on.

320
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,250
I'll sit here since you asked.

321
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,000
My team members seem to like you,

322
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,650
so they wanted to invite you to watch the game.

323
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,120
Don't wanna watch?

324
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,000
I do.

325
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,000
I want to watch.

326
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,250
Wait for ten minutes,

327
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,830
then come inside with us.

328
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,700
Playing games again, no conversation?

329
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,540
Pretty nose.

330
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,750
What are you doing?

331
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,370
I'm thinking

332
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,940
if I need to explain the misunderstanding to them.

333
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,410
Misunderstanding?

334
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,410
They think I'm your girlfriend.

335
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,940
I don't think it's fair to you.

336
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,440
Although I...

337
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,500
Although you like me,

338
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,040
you don't wanna cause trouble for me?

339
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,500
Go ahead.

340
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,200
You have one minute to explain.

341
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,800
Don't lower their frame of mind.

342
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,540
One minute is not enough.

343
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,500
I explained to them yesterday

344
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,080
but they didn't get it.

345
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,970
I need at least five minutes.

346
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,450
Then wait until after the competition.

347
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,750
Let's go.

348
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,080
-Relax, good luck.  -Ok.

349
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,000
Quickly!

350
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,200
K&K, I love you!

351
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,739
K&K, K&K, K&K.

352
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:26,700
How's your stomach?

353
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,660
Much better.

354
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,600
Hey Squid, don't forget my autograph.

355
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,420
I can't.

356
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,160
I'm afraid he'll be mad and drive us out.

357
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,000
Just an autograph from your boyfriend.

358
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,830
He's not.

359
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:39,990
He's not?

360
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,880
I like him but he doesn't like me.

361
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,540
You chased him?

362
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,830
And you failed?

363
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,120
Just go.

364
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,250
I'm speechless.

365
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,040
Hurry up.

366
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,120
Come on.

367
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,790
Well, where should we...

368
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,023
How about you sit there

369
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:22,880
and let Tong Nian and I sit together?

370
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,550
How can I sit with the boss? I can't.

371
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,030
Then I'll sit here. You can sit over there.

372
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,750
Thanks.

373
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,450
You know her?

374
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,250
Not really.

375
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,500
She took me inside yesterday.

376
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,000
Do you know who she is?

377
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,880
She told me that she works for SP.

378
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,770
She's Appledog,

379
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,430
former main attacker of the CTF Champion.

380
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,160
Now she's the leader of team one of SP.

381
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,990
Hey it's Appledog!

382
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,200
Appledog?

383
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,400
One of Solo's main attackers,

384
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,020
your former partner Appledog?

385
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,000
You did research.

386
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,790
That's the woman he likes.

387
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:35,830
Who's that?

388
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,350
They should be a great couple in the CTF world.

389
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,990
I don't know her either,

390
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,080
I just met her yesterday.

391
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,040
I thought she was a K&K fan.

392
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,880
So I took her inside.

393
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,120
Shangyan has a girlfriend?

394
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,750
I don't think so.

395
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,990
It's not appropriate for me to sit here.

396
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,390
Should I, should I leave now?

397
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:04,870
Leave?

398
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,370
She might take the wrong idea.

399
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,910
What do you mean?

400
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,450
What if she thinks that

401
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,310
I'm your girlfriend because I'm sitting here.

402
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,700
You'll be in trouble if she is upset.

403
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,500
It'll be even harder to win her back.

404
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,360
I won't cause you trouble.

405
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,900
I know, I understand.

406
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,330
I, I'll find another seat.

407
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,990
You've got to be kidding me.

408
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't care what she thinks about us.

409
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,750
Besides,

410
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,950
young lady,

411
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,160
your info is totally wrong.

412
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,580
You say you like me

413
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,910
without realizing

414
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,210
I'm a bachelor by choice.

415
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,750
Sit back down.

416
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:14,940
By the way,

417
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,000
I have no interest in women

418
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,250
and also no interest in men.

419
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,700
Ladies and Gentlemen,

420
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,480
you're watching CTF Doppler Summit Finals.

421
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,070
The first team you can see is K&K.

422
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,450
Here's captain DT,

423
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,160
and teammates Grunt, Demo,

424
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,600
97, and One.

425
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,940
On the other side is our old friend

426
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:44,519
SP Team one.

427
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,909
Their Captain, Hua Ti,

428
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:47,769
and teammates Xiaomi, All,

429
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,479
inin, and Following.

430
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:51,609
For today, I'm looking forward to watching

431
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,389
Xiaomi and All, two veterans of the game,  -Good luck.

432
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,549
returning to the competition after all these years.

433
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:59,559
Right. I wonder if competing together will rekindle

434
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,699
that old feeling.

435
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:01,619
Yeah, me too.

436
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,329
Speaking of which,

437
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:05,089
turn the camera to the three leading players from years ago!

438
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:09,049
Please welcome captain of Solo Team, Solo!

439
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:18,889
Next to him was our CTF goddess, Appledog!

440
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:26,709
And last but not least is Gun, Han Shangyan!

441
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:28,539
He still hasn't changed.

442
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,979
That reminds me of the old days.

443
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:33,239
Right.  -Okay. Let's start the countdown.

444
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:35,739
We're about to watch an excellent competition!

445
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,339
No doubt.

446
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:37,598
Great.

447
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:40,709
Under the severe environment of the Internet security,

448
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,319
CTF has become integral to discovering new talent.

449
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,069
It also demonstrates the strategic thinking of our nation.

450
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:50,179
This time all competitors

451
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:51,739
will concentrate on

452
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,820
server attack and defense, locate vulnerabilities,

453
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,539
and use multiple techniques to protect network security.

454
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,539
OK. We can see that K&K

455
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,420
is attacking the primary port.

456
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:06,060
Captain DT is auditing codes alone to find holes.

457
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:08,140
Beautiful strategy.

458
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:10,420
DT's good with the white-box test.

459
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,100
That's right. K&K has done a good job attacking.

460
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,019
SP's server has been attacked

461
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,539
while K&K has only lost one node.

462
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,459
Nice.

463
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:24,700
All and Xiaomi have deleted the backdoor

464
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:25,979
and patched the hole.

465
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:27,900
They've turned the situation around.

466
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,140
Good for you.

467
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,259
DT's the only one left

468
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,060
to defend the main server.

469
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,739
SP is attacking on several fronts.

470
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,459
DT has to give up on defending.

471
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:38,620
He's attacking SP's server now.

472
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,739
Let's see whether DT can work wonders on his own.

473
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:41,940
Let's see what happens.

474
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,420
We can see Xiaomi has exposed his node at this time.

475
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:45,620
This definitely can't be ignored by DT.

476
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
DT is going for the node Xiaomi has exposed.

477
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:49,499
DT hasn't realized that All and Hua Ti

478
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,820
are working on K&K's server.

479
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,060
Nice.

480
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,540
We can see that SP gets a point first.

481
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,420
K&K has made some quick adjustments.

482
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Yes. Look.

483
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,660
Because they lost the last round,

484
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:10,300
K&K is attacking aggressively now.

485
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,660
As for DT,

486
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:12,860
he also figured out

487
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,140
a coding problem with his opponent.

488
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:17,779
Following failed at security reinforcement.

489
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,340
DT has got the flag.

490
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,259
They did it.

491
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,420
Excellent.

492
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:31,979
Let's go.

493
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:33,999
Where?

494
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:35,709
To the bathroom.

495
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,919
It's not finished.

496
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:38,629
Come with me.

497
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:42,299
Excuse me,

498
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,459
we'll be back in a minute.

499
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,339
I need to ask you something.

500
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,959
Ok, ok.

501
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:59,019
I'll try my best to get an autograph for you, ok?

502
00:26:59,099 --> 00:26:59,629
I'll try.

503
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:01,709
It's not about that.

504
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,988
I wanna know what's between

505
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:05,049
you and my husband's idol.

506
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,049
We're so close but you didn't tell me.

507
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,629
I'm not hiding it from you.

508
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,469
I really didn't mean to not tell you.

509
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,009
It's just...

510
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,508
It's just I was rejected by him

511
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:18,249
and it's so embarrassing.

512
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,879
You asked him out?

513
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:22,050
Don't you know you never confess

514
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:22,989
to the one you like?

515
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,944
Who would be interested

516
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:27,209
in a girl they met only twice?

517
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,709
How stupid are you? I...

518
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:33,919
No. I didn't want to confess but yesterday I...

519
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:35,419
Enough, stop.

520
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:36,459
Look at you,

521
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,169
such a pretty face

522
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:39,569
yet such an empty brain

523
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,119
when it comes to relationships.

524
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,379
Confess the second time you met?

525
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:46,219
I'm not surprised he didn't fall for you.

526
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:47,589
You know what?

527
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,209
It's so stupid.

528
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:51,729
Before he can see any of your advantages

529
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:54,429
you just run to him and say you like him.

530
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,959
Who would like such a psychopath?

531
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,359
You should take it slowly, haunt his side

532
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:02,589
to reveal your beauty.

533
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:05,309
For example, you're cute,

534
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:06,999
cool,

535
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:08,959
sexy.

536
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:12,289
Anyway, you can't admit that you like him.

537
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:13,879
You should make him suffer,

538
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:14,839
make him guess,

539
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,049
make him confused whether you like him.

540
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:18,379
Why don't you say something?

541
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:19,799
You understand?

542
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:22,509
Besides,

543
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:24,759
you should let him confess first.

544
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:27,769
He gives you a hint and he confesses first.

545
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,419
Also, listen up,

546
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:33,419
he's had opportunities to explain

547
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:34,999
but he hasn't,

548
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:35,959
why is that?

549
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:38,999
That means he doesn't resent you

550
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,959
and even has some affection for you.

551
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,169
He, he doesn't like me.

552
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:48,497
You should know all men

553
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:50,639
are too shy to express themselves.

554
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,459
Get it? Let's go.

555
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,969
K&K is on the defensive today.

556
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,459
Right. And we can see SP team

557
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:00,639
with the added strength of Xiaomi and All,

558
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:02,049
has promoted the whole team

559
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,579
to a higher echelon than before.

560
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,169
Yes, indeed, they can kick K&K's ass.

561
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:08,529
Yep. K&K may never consider

562
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,429
how SP's experienced players

563
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:12,239
can coordinate like this.

564
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:14,749
They undermine every one of K&K's strategies.

565
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,009
Yes, like we always say

566
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:17,649
the older players in CTF,

567
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,229
may not react as fast as the young players.

568
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:19,829
That's true.

569
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:20,999
But the two veteran's cooperation

570
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:23,039
in today's competition, is perfect.  -Right.

571
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,009
Xiaomi defeated the last two on his own.

572
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,879
SP wins!

573
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:40,329
Congrats SP!  -Yes!

574
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,966
Xiaomi and All did a great job today.

575
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,296
How about we eat together?

576
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:29,666
Go on.

577
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:33,626
It's ok to lose this time.

578
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:35,460
I'm sure next time you will win.

579
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:36,206
You can do it.

580
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,046
Don't you wanna explain?

581
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:43,046
Now?

582
00:30:43,956 --> 00:30:46,006
Yes, now.

583
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,206
You can't explain

584
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:50,836
or you won't have a chance.

585
00:30:51,006 --> 00:30:52,336
Just let them take the wrong idea,

586
00:30:52,456 --> 00:30:54,916
that's the beginning of a love story.

587
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:56,876
Don't explain.

588
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,506
You stay here

589
00:30:58,586 --> 00:30:59,796
and I'll go ask for an autograph.

590
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,006
I could never imagine

591
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:02,646
these two players are still so good.

592
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,876
Right, they were so great.

593
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,046
I had no idea.

594
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:12,036
You can rehearse your explanation with me first.

595
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:14,546
Rehearse?

596
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:17,616
Let me see if you can express yourself clearly.

597
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,626
We lost the game today

598
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,046
and I don't wanna waste their time.

599
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:30,306
Ok. Han Shangyan and I,

600
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:33,836
the two of us...

601
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:34,586
Don't know what to say?

602
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,456
Then don't explain.

603
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:43,416
Are you sure?

604
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,126
We won't see each other anyway.

605
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:49,636
It doesn't matter what they think.

606
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,046
Frankly speaking,

607
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:03,706
I have no plans to be in a relationship.

608
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,086
These boys

609
00:32:06,796 --> 00:32:09,186
come to me with their future and dreams

610
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:12,166
to wear our national flag

611
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:14,656
and become world champions someday.

612
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:16,567
To prove to their parents

613
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,246
that their choices weren't wrong.

614
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,556
So, I don't have time and energy

615
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:25,886
to deal with anything except K&K.

616
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:29,206
Are we clear?

617
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:32,166
Yes.

618
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:38,626
Go now.

619
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:41,756
Ok, see you.

620
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,006
No need,

621
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:46,916
we won't see each other again.

622
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:54,006
Get your stuff, let's go.

623
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:55,626
Ok, let's go.

624
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:56,046
Let's go.

625
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:57,346
Where's DT?  -Here, take your things.

626
00:32:57,986 --> 00:32:59,256
He's already on the bus.

627
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:13,626
Let's go.

628
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:15,046
See you, bye.

629
00:33:15,706 --> 00:33:16,166
Bye.

630
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:19,886
What? Am I mistaken?

631
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:23,456
He definitely likes you.

632
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,966
That's it, my first love failed

633
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:30,876
at Guangzhou Stadium.

634
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:46,734
You're back.

635
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:47,766
You must be tired.

636
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:49,921
Here's your traveling fee

637
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:51,526
for Norway after Spring Festival.

638
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:52,296
Please sign it.

639
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:02,566
So, what will you do about that girl?

640
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:03,336
Which girl?

641
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,506
The girl in Guangzhou.

642
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,216
That girl with round face, big eyes, wearing a skirt.

643
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:08,336
Tong Nian?

644
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:10,576
Right. I think she's adorable.

645
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:13,586
It's over.

646
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:17,026
Over? What do you mean, over?

647
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:19,206
Over means problem solved.

648
00:34:19,836 --> 00:34:20,796
Tell me,

649
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:22,416
do you want to be alone your whole life?

650
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:24,466
This is the internet club,

651
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:26,506
not some matchmaking club.

652
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:28,506
I only want to

653
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:30,916
help these boys realize their dreams,

654
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:33,526
win the national and Asian championships,

655
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:34,876
even the world championship.

656
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:36,876
I'll worry about that.

657
00:34:36,996 --> 00:34:38,786
You'd better save some time for yourself.

658
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:40,376
I think she's a nice girl.

659
00:34:42,836 --> 00:34:43,426
See you.

No need,

Guys,

673
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:22,686
why did Boss become so angry when he met SP's boss?

674
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:24,336
You noticed, too?

675
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,456
I also thought so.

676
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:30,008
This is a story of love and hate

677
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:32,416
that lasted almost a decade.

678
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:33,706
Watch what you say.

679
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:35,526
It could upset our Boss.

680
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,916
97, you tell them.

681
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:43,366
Boss established the Solo club with Solo and Appledog

682
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,456
after he came back from abroad.

683
00:36:44,546 --> 00:36:45,546
You guys know it, right?

684
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,296
Solo and Appledog were a couple,

685
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:54,896
but Solo's ex suddenly showed up,

686
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:56,086
and Appledog couldn't bear it.

687
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,416
She broke up with him.

688
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,046
She quit the team after their breakup.

689
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,916
Solo also quit because he felt guilty.

690
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:04,836
Of three chief players two left,

691
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:06,046
the team disbanded.

692
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:09,776
So the boss has always been angry at Solo and Appledog.

693
00:37:10,256 --> 00:37:12,166
But it has been years,

694
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:14,416
why is he still angry?

695
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:17,166
Solo team

696
00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:18,956
was not a normal team.

697
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:21,396
It was the best in the country.

698
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:22,796
You know?

699
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:25,376
They were national champions

700
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:27,166
and about to fight for the world championship.

701
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:29,046
It was the most glorious time

702
00:37:29,126 --> 00:37:30,876
when the team disbanded

703
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,166
because of Solo's personal issues.

704
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,956
Of course Boss hates them.

705
00:37:34,506 --> 00:37:35,876
It's not hate I think,

706
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:37,166
it's sadness.

707
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:39,456
Boss values friendship.

708
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:41,296
Once he was hurt,

709
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,546
it was hard to move on.

710
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:45,766
Right, he had the chance to be world champion

711
00:37:45,956 --> 00:37:47,586
but was screwed over by his best friend.

712
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:50,006
I couldn't bear it either.

713
00:37:50,546 --> 00:37:51,456
Listen to me,

714
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:52,956
don't mention

715
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:54,996
this history to our leader.

716
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:56,046
Why?

717
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:58,086
What's she got to do with it?

718
00:37:58,506 --> 00:38:01,136
She is Solo's ex, mother of his child.

719
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:02,586
What?

720
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:04,796
Gosh!

721
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:07,796
No way!  -What are you talking about over there?

722
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:09,706
Well...

723
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:11,256
Nothing, nothing.

724
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:11,956
Nothing.

725
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:13,586
You mentioned a meeting, right?

726
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,966
I'll grab some snacks. You hungry?

727
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,446
Yeah. Let's go.  -I'm off to train.

728
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:19,296
Right, the English class will start later,

729
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:20,256
don't be late.

730
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:22,166
Tell the others not to be late.

731
00:38:24,206 --> 00:38:25,206
Something on your mind?

732
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:27,296
Leader,

733
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,956
why should we learn English?

734
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:31,626
Because you're going abroad to compete.

735
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,376
You'll represent China,

736
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:35,776
if you can speak English fluently,

737
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:36,996
wouldn't it be great?

738
00:38:37,086 --> 00:38:39,216
Your boss arranged it for you.

739
00:38:39,506 --> 00:38:40,296
It's expensive.

740
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:42,606
Study hard, don't waste his money.

741
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:46,376
Why are you staring at me?

742
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:47,666
No reason.

743
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:49,086
Go quickly now.

744
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:50,126
Go on.

745
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:51,426
Ok.

746
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,446
The way to say is, I am from...

747
00:38:58,496 --> 00:38:59,796
Now this is the main class.

748
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:01,856
There'll be two 40-minute classes.

749
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:03,296
After the main class,

750
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,498
they each get 20 minutes

751
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:05,986
one-on-one oral English tutorial.

752
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:09,126
I am from Beijing, I am from Shanghai,

753
00:39:10,796 --> 00:39:13,296
is the correct way to say it. Ok.

754
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:14,546
How many times a week?

755
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:15,726
Twice.

756
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:17,006
Do they have exams?

757
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:18,666
Every three months.

758
00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:20,586
Every three months?

759
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:22,296
They won't work hard.

760
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:23,456
Make it every month.

761
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:25,746
I need to see the transcript.

762
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,356
You can say, I come from...

763
00:39:28,626 --> 00:39:29,876
In this case...

764
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:34,006
He seems more handsome than your husband.

765
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:36,256
Exactly.

766
00:39:36,296 --> 00:39:38,816
You can try together, to play this game.

767
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:44,956
Mom, I'm leaving.

768
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:46,086
Going where?

769
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:46,918
Right, come with me

770
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:48,496
for grocery shopping this afternoon.

771
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,456
No I can't.

772
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:50,996
Zheng Hui is waiting for me at school.

773
00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:56,626
You two are dating?

774
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:58,086
What are you talking about?

775
00:39:58,206 --> 00:39:59,836
It's nonsense.

776
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:03,006
The new students need a tour around the campus.

777
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:05,646
My teacher asked me to give them a speech.

778
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:07,296
I'll be the main speaker.

779
00:40:07,626 --> 00:40:08,836
Ok.

780
00:40:10,706 --> 00:40:12,736
How's this, when you're finished,

781
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:14,486
bring Zheng Hui home to have dinner,

782
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:14,996
do you hear me?

783
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:15,996
See you, mom.

784
00:40:16,996 --> 00:40:18,176
-Tong Nian.  -I'll be late.

785
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:19,926
Just do what I told you to do, ok?

786
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:48,456
So, so many people.

787
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:50,496
Alright, everyone, look here.

788
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:53,026
Wake up that sleeping girl.  -Tong Nian!

789
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:54,686
You can't even open your eyes.

790
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,406
Today's lecture should be a treat.

791
00:40:57,476 --> 00:40:58,296
I'm sure you'll like it.

792
00:40:59,206 --> 00:40:59,916
Give me your laptop.

793
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,086
-It's in my bag.  -Okay.

794
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:04,996
Why are there so many people?

795
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:07,166
He was afraid no one would come

796
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:10,206
so he called all of the freshmen to come.

797
00:41:10,296 --> 00:41:12,946
I'm afraid of many people, I'm panicking.

798
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:14,166
Chill out, you can do it.

799
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:16,866
Ok. Great.

800
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:18,021
Alright.

801
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:21,126
Let me introduce the main lecturer today.

802
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:24,246
She's very young but very talented.

803
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:25,166
At the same time,

804
00:41:25,336 --> 00:41:29,126
she was the runner-up in the ACM competition.

805
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,272
This competition involves participants

806
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:32,546
from over 200 countries.

807
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,646
It's not easy to be runner-up.

808
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:37,726
Her topic today is Artificial Intelligence.

809
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:38,996
Let's give her a round of applause!

810
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,866
Welcome our speaker, Tong Nian!

811
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:49,876
Hi, I'm Tong Nian.

812
00:41:49,996 --> 00:41:52,416
Artificial Intelligence is so general.

813
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:54,406
Some of you haven't attended university,

814
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:55,956
and some don't study this major.

815
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,836
I'd like to start my lecture with a game.

816
00:41:58,876 --> 00:42:01,726
And give you a rough idea about AI.

817
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:04,326
This is an easy Tetris game.

818
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:08,086
This program doesn't need to eat or drink.

819
00:42:08,116 --> 00:42:10,376
It just needs three days of learning

820
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:13,906
to turn from a novice into a master.

821
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:15,956
It can learn by itself?

822
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:18,866
Of course. Actually, it's no worse than we are.

823
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,766
Look, it's playing by itself.

824
00:42:20,846 --> 00:42:23,846
Yes, machines are smart.

825
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:25,456
They have lives just like a human does.

826
00:42:25,956 --> 00:42:27,966
And it has enhanced learning abilities.

827
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:31,986
Ok, we may allow this game to continue playing.

828
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:36,466
Artificial Intelligence is shortened to AI.

829
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:38,086
That's what we mentioned above.

830
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:40,456
Actually, the term "Artificial Intelligence"

831
00:42:40,586 --> 00:42:42,836
has been used for over 60 years,

832
00:42:42,956 --> 00:42:45,236
but it's only now that it's been fully developed.

833
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:46,706
Can you imagine that?

834
00:42:46,836 --> 00:42:48,256
Ten years ago,

835
00:42:48,326 --> 00:42:51,086
no one knew what AI was.
