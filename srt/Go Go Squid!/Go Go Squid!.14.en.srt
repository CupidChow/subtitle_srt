That necklace your stepmom asked for,

where is it?

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,440
I lost it.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,400
I knew you'd say that.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,280
She's getting married.

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,040
She'll be leaving us,

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,540
and you can't even do this tiny little thing for her.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,590
Is that how you thank her for everything?

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,600
It just got lost, I didn't lie!

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,850
That... That club of yours,

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,040
is it still losing money?

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,040
Yeah, it is.

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
You needed money,

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,800
so you sold her necklace.

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,480
I didn't!

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,340
The other divisions are doing well.

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280

If you really need money, I can help!

45

Come on, you know I would never do that to her.

46
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,640
Am I that kind of person?

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,050
I want my grandson to live a better life!

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,720
I'm worried about you!

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
I'll transfer the money

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
back to her soon,

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,120

00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,120
going up and down and spinning round.

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,360
Now it's rushing to the bottom.

Wow... We have guests coming today?

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,640
No.

No?

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
The three of us can't eat so much food!

62
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,640
We'll try.

63
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,520
Quiet!

64
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,040
Hey hey hey!

65
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,560
Sit down and eat!

You, you...

68
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,680
You know I don't like spicy food!

69
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,360
Braised pork, this will do.

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,240
What the...

71
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,760
Even the braised pork is spicy!

72
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,920
Unbelievable!

73
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,680
Tong Nian, over here! Hurry!

74
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,760
Hello!

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,320
What's the matter?

76
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
Is it some kind of emergency?

77
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
Don't you remember?

78
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,440
We're going to the audition for the CTF song.

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,490
Your bag, pick it up.

80
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,320
It wasn't easy for us to make it into the top 10.

81
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,200
I totally forgot it.

82
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,720
I haven't prepared at all.

83
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,200
Check the NetEase Cloud Music.

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,720
It's on the opening screen ad.

85
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
I heard that

86
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,100
Han Shangyan is the ambassador for CTF.

87
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,120
Look,

88
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
you are the most popular singer on there now.

89
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,560
They are fast.

90
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,170
Yeah.

91
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,150
Hey, you didn't tell them about me and him right?

92
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,430
Of course not.

93
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,680
The two of us don't need men to help us.

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,360
That's good.

95
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,560
I broke up with him.

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,320
Broke up?

97
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,720
Why?

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
That night,

99
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,280
I heard him saying...

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
What did he say?

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,320
He said,

102
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
he didn't know you that well.

103
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,080
You've only met a few times.

104
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,670
He didn't know how he felt about you,

105
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,480
and he didn't want to lie.

106
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,400
Yeah. That's right.

107
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
He was being honest.

108
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,480
But,

109
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,160
he also said that

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,080
give him some time,

111
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,640
and see how things go.

112
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,200
Such an honest guy!

113
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,470
No wonder my husband's been a fan for so many years.

114
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,600
I ordered you a drink.

115
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,680
Thanks.

116
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,400
Enjoy.

117
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,350
Hey.

118
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,390
So there's no chance for you two?

119
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,280
I brought it up.

120
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,640
He said okay.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,320
You brought it up?

122
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,280
Why did you do that?

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,530
You like him so much, why did you break up with him?

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,200
Are you just being proud?

125
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,130
He agreed to be with me to make his family happy.

126
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,320
He doesn't have to anymore.

127
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,400
Guess this is it.

128
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,760
Don't mention him again.

129
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,710
Okay okay, I won't.

130
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,490
Just forget him.

131
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,450
Love is supposed to make you happy.

132
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,040
If you're not happy, then just forget about it.

133
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,560
I was worried about you, you know?

134
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,920
It's not a big deal.

135
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,960
Let's eat first.

136
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,840
We've got a big day ahead of us.

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,520
Your career will never leave you.

138
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
A woman should always be independent.

139
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,880
Don't you agree?

140
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,480
Yeah.

141
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,470
-Cheers.  -Cheers.

142
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,480
This way.

143
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

144
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,250

Yeah.

151
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,440
Tons of people have signed up for the audition.

152
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,160
That's right.

153
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,120
Wait for me here.

154
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,700
Here's your pen.

155
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,640
Thanks.

156
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,560
Let's go.  -Okay.

157
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,480
It's you, Solo!

158
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,720
I didn't have the chance to say thank you last time.

159
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,600
No need to thank me.

160
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,480
Xiao'ai told me

161
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,160
that you took her to the park.

162
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,520
She had a great time.

163
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,360
It's alright.

164
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,920
I had a great time, too.

165
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,680
Best of luck for the audition.

166
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,040
Thank you so much.  -Thank you.

167
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,370
Good luck.

168
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,480
We'll do our best.

169
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,500
Hey Tong Nian,

170
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,260
is that him, the legendary Solo?

171
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:35,700
Yeah.

172
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,280
Wow, dating Han Shangyan has its benefits.

173
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,880
You get to meet all the big players in this industry.

174
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
Oh, I was just saying...

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,920
Let's go. It's about to start.

176
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm the coordinator for today, Mr. Xiang.

177
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,920
Welcome to the NetEase Cloud Music audition.

178
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,800
Today,

179
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,800
we'll be recording a theme song for CTF.

180
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,850
Congrats for making it into our top 10.

181
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,870
I know you're all outstanding singers.

182
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,800
Thanks for being here.

183
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,480
Next, I'd like you to

184
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,880
introduce yourselves.

185
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,520
We'll mark you in terms of

186
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,280
tone, appearance, style

187
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,310
and improvisation.

188
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,020
Two of you will be selected accordingly

189
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,720
to compete for first place.

190
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,240
Since one of our judges

191
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,120
is stuck in traffic,

192
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,440
you can take a rest now

193
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,280
and get yourselves ready.

194
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Thanks.

195
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,040
Do you think I can win this?

196
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,800
Do you think I should sing this one?

197
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,400
Okay, go.

198
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:48,960
Yes sir.

199
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,600
Everybody,

200
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,800
one of our judges

201
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,760
can't make it today.

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,840
Shall we... start now?

203
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,550
Did he tell you he'd be here?

204
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
He didn't say he wouldn't.

205
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,120
The thing is none of us can reach him for the moment.

206
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,000
We'll have to start without him.

207
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,520
It's a great honour for me to stand here.

208
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,700
I was a big fan of team Solo before it disbanded.

209
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm a single mother.

210
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,400
Okay, relax.

211
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Is your son here?

214

Hello everyone, I'm Zhang Yunyun.

215
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,720
My name is Haha,

216
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,720
because I'm always laughing.

217
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,560
I used to weigh over 150 kilos,

218
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,610
but now I've lost 100 kilos.

219
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,520

Hello everyone, good morning.

223
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm Tong Nian.

224
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,160
I really love singing,

225
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,960
especially

226
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,920
singing to

227
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,420
the man I love.

228
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,080
I hope that listening to my song will make him happy.

229
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,730
I think music is the best way to express your feelings.

230
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,410
I always try to put my emotions into my songs.

231
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,550
Even if he doesn't like me,

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,930
and I know I can't force him to,

233
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
I still don't want to give up.

234
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,920
If I don't try to do something,

235
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,800
if I don't sing it out loud,

236
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,950
he may never know how much I love him.

237
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,830
I'm really sorry

238
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,000
for being late.

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,360
I'll just sit here.

240
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,370
No need to record my marks.

241
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,000
Take a seat.

242
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,200
Great,

243
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
our last judge

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,320
has managed to come.

245
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,880
Let me introduce you all.

246
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,210
This is the founder of the K&K club,

247
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,240
Han Shangyan,

248
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,100
who will

249
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,760
also be CTF's

250
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,360
ambassador here in China.

251
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,160
What's more,

252
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,520
he and the top 2 singers from our audition today

253
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,390
will attend the meeting with ours fans.

254
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,360
Shangyan, you came right on time.

255
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,080
We were about to choose a song

256
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,930
for Ms. Tong Nian to sing.

257
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,600
Which one do you think

258
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,160
is suitable for her?

259
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,800
Well,

260
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,450
let's hear her sing out of heart, like she just said.

261
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,640
Just sing

262
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,240
Little Donkey.

263
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,740

279
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,910
So what kind of emotions are you trying to

280
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,400
express through this song?

281
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,240
The judge just asked me to

282
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,320
sing out of my heart, like I said I would.

283
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,550
So I thought of the little donkey as someone I loved

284
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,040
when I was singing...

285
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,080
What happened to

286
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,680
your little donkey?

287
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,560
I think I've lost it.

288
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,690
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,090
The results are out.

290
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,830
If there're no further questions,

291
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,100
the winners today are

292
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,080
No.8 Lan Mei

293
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,300
and No.6, Tong Nian.

294
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,610
Shangyan, you were there too.

295
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,550
You heard her sing.

296
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,700
What do you think?

297
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,820
I... don't have any objections.

298
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,720
It's just our theme song is supposed to be

299
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,080
lighter and happier.

300
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,590
Do you really think

301
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,650
she'd be a good fit for the theme song?

302
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,090
The other judges all voted for her.

303
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,000
I think she did a good job.

304
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,210
I don't know about you guys,

305
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,480
but I was moved and won over.

306
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,460
What do you think, Solo?

307
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,210
I think Tong Nian's voice is pure and clear.

308
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,600
As pure as a child's.

309
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,880
Having a childlike voice for the theme song

310
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,400
could work well.

311
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,280
I understand Shangyan's concerns.

312
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,760
It's the theme song, after all.

313
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,000
It's very important.

314
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,280
Come on guys,

315
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,800
it was a fair competition.

316
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,560
You see,

317
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,580
she did get the highest mark.

318
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,760
Shangyan,

319
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,320
I remember you said back there

320
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,060
that you'd give no comments,

321
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,420
you'd just sit and listen.

322
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,280
You just asked for comments.

323
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,920
You asked, and I answered.

324
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,680
Okay, I have no objections.

325
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,880
Okay then.

326
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,660
You two would make a good team.

327
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,000
Wait,

328
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,840
when did I promise you I'd be the ambassador?

329
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,680
I agreed to be the judge because you're a friend.

330
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,300
I was doing you a favour.

331
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,240
I was late today because

332
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,400
one of my team members had a car accident.

333
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,210
I went to the hospital to check on him

334
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,040
to make sure he was okay.

335
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,700
I'm very sorry that I was late.

336
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,840
If there's nothing else, I'd better go.

337
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,880
You guys go ahead.

338
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,520
Shangyan, don't say that.

339
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,480
Shangyan!

340
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,840
Shangyan!

341
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,600
There he is!

342
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,200
Watch your step.

343
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,120
Congratulations!

344
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,640
Look forward to your performance.

345
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,040
Do practice the song when you get home.

346
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,080
Don't worry, Mr. Xiang.

347
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,760
We sure will.

348
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
Next Saturday at 3 pm.

349
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,640
Don't be late.

350
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,710
Solo, and Shangyan

351
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,400
will both be here,

352
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,520
and watch your performance.

353
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,480
Is that okay, Solo?

354
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,320
No problem.

355
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,000
I owe you this for helping SP.

356
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,720
I'll be here.

357
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
Mr. Xiang, are you sure

358
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,920
that Han Shangyan will be here too?

359
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,600
Of course.

360
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,240
He's got things to do so he left early.

361
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Dinner is on me

362
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,440
when you finish recording,

363
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,280
we should hang out more often.

364
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,880
Okay.

365
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,400
Okay.

366
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,400
Do you need a ride home?

367
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,480
My car's over there.

368
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,000
I can drive you home if you want.

369
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,680
No we're good.

370
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,800
Okay then, bye-bye.

371
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,800
Bye-bye.  -Bye-bye.

372
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's keep in touch then.

373
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay, Mr. Xiang. Thank you.

374
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,760
Thank you.   -Bye-bye.

375
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,520
Bye, Mr. Xiang.  -Bye-bye.

376
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,720
Tong Nian,

377
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,960
Solo and Han Shangyan are totally different.

378
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,080
To be honest,

379
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,520
every time I see Han Shangyan,

380
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,680
I get nervous.

381
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,720
Don't be, that's just the way he is.

382
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,440
Do you think he'll come?

383
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,760
To hear the recording?

384
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,880
Yeah.

385
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,640
I think... I guess he will.

386
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,040
Come on, don't worry.

387
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,230
You just need to wait one more week to see him again.

388
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,160
And then,

389
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,040
we'll ask him what he really thinks.

390
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,910
He can forget it if he's playing hard-to-get.

391
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,760
Let's go.

392
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,520
Hey, isn't that his car?

393
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,680
Okay, Tong Nian.

394
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,800
Let's do it again.

395
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,200
Okay.

396
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,200

397
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,800

It sounded like a robot singing.

409
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,440
What's going on?

410
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,120
I'm sorry, sir.

Look,

413
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
maybe we should take a break?

414
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,240
Let me go talk to her, okay?

415
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,240
Okay.

416
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Let's take a break.

417
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,040
What's the matter?

418
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,720
You look distracted.

419
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,880
Are you waiting for him?

420
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,480
He said he didn't have to come so he's not coming.

421
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
Try to concentrate, okay?

422
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,560
Just imagine he's here,

423
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,040
watching your performance.

424
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Would that make you feel better?

425
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,390
Yeah.

426
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,040
I'll leave you to it then.

427
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,520
Okay.

428
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,760

429
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,040
I'm so sorry.

430
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,160
Is she ready now?

431
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,620
How about we let her practice a few more times?

432
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,680
Practice?

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,360
normally it wouldn't take us this long.

436
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,560
What happened to you?

437
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,200
You've lost your confidence.

438
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,200
How about I go in

439
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,280
and sing with her?

440
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,840

I want to ask,

480
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,140
does the vending machine at the gate only accept coins?

481
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,680
Um... Yeah.

482
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,360
Can I get some coins from you then?

483
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,600
Coins?

484
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,120
I don't have that many here.

485
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,040
How many do you need?

486
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,960
100.

487
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,200
100?!

488
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,840
Well...

489
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,320
-Xiaofan.  -Yeah?

490
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,680

492
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,560

493
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,000

I don't know if that's enough.

502
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,400
I'll count them for you.

503

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,880
She's doing well.

515
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,700
It was terrible for the first 10 minutes.

516
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,570
I don't know what happened

517
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,850
but she's back on track now.

518
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,560
Well done!

519
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,200
That's more like you.

520
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,840
Thank you, sir.

521
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I told you not to worry!

522
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,620
If only you could sing like this from the beginning!

523
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,450
We wanted to surprise you!

524
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,840
You must be tired.

525
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,320
Guys, have some juice.

526
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,590
Wow, Mr. Xiang you are so nice.

527
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,190
What? It wasn't me.

528
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,120
Ha? Then... thank you, Solo.

529
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,130
It wasn't me, either.

530
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,520
Oh, a gentleman came over to the reception,

531
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,280
exchanged 100 coins, and bought them

532
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,380
from the vending machine.

533
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,560
What? Who is he?

534
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
He said he was your friend.

535
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
He's really cute.

536
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,040
My friend?

537
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,600
Never mind, they're free.

538
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,760
Come on.

539
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,920
Tong Nian, look at this!

540
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,650
Is this his handwriting?

541
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,530
= Good luck =

542
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,300
Is this his way of expressing love?

543
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:32,720
I need to go.

544
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,200
Where are you going?

545
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,560
Shangyan is always doing this,

546
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,280
coming and leaving without notice.

547
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,080
What?

548
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,960
Why are you staring at her?

549
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
She's my type.

550
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,520
Hey, is she seeing someone right now?

551
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,880
If not, I'd like to try my luck.

552
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,040
No you don't.

553
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,040
What's wrong?

554
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,160
She's taken?

555
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,960
Take my advice,

556
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,040
don't think about

557
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,080
going after her.

558
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,320
Understand?

559
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,320
Or you'll regret it.

560
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,080
Boss.

561
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,720
It's so late.

562
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,920
Where have you been?

563
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,560
I thought...

564
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,520
You thought what?

565
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,180
Do I need to report to you or something?

566
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,280
Boss, good night.

567
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,960
Shangyan, time to get up.

568
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,440
It's almost noon.

569
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,920
Wake up, sunshine!

570
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,040
Time to get up!

571
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,080
Jeez, my eyes!

572
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,170
Get up, hurry!

573
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,680
Are you gonna sleep the whole day?

574
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
Get up, get up!

575
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,680
Hey, you look really pale.

576
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,600
Are you sick?

577
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,960
No.

578
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,060
I'm just... feeling hungry,

579
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,200
and a bit dizzy.

580
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,130
Oh no, you've got a fever.

581
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,870
Hey, where are you going?

582
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,920
Take your temperature, hurry.

583
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,510
Oh.

584
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,840
Look,

585
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,960
you don't have to stay here.

586
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,380
I don't want to pass on the cold to you.

587
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,920
Next week,

588
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,200
you can come in,

589
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,160
tidy up and disinfect the room for me.

590
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,960
It's okay if I get sick,

591
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,310
but I can't let those boys out there catch it.

592
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,440
Okay.

593
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,650
I'll boil some water with garlic

594
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,910
and have them drink it.

595
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,360
It's good for preventing colds.

596
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,240
You don't have to worry about me.

597
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,840
I'll go get some water for you.

598
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,440
Okay.

599
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,000
Boss, you're up so early!

600
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,210
Did you sleep at all last night?

601
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,280
I only took three days off

602
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,840
and you managed to get sick?

603
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,160
I stayed up too much.

604
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,470
What have you been doing staying up?

605
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,200
Boss, we're full now.

606
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
We're off to training.

607
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,720
Yeah, let's go.

608
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,810
Wait. Hey...

609
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,710
Wu Bai.

610
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,480
I'm broke.

611
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,110
Hey, how can you say that?

612
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,390
Aren't we brothers?

613
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,620
Sorry, I have no money to lend to you.

614
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,890
I don't need your money.

615
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,920
Go to Jiaodong University

616
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,520
and drive my car back for me.

617
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,060
Why did you go there in the first place?

618
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,040
Oh yeah,

619
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,020
take some money with you

620
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,230
and fill it up for me.

621
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,880
Go now.

622
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,160
What?

623
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Why are you staring at me?

624
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,190
Didn't you tell me that

625
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,030
I get monthly allowances?

626
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,010
I thought you didn't want them.

627
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,040
Why don't you tell me

628
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,380
what is included?

629
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,920
Not much.

630
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,480
1,000 for meals,

631
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
2,000 for the car.

632
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,630
The standard package.

633
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,560
Is that enough?

634
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,710
Yeah.

635
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,870
You're not into gambling are you?

636
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,230
You're the owner of the club,

637
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,040
I thought you were rich.

638
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,810
I lost my stepmom's necklace,

639
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,920
and I gave all my savings to her.

640
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,080
Wu Bai has lent me some money,

641
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,950
but it's still not enough.

642
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,440
You poor thing.

643
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,200
Transfer this month's allowance to me first.

644
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,840
Hey, I can lend you some money if you want.

645
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:20,780
Hmm... thank you in advance.

646
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,800
Wu Bai.

647
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,360
Did you drive Shangyan's car back?

648
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,320
Right.

649
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,600
He's got a fever.

650
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,800
Go check on him.

651
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,000
A fever?

652
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,600
What else has he got?

653
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,390
Go.

654
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,000
You're sick?

655
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,200
Yeah.

656
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
You hardly ever get sick.

657
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Is this because of the break-up?

658
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,400
Do you have to bring it up now?

659
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,830
I wonder who drove to Jiaodong University

660
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,790
and left it with no gas.

661
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,660
I'm not going home today.

662
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,640
My head hurts.

663
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,000
If I go back,

664
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,400
Grandpa will nag me,

665
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,920
and I'll die of frustration.

666
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Grandpa said,

667
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,280
if you don't go home,

668
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,880
he'll come live at the club.

669
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,000
What do you think now?

670
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
You drive.

671
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,320
You filled it up, right?

672
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,720
Of course I filled it up,

673
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,440
do you need to ask?

674
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,120
Well I just wanted to double check.

675
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,240
The gauge is full.

676
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
See for yourself.

677
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,170
Do I really look like some guy

678
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,940
who's heartbroken?

679
00:33:20,979 --> 00:33:21,840
Yes.

680
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,920
You still look good though.

681
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,760
Sorry, I'm late.

682
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,440
It's okay.

683
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,960
Just sign your name here.

684
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,080
So have the others

685
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,320
all arrived by now?

686
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,840
Yes, they are all here.

687
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,950
Including a man surnamed Han?

688
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,190
A Mr. Han?

689
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,640
I don't know.

690
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,390
I don't know which one you're asking,

691
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,760
but everyone else 's here now.

692
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,360
Thanks.

693
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,160
Of course.

694
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,720
Tong Nian, you're here.

695
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,920
Sorry I'm late.

696
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,800
What's wrong?

697
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
You look disappointed.

698
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,320
I thought Han Shangyan was here.

699
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,310
I rushed here in a taxi, instead of taking the bus.

700
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,560
Never mind.

701
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,160
Later, you two can listen to it again

702
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,810
and see if there's something missing.

703
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,480
I think it's all good now.

704
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,360
Nothing's missing.

705
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,320
Look,

706
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,530
we'll listen to the recording again later.

707
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,170
Mr. Xiang.

708
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:48,800
Yeah?

709
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,090
I want to ask,

710
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,650
why aren't Solo and Han Shangyan here today?

711
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,760
They're both busy.

712
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,360
It was lucky we caught them last time.

713
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,500
They are club owners,

714
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,510
they have matches coming.

715
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,080
They don't work for us.

716
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,600
I see.

717
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
The demo's out.

718
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,280
It was quite good.

719
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,920
Thanks.

720
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,240
Mr. Xiang,

721
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,170
I'm kind of curious about Han Shangyan.

722
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,040
Could you tell us more about him?

723
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,040
You know, I've noticed

724
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,090
that all the girls ask about him

725
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,960
whether they're single or not.

726
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,430
Yeah he's good-looking.

727
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,300
Back when he was a player,

728
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,840
he had mainly female fans.

729
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,450
All of them wanted to be his girlfriend.

730
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,790
We were so jealous.

731
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,910
He's got male fans too.

732
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,790
My husband is a big fan of his.

733
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,920
He wanted to know more about him.

734
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,470
Oh, I see.

735
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,370
I thought you were interested in him.

736
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,310
No.

737
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,350
I'm married already.

738
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,230
Wow, I didn't notice.

739
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,070
What about you?

740
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,430
I'm single.

741
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,670
Let's get back to Han Shangyan.

742
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,150
Does he have a girlfriend or not?

743
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,070
I don't know about that.  -May I join you?

744
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,070
Sure.

745
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,070
He doesn't trust people easily.

746
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,950
But he trusts you,

747
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,390
he'll be a most loyal friend.

748
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,990
If he doesn't,

749
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,430
then he keeps his distance.

750
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,750
It's not a bad thing though.

751
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,030
He's a reliable man.

752
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,990
He's honest.

753
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,390
What about now?

754
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,430
Now?

755
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,550
Is he seeing anyone... right now?

756
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,430
I guess he is?

757
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,590
He is?!  -He is?!

758
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,720
There was this girl in our company

759
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,870
who's obsessed with him.

760
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,230
But,

761
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,230
people from K&K told me that

762
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,750
he had got a girlfriend.

763
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,710
When did you hear that?

764
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,070
The last few days.

765
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,470
Before that I heard nothing.

766
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,790
Guess they just started dating.

767
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,470
It seems that he doesn't

768
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,510
want people to know.

769
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,940
This guy is so heartless!

770
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,990
He just broke up with you,

771
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,110
I mean like days ago.

772
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,390
Two weeks.

773
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,190
Two weeks...

774
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,180
I really hate guys who jump straight onto a new girl.

775
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,310
I mean,

776
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,250
he wasn't even sad for a little bit?

777
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,950
If you ask me,

778
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,170
he doesn't care about you at all.

779
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,950
I wish I had seen through him earlier.

780
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,600
I'll have to give my husband a good kick.

781
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,550
How can he worship a guy like this?

782
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,150
Tong Nian,

783
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,670
don't waste another second on him, okay?

784
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,230
Douchbag!

785
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,020
This project was completed by us

786
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,280
and some researchers at Jiaodong University.

787
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,950
Jiaodong University?

788
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,910
Isn't that Tong Nian's school?

789
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,030
I think so.

790
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,160
Shangyan's girlfriend

791
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,690
is a real talent,

792
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,750
just like you,

793
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,910
she's a scientist!

794
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,700
Tong Nian hasn't been around for a while.

795
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,600
Yeah.

796
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,550
Do you know why?

797
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,190
No idea.

798
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,790
Wu Bai,

799
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,040
I can tell when you are lying.

800
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,070
Just tell me,

801
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,110
what's going on?

802
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,310
Why not go ask Shangyan?

803
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,030
I'm asking you!

804
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,640
It seems

805
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,390
they had a fight or something.

806
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,070
Ask Shangyan

807
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,670
if you want to know the details.

808
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:41,990
Morning.

809
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,030
Morning.

810
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,070
Hey, you're up.

811
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,710
You feel better?

812
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,470
Yeah, much better.

813
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,550
That's good.

814
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,400
Hurry and go bring Tong Nian over here.

815
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,710
What for?

816
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,790
It's her birthday today.

817
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,590
Is it?

818
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,510
What does it have to do with me?

819
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,880
Did you forget or did you never know?

820
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,550
She never told me.

821
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,270
She's your girlfriend and you don't know?

822
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,230
You know why I know?

823
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,470
During the Spring Festival,

824
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,110
when we were on that blind date,

825
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,520
I managed to get that info from her mom.

826
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,340
You are welcome!

827
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,390
You talk too much.

828
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,350
What did you say?

829
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,230
Oh, nothing.

830
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,230
I talk too much?

831
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,990
Yeah, yeah.

832
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,430
That's how I found out about her birthday.

833
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,030
I went up and asked her mom

834
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,990
and she told me that.

835
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,510
I haven't had a decent meal for days.

836
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,640
Can I just sit down and eat, please?

837
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,670
Eat whatever you want.

838
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,990
I'm not stopping you.

839
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,230
Shangyan,

840
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,970
I really like Tong Nian, you know that.

841
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,870
She's so sweet and innocent.

842
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,310
She's smart too.

843
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,790
I was watching the news

844
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,270
and it said the university she goes to

845
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,590
has a key national lab!

846
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,670
I mean,

847
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,230
isn't she good enough for you?

848
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,910
I'm not enough for her, okay?

849
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,310
Glad you realized that.

850
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,430
I'm not finished yet!

851
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,550
Someone in this world likes you,

852
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,590
that's a miracle.

853
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,910
And she's such a nice girl!

854
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,430
That's even more miraculous!

855
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,030
Are you going to get her or not?

856
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,830
No.

857
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,670
You won't listen to me?

858
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,830
She's still a student!

859
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,350
She should focus on her studies!

860
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,870
It's Sunday today okay?

861
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,790
Just go.

862
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,430
No.

863
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,110
If you don't,

864
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:53,870
I won't eat anything today.

865
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,190
Oh my goodness.

866
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,550
Threatening me with a hunger strike?

867
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,830
I won't eat anything tomorrow!

868
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,950
Drop the act, your heart is fine.

869
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,030
I'm telling you,

870
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,550
you know what I'm like.

871
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,870
Are you going or not?

872
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,670
So it was you huh?

873
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,110
What did you say to Grandpa?

874
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,700
Nothing.

875
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,910
Okay.

876
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,910
I'll go get her.

877
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,750
But I have a condition.

878
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,310
He has to go with me.

879
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,470
Me?

880
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,590
People from K&K told me that

881
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,180
he had got a girlfriend.

882
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,110
When did you hear that?

883
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,510
The last few days.

884
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:23,950
Yeah?

885
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,190
Tong Nian, come here.

886
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,390
What's up?

887
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:35,910
Are you busy right now?

888
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,950
I'm supervising them.

889
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,920
Did you forget something today?

890
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,150
Did I?

891
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,830
You must've forgotten.

892
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,270
Can we talk in private?

893
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,230
Wait for me here.

894
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,830
Okay.

895
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,350
When the class is over,

896
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,950
you may leave the classroom.

897
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,000
Focus on your studies when you're in here.
