Come on!

28
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,200
Hi. What are you doing?

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm here to drink.  -Come on with us.

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,440
What's up?

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,840
Leave me alone!

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,720
Let's have a drink.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,579
Release me!

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,260
What are you doing?

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,880
What do you want? Release me! Release me!

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,520
No! No!

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,600
Han Shangyan!

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,800
Help me! Han Shangyan!

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,120
Go away! Stay away from me.

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,000
Han Shangyan!

41
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,880
Leave me alone!

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840

43
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,080
Leave him alone!

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,920
Han Shangyan!

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,800
Put it down!

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,030
You always solve problems with violence!

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,250
You say, I only solve problems using violence?

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,760
That's not what I meant.

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,000
Perhaps they didn't mean any harm.

50
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,280
It was a language barrier.

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,720
We can talk with them.

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,320
Alright?

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,880
Put it down.

Stop!

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,120
Just kidding.

58
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,040
Han Shangyan!

59
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,760
Leave him alone.

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,920
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

61
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,200
Are you okay?

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,080

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,920
He's been like this since 10 years ago.

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,920
Give him some time to calm down.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll talk to him later.

76
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,170
Alright?

77
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,400
Don't worry.

78
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,680
Excuse me, Miss.

79
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,640
You forgot your cake and coffee.

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,760
Thank you.

81
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,840
You're welcome.

82
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,830
I was about to celebrate his birthday,

83
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,640
so I secretly ordered this cake.

84
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,840
It's my fault.

85
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,880
I screwed everything up.

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,880
Don't blame yourself.

87
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,040
I'll give it to him.

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,320
Get some rest.

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm not in a good mood.

90
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,880
You'd better leave me alone.

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
I don't get it.

92
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,430
Solo and I both made you an offer.

93
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,030
What made you choose him?

94
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,250
Do you want the truth?

95
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,019
I do.

96
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
Out of the 5, we are most alike.

97
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,440
We never fought in other teams.

98
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,890
Solo is the only captain we trust.

99
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,080
We retired at the same time.

100
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,620
Solo is not only a friend of mine,

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,220
he is the symbol of my spirit.

102
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,200
He represents the birth of my dream.

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,880
Han Shangyan,

104
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,730
you know very well what I mean.

105
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,960
I knew our team disbanded

106
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,520
because of Solo and Ai Qing.

107
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,470
But Han Shangyan,

108
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,220
you can't sentence them to death

109
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,040
and make them guilty

110
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,880
for the rest of their lives

111
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,710
because one mistake they made when they were young.

112
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,480
Coffee.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Cake.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
Ai Qing asked me to bring them to you.

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,560
She bought them for you.

116
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,800
Don't push yourself too hard.

117
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Bandage your hands.

118
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
This is what we three want to say to you.

119
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,020
Happy Birthday, Han Shangyan.

120
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,400
Are you in a meeting?

121
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,490
Or are you training?

122
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,520
Phone calls may disturb you

123
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,160
so I'll use voice message.

124
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,080
Happy Valentine's Day!

125
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,000
Happy Birthday!

126
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,880
Am I a clever girl?

127
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,400
I still remember your birthday.

128
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,560
Hope your job in Norway goes well.

129
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,960
You should be happy on your birthday.

130
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,920
I almost forgot!

131
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,280
This is the last one!

132
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,370
Good night and sweet dreams.

133
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,430

Hi.

156
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,160
This is my bro. Best homie.

157
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,920
Nice to meet you. I'm Shaofei.

Nice to meet you. I'm Judy.

159
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,080
Will you stay in Norway?

160
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,240
No. I'm settled in China now.

161
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
What a pity!

162
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,320
I like a man who loves cats.

163
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,080
Enjoy yourselves.

164
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,240
I'll go and pack up my stuff.

165
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,480
I'll leave Alice with you.

166
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,680
Take care of her.

167
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,320
Thanks.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,320
She likes you.

169
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,080
You haven't changed.

170
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,760
You still like cats.

You came here right after the team disbanded.

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I went to university first.

175
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,160
After graduation I started my business

176
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
and founded K&K.

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,360
I fully respect you.

178
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
I love CTF,

179
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,760
but I did nothing more than playing it

180
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,600
in my spare time.

181
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,920
You're different.

182
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,190
You are brave enough to make it your life.

183
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,740
You are the real CTF fan.

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,560
But I can read it in your eyes,

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,400
you want to do something.

186
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,450
Your eyes give you away.

187
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,120
Is everything okay in SP?

188
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,170
Is there any team in-fighting?

189
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Are you isolated?

190
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,000
Mr. Mi?

191
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,120
Don't be jealous.

192
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,430
SP is a friendly company.

193
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
It feels exactly the same as Solo team used to.

194
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,680
After all, Solo is the boss.

195
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,860
His team won't be a bad one.

196
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,000
Alright.

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,960
Good luck.

198
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,840
As a new member,

199
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,830
you must impress him with your performance.

200
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,080
Don't worry about me.

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,440
I'll perform well tomorrow.

202
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,120
Happy Birthday!

203
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,040
Cliche.

204
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,920
It's not cliche!

205
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,200
Life is a struggle.

206
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Ever since we were born,

207
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,380
we have to face difficulties.

208
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:23,130
Is it worthwhile?

209
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,220
Without these difficulties,

210
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,090
you would never know what happiness is.

211
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,280
Listen up.

212
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,200
We are born to see this world,

213
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,520
enjoy ourselves

214
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
and fight for what we want.

215
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,040
Time's up!

216
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,040
Be ready!

217
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,760
Let's go.

218
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,320
Let's go.

219
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,240
Boys!

220
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,480
Enjoy the game.

221
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
No problem!

222
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm not nervous.

223
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,320
We can at least make it to top 5.

224
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:32,960
It's easy.

225
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,840
Can you be more ambitious?

226
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,480
Listen up.

227
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,310
This is the first time you're representing China.

228
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,920
It's okay if you lose the game

229
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,560
to someone more skillful than us.

230
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,650
But you can't give up the game,

231
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,920
before it's truly over.

232
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,440
Do you hear me?

233
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,360
Yes, boss!

234
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,200
Wu Bai.

235
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,240
As the captain,

236
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,680
is there anything you would like to say?

237
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,140
We're not fighting for our own glory.

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,120
We're fighting

239
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,040
to make China a true contender in the CTF world.

240
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
Come on! Cheer for us.

241
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,360
Come on!

242
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,320
Team China. Go!

243
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,280
As network technology is quickly advancing,

244
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,680
cyber security is under threat.

245
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,520
Today,

246
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,490
top CTF players from around the world

247
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,760
will compete for the trophy

248
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,760
for their countries.

249
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

250
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
welcome to the CTF All-star

251
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,520
one-on-one Invitational live show

252
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,640
in downtown Norway.

253
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,040
Today, the 50 best players from 34 countries

254
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,720
will compete for the single star

255
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,500
in the CTF World Hall of Fame.

256
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,840
Good to see you again.

257
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,160
Nice to see you, Archie.

258
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
Welcome everyone to the

259
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,640
CTF All-Star Invitational live show.

260
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,040
I'm your commentator KK.

261
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
To my right

262
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,360
sits our old friend, Archie.

263
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,200
On my left,

264
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,480
sits our gorgeous commentator.

265
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,790
Please introduce yourself.

266
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,579
Hi, everyone. My name is Phraes.

267
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,320
Alright.

268
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,310
So today we have the 50 top players

269
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,660
from 34 countries all over the world

270
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,670
competing for a single star in this live show.

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,420
The winner will mark their name

272
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,390
in the CTF World Hall of Fame.

273
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,630
First of all, it's time to draw lots!

274
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,640
All players please take out your phones,

275
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,840
press start and draw lots

276
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,400
for your competition.

277
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,440
Now let's move our focus to the screen

278
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,890
where photos of players will be displayed.

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,270
Now I have a question

280
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,110
for our old friend, Archie.

281
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,220
Who are the top contenders in the competition?

282
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,000
It's hard to say.

283
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,800
We've got great competitors this year.

284
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,080
We've got DT from China.

285
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,560
We've got Naya from Norway.

286
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,240
2 of the best players in the world.

287
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,400
So, we'll see what will happen.

288
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,280
So, as we heard,

289
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,860
Archie also speaks highly of DT from China.

290
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,480
But I must say,

291
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,270
the competition today will be tough for DT.

292
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,840
Yes.

293
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,200
No matter who he competes with,

294
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,040
he must try his best to win.

295
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,600
Xiaomi's competitor is a tough one.

296
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,160
He's in a dangerous predicament now.

297
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,250
Okay.

298
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,560
Xiaomi vs. Naya?

299
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,520
Relax. Calm down.

300
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,920
Relax. Calm down.

301
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,360
I told you to relax!

302
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,520
It's painful!

303
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,979
What are you doing? Be quiet.

304
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,380
Calm down.

305
00:17:58,459 --> 00:17:59,040
Watch.

306
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,680
This is an important game.

307
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,560
Don't underestimate your rivals.

308
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,640
He is a good player.

309
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,920
I am a good one too.

310
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
I'll beat him.

311
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:13,960
How is it going?

312
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,960
Whose turn is it?

313
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,520
Anyone else?

314
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,680
K&K team all finished the 1st round.

315
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,660
Wu Bai and Grunt won for now.

316
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,800
No doubt.

317
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,600
What about our team?

318
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,400
Lin Yin won so far.

319
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,420
Ou Qiang is up next.

320
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,680
Alright.

321
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,560
Now we have All from China

322
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,080
versus Play from Columbia.

323
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,550
All is being pretty aggressive now.

324
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,600
A surprise for a player who specializes in defense.

325
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,960
Right! 1 point for All.

326
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,440
Here comes the second round.

327
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,030
All quickly found another loophole.

328
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,630
Play has recognized his change of attack.

329
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,640
Congratulations to All!

330
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,400
He won this game!

331
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,510
Awesome!

332
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,600
All is still a tough competitor.

333
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,640
Ou Qiang hasn't played for years.

334
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
After such a long time,

335
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,990
he is still in top condition.

336
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,450
His golden streak is longer than I expected.

337
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,920
According to the results of the first round,

338
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
it is very likely that a Chinese player

339
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,960
will be the ultimate champion!

340
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,880
Who do you think will win the trophy?

341
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,920
It must be...

342
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,440
What?

343
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,880
Are you going to say someone from K&K?

344
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,760
It's okay.

345
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,240
This is a world competition.

346
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,000
We all represent China.

347
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,480
As long as a Chinese player wins the game,

348
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,840
we should be proud.

349
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,960
I guess I can say it now.

350
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,160
DT is most likely to win.

351
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,240
He always ranks first in CTF.

352
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,000
So, I believe,

353
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,540
he will continue his winning streak.

354
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,720
What?

355
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,440
Why are you giggling?

356
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Are you his groupie?

357
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,320
But I admit,

358
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,680
Han Shangyan's brother,

359
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,800
is a real genius.

360
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,080
He is just like Han Shangyan 10 years ago.

361
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,880
Is Xiaomi alright?

362
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,530
There is another apparent loophole.

363
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,440
Xiaomi's got too many loopholes today.

364
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,080
Xiaomi has lost 3 points.

365
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,040
Our competition today includes 3 modes,

366
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,660
which are Jeopardy, Attack-Defense, and Mix.

367
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,220
Players must be good at server attack-defense,

368
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,960
exploitation and utilization of loopholes

369
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,490
and many other cyber security problems.

370
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,080
Naya wins the game easily!

371
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,590
Congratulations to Naya

372
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,660
for winning the competition.

373
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,960
Despite the result,

374
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,720
Xiaomi has shown us a great battle

375
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,960
of brilliant defensive action.

376
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,640
But personally, I think,

377
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,840
during this game

378
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Xiaomi was clearly panicking.

379
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,760
Although Xiaomi played his hardest,

380
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,800
he still lost.

381
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,920
I think it's time for Xiaomi to reflect on

382
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,320
if he is still capable of competing in CTF.

383
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,940
So once again,

384
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,880
congratulations to Naya from Norway.

385
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,800
Let's also give applause

386
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,530
to Xiaomi from China.

387
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,600
Are you okay?

388
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,600
Alright. As we sit here,

389
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,670
the first round of our competition

390
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,640
has come to an end.

391
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,480
Yes. I think that the

392
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
Chinese players' first round performance

393
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,200
was quite outstanding.

394
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,280
You're right.

395
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,640
Except for Xiaomi

396
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,470
who lost to Norway's top player, Naya,

397
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,440
the other 5 Chinese players

398
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,140
successfully moved to the second round.

399
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,180
Wu Bai retains first place in the CTF World ranking.

400
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,020
Naya is a strong competitor too.

401
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,450
I think he's capable of beating DT

402
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,800
in the following rounds.

403
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,550
Actually, we do expect an epic battle

404
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,280
between these 2 players.

405
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,540
It will definitely be a spectacle

406
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,940
both for the audience and for us.

407
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:53,600
Right.

408
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,120
So, please don't switch the channel

409
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,360
and stick around for this afternoon.

410
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,260
The second round is coming soon.

411
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,640
Be ready for this afternoon.

412
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Ou Qiang, where is Shaofei?

413
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
He said he isn't hungry.

414
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,040
He wanted to go out for a walk.

415
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,160
What? Defeated?

416
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,560
Can't I be vulnerable?

417
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,840
It's only one game.

418
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,680
So many feelings.

419
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,040
This is the first time I've competed abroad.

420
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,100
I truly expected cheers and adulation.

421
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,640
You still have many other chances.

422
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm old.

423
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,320
You're younger than I am.

424
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,720
How can you say you're old?

425
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,720
Wu Bai really is a good player.

426
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
He is very much like you.

427
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,650
How can you compare him to me?

428
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,040
Shaofei.

429
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,080
Put aside your sadness,

430
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,160
and cheer for Team China.

431
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,200
Right on!

432
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
I knew you would be here.

433
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,680
This is your method of preparing yourself.

434
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,320
I've heard about it.

435
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
You enjoy being alone,

436
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,570
especially before international competitions.

437
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,160
Some people like to be surrounded.

438
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,000
But I prefer solitude.

439
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
Am I disturbing you?

440
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,880
Honestly speaking...

441
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,400
a little bit.

442
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm sorry.

443
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,800
Then let me make it short.

444
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,600
The reason I'm here today

445
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,240
is to tell you to go get it.

446
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,120
All these years,

447
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,920
I've seen your talent and endeavor.

448
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,680
So, I believe,

449
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,060
you'll claim first prize for China.

450
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,520
In fact...

451
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,060
I aim at winning, not only for China,

452
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,360
but also for you

453
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,500
on an international stage.

454
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,840
Thank you,

455
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,360
for liking me that much.

456
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,240
You know what?

457
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,830
In the year your team became champions,

458
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,920
I was just a high school student.

459
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,760
The moment I saw you on that stage,

460
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,920
I swore to myself

461
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,560
that I would be as good as you someday.

462
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,080
Standing on the stage,

463
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,040
right in front of you,

464
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,240
and receiving the trophy that I deserve.

465
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,530
I've been watching your performance

466
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,160
in the Invitational Competition

467
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,040
and the world tournament.

468
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,280
I know you're good enough.

469
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,600
That's not the point.

470
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,910
I chose CTF because of you.

471
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,250
So, today's result will mean a lot to me.

472
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,680
I'll make it.

473
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,120
As a matter of fact,

474
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,200
you are already a star in my heart.

475
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,800
Good luck.

476
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,800
Summer! Summer! Did you see it?

477
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,280
It's Han Shangyan's team.

478
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,690
Let's wish him good luck! Okay?

479
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,880
Come on! Han Shangyan!

480
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,680
Come on! Han Shangyan!

481
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,320
Isn't he handsome?

482
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,440
Alright! Welcome back!

483
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Here comes our final battle for today!

484
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,290
This is the battle between DT from China

485
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,360
and Naya from Norway.

486
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,920
We all know that DT ranks first.

487
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,360
But we can't omit the fact that

488
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,280
Naya from Norway ranks second.

489
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,440
What's more, they've never competed before.

490
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,490
But according to their performances this year,

491
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Naya's number of victories

492
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,790
is actually 3 more than DT's.

493
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,840
I also heard that

494
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,190
Naya has studied Wu Bai's strategy intensively

495
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,160
for over a month.

496
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,320
In these conditions,

497
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,540
I'll assume this will be a difficult battle for Wu Bai.

498
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,180
Yes.

499
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,640
Now let's give these 2 players

500
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,080
a warm welcome!

501
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,500
= World's No.1, World's No.2 =

502
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,640
Alright. Let's countdown! 10!

503
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,160
9.

504
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,920
8.

505
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,600
7.

506
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,360
6.

507
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,120
5.

508
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,920
4.

509
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,520
3.

510
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
2.

511
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,860
1!

512
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,700
Go!

513
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,200
The mode for this battle

514
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,960
is Mix mode.

515
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,720
Yes.

516
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,360
Mix mode contains 2 parts,

517
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,320
Jeopardy and Attack-Defense.

518
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,800
10 information puzzles. 10 nodes.

519
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,960
Either breaking down your opponent's nodes,

520
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,680
or solving 10 puzzles

521
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,520
to win the game.

522
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,440
DT, Naya.

523
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,800
Which one would you choose?

524
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,200
DT has chosen puzzle solving

525
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,120
which Asian players dominate in.

526
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,260
Alright! The first puzzle is solved by DT.

527
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,760
The second and third puzzle

528
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,800
are both shown in DT's screen.

529
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,520
DT is pausing. What is he thinking about?

530
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,240
Is this an opportunity for Naya?

531
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,640
What happened?

532
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,160
Is he solving both at the same time?

533
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,880
Nice! Both solved!

534
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,360
Is he crazy now?

535
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,440
The fourth, fifth and the sixth puzzles!

536
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,680
3 of them! All 3!

537
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,400
I've commentated for CTF for so many years,

538
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,200
but I've never seen such a player!

539
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,000
DT's done it!

540
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,480
He's like a monster!

541
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,120
Did you see it?

542
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,660
This is what the world's best can do!

543
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,180
What happened?

544
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,560
DT made a mistake in the seventh puzzle!

545
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,840
It's Naya!

546
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,200
He's attacking DT's server!

547
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,880
He is not solving the puzzle at all!

548
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,280
He is like a Viking!

549
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,760
Plunder! Plunder! And plunder!

550
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,000
Naya got 3 nodes at the same time!

551
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,720
DT is forced to stop!

552
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,320
He's trapped by this Viking warrior.

553
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,880
I would be as good as you some day.

554
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,280
Standing on the stage,

555
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,320
right in front of you,

556
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,520
and receiving the trophy that I deserve.

557
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,210
I chose CTF because of you.

558
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,590
So, today's result will mean a lot to me.

559
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,120
I'll make it.

560
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
DT doesn't have much time left.

561
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,960
There's little chance for victory.

562
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,440
The ninth node!

563
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I believe the winner will be Naya!

564
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,080
Wait a moment!

565
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,499
Naya has suddenly lost 5 nodes!

566
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:38,979
What happened?

567
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,680
Nice!

568
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,960
All Naya's loopholes have been attacked!

569
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,960
DT set a trap for Naya!

570
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,280
He was not solving puzzles!

571
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,440
Naya is now totally under DT's control!

572
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,720
DT made Naya believe he was solving puzzles,

573
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,080
and neglected any defensive action.

574
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,600
However, this was all a trap!

575
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,000
Naya is forced to defend now!

576
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,800
He's using all his power to stop DT.

577
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,480
But it appears he won't be able to stop him.

578
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,400
Even!

579
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,520
Last step and DT will have the trophy!

580
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,000
Naya seems exhausted.

581
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,120
Let's have a look at DT's screen.

582
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
What? While attacking so fast,

583
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,120
DT is still solving the puzzles!

584
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,560
4 puzzles!

585
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,120
3 puzzles left.

586
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,400
The last one!

587
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,880
DT has paused.

588
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,320
His finger is on the enter button.

589
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,160
He pressed it!

590
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,920
As the last puzzle is being solved,

591
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,240
Naya's server has also been hacked!

592
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,760
Nice!

593
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

594
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,360
and viewers at home in front of your TVs,

595
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
congratulate the winner

596
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,180
of this year's CTF Invitational Competition.

597
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,120
The winner is DT from China!

598
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,930
Second place goes to Naya from Norway.

599
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,080
Third place goes to Lin Yin from China.

600
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,000
Congratulations!

601
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,280
China has taken first and third place

602
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,930
in this year's Invitational Competition.

603
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,120
Bravo China!

604
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,880
Yes.

605
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,720
Let's applaud these 3 players!

606
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,280
Summer! We won!

607
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Do you want the meat?

608
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,160
Summer! Summer!

609
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,560
Summer! Summer! Summer! Summer!

610
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,480
It's noisy here.

611
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,160
Can you hear me?

612
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,440
Han Shangyan!

613
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,240
It's me! Tong Nian!

614
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,760
I just watched your competition.

615
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,200
Congratulations to all of you!

616
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,360
Thanks!

617
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,200
Do you want to hear them cheering?

618
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,760
I do! I do!

619
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Hey! I have an interview now.

620
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,080
Talk to you later.

621
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,400
Han Shangyan. I...

622
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,180
I...

623
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,360
Congratulations.

624
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:15,920
Mom!

625
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,190
What's wrong with you?

626
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,160
K&K is the world champion!

627
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,400
Are you crazy?

628
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,920
You're being too noisy.

629
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
What is KKK?

630
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,680
K who? K what?

631
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
I'll KO you if you continue.

632
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,200
It's Han Shangyan's team.

633
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,640
K&K. It just won the world championship.

634
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,760
Third place went to China, too.

635
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,000
But a player from another team.

636
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,320
In short, Han Shangyan is the best!

637
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,000
Wait a moment.

638
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,720
Come here. Come here.

639
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,030
Han Shangyan's team won the world championship?

640
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,320
My daughter has excellent taste!

641
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,320
No! No!

642
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,040
Where are you going?

643
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,520
To watch the award ceremony!

644
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,760
My daughter has excellent taste.

645
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,680
She is...

646
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,000
Breakfast.

647
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,320
Breakfast.

648
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

649
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,190
welcome back to 2019 CTF

650
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,200
All-star Invitational.

651
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,360
Welcome back to the CTF All-star Invitational.

652
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,280
This year's competition has come to an end.

653
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,590
Now let's give a warm welcome

654
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,000
to the host for the award presentation.

655
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,600
And now,

656
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,200
in third place,

657
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,420
hailing from the People's Republic of China,

658
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Inin!

659
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,870
Congratulations! Thanks!

660
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,760
In second place!

661
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,160
Congratulations.

662
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,520
And now,

663
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:06,220
the champion of the 2019 CTF

664
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,830
All-star Invitational is...

665
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,720
DT, Wu Bai!

666
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,350
Nice work!

667
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,460

I can't believe you brought the flag.

683
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,280
Wu Bai is the best player,

684
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,760
of course, I was prepared.

685
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,960
SP doesn't need to do this.

686
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,880
Are you provoking me?

Congratulations.

Hi,

720
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,880
may I... have an interview with you?

721
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,990
Don't waste your time on me.

722

They are the stars today.

723
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,440
Another one!

724
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,560
Come on!

725
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,259
Have a beer!

726
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,620
Cheers!

Congratulations! It's a good start!

728
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,360
You're right.

729
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,080
I finally have something to show headquarters.

730
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,570
I'm so grateful to you

731
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,720
for supporting my choice at that time

732
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,380
to start the branch team one year earlier.

733
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,400
Don't mention it.

734
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,040
We are brothers.

735
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,560
This is your dream.

736
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,220
I must help you. Right?

737
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,040
But...

738
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,560
I have to tell you something.

739
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,000
That friend of yours didn't play very well.

740
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,560
Mi Shaofei?

741
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,590
I watched the whole game.

742
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,990
All the other Chinese players were good

743
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,250
but he is below average.

744
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,550
It's not his real strength.

745
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,150
He must be very depressed now.

746
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Why are you in such a rush?

747
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,610
I didn't finish doing my hair!

748
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,570
How do I look?

749
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,660
Let's go! Let's enjoy ourselves.

750
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,960
-I am enjoying myself.  -I know.

751
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,200
Where are we going?

752
