Han Shangyan.

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,280
I need to sleep.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
What's wrong?

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,760
Who's this?

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,680
It's past midnight.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,760
It's you.

35
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,560
What happened?

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,800
Had a fight with your girlfriend?

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,430
Staying here is not going to help.

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,620
If I hadn't seen your car at night,

39
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,240
I would have thought you were a thief.

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,680
How do you know I'm not?

41
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,720
This's where the girl lives.

42
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,480
I know.

43
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,280
What if I know her

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,560
but I'm a bad guy?

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Be careful.

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
You're so stubborn.

47
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,600
You didn't mean that, right?

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,600
Well, you really did have a fight.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,400
It's OK.

50
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,960
My wife and I fight all the time.

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,360
I was like you when I was young.

52
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,520
I waited for her in front of her place every day,

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
couldn't sleep anyway.

54
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,720
And you know why?

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,240
I kept waiting until she went out.

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,480
You think I was being romantic?

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,640
Not at all.

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,760
After she went out,

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,600
we kept fighting.

60
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,280
When women start to argue with you,

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,040
they never stop.

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,960
You think you can ignore them.

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
But then,

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,520
they keep fighting with you.

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,540
They want to argue with you about the past.

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,160
If we all had such good memories,

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,600
then all of us would be going to top universities.

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm talking to you.

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,800
Say something.

70
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,000
It goes both ways, right?

71
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,600
If you don't have anything else,

72
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,240
you should go on patrolling.

73
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,560
Candy.

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,600
Eat more candy. Smoke less.

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,080
Your wife would be happy about it.

76
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
Why are you up so early?

77
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,160
Boss, you're early too.

78
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,280
Answer me.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,720
Why are you up so early?

80
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,960
The new rankings came out yesterday.

81
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm only No.71.

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,760
The captain is No. 1 again.

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm afraid to see him

84
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,440
in case he'd say I'm holding the team back.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,560
So, I'm up early

86
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,200
to watch videos of his games,

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,870
and other important international competitions.

88
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,960
I hope to learn something from them.

89
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm impressed.

90
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,560
Since you've seen me,

91
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,560
when they're up,

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,560
tell them that

93
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,080
I'm going back to report to headquarters.

94
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,280
I won't be coming to the game next week.

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,480
What?

96
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,600
You're not going?

97
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,790
But the event has been promoted.

98
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,080
That's got nothing to do with me.

99
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,360
Boss,

100
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,040
you don't know coz you don't have Weibo.

101
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,100
The official promotion said you were gonna be there.

102
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,760
It's a kind of publicity stunt.

103
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,480
Why didn't I know this?

104
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,840
It's on the Internet. It's just a stunt.

105
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,200
And, if you don't show up,

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,760
people will be disappointed.

107
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,960
I've let lots of people down.

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,560
It won't change anything.

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,080
I'm off now.

110
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
You're really not going?

111
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,360
If it were me,

112
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,410
with all those fans waiting for me,

113
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,200
I'd go even if it was pouring.

114
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,960
Competition

115
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,000
is not about fans but about honor.

116
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,960
Got it?

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,920
Yes.

118
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,240
And,

119
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,440
my Chinese phone

120
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,000
won't be working when I'm in Norway.

121
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,640
If you want to contact me,

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,000
call my other one.

123
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,440
OK.

124
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,280
Okay, let's go.

125
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,760
Tong Nian,  -Hi.

126
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,480
you're so early today.

127
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,640
I brought you breakfast.

128
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,600
Wow, Tong Nian,

129
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,560
are they for us?

130
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,160
97.

131
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,610
You're so good to us even when the boss isn't here.

132
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,040
You're like a sister.

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,200
Let me take them to the others.

134
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,360
Your said your boss isn't here?

135
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,120
Where did he go?

136
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
You don't know?

137
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,720
No.

138
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,080
He went abroad.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,320
He didn't tell me.

140
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,640
He didn't?

141
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,240
He should have told you.

142
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,450
Anyway, we'll have your breakfast.

143
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Thank you.

144
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,280
Come in.

145
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,920
You came straight to have lunch

146
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,080
once you arrived huh?

147
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,230
You know how to enjoy life.

148
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,400
Where's my money?

149
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,350
Pay me back.

150
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,750
Didn't I transfer it all to your account?

151
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,870
You think that's enough?

152
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,680
My stuff has appreciated in value.

153
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,720
I'm broke now.

154
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,520
Nothing you say will help.

155
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,320
You gave it to a girl, right?

156
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,480
Wu Bai told me.

157
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,960
Alright.

158
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,320
I forced him.

159
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,240
You always inquire about your ex-husband's son,

160
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,680
won't your husband-to-be be mad?

161
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,680
As long as you still call me mom,

162
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,560
I'd be responsible for you.

163
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,000
Look at you,

164
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,120
you never smile.

165
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,440
Right, that's adorable.

166
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,200
I planned to bring you a gift.

167
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,600
But I only have a few hundred yuan in my account.

168
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,440
So,

169
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,840
I decided to buy you lunch.

170
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,080
You didn't deny it.

171
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,840
Which means that

172
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,520
you did give it to a girl.

173
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
Son, come with me.

174
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,560
Come on.

175
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,640
Did you pay the bill?

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
Nan Wei paid.

177
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,200
Alright.

178
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
Hurry up. Let's go.

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,500
Hurry.

180
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,240
Here, take a look.

181
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,872
These are part of my dowries

182
00:10:18,873 --> 00:10:20,510
from when I married your father.

183
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,120
I think this is the watch.

184
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,080
It's not.

185
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,480
No, it's not the watch.

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,400
The box has the watch.

187
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,480
Look, here's the watch.

188
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,000
And this one.

189
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,640
They're emeralds.

190
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,120
Right,

191
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,880
and this.

192
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,600
This is a whole set of rubies.

193
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,480
They're worth a lot of money.

194
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,000
This one's the most valuable.

195
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,460
Look.

196
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
This jade bracelet

197
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,400
was from my grandma.

198
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,120
It's a family heirloom.

199
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,640
I'm too fond of it to wear it.

200
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
Very valuable.

201
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm giving all of them to you.

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,480
After my wedding,

203
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,960
you can use them to propose.

204
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,920
No thanks.

205
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,360
Take them back.

206
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,960
What do you mean?

207
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,100
Is it that they're second-hand?

208
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
It doesn't matter for jewelry.

209
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,920
Well, you don't know about these things.

210
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,000
I said, no thanks.

211
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,440
You were dumped?

212
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,600
No way.

213
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,760
You're so handsome.

214
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,520
How could you be dumped?

215
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
Is it because that girl

216
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,880
cares more about money?

217
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,560
Stop it.

218
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm serious about this.

219
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,000
Look at you now,

220
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,520
you're not making an effort.

221
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
I'm in my 40s,

222
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,720
and I've been married twice.

223
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,080
You're almost 30,

224
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,680
but you can't even get a girlfriend.

225
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,440
Can you stop?

226
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Seeing you like this,

227
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,960
how can I get married in two days

228
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,760
without worrying about you?

229
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,760
You've been rebellious since you were a child,

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
making trouble all the time.

231
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,920
Well, now you've made

232
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,880
all these gifts

233
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,480
seem pointless.

234
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,520
Honestly,

235
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,600
is it true that I was rebellious when I was younger?

236
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
Well, not really.

237
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,040
It's something that everyone has to go through.

238
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
When I was young,

239
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,240
I was more rebellious than you.

240
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,000
After today,

241
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,400
you won't have a chance to scold me.

242
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,280
It's not true.

243
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,880
Since you were little,

244
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,720
I've been looking after you.

245
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,800
No matter what,

246
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,720
before I die,

247
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,120
I will fulfill my responsibility to you.

248
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,000
You're not my real mother.

249
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,440
Move on when you should.

250
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,800
Well people have feelings.

251
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,520
I still remember the day

252
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,920
when I first saw you,

253
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,640
you were like

254
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,400
this tall, right?

255
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,400
And I know, we were supposed

256
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,440
to be mother and son forever.

257
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,320
You keep talking.

258
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,280
Talk about what?

259
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,680
Talk about that girl.

260
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,960
What's going on?

261
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,080
How did she dump you?

262
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,600
Was it because you lost your temper again?

263
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,620
But your good looks should have got you off the hook.

264
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,760
I won't attend your wedding.

265
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,720
I get jealous for my dad.

266
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,320
What a temper you have huh?

267
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,720
You're leaving now.

268
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,840
Bye.

269
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,600
You really have a bad temper,

270
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,160
falling out so quickly.

271
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,760
Hey Anna, is Nan Wei here?

272
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,520
Yes, he's in the office.

273
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,480
Okay, thank you

274
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,240
Hello, everybody.

275
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,400
-Hello boss.  -Hello.

276
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,150
Hi, boss.

277
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,520
Hi.

278
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,240
Hi.

279
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,240
You're here.

280
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,800
I need a budget of 1 million.

281
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,440
The headquarters have no more money.

282
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,750
You're so good to players in China.

283
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,400
People here get jealous.

284
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
You know,

285
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,880
we can't forget where we came from.

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,640
China is my home.

287
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,040
When I started my career,

288
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,620
I joined the Chinese team.

289
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,400
If they ranked a little higher,

290
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,620
China would have a chance to go to

291
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,280
the global finals for the first time.

292
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,440
More importantly,

293
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,220
we could get a lot of bonus and

294
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
make money from themed products,

295
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,360
which would help solve our financial problems.

296
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,240
Don't you think?

297
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,600
You're expecting more than that, right?

298
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,720
I understand.

299
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,360
You didn't become a world champion.

300
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,680
You wish Wu Bai could do it for you.

301
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,200
These kids have to fend off doubters

302
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,160
in their families and the outside world.

303
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
They are not playing,

304
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,840
they're training and competing.

305
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,230
It's a job about winning honor and respect.

306
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,000
What I need to do is to

307
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,120
help them prove themselves to everyone

308
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,440
that they can do it.

309
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,840
Dude, we have no money.

310
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,320
The old rule then.

311
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,560
Pick one.

312
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,640
If my card's higher, you listen to me.

313
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,200
If not, I solve this myself.

314
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,920
You're doing this again.

315
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,480
Pick one.

316
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,360
If my card's higher, you listen to me.

317
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,200
If not, I solve this myself.

318
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,520
Dude, how old are we?

319
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,560
We're not kids anymore.

320
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,680
Wake up.

321
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,560
Get out of this game.

322
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,120
Come on.

323
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,400
If mine's higher,

324
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,320
you'll quit your job and

325
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,080
start an internet club with me.

326
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,640
I'll put all my money into it.

327
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,960
If not,

328
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,840
I'll solve this myself.

329
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,600
Whether I make it or not,

330
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,960
you don't have to worry.

331
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,480
Come on.

332
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,180
3, 2...

333
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,080
Alright.

334
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,510
Don't you cheat.

335
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,880
Mine's higher than yours for sure.

336
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,380
What?

337
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,560
Don't forget my budget of 1 million.

338
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
OK, I promise.

339
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,920
As a businessman,

340
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,440
making money is what I care about,

341
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,530
but I want to see

342
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,360
Chinese teams and players

343
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,440
in international competitions.

344
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,560
I believe you can make that happen.

345
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,920
And I have no good reason to refuse you.

346
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,360
But Shangyan,

347
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,600
promise me that

348
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,030
you will help K&K get a world champion.

349
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,040
Alright?

350
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,440
Solo used to be important to you,

351
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,770
but people here

352
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,240
are like your family,

353
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,200
they've always supported you.

354
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,190
I know you're aware of that.

355
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,560
Well, let's not talk about work,

356
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,320
tell me where your girlfriend is.

357
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,800
I don't have a girlfriend.

358
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,600
You were dumped?

359
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,480
You're annoying.

360
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,480
I'm not.

361
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,470
If you don't tell me,

362
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,640
you won't get the 1 million.

363
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,040
Bye.

364
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,200
You won't get your 1 million.

365
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,200
I don't think so.

366
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
It's been 4 days,

367
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,280
and I still can't get hold of him.

368
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,560
Could something have happened?

369
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,000
Yaya,

370
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,720
could something have happened to him?

371
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,400
No.

372
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,720
If it had, it would hit the headlines.

373
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,600
Don't worry.

374
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,040
He's famous.

375
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
Lots of people have an eye on him.

376
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,970
What you said makes me more worried.

377
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
Is he mad at me?

378
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,080
Well, is it because of the cat

379
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,480
or the picture I took with Mi Shaofei and Ou Qiang?

380
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,560
I have no idea.

381
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,280
Judging by his attitude to Mi Shaofei and Ou Qiang,

382
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,610
he wouldn't mind you taking pictures with his friends.

383
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,130
So, it has nothing to do with the photo.

384
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,800
As for the cat...

385
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,120
It might be hard for a guy to take care of a little cat.

386
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,720
It could be even harder for Han Shangyan.

387
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,160
It's daytime now where he is.

388
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
He's probably working.

389
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,360
If he is, why is his phone turned off?

390
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,160
Why did he turn off his phone?

391
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,000
He must be mad at me, right?

392
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,360
Is he mad at me?

393
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,080
He must be.

394
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,640
What should I do?

395
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,400
He must be mad at me.

396
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,360
Right.

397
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,290
Hello.

398
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,840
Your cat has diarrhea.

399
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,320
Alright.

400
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,840
Demo's mom wants to take him home

401
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,000
and refuses to let him play anymore.

402
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,720
Your mom's going to get married tomorrow, right?

403
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,880
Yes.

404
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,320
If you come back tomorrow,

405
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,120
you can catch SP's group match.

406
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,720
Let's see.

407
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm done talking.

408
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,280
Wait.

409
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,640
How is grandpa?

410
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,440
He's good.

411
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,040
I'd better go if there's nothing else.

412
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,640
I said wait, didn't you hear that?

413
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,880
Well,

414
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,720
did Tong Nian come to look for me?

415
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,480
It's boss. Come on.

416
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
Yes. Yes.

417
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,840
She was here the morning you left.

418
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,200
And she bought us breakfast.

419
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,320
Boss, seriously,

420
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,050
why didn't you tell her before you left?

421
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,160
That wasn't very considerate.

422
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,840
Boss,

423
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,440
you need to take better care of her.

424
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,840
Why do you turn on the speakers, Wu Bai?

425
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,280
Why have you been stroking my cat?

426
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,880
You should get one of your own.

427
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,040
Doesn't he care about his girlfriend?

428
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,120
He does,

429
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,440
but after he'd heard you,

430
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,640
he called it quits.

431
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,620
Well,

432
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,240
our boss is so unromantic.

433
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,520
He felt embarrassed.

434
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,480
I can't believe it.

435
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,400
Boring. Boring.

436
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,720
When do you leave?

437
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,720
Where should I go?

438
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,600
You can't sleep in my room, right?

439
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,200
What's wrong with me staying longer?

440
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,710
I've booked another room next to yours.

441
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,560
Why don't you go home?

442
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,400
You're family.

443
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,800
What's wrong with

444
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,160
staying with family?

445
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,720
Besides, you sleep in this room and

446
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,160
I sleep in the next room.

447
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,640
You could say

448
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,520
I'll leave my family.

449
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,560
Anyway, my husband will pick me up tomorrow.

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,680
Ridiculous.

451
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,880
Han Shangyan,

452
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,320
since you become my son,

453
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,080
I've been looking after you for 9 years.

454
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,480
Those were your most rebellious years.

455
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm watching a movie.

456
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,160
A young woman

457
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,960
is looking after her child by herself.

458
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,680
It reminds me

459
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,440
of the time when we lived together.

460
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,960
You can just tell me what you want.

461
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,920
I'll write it down

462
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,040
and buy it for you next month when I get paid.

463
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,080
Never mind.

464
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,480
I was going to give the necklace to your girlfriend.

465
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,720
However,

466
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,440
I don't know who give it to.

467
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,400
I don't even know what she looks like.

468
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,200
You don't have a photo of you and her?

469
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,560
I feel sorry for you.

470
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,090
And I wonder what the girl my son likes looks like.

471
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,840
What are you going to do?

472
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,240
I'm going to bed now.

473
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,620
Well, she's my type.

474
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,840
I want to make sure that you've seen the picture.

475
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,080
You mean this one?

476
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,560
I'm not a great artist.

477
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,600
I don't know if

478
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,120
you can tell what she looks like.

479
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,520
Well, it's pretty clear.

480
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,280
It's a picture of

481
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,520
a smiling girl.

482
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,280
I can tell she's

483
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,240
pretty and kind.

484
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
You've got a good eye.

485
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,320
After your wedding ceremony,

486
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,160
I won't attend the after party.

487
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,400
I have a flight to catch.

488
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,320
Are you trying to get rid of me?

489
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,560
No.

490
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,040
One of my best friends

491
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,960
is in a match in China.

492
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
I need to be there for him.

493
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,160
It really isn't about me?

494
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,440
You overthink it.

495
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,760
Time for bed.

496
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Sweet dreams.

497
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,080
No matter how many times you fail,

498
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,280
I'll always support you,

499
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,480
protect you and

500
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,000
admire you.

501
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,400
My dear son,

502
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,720
love you forever.

503
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,730
= Shanghai Jiaodong University =

504
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,620
Tong Nian, your phone's ringing.

505
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,180
= Unknown =

506
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,480
I'll help you with that.

507
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,360
Don't.

508
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,160
Let me.

509
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,840
I'll get it. I'll get it.

510
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,800
Who is this?

511
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,200
Hello?

512
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,360
Hello,

513
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,320
this is a security guard at Jiaodong University,

514
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,920
a gatekeeper.

515
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,920
A girl of about 10 years old

516
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,440
came looking for her sister

517
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,360
at the school gate.

518
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,920
He wears jeans,

519
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,120
black shoes and hat,

520
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,800
and carries a back pack.

521
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,680
She said her name is Xiao'ai.

522
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,640
Do you know her?

523
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,920
I know her.

524
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,760
Please tell her to wait for me.

525
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,920
I'm coming to pick her up.

526
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,800
Thank you.

527
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,080
Come with me to pick someone up. Come on.

528
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,080
Who?

529
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,280
You'll find out soon.

530
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,840
Come on.

531
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,080
Hello.

532
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,310
-Hello, I spoke to you on the phone.  -Hello.

533
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,440
Thank you.

534
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,770
We can take her with us now.

535
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,560
Alright.

536
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,760
I'm a bit worried.

537
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,140
Since you know each other,

538
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,920
-I'll leave her to you.  -OK.

539
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,260
Are you students at Jiaodong University?

540
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,400
Do you have your student cards with you?

541
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,810
This is mine, here.

542
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,680
I'd better record this.

543
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,280
OK.

544
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,560
You came looking for me?

545
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,680
You came by yourself?

546
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,280
Does your family know?

547
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,160
I'm wearing my hearing-aid.

548
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,600
It's cold out here.

549
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,520
How about going to my dorm?

550
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,000
Alright.

551
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,680
Here, it's your card.

552
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,080
Thank you.

553
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,280
You can take her with you then.

554
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,720
Alright. Thank you.

555
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,400
You're welcome.

556
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:31,960
Let's go.

557
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,200
Bye.

558
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,700
Bye.

559
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,440
That way.

560
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,480
Which room?

561
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,100
Room 104.

562
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
104...

563
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,840
It's here.

564
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,840
This one?

565
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,200
What?

566
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,200
What's the matter?

567
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,960
Is she really Solo's daughter?

568
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Yes.

569
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,220
But I don't have the time to explain to you now.

570
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,680
I'll tell you about it tonight.

571
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,120
The priority right now is

572
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,840
to figure out how to get her back.

573
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,960
No...

574
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,240
What now?

575
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,320
Are her ears...

576
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,120
She wears hearing-aids.

577
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,960
She can hear us.

578
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,080
She ignored us at the gate,

579
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,760
I think she just didn't wanna talk.

580
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,280
Why don't you come inside?

581
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,520
Let's go in now.

582
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,720
I was scared.

583
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,920
Are you hungry?

584
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,000
Have some water.

585
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,560
She might be hungry.

586
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,440
I'll go buy some food.

587
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,480
Alright.

588
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
You must be hungry, aren't you, Xiao'ai?

589
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,240
What do you want to eat?

590
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,750
I think she wants to speak to me alone.

591
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,630
I'll see what I can get.

592
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,640
Yeah, alright.

593
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,480
Alright, bye.

594
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,120
You guys talk.

595
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,000
You're my friend on WeChat, right?

596
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,080
Why didn't you send a message

597
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,800
to me before you came here all alone?

598
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,240
I'm upset. I wanted to see you.

599
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,400
If I had told you before,

600
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,800
you wouldn't have let me come.

601
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,920
Why did you want to see me?

602
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,080
I need a favor.

603
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,320
A favor?

604
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,840
Han Shangyan is my mom's boss,

605
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,720
tell Han Shangyan to send her back.

606
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,200
Why?

607
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,160
You don't like having her around?

608
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,400
It's not going so well.

609
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,280
I want her to leave soon.

610
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,560
Her presence

611
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,760
upsets my dad.

612
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,120
Upsets your dad?

613
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,800
Your mom's remarried, right?

614
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,640
You're not thinking that your mom

615
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,820
wants to get back together with your dad, are you?

616
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,680
She wants to take me away with her.

617
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,430
It's really making my dad feel bad.

618
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,511
I'm afraid Han Shangyan

619
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:30,140
doesn't have as much right as you think.

620
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,380
You should just admit that

621
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,570
Han Shangyan wouldn't listen to you.

622
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,840
That's not true.

623
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,880
You should break up with him.

624
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,680
Han Shangyan is grumpy.

625
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,600
My dad is a good man,

626
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,240
you should date with my dad.

627
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,120
What?

628
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,160
What's wrong?

629
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
My dad performed as well as

630
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,120
Han Shangyan in CTF.

631
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,400
Besides,

632
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,680
my dad is much more better-looking than him.

633
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,800
Your dad...

634
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
Are you blind?

635
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,000
Han Shangyan is much more handsome.

636
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,440
You're blind!

637
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,240
My dad is better, OK?

638
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,240
Your dad looks like this.

639
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,900
Han Shangyan pulls a long face like this.

640
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,520
Your dad has a big head.

641
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,040
Han Shangyan has a bad temper.

642
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,360
Your dad's legs are shorter than Han's.

643
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,520
They're half as short.

644
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,560
Han Shangyan has smelly feet.

645
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,080
How do you know that?

646
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,880
People told me that.

647
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,640
Who told you?

648
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,920
It doesn't matter.

649
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,880
He has smelly feet anyway.

650
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Han Shangyan has smelly feet.

651
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,120
Han Shangyan has smelly feet?

652
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,560
No, he doesn't have smelly feet.

653
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,360
Oh yes, he does!

654
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,160
Your dad has smelly feet.

655
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,720
Have you smelt them or what?

656
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,360
I...

657
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,840
We're back.

658
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,720
We bought lots of yummy food.

659
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,120
You're finally back.

660
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,440
Xiao'ai must be starving.  -Right.

661
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,600
I don't know what you want to eat,

662
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,080
so I bought various kinds of food.

663
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,440
We have KFC,

664
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
bread, fried pork buns,

665
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,480
and steamed dumplings.

666
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,920
And in case you don't like salty food,

667
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,920
we also bought lots of cakes.

668
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,200
What would you like then?

669
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:29,920
What?

670
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,720
Hold on.

671
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,320
Xiao'ai, look,

672
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,700
Yaya and I bought them for you after class.

673
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,840
What are you gonna do with her?

674
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,160
I don't know.

675
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,680
I called Han Shangyan,

676
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
but he didn't answer.

677
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,880
We haven't been in touch for days.

678
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,520
What should I do?

679
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,520
It seems that

680
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,080
she had a fight with her dad.

681
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,160
How about

682
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,880
you call Mi Shaofei and

683
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,400
ask him to tell Solo to pick her up?

684
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
I don't think so.

685
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,240
She's a little difficult. We can't force her.

686
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,240
Her dad should know, though.

687
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,390
SP's playing tomorrow.

688
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,160
I'll try to get tickets.

689
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,800
We can take Xiao'ai there.

690
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,960
After the game,

691
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,430
we can persuade her to make peace with her dad.

692
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,840
Let her stay here and calm down tonight.

693
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,960
It's not a big deal.

694
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,350
She'll be alright tomorrow.

695
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,040
Alright, whatever you say.

696
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,520
He's on the way back.

697
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,800
He's back now.

698
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:31,520
Alright.

699
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,320
Idol, you can talk to Tong Nian now.

700
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,040
Alright.

701
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,640
Found her.

702
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,870
Hello, it's Solo.

703
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,000
Hello, Solo.

704
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,910
It's Tong Nian,

705
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,800
Han Shangyan's

706
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:44,960
friend.

707
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,520
I know.

708
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,240
Is Xiao'ai at your place?

709
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,430
I couldn't find her anywhere.

710
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,600
Yes, she's here.

711
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,520
Don't worry.

712
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,730
How about I bring her to the game and

713
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,910
and you pick her up from there?

714
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,110
Let her stay with me tonight, alright?

715
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,440
Alright.

716
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
Thank you, Tong Nian.

717
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,560
It's alright.

718
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,440
Right, is she OK?

719
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,280
She's OK. Everything's fine.

720
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,080
Don't worry.

721
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Tong Nian.

722
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Han Shangyan has a bad temper,

723
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,440
what do you like about him?

724
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,920
That's not true,

725
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,720
he's perfect.

726
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,600
I like everything about him.

727
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,000
Love is blind.

728
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,120
How about dating with my dad?

729
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,240
Forget it. I don't like him.

730
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,160
Thank you.

731
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,640
Well, Xiao'ai,

732
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,800
has it crossed your mind that

733
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,090
your dad must like someone who has real skills?

734
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,440
Who told you that?

735
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,960
We need a good talk on that one.  -Careful!

736
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,480
What are you doing?

737
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,240
What are you doing?

738
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,440
What are you doing?

739
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,240
Someone is being rude to me.

740
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,600
Help! Help! Help!

741
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,200
Stay still.

742
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,320
My hearing-aid is expensive.

743
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,080
I was wrong, OK?

744
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,900
I... I'm on your side now.

745
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,440
Is that OK?

746
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,920
Yaya, you changed sides so quickly.

747
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,560
Chunxuan, your turn.

748
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,920
Well, you know what,

749
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,640
Tong Nian dislikes handsome men.

750
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,040
So Han Shangyan is...

751
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,800
He, he's so ugly.

752
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,320
You're ugly.

753
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,920
He's not. He's so handsome.

754
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,520
You... You have four eyes.

755
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,440
You wear glasses.

756
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,680
I was wrong.

757
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,720
Yaya.

758
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,950
So you're on my side, right?

759
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,880
I...

760
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,320
Well...

761
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,440
When Mi Shaofei had just arrived in Shanghai,

762
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
he stayed with me.

763
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,560
You can ask me anything about him.

764
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,000
I have nothing to ask.

765
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,960
Don't you?

766
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,800
Yeah.

767
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,240
Really?

768
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,960
Yes.

769
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,040
Alright. Alright.

770
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,840
It's time for bed.

771
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,320
Get some sleep.

772
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,200
We all should go to sleep.

773
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,920
It's bedtime.

774
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
You sleep in with her.

775
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,040
That's nice.

776
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,400
You can talk about Mi Shaofei.

777
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,640
Really?

778
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,200
Yes, go to sleep now.

779
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
What?

780
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,640
Go to sleep.

781
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,480
I know you're here.

782
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,880
Anything wrong?

783
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,760
Nothing's wrong.

784
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,120
You're nervous, right?

785
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,960
Why would I be?

786
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,280
It's the last game in the groups.

787
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,600
After it's over,

788
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,240
it'll be the quarter finals.

789
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,000
We'll be going on to the next round, right?

790
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,080
I have nothing to worry about.

791
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,640
Did Solo talk to you?

792
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,640
I feel a bit uneasy.

793
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,800
What for?

794
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,000
Stop beating around the bush,

795
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,240
just say it.

796
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,600
I heard that

797
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,930
the captain of team two Fu Ying is going to be promoted.

798
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,360
Which means that

799
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,870
someone from our team will be replaced.

800
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,520
That's good.

801
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,120
So I...

802
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,680
You're afraid that I'll be the one, right?

803
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,280
I didn't mean that.

804
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,640
It might be me.

805
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,620
Bro, I'll tell you what I think, alright?

806
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,800
Go ahead.

807
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,000
Back then,

808
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,480
the five of us were the best.

809
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,680
But now, I'm the worst.

810
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,880
What a shame!

811
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,640
You know what,

812
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,880
if I were replaced,

813
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,640
I wouldn't care.

814
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,846
Then people wouldn't say

815
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,310
I get the position because of Solo.

816
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,200
Are you crazy?

817
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,640
I'll be angry if you say that again.

818
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,250
We never doubted your abilities.

819
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,640
Bro,

820
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,680
please help me.

821
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,840
Cheer me up tomorrow.

822
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,600
I have to win.

823
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,760
Alright, you've got me.

824
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,960
I'll help you.

825
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,960
We can do it.

826
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,440
Alright.

827
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,840
Let's do even better this time

828
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,720
and show them that

829
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,160
the players of Team Solo are all heroes.

830
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,280
Relax.

831
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,530
= The Eight-finals of the China Division Qualifiers =

832
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,640
Ai Qing.

833
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,200
Tong Nian.

834
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,560
I brought your tickets.

835
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
Thank you very much.

836
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,160
You're Appledog?

837
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,280
Hello.

838
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,200
Nice to meet you.

839
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,280
To me, you'll always be the best main attacker.

840
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,200
Thank you.

841
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
She's my classmate.

842
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,640
My dad has a secretary.

843
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,400
Why did he send you here?

844
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,410
Your dad's secretary has other things to take care.

845
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,720
She doesn't come to the games very often.

846
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,320
They're VIP tickets.

847
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,940
Wanted to make sure you were sitting together.

848
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,760
Alright, thank you very much.

849
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,360
Will Han Shangyan be here today?

850
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,560
Is he backstage?

851
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,560
He won't be here today.

852
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,800
He didn't tell you?

853
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,080
I know he went abroad.

854
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,880
I just thought I'd check.

855
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,640
He might be too busy.

856
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,080
It's SP's game today,

857
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,600
not K&K's.

858
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,080
Come on in.

859
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,080
It's about to start.

860
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,040
Our game should be great too.

861
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,640
I should go. Bye.

862
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,880
Thank you.  -Thank you.

863
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,040
It doesn't matter if he's here or not.

864
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
You'll still have the chance to

865
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,080
see the greatest captain in the world.

866
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,860
Every time you say something like that about your dad,

867
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,840
I want to ask you whether

868
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,030
he's Leonardo DiCaprio or Tom Cruise?

869
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,240
My dad is Wang Hao.

870
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,560
The greatest captain!

871
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,640
Wang Hao.

872
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,960
Wang Hao is the best.

873
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,200
Of course.

874
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,060
Hello,

875
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,040
I'm heading out.

876
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,920
I'm at gate 2.

877
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,120
OK, please be quick.

878
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,040
I'm in a hurry.

879
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,360
Alright. OK. See you later.
