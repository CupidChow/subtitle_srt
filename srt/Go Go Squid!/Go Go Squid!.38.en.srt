00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,720
Your parents really aren't home?

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,440
Didn't I just say that?

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,680
Her parents are not home,

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,920
should I...

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,520
Do you want to relax upstairs?

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,720
Or stay in the living room for a while?

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,560
If he says he wants to go upstairs,

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,240
then what should I do?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,050
Make yourself at home,

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
no need to be nervous,

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,000
relax, relax.

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,200
You don't need to be so nervous, either.

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,840
This is my home,

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm quite relaxed.

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,800
Why are you fidgeting with your fingers?

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm not.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,280
I just feel

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,040
a little bit awkward.

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,120
Why is that?

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
This is not the first time I've come to your house.

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It's not the same.

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,840
The first time you came here,

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,600
you had a blind date with my cousin.

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,880
Yeah, that's right.

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,480
The second time you came here,

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
you made up stories to lie to my parents.

52
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,950
Only now do you come with a sincere heart.

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,520
Do you want to watch TV?

54
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,600
If you want,

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
here's the remote.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
I'll get you a cup of water.

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,480
No need.

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,480
It's okay,

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,840
you're the guest.

60
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,920
Just wait for me here,

61
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,920
I'll be right back.

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,520
Tea is ready.

63
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,040
What are you looking at?

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,200
You were very cute as a child,

65
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,640
it's a pity you weren't a child star.

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,820
How do you know that I wasn't?

67
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,800
Somebody's a little arrogant.

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm not lying.

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,250
I was on TV once when I was a kid.

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
I was famous in our community

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,800
when I was little.

72
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,200
I can tell from these photos

73
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,290
that you had a happy childhood.

74
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,270
Of course.

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:16,920
When I was little,

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,030
my parents loved me so much,

77
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,960
they would give me everything I wanted.

78
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,800
Are you happy with me?

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,240
Of course.

81
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,600
I have a question for you.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,420
When your step-mother met my parents,

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,360
what did they talk about?

84
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,440
Which day?

85
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,720
The day

86
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,160
before your competition.

87
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,160
Your step-mother came

88
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,480
and wanted to chat with my parents.

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
The day you lied to me,

90
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,720
you said you would meet at home,

91
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,720
but actually you went to a restaurant.

92
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,520
And I rushed back

93
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,120
only to find out that no one was home.

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,220
Oh, that day.

95
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,840
Yes.

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,000
I have to think.

97
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,040
Stop thinking,

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,800
just tell me!

99
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,200
What did you say?

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
I said,

101
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,180
I made many mistakes before I was 30.

102
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,120
And I hope your parents can forgive me.

103
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,680
Because I truly love Tong Nian with all my heart.

104
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,760
But my word was not enough.

105
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,840
I want to get married,

106
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,400
so actions speak louder than words.

107
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,430
I hope Tong Nian will agree to marry me.

108
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,840
What about my parents?

109
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,760
What did they say?

110
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,360
If I were your parents,

111
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,520
I wouldn't agree.

112
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,880
Look at you,

113
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,440
you're good-looking, kind and friendly,

114
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,240
filial and have a good personality.

115
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,720
And you have a PhD.

116
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,840
Most importantly,

117
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,560
your family is wealthy.

118
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,920
Money is the only aspect I can surpass you,

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,040
but I lose my advantage now.

120
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,640
Then?

121
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,200
What did my parents say?

122
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,760
Then your dad asked me

123
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,920
how will you convince me to entrust my girl to you?

124
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,760
I thought about it for a while.

125
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,710
I really can't match you in any aspect.

126
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,200
You're younger than me,

127
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,120
you have a higher degree than me.

128
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,360
Then I can only talk about my dream.

129
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,550
I said I've devoted myself to China's CTF cause.

130
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,480
But your parents still didn't agree.

131
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,440
I was really worried and anxious,

132
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,840
I could only kneel down in front of them,

133
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,290
and said "if you won't let me marry Tong Nian,

134
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,960
I will never get married my entire life."

135
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,040
You really think I'm that dumb?

136
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,120
You really think I didn't know you were lying?

137
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,600
Why did you lie to me?

138
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,440
You think I wouldn't catch on?

139
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,720
You are quite used to smacking me around,

140
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,680
are you taking advantage of me?

141
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,640
Who's taking advantage of who?

142
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,480
Look,

143
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,080
you're the one who is holding me.

144
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,720
What?

145
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,000
I want to hug you now.

146
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,780
Usually I don't mean what I say

147
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,880
except "I love you",

148
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,000
so don't believe a word I say.

149
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,800
I'm just joking.

150
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,480
Tell me,

151
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,480
after you retired,

152
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,000
did you regret it?

153
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,640
One cannot return to the past.

154
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,800
Although Han Shangyan is retired,

155
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,420
a whole group of K&K players are now rising.

156
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,240
Behind Han Shangyan,

157
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,320
there are many Chinese teenagers

158
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,680
who are willing to devote themselves

159
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,120
to China's CTF cause.

160
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
Tong Nian, I'm back.

161
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,090
Look what dad brought you.

162
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,800
Dad.

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,240
Shang...

164
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,960
Mr. Tong.

165
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,760
Shangyan, you're here.

166
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,920
Yes, he is here.

167
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,160
As you were, as you were.

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,920
In a bit

169
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,000
we can have lunch together.

170
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,120
Dad, it's night time right now.

171
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,000
Ah yes, I was confused.

172
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,240
You two go on.

173
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,760
Okay.

174
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,520
That was close.

175
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,080
Shangyan,

176
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,840
what do you think of the dishes?

177
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,960
Yes, very good.

178
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,480
Then eat more.

179
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,480
Here, eat more shrimps.

180
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,320
Men should eat more shrimps,

181
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:33,990
dig in.

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,600
Thank you.

183
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,990
Don't be so nervous, relax!

184
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,040
After my grandpa went back to Norway,

185
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,350
I often have take-out when I'm at the club,

186
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,870
so I'm used to it.

187
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,560
You eat what?

188
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,560
Take-out?

189
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,280
Don't eat so much of that!

190
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
Take-out is bad for your health.

191
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,600
If you have time,

192
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
come to our house.

193
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,200
I'll cook for you, alright?

194
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,040
Thank you.

195
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Eat up.

196
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,360
The yesterday's Champion should eat more.

197
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,080
Your club won yesterday?

198
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,760
No, we lost. Silver medal.

199
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,600
A silver medal is still good.

200
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,780
After all it's still second place in all of China.

201
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,080
Not bad at all.

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,080
Keep on fighting.

203
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,520
No, he says to his team members that

204
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,600
from his point of view,

205
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,120
there are only champions and losers.

206
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,960
Such an ambitious boy.

207
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,390
Don't push yourself so hard.

208
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,080
Here, give me your bowl,

209
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,400
I'll get you some more rice.

210
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Thank you.

211
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,560
Some soup for me, please.

212
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,360
Eat, dig in.

213
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,680
Did I say something wrong?

214
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,000
Why did you kick me?

215
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,920
Talk less,

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
then you'll make less mistakes.

217
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,800
What if they don't like to hear these words?

218
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,040
Alright then.

219
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,880
Shangyan, what are you doing?

220
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,640
Put it down, put it down.

221
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,000
-You don't have to do this.  -It's okay.

222
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,880
It's okay, let me do this.

223
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
You're the guest,

224
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,360
I can't let you to wash the dishes.

225
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Mr. Tong, it's okay.

226
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,360
Shangyan, listen to me.

227
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,880
We have a tradition in our family.

228
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,320
The man provides, the woman does the chores.

229
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,500
Things like this are always Tong Nian's mom's work,

230
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,760
I've never done chores before.

231
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,360
You really shouldn't do this.

232
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,150
-It's fine.  -Listen to me,

233
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,680
put it down.

234
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,800
What's wrong with you?

235
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
How can you let Shangyan wash the dishes?

236
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,780
I saw him washing the dishes when I came in,

237
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,160
and he wouldn't listen to me.

238
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,960
Have you no shame?

239
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
Usually it's your job,

240
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,640
aren't you ashamed?

241
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,680
Don't wash them, Shangyan.

242
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,120
It's okay. It's my duty.

243
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,480
What duty?

244
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,080
This is your first time over for dinner,

245
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,080
it's not proper.

246
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,560
Yes.  -Tong Nian, hurry up,

247
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,640
take him out.

248
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,320
It's okay.

249
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,200
Usually he's the one who does chores,

250
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,840
he's responsible.

251
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,200
It's almost done.

252
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,760
Mr. and Mrs. Tong, you can go and watch TV,

253
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,440
I'll come out later.

254
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Please go.

255
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,800
It's okay.

256
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,160
Come on.

257
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,640
Nice job.

258
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,480
Do you need my help?

259
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,000
No.

260
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,320
Just watch me as I work.

261
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,930
Okay, I'll stay right here.

262
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,930
Do you know what your dad said to me?

263
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,640
What?

264
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,960
He said in your family,

265
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,280
man provides, women do the chores.

266
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,720
And he has never done any chores.

267
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,360
He said that?

268
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,880
Usually he's the one who does the housework,

269
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,880
why did him lie to you?

270
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,560
You get enough to eat?

271
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,280
More than enough.

272
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,600
Well, I want to thank you

273
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,400
for washing the dishes today.

274
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,720
Come on, I wash the dishes every time!

275
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
That's right.

276
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,800
Are you cold?

277
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,560
How could I be with all these layers?

278
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,520
What exactly do you want to tell me?

279
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,560
Be careful while driving.

280
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,280
That's not what you really want to say.

281
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,960
I want to say that

282
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,640
in a movie,

283
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,200
two people in love,

284
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,200
when they are apart,

285
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,440
the guy will always...

286
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,680
you know before he says goodbye...

287
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,840
Tong Nian,

288
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,600
I hope that you can be braver when you're with me.

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
Do what you want to do,

290
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,000
don't be afraid.

291
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,480
Don't be scared of me, okay?

292
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,920
What are you doing?

293
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,880
Oh, it's you.

294
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,440
Sorry, sorry.

295
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,120
Officer, have you eaten your dinner?

296
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,880
Yes, I just ate.

297
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,840
Miss, I'm so jealous of you.

298
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,120
Jealous of me?

299
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,560
It seems that all this young man needs

300
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,070
is to buy a parking spot in our community

301
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
and sleep here every day.

302
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Every time I go out for a night shift,

303
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,360
I can always see him.

304
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,960
It is probably because you two had a fight, right?

305
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,840
No, not at all.

306
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,960
In today's society,

307
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
you should cherish the boy

308
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,720
who will wait at your front door

309
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,880
for the whole night.

310
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,720
People like him

311
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,600
look arrogant,

312
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,800
but actually they're very loyal.

313
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,960
He is a nice person.

314
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,680
Officer, please stop.

315
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
She is a shy girl.

316
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,360
Sorry for bothering you.

317
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,240
Go on.

318
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,400
Go on!

319
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,000
It turns out that

320
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,090
somebody guards my apartment every day.

321
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,120
He was mistaken.

322
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,680
If I do this every day,

323
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
then I must be crazy!

324
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm leaving.

325
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
He was mistaken.

326
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,360
Stop doing that.

327
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Go back now.

328
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm leaving.

329
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,880
Get in the car.

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,720
I know.

331
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll get in after you go back.

332
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,040
No, you go first.

333
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,400
This place is not safe,

334
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,400
you should go first.

335
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,280
You get in the car first.

336
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
You go back first.

337
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,600
Alright, I'm leaving.

338
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
I'm really going now.

339
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,040
Come in.

340
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,120
Somebody looks happy,

341
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,640
you can hardly stop smiling.

342
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,520
Tong Nian, I should tell you something.

343
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,560
In the past,

344
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,960
I thought you would be a bad girl

345
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,000
if you stayed with Shangyan.

346
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,460
And I thought he didn't truly love you.

347
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,400
But then I realized

348
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,800
I was wrong.

349
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,980
No matter if it's pursuing his career or love

350
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,670
he is serious and prudent.

351
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,440
But the most important thing is that

352
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,120
I think my daughter

353
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,400
is very happy.

354
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,340
Yes, I feel very happy when I am with him,

355
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,680
also I feel quite content.

356
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,440
But I think

357
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,840
I have problems.

358
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,180
Perhaps it's because I care so much about him,

359
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,280
I love him so much,

360
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,660
so I listen to his opinions most of time,

361
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,120
I won't listen to my own voice.

362
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,890
These days he often says to me that

363
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,500
he hopes I can express my own opinions more often,

364
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
and not listen to his all the time.

365
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,880
He wants me to maintain my own personality.

366
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,610
Tong Nian, do you know

367
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,470
what we talked about the day when

368
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,680
Shangyan, I and his step-mother were together?

369
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,400
What did he say?

370
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,520
Because I love Tong Nian deeply,

371
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,920
and I want to see her every day.

372
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,120
I really want to be with her

373
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,270
for the rest of my life.

374
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,440
That's why we brought this up.

375
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,790
He said that in the past,

376
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,920
the only thing he cares about

377
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,400
is to be the champion.

378
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
Now things are different.

379
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,680
Now he cares about two things:

380
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,320
being a Champion and Tong Nian.

381
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,920
He also said he wants to marry you,

382
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,440
only if he marries you,

383
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,680
he will be assured.

384
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,220
That he can continue training Chinese champions.

385
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,850
And you can have as many PhD. diplomas as you like.

386
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Because he hopes

387
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,400
you can have your own dream,

388
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,380
and he will give you his full support.

389
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,040
What else did he say?

390
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,000
What else did he say?

391
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,240
I need to think for a second.

392
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,160
Come on, tell me.

393
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,520
He also said that

394
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,960
he knows you have been spoiled by us

395
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,280
since your were a child.

396
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,840
That makes you and him a perfect match.

397
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,750
He thinks he's nothing special,

398
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,600
he only knows how to train those players,

399
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,600
and do chores.

400
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,990
And the last thing he can do is to love you.

401
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,640
Mom, do you know?

402
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,770
Han Shangyan is really a good man.

403
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,840
Back to the poor old days,

404
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,520
he lived with his team members.

405
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,000
He was responsible for

406
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,720
cooking and cleaning.

407
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
He is very hard-working,

408
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,200
and he is nice to his friends.

409
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,070
So please, try and get to know more about him.

410
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,520
Do you think

411
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,360
I didn't observe him before?

412
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
I think he is

413
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,690
changing for you little by little.

414
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,000
Just like two people go out for a walk.

415
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
You don't have to say anything,

416
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,160
but gradually,

417
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,720
they're in step with each other.

418
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
And both people will see

419
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,480
the scenery along the road.

420
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,680
Do you understand?

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,720
It is a reciprocal process.

422
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,280
Mom, thank you for understanding.

423
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,200
Oh yeah, did he talk about the future with you?

424
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
He proposed to me.

425
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,560
Really?

426
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,760
Did you say yes?

427
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,000
Why?

428
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
I think it is not the right time.

429
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,740
Was I wrong?

430
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,360
No, of course not.

431
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,960
I just didn't expect that

432
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,560
you would say no.

433
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,920
Tong Nian, it is not a bad thing.

434
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,000
I just hope that

435
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,800
you can think carefully

436
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,600
before making a decision.

437
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,520
That's all.

438
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,800
You're here.

439
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,840
This is my first time here.

440
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,690
To be honest, I'm a little nervous.

441
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,960
You're a grown man

442
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,840
with lots of experience,

443
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,880
why are you nervous?

444
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,320
This is a brand new start,

445
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,840
and the result is unknown.

446
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,920
I have a wife and a child now,

447
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
not like you, your a free man,

448
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,040
I'm not like you.

449
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,870
I have to be responsible for my family.

450
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I have a question.

451
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,360
I remember

452
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,890
your wife was your fan before.

453
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,560
Now she is with you,

454
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,680
is it possible that her love for you

455
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,400
is more of admiration than true love?

456
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,040
Isn't it strange?

457
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,600
What are you talking about?

458
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,120
How can you say my wife is strange?

459
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,840
I think you're strange.

460
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
Han Shangyan,

461
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,760
I didn't expect you'd be confused

462
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,840
about love one day.

463
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,920
How can I be confused?

464
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,400
It's just I have a friend

465
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,400
who is confused about such things.

466
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm asking for him.

467
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,920
Did you do something with your girl?

468
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,000
What could I do to her?

469
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,360
Answer my question.

470
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,280
Fine.

471
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,480
I'll be honest with you.

472
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,960
As an experienced man,

473
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,240
I'll sum up for you.

474
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,800
If one day

475
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,440
the girl yells at you,

476
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,280
and then she cries and hugs you,

477
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,560
then she really loves you,

478
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,480
not admiration.

479
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,440
If, if you love someone,

480
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,320
shouldn't you pay attention to them?

481
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,320
If, if you really love me,

482
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,040
you should observe me carefully.

483
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,720
So, I think,

484
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,640
you know nothing about me.

485
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,640
If you knew me well,

486
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,400
you would know I'm allergic to mangoes.

487
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,800
I love strawberries.

488
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,280
I don't care if you are rich or not.

489
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,130
I care only if I'm part of your future.

490
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,920
I like how we share everything with each other.

491
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,320
I don't like it when you're thinking too much.

492
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,000
OK, OK, OK.

493
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,330
Let's stop fighting,OK?

494
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,720
It could go on forever.

495
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,040
Let's calm down first, OK?

496
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,600
Calm down.

497
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,560
Pack up your things,

498
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
we'll have a meeting in a little bit.

499
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,120
OK.

500
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,120
My silver medal winners.

501
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,200
Boss.  -Boss.

502
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,040
We were just...

503
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,040
What are you talking about?

504
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,600
We just...

505
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,770
Boss, we're not slacking off,

506
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,720
it's just our eyes weren't very comfortable,

507
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,480
just a five-minute break.

508
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,080
Just five minutes.

509
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,880
Five minutes.

510
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,520
I'm not scolding you,

511
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
don't be so nervous.

512
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,760
I'm so scared.

513
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,670
I thought you lost your marbles today.

514
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,320
Boss, you always told us that

515
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,200
there are only champions.

516
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,840
Everyone else is a loser.

517
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,760
Yes.  -Yeah.

518
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,680
Really?

519
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,330
Well, you can reflect upon yourselves later.

520
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,680
Right now,

521
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,640
let's have a small meeting.

522
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,640
Thank you.

523
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,640
What's happening?

524
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,040
Coach.  -What's going on?

525
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,920
Did you see that?

526
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,440
What does that gesture mean?

527
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,040
He's acting so weird today.

528
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,800
To the meeting.

529
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,680
Hurry. The Asian Championships is about to start.

530
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,720
It's quite scary.

531
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,200
A small meeting.

532
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,840
Is he okay?

533
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Thank you?

534
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,040
Let's go.

535
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,680
Hello everyone.

536
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,800
Hi.

537
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,320
Hello.

538
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,040
Take a seat.

539
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,760
Yeah, sit, sit.

540
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,800
Buff,

541
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,680
introduce yourself to us first.

542
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,360
Old rule.

543
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,600
Okay.

544
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,600
I'll start then.

545
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,320
Guys, we competed against each other before.

546
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,120
I'm the one

547
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,600
who was defeated by you.

548
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,760
I believe you know me well

549
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,480
even if I don't make a self-introduction.

550
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,440
We know you very well.

551
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,280
I'm Buff.

552
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,840
My real name is Bi Dongran,

553
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm 31 years old.

554
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,080
An old player.

555
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,200
I was the national champion.

556
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,680
Counting this year,

557
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,600
I've been the captain for four years.

558
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,320
I rank in fourth place currently.

559
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,660
This is the first time I formally join an club.

560
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,320
Back in the early days,

561
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,600
I had no idea what a club was.

562
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,280
The reason I came back

563
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,360
after a long retirement

564
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,240
was to pursue my goal

565
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,520
one more time.

566
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,080
You all know that

567
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm in my thirties.

568
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,320
So other clubs wouldn't recruit me.

569
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
Now,

570
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,640
I would like to thank K&K

571
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,880
for giving me this opportunity.

572
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,040
Welcome Buff

573
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,160
to team K&K!

574
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,400
As a new member,

575
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,160
Buff will train with us for half a month.

576
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,840
In this half a month,

577
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,080
five active players and a bench player

578
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,130
will go through several training shifts.

579
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,640
After the training,

580
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,600
we have two tests.

581
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,080
One is for personal grades,

582
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,280
the other is for team work.

583
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,480
After that, we'll finalize the list for the championships.

584
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,880
And then after another half month's training,

585
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,000
we'll go to the Asian Championships.

586
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,680
Any questions?

587
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,400
No.

588
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,920
Of course no.

589
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,680
This is fair.

590
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,160
I agree with the boss.

591
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,760
The honor of our team is the most important thing.

592
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,560
Okay.

593
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,440
Buff, your team uniform.

594
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,120
Thank you,

595
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,600
boss.

596
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,880
Xiaomi,

597
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,800
if you see Wu Bai later,

598
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,480
tell him to meet his new teammate.

599
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,440
No problem.

600
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
New teammate.

601
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,480
This is the information form for new teammates.

602
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
Fill it out and bring it to me.

603
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,130
I'll help you apply for social security card.

604
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,760
Okay.

605
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,920
You guys have social security here?

606
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,840
Of course.

607
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,840
Where did you register your social security?

608
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,600
In your hometown?

609
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah, in Jinan.

610
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,080
Okay.

611
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,320
I'll help and transfer your registration here.

612
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,160
What's happening here?  -Don't worry,

613
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,920
we can talk about it later,

614
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,840
I'll help you to handle it.

615
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,710
We often entrust an outsourced firm with such things.

616
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,280
But don't worry,

617
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,400
I'll help you to get it right.

618
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,080
Of course, I won't worry.

619
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,480
The pay package you offer is very desirable.

620
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,040
Yes, that's true.

621
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,680
One more important thing,

622
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,000
it's the schedule here.

623
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,520
You know our boss has a bad temper,

624
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,200
especially when it comes to time control,

625
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,120
he is really serious.

626
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,120
Got it.

627
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,600
Thank you, coach.

628
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,000
Your computer.

629
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,600
Okay.

630
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,480
If you have any questions, tell me.

631
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,040
Okay.

632
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,320
You four, to the boss's room,

633
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,160
a small meeting.

634
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,040
For Buff?

635
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,640
Go on.

636
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Come on, let's go.

637
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,760
Go.

638
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,280
Boss.

639
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,040
Boss.

640
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,760
Boss.

641
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,280
Boss.

642
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,080
Take a seat.

643
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,880
Why are you all standing?

644
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,520
Sit down.

645
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,040
We just had a welcome meeting,

646
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
now, a serious private matter.

647
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,080
Boss, if you need to kick someone,

648
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,960
then just tell us.

649
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,550
I already said,

650
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,080
a half month later,

651
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,760
your grades will decide everything.

652
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,800
The list in my head is still empty now.

653
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
We two have the worst ranking,

654
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,440
it must be one of us.

655
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,000
Then you should work harder.

656
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,920
K&K is fair, we don't have secrets.

657
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,320
What about you? Feel stressed?

658
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,080
No.

659
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,000
Tell the truth.

660
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,160
I'm worried, but I'm not stressed.

661
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,120
Boss, I'm an adult,

662
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
I'm not Demo.

663
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,160
What do you mean?

664
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,920
Let your ability speak for you.

665
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,440
Man after my own heart.

666
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,400
It's my turn.

667
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,520
I have no issues, either.

668
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,600
I'll try my best, boss.

669
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,000
You got nothing to worry about,

670
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,040
what are you talking about?

671
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,080
It's hard to say.

672
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,960
Apart from our captain,

673
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,640
who dares to say he's not worried?

674
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,480
Exactly.

675
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,410
Buff now ranks fourth.

676
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,200
Only DT

677
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,140
can guarantee that he can beat Buff.

678
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,920
Can you have a little confidence?

679
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,840
Conviction.

680
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,360
If you believe you are the best,

681
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,720
then you are!

682
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,680
It's the same when finding a girlfriend.

683
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,080
You must be kidding.

684
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,040
Trust me.

685
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,040
Show me your confidence.

686
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,920
That's right.

687
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,200
Good. That's everything.

688
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,560
Go back now.

689
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,080
Okay.

690
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,040
We'll go back, boss.

691
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,480
97, wait a minute.

692
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,160
Go.

693
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,160
See you.

694
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,680
Sit.

695
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,560
I'm so sad,

696
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,920
there will be some changes with our team.

697
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,640
Promise me that

698
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,240
no matter who is the bench player,

699
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,360
nobody shall cry,

700
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,440
or feel bad.

701
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,440
Don't worry,

702
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,040
I know it's gonna be me.

703
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,520
Come on,

704
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,120
what's wrong with you two?

705
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,560
We made it clear just now.

706
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,520
We have to be brave, and confident,

707
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,920
understand?

708
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,080
Game on.

709
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
Game on!

710
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,240
That's more like it.

711
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,120
Come on.

712
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,000
Wu Bai's actually soft inside,

713
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
he just doesn't talk too much.

714
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Grunt is too loquacious.

715
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,440
Can you do me a favor?

716
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,000
Get everybody to unite together.

717
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,200
That's it?

718
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,520
Not gonna help?

719
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,600
No, no.

720
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,650
I thought you were going to tell me something bad,

721
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,920
I was so scared.

722
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,840
Boss.

723
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,480
Actually,

724
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,760
you don't want to kick anyone right?

725
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,200
We are like your own children.

726
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,240
Yes.

727
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
I care about all of you.

728
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,120
You are all important to me.

729
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,720
In the past, when SP decided to kick Mi Shaofei,

730
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,780
I had a huge fight with Solo.

731
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,600
But it turns out that

732
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,280
their decision was right.

733
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
I understand.

734
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,440
This time, according to the current situation,

735
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,720
SP has greatly improved themselves

736
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,130
for this year's national finals.

737
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,840
If we don't change,

738
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,040
we won't stand a chance to win.

739
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,280
Boss, not only do I understand,

740
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,640
we all understand.

741
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,320
Oh man.

742
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Now playing CTF

743
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,480
comes with a test for stamina.

744
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,520
I'm gonna die, seriously I'm gonna die.

745
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,800
I can't take it.

746
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,600
Second last place.

747
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,040
Today is the first day,

748
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,040
give me some time.

749
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,080
Tomorrow I can do better.

750
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,070
You can't even surpass a thirty-year-old man,

751
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,920
you proud of that?

752
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,720
I'm not a distance runner.

753
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,880
A country's strength lies in it's youth,

754
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,800
don't you know that?

755
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,000
How does long distance running

756
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
relate to patriotism at all?

757
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,840
I get it, boss.

758
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,040
Alright, get up.

759
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,360
You still have five laps.

760
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,760
Give us a minute, boss.

761
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,480
You wanna compete or not?

762
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,640
Get up.

763
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,000
♪ 56 ethnic groups ♪

764
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,520

772
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,280
Try this one.

773
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,160
-What's in yours?  -Meat.

774
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:19,830
Let me try.

775
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,480
-Meat?  -Yes.

776
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,430
What's he going to do?

777
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,600
You forgot your juice.

778
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,680
Thank you.

779
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,430
The food here is quite good.

780
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,560
Of course.

781
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,170
Our boss can endure a hard life himself,

782
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,120
but he'd provide us quality food.

783
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,760
That's typical of him.

784
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,760
Listen to me Buff,

785
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,770
97 is really cunning,

786
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:44,680
be careful.

787
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,480
Yeah, he's right.

788
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,960
He is very good at charming people.

789
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,350
Don't be fooled by him.

790
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,760
When you think he's your friend,

791
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,870
he'll treat you like his fan.

792
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,800
What are you taking about?

793
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,000
-Enough!  -What?

794
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,040
Are you...

795
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,760
I'm just telling the truth.  -It's just the way you are.

796
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,800
Why did you take away my juice?

797
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,320
Yeah.

798
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,120
Didn't you just get a cup?

799
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,800
I gave my cup to Buff.

800
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
But what about ours?

801
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,880
I didn't even drink it.

802
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,400
You're not a new member, you can get one on your own.

803
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,880
Aren't we good friends?

804
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,480
Help yourselves.

805
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Look at you.

806
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,650
Buff, after refilling your plate,

807
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
come and sit with us.

808
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,480
Okay.

809
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,060
Tell me, why is 97 a cunning person?

810
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,680
No problem.

811
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,480
You're just a fickle person.

812
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,520
Tong Nian.

813
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,240
Zheng Hui,

814
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,280
what are you doing here?

815
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,320
Wait a minute,

816
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,200
let me finish hanging my clothes.

817
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,160
When did you come in?

818
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,210
I just said that I would go out to see you.

819
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,960
This is the girl's dorm.

820
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,280
I want to talk to you.

821
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Are you free?

822
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,920
Yes, come in.

823
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,040
It's just a little messy.

824
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,520
I didn't tidy it up, sorry.

825
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,440
Take a seat.

826
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,520
It's because you're busy dating, right?

827
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,240
And I don't believe

828
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,170
that Han Shangyan hasn't come to your room.

829
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,080
Yes, he has.

830
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,320
You got me wrong.

831
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,000
Han Shangyan is not that kind of person.

832
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,960
He has done nothing to me.

833
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,360
Really, you got me wrong.

834
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,440
So then,

835
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,150
does he take you just as one of his fan girls

836
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,520
or just an accessory

837
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,560
on his path to becoming a champion?

838
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,480
Zheng Hui, I think today

839
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,520
is not a good day for us to talk.

840
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,840
You should...

841
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,040
I think I'm getting sick,

842
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,760
how about this,

843
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,480
you go back first,

844
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,520
I'll treat you to some coffee next time,

845
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,280
how does that sound?

846
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,840
Tong Nian.

847
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,200
Look at me,

848
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,460
why can't you just look at me for once?

849
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
I'm looking at you now.

850
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,560
I'm looking at you now.

851
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,600
I love you.

852
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,560
I love you.

853
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,360
I love you!

854
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,560
I've been in love with you for two years.

855
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
Two years!

856
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,880
How can you not see that?

857
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,520
And, in terms of

858
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,640
education, temptation and age,

859
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,480
or major,

860
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,960
I, am the only right one for you.

861
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,770
I'll earn a lot of money,

862
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,880
I'll become a better person,

863
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,920
I'll exceed him,

864
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,920
I'll make you happy.

865
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,640
I'll try my best!

866
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,960
I know it, Zheng Hui.

867
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,040
I know you will earn a lot of money,

868
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,690
you'll become better,

869
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,680
you'll be a good person, of course.

870
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,960
But I don't want this.

871
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,480
I don't want any of this.

872
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,520
Thank you for loving me,

873
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,760
but I think we should only be friends, okay?

874
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,320
That's all I want.

875
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,600
Why?

876
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,680
Why?

877
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,520
Am I that bad compared to Han Shangyan?

878
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,850
Am I that bad compared to Han Shangyan?

879
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,720
Tell me, I can change, Tong Nian.

880
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,640
You're a good man.

881
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,800
Really, Zheng Hui, you're a good man.

882
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,132
But do you know what it feels like

883
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:54,200
when two people are together?

884
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,440
I have a special feeling

885
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,120
when I'm with Han Shangyan.

886
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
We understand each other.

887
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,980
We don't need to say anything

888
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,560
but we know what's on our mind.

889
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,000
After being with him,

890
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,770
I don't even care about how much he can provide for me.

891
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,080
What I worry about the most is

892
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,000
whether or not I've devoted more to him.

893
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,210
I want him to be happy and that's all.

894
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,120
I want to see him

895
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,520
be happier each day.

896
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,960
So you're telling me

897
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,320
you like him?

898
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,200
I love him!

899
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,520
I love him very, very much.

900
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,080
I love him more and more every day.

901
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,040
I've not been very well,

902
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,360
I don't have much appetite,

903
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,720
I can't sleep well, either.

904
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,640
I just wanted to have a chance.

905
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,880
Can you give me a chance?

906
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,560
Please.

907
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,880
Thank you for loving me.

908
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,160
But I believe

909
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,280
there will be a better girl

910
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,640
who suits you more than me.

911
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,600
There will be.

912
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,880
I believe in you.

913
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,000
Sorry.

914
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,520
Zheng Hui.

915
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,600
I'm sorry!

916
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,480
Seeing Zheng Hui's figure fading away,

917
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,800
I suddenly realize one thing.

918
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,240
I love Han Shangyan

919
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,200
not because he is the famous CTF player Gun,

920
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,750
it's because I can truly sense his sadness and happiness.

921
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,400
I want to stay by his side

922
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,200
and work together toward his goals.

923
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,520
In this half month,

924
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,240
except for Wu Bai who takes on self-training,

925
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,960
all the other members stay in K&K

926
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,640
and work very hard.

927
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,760
Even Buff and Xiaomi

928
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,750
cherish this valuable opportunity.

929
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
Six teammates,

930
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,630
only five can finally make it to the competition.

931
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,960
Although it's ability that talks,

932
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,920
it is still very harsh.

933
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,080
Now the day of the competition is approaching,

934
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,120
everyone is more nervous than before.

935
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,920
They're tired,

936
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,400
both physically and mentally,

937
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,920
but this is unavoidable.

938
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,460
They should show more perseverance and determination.

939
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,920
We support and help each other.

940
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,820
Because we belong to the same team,

941
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,600
we're the best partners.

942
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,320
What?

943
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,000
Why are you so nervous?

944
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,280
Don't laugh at me.

945
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,200
Little Demo.

946
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,360
Don't eat so much instant noodles,

947
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,360
eat something else.

948
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,520
Instant noodles is time-saving,

949
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,720
we have to keep training.

950
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,220
Yeah, boss.

951
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:30,780
Right.
