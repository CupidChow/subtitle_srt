Who's Mrs. Han?

Who's Mrs. Han?

Come over here.

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,459
How's there a Mrs. Han?

32
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,230
Mrs. Han. Please get on the bus.

33
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,760
Thank you.

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,179
Guys, Shangyan's girlfriend.

35
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,259
Shangyan's girl, hi.

36
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,219
Hi, Shangyan's girl.

37
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,739
Hello there. Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,459
Could you please tell them not to call me "Shangyan's girl"?

39
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,779
They've made a mistake.

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,879
No problem.

41
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,879
Well, Mrs. Han just said, don't call her Shangyan's girl.

42
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,159
She's embarrassed.

43
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,630
No problem, Shangyan's girl.  -Mrs. Han, I get it!

44
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,580
Mrs. Han, have a seat.

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,900
Thank you.

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,839
Mrs. Han, here's your luggage.

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,079
Thank you.

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,420
Give it to me, please.

49
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,959
DT, DT, DT!

50
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,900
When will your boss get on the bus?

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,309
Please wait.

52
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,420
Ok.

53
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,620
Captain,

54
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,719
when did your cousin find a girlfriend?

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,000
Isn't he in the club 24 hours a day?

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,359
I don't know.

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,799
He must have done it secretly.

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,479
Good for him! Keeping it secret from us.

59
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,339
He must be worried that

60
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,399
if we got girlfriends, we'd be distracted.

61
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,959
He's old enough to have a girlfriend.

62
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,870
It's quite normal.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,980
Old enough?

64
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,319
I don't think so.

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,039
I think he's super handsome.

66
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,970
Much better than you little brats.

67
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,349
When you arrive at the hotel,

68
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,759
go to the buffet room on the first floor.

69
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,199
I booked several tables.

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,279
Careful, no seafood or anything cold.

71
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,399
Think about Grunt.

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,559
His poor health is the result of a bad diet.

73
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,599
It's competition season now.

74
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,839
You should pay attention to your health, understand?

75
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,660
We get it, Miss.

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,199
Sir, you can drive them back.

77
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,719
I'll go back with the boss.

78
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,820
Ok.

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,439
And, take care of her.

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,130
Don't worry, relax.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,039
It's for work.

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,620
Don't get your feelings involved.

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,940
Please take a seat.

84
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,510
The two teams are competing tomorrow.

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,220
We've all got to do our best.

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,439
Yeah sure.

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,260
There can only be one champion.

88
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,900
Who will that be?

89
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,839
I'm late?

90
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,959
I'm really sorry.

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,799
You both have so many fans.

92
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,639
I've had to make sure they get off safely.

93
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,839
Then I can leave.

94
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,479
Get to the point, will you?

95
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,319
Oh come on. This is a reunion for old friends.

96
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,620
Isn't it nice to have dinner together?

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,959
Just have dinner?

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,090
Well, not really.

99
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,679
Is there anything you want to tell everyone?

100
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,119
Dinner is very important, Shangyan.

101
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,719
I know a good restaurant in Guangzhou.

102
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,900
I'm off.

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,919
Come on, don't be a party-pooper.

104
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,439
You need to have dinner anyway.

105
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,990
Why not just stay and chat with us?

106
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,420
Forget it.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,759
Well, I booked a room for 12 people.

108
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,679
But there're only three of us.

109
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,900
What can I say?

110
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,500
Forget it, Mr. Xiang.

111
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,870
It'll be a waste if there're only three of us.

112
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,559
We can eat next time.

113
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,700
Goodbye.

114
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,037
I've called a cab.

115
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,479
Maybe it's stuck in traffic.

116
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,299
Wait a moment.

117
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,600
He just doesn't know much about Han Shangyan.

118
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,439
We've got a car coming for us.

119
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,599
And we're in the same hotel.

120
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,500
Why don't you come back with us?

121
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,359
No, thanks.

122
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,020
Our taxi'll be here soon.

123
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,020
Don't let these little things bother you.

124
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,420
We won the competition today.

125
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,910
I never thought it'd turn out like this.

126
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,860
We finally got rich and successful,

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,550
but we can't even get in the same car.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,300
Sorry.

129
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,740
It's my fault.

130
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,860
I'm the one to blame.

131
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,300
I was not blaming you.

132
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:52,759
= 10 years ago =

133
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,180
Guys.

134
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,319
Look.

135
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,260
Look what I've got for you.

136
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,820
Red envelopes!

137
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,359
May you be prosperous.

138
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,519
Thanks a lot.

139
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,279
Thank you, captain.

140
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,359
This is the first championship Solo has won

141
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,239
since we were established.

142
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,399
I know it's only Beijing,

143
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,100
still, it's amazing.

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,599
It is all thanks to you!

145
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,439
You're a great captain,

146
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,679
and you really studied the other team.

147
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,599
Without your help, we'd never have won.

148
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,039
Yes, that's right.

149
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,839
Just doing my job.

150
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,119
Han Shangyan, you know what

151
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,240
you're really popular in CTF circles.

152
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,719
Everyone on the Internet

153
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,569
knows who you are, and sees you as their main rival.

154
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,199
So you're our hero now.

155
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,519
Hero, hero!

156
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,600
That's just because I have you guys to support me.

157
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,399
If we go on working together,

158
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,852
we can be the champion of any league

159
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:47,999
if that's what we want.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,540
Exactly.

161
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,999
Well, we should have a drink now.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Shaofei.

163
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,119
Shaofei, good for you.

164
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,720
Here.  -Where did you get the beer?

165
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,500
Good for you.

166
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,839
Here. To the future national champions.

167
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,260
National champions!

168
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,600
-So energetic!  -Yes.

169
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,119
Sorry, we're being too loud.

170
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,599
Brilliant.

171
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,919
Thank you.

172
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,119
National champions, national champions.

173
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,199
Shaofei, you did a good job today.

174
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,660
The beer's great.

175
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,220
Look, Tian'anmen!

176
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,260
Yes!

177
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,100
Tian'anmen, it's really Tian'anmen!

178
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,079
You know what,

179
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,199
every time I see Tian'anmen, I feel a sense of awe.

180
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,840
I think we should bring honor to our country,

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,260
and win on international games.

182
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,940
That's right.

183
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,199
Shangyan, it's Tian'anmen.

184
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,060
Here, to the world champions!

185
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,790
Come on.  -Come, Mrs. Han.

186
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,479
Please.

187
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,999
Mrs. Han, please.

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,199
Please sit here.

189
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,020
Take a seat.

190
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,530
Be careful.

191
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,359
Mrs. Han, you haven't even met us all officially yet.

192
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,199
-My name is 97. I was born in 1997.  -Hello.

193
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,959
My name is Demo.

194
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,839
They call me that because it sounds cute.

195
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,399
Mrs. Han. I'm One.

196
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,759
Why are you called One?

197
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,060
I'm the tallest

198
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,420
and the most handsome.

199
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,579
Who's the tall guy who was sitting behind me

200
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,679
and wearing a cap today?

201
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,719
He's Wu Bai.

202
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,759
The boss's cousin.

203
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,919
He's our captain.

204
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,559
Right.

205
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,679
He's like the boss,

206
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,159
he enjoys his own company.  -Yes.

207
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,759
I think he's busy training now.

208
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,559
You guys, don't scare her.

209
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,160
We're not. We're just chatting.

210
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,500
Come with me.

211
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,900
Han Shangyan wants to see you.

212
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,479
Hey, stay a little longer.

213
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,039
Bye.

214
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,759
You're leaving?

215
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,079
The boss can't wait?

216
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,919
Bye.

217
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,780
He can't wait?

218
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,879
She's so elegant and graceful.

219
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,940
She dwarfs me completely.

220
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,300
Have you had dinner?

221
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,679
I drank some water just now.

222
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,420
I'm not hungry.

223
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,380
Come in.

224
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,860
Why can't we talk in the dining hall?

225
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,220
That's private stuff.

226
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,300
Do you want me to shout about it?

227
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,380
Relax.

228
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,159
He won't be rude to you.

229
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,470
I should go take care of the team members.

230
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,380
Take your time.

231
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,780
I'll give you 10 seconds.

232
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,580
Now,

233
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,100
you two can tell me the truth.

234
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,620
How many times do I have to say it?

235
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,279
You're a man now.

236
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,020
Can't you be honest?

237
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,380
Go ahead and kill me.

238
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,639
Did you know he has a girlfriend?

239
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,439
No.

240
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,559
Now you know. Tell me what you think.

241
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,940
I have nothing to say.

242
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,319
Ok, Miss.

243
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,420
Come here, I want to talk to you.

244
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,260
Tell me the truth.

245
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,879
What do you want from me?

246
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,639
I wasn't looking for you.

247
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,759
I can give you a signature,

248
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,959
or a photo.

249
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,279
Anything you want.

250
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,439
As long as you tell him,

251
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,039
there's nothing going on between us.

252
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,319
Anything you want,

253
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,519
except for being my girlfriend.

254
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,439
I don't want to be your girlfriend.

255
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,120
I don't like you.

256
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,700
What's going on here?

257
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,439
Why won't he speak?

258
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,039
Look, Miss,

259
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,460
tell me this,

260
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,700
you know him, right?

261
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,719
You watched the game

262
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,540
because of him, right?

263
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,639
You went to the stadium

264
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,700
to look for him, right?

265
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,300
Yes.

266
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,839
She came here for you.

267
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,039
Dude.

268
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,199
Want me to be your scapegoat?

269
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,620
In your dreams.

270
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,408
Say that again!

271
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:29,119
Come on.

272
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,919
Who's a scapegoat?

273
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,340
Come on.

274
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,399
Miss, listen to me.

275
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,759
If you like him, speak up.

276
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,399
Men like him, have no woman around them.

277
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,559
Not even a female animal.

278
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,519
The security guard's dog at the place he lives is male too.

279
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,759
If you don't speak up now,

280
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,199
you'll never get another chance.

281
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,790
It's not Grunt that I like. It's...

282
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,420
No.

283
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,020
I was looking for you.

284
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,199
So you still won't tell the truth, right?

285
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,020
This is the truth.

286
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,100
Alright that's all.

287
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,460
You can go now.

288
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,159
Well, I'll be off then.

289
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,820
I didn't mean you.

290
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,940
I meant him.

291
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,559
Ok.

292
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,519
Got it, Boss.

293
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,300
See you then.

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,340
Please go on.

295
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,980
Bye, bye.

296
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,060
You like me?

297
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,860
What?

298
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,660
Am I wrong?

299
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,119
No, no.

300
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,500
Why do you like me?

301
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,540
Don't know how to answer?

302
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,039
Ok.

303
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,980
Let me put it this way.

304
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,730
What's so special about me?

305
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,839
I saw you at the airport with a group of people

306
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,959
wearing the team kit.

307
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,379
I was quite surprised.

308
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,219
Later, my friend told me there was this competition.

309
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,709
I thought maybe you were there taking part.

310
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,420
I thought I would see you.

311
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,599
And Grunt,

312
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,999
I thought you were Grunt.

313
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,079
I thought you had internal bleeding.

314
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,360
So I wanted to make sure you were alright.

315
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,759
I didn't mean to bother you.

316
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,220
Sorry.

317
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,839
Why are you scared?

318
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,700
Am I that intimidating?

319
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,260
Your phone's ringing.

320
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,860
Oh, it's mine.

321
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,479
Can I use your bathroom?

322
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,199
It's, it's a very important call.

323
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,420
Is it ok?

324
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,900
Thank you.

325
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,959
Hello.

326
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,719
Hello, hello.

327
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,629
This is 123 traffic radio.

328
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,810
I'm the host, Hailukong.

329
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,660
Hello.

330
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,309
Ok.

331
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,239
Hello, dear listeners.

332
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,499
This is 123 traffic radio.

333
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,759
We are speaking to a hit singer via live streaming.

334
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,959
She has over 100,000 fans.

335
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,420
Her name is Squid.

336
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,439
Squid, may I ask you

337
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,119
why did you decide to put your music online?

338
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,980
Was there a special reason?

339
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,679
Music was just a hobby.

340
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,559
It was something that I was interested in.

341
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,370
Then what types of songs do you typically post?

342
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,599
I like music that's kind of cute

343
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,759
or sweet.

344
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,340
Music from cartoons.

345
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,119
Also, stuff in a high key.

346
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,040
What's your favorite color?

347
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,079
I prefer white.

348
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,239
What kind of fruit do you eat?

349
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,919
Actually, I eat a lot of fruit,

350
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,119
I like apples and cherries.

351
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,820
I like fruit in general.

352
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,799
May I ask:

353
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,020
do you

354
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,399
have

355
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,180
a boyfriend?

356
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,719
At the moment, no.

357
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm single.

358
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,239
No boyfriend!

359
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,759
Then,

360
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,580
what kind of guys do you like?

361
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,380
Handsome.

362
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,119
Calm and collected.

363
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,340
But they've gotta have a warm smile.

364
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,540
That's my type.

365
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,060
Good, thank you for agreeing to speak to us today.

366
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,959
Before we play our last song,

367
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,319
would you just say good day

368
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,279
to our listeners?

369
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,700
No problem.

370
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,159
Good day, my friends.

371
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,919
Bye.

372
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,919
Ok.

373
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,679
Thank you, bye.

374
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,340
Goodbye.

375
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,239
Finished?

376
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,820
Yes.

377
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,260
Sorry.

378
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,159
Sorry to have bothered you.

379
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,500
Are you hungry?

380
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,900
Let's get dinner.

381
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,260
The club is about to start training.

382
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,479
We only have 20 minutes to eat.

383
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,719
Actually, I don't need to have dinner.

384
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,199
You don't have to treat me.

385
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,740
What's your name?

386
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,220
Tong Nian.

387
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,620
Close the door.

388
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,650
Weird. Why did he ask me to eat with him?

389
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,780
Anyway, I should go.

390
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,340
Want one?

391
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,060
Don't like the flavor?

392
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,580
Choose one yourself.

393
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,580
Boss.

394
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,599
Am I disturbing you two?

395
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,119
Why do you keep coming in and out?

396
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,620
Going up or down?

397
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,239
Down, down.

398
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,319
Up, up.

399
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,100
I just wanted to fetch something.

400
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,060
You didn't even ask whether we wanted to go out.

401
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,359
I'm sorry, boss.

402
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,220
I didn't realize you wanted to go down.

403
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,660
Do you want one or not?

404
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,340
Isn't he worried about rumors?

405
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,959
This one. Thank you.

406
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,517
I shouldn't have seen this.

407
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:21,690
Is the boss going to kill me?

408
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,700
Boss, this is my floor.

409
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,879
Sorry.

410
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,260
I'll leave you be.

411
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,439
Demo has a big mouth.

412
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,420
He's gonna tell everyone.

413
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,300
Let's go.

414
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,540
This is Mrs. Han.

415
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,380
Pick what you like.

416
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,620
Mrs. Han is so young.

417
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,799
You're not interested in her.

418
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,860
Why bring her here for dinner?

419
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,479
We brought this girl here

420
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,119
before we figured everything out.

421
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,159
We're at fault here.

422
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,599
So we should take care of her.

423
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,639
After she finishes dinner,

424
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,140
let's take her back.

425
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,479
Not bad.

426
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,180
It seems you're a gentleman.

427
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,799
Eat your dinner first.

428
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,020
I'll call a cab.

429
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,420
What did they do just now?

430
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,799
You're so late.

431
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,340
I just ran into the boss.

432
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,159
He was in a bad mood.

433
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,519
What happened to him?

434
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,918
If he's eating candies,

435
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:50,439
it's means he's really annoyed

436
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,959
and has a lot on his mind.

437
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,260
Just now, he was eating candies in the lift.

438
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,639
I was terrified.

439
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,439
Did they have a fight?

440
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,980
I don't know.

441
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,039
I was sweating like crazy.

442
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,319
I was scared he would throw me out of the lift.

443
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,980
Listen to you, so sensitive.

444
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,279
Shells?

445
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,580
I don't want to open my mouth that wide.

446
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,839
Shrimp?

447
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,319
No, my nails will get dirty

448
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,660
splitting the shrimp shells.

449
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,940
Crab legs?

450
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,999
No, they're too hard

451
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,180
to bite into.

452
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,740
I'll just take some cake.

453
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,399
But will that make him think all I eat is dessert

454
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,119
and that I'm really fat?

455
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,799
No.

456
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,940
I should eat some other kind of dessert.

457
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,340
Those will blacken my teeth.

458
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,020
What should I eat?

459
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,580
So little?

460
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,159
I don't have much of an appetite.

461
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,799
I never eat much for dinner.

462
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,340
Still afraid of me?

463
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,800
Hey, you guys, come here.

464
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,540
Who's he talking to?

465
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,740
Who're you calling?

466
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,820
You.

467
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,820
I'm coming.

468
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,180
What's the matter?

469
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,279
Have you finished?

470
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,279
Not yet.

471
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,919
Wait. Almost.

472
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,919
We're ready to start training.

473
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,719
Then sit down and keep us company.

474
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,180
Keep you company?

475
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,990
Go, go ahead. No problem.

476
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,540
We'd love to.

477
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,860
Mrs. Han.

478
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,700
Mrs. Han?

479
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,159
If not Mrs. Han, then what should we...

480
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,079
I should call you...

481
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,279
Mrs. Han, what's your name?

482
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,119
Just call me Tong Nian.

483
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,199
Tong Nian?

484
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,759
Reminds me of a song!

485
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,259
♪ On the tree beside the pond ♪

486
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,879
♪ Cicadas are singing summer is here ♪

487
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,559
Tong Nian, good name.

488
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,409
Mrs. Han, your clothes are pretty.

489
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,940
It says "hello".

490
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,599
You're beautiful.

491
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,079
Eat some more, Mrs. Han.  -You're too thin.

492
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,398
You don't need to lose any weight.

493
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,599
Eat some more.  -Yes.

494
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,599
Well, Mrs. Han, what do you do for a living?

495
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,279
Yes, what's your job?

496
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,340
I, I'm

497
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,500
kind of a singer online.

498
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,099
-I know!  -Really?

499
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,479
My classmate was a singer online.

500
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,439
Lots of people do that now.

501
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,359
Really?

502
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,119
Mrs. Han, where can we find you on the Internet?

503
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,180
Yeah.

504
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,479
You can find me on NetEase Cloud Music.

505
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,429
Search Squid. That's my name.

506
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,900
Go on, search!

507
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,220
Search!

508
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,620
Boss, are you searching, too?

509
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,210
= Mailbox =

510
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,999
Well...  -Oh my goodness!

511
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,020
What? What did you find?

512
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,340
Look at this.

513
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,159
NetEase musician!

514
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,519
You've got so many fans.

515
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,559
Exactly. She has way more fans than us.
= Squid: 1.262 million fans =

516
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,620
And she's a VIP on Weibo.

517
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,159
She's even got a profile on Baidupedia.

518
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,919
Impressive.

519
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,679
Good for you, boss!
=NetEase musician, student at Jiaodong University=

520
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,839
He never goes after girls.

521
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,839
But when he makes a move,

522
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,639
he finds a lovely and sweet celebrity.

523
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,399
Look at the boss. He's so calm.

524
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,719
He doesn't even give her a second glance.

525
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,320
Look, Mrs. Han's still looking at him.

526
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,079
Hey, if she follows me on Weibo,

527
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,959
will I get a lot of attention?

528
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,380
Ask her. Go ahead.

529
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,340
Well, Mrs. Han.

530
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,479
Mrs. Han,

531
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,539
well, your profile says that

532
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,899
you're majoring in biotechnology

533
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,279
and electronic engineering.

534
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,140
Did you just start university?

535
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,479
Oh, that's what I did as an undergraduate.

536
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,860
I'm a post-grad now.

537
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,399
When did you do your undergrad?

538
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,359
When I was 15.

539
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,139
15?

540
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,240
When I was 15, I was still in middle school.

541
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,359
There was a special class for teenagers.

542
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,679
You're a genius!

543
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,479
Mrs. Han.

544
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,809
I've always dreamed of knowing a genius.

545
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,559
Can you help me?

546
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,359
What do you mean?

547
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,740
Introduce one to me.

548
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,919
That's possible.

549
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,359
But they're usually pretty hard-working. So...

550
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,359
Mrs. Han, I bet you're good at games.

551
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:36,959
Right.

552
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,199
I don't play games.

553
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,919
I don't understand them at all.

554
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,679
How is that possible?

555
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,999
Hasn't the boss played games with you?

556
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,540
Yes, Boss.

557
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,879
I can't say I've played any games with Grunt.

558
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,660
It'll create more misunderstanding.

559
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,639
No, never.

560
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,799
Then, come join our team!

561
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,200
Yes! We can teach you.

562
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,479
If you're finished, let's go.

563
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,260
The cab is waiting outside.

564
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,260
And you two.

565
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,060
Don't call her Mrs. Han from now on.

566
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,959
Boss, don't be angry.

567
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,620
Eat some more.

568
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,079
Well then, we'd better get going.

569
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,679
Come on, eat some more!

570
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,799
You haven't eaten anything.

571
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,300
You...

572
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,780
Sir, please take her to...

573
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,060
Where do you live?

574
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,660
White Swan.

575
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,060
White Swan Hotel.

576
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,340
Ok.

577
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,860
Go ahead. I'm listening.

578
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,320
Ok.

579
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,760
♪ I pretend I don't care about you ♪

580
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,880
Does he think I'm annoying?

581
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:04,490
♪ Just want to be closer to you ♪

582
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,650
Does this mean we might never see each other again?

583
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:20,650
♪ I tell myself we just need more time ♪

584
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,260
Why didn't he give me a second look?

585
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:40,120
♪ Thinking he's just pretending he doesn't care ♪

586
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:47,720
♪ I thought my guard would fool you ♪

587
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,740
Why has my first love brought me so much sorrow?

588
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:01,980
♪ The self that doesn't care about you ♪

589
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,759
I thought that

590
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,319
the boss had impressed Tong Nian

591
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,079
because of his legendary status in the CTF world.

592
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,340
He didn't?

593
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,060
He's not good at anything

594
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,159
except for programming.

595
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,839
He tortures us at the club 24/7.

596
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,940
He doesn't have time to date

597
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,160
a cute girl like that.

598
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,959
Or it could be that Tong Nian doesn't like dating.

599
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,279
Maybe she spends her time studying 24 hours a day.

600
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,239
After all, she started college at 15. She's a genius.

601
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,439
Maybe she's just attracted to men's personalities.

602
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,599
Personalities?

603
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,319
Want to know?

604
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,700
Voldemort?

605
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,639
Captain, the boss is your cousin.

606
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,919
You must know what's going on.

607
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,919
Right.

608
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,260
Want to know?

609
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,439
Ask him.

610
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,780
Just tell us about it.

611
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,239
It's training time.

612
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,980
What are you prattling on about?

613
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,999
Nothing.

614
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,839
Nothing.

615
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,750
I, I'm... I'm practicing.

616
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,260
Practicing.

617
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,420
Come out for a while.

618
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,940
I have something to tell you.

619
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,220
I was terrified.

620
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,740
What?

621
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,340
Grandpa wants you to call him.

622
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,540
Give me your phone.

623
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,759
What do you need my phone for?

624
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,759
I'll give it back to you later.

625
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,939
I can't let him know my number.

626
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,420
Or I'd never escape.

627
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,900
Wu Bai.

628
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,340
It's me.

629
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,599
Han Shangyan,

630
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,799
you little punk.

631
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,199
Book a ticket and come back right now.

632
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,039
You're 30 yet you're still playing computer games!

633
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,199
Still single.

634
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,559
When will you have children?

635
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,879
What a shame for me to have a grandson like you.

636
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,239
A grown man who still plays computer games?

637
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,739
You used all the money your father left you

638
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,279
to build your silly club.

639
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,999
Maybe you've forgotten, but I haven't.

640
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,839
Look at Wu Bai, he's such a good boy.

641
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,140
But you led him astray.

642
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,740
Are you listening?

643
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,020
Yes.

644
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,119
I'm too angry to hold the phone.

645
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,359
My hands are shaking.

646
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,759
Then you should hang up for the sake of your health.

647
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,599
It's ok, Han Shangyan.

648
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,359
I knew you wouldn't book a flight for me.

649
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,359
The day after tomorrow, I'll arrive at the airport.

650
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,599
Go pick me up.

651
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,300
You're too old to be travelling that far.

652
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,559
When the competition's over,

653
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,919
Wu Bai and I will come back and see you.

654
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,399
It is because I'm old,

655
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,129
that I've got to go to see you.

656
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,079
I'll visit my old friends this time,

657
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,479
and take the chance to find a girl for you.

658
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,839
You can't say no.

659
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,999
You have no right to refuse.

660
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,359
If you don't like it,

661
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,879
you'd better get back here now.

662
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,119
My duty as your grandpa

663
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,023
is to raise you up and

664
00:35:06,024 --> 00:35:07,639
make sure you're on the right path.

665
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,559
But I've failed.

666
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,919
Your behavior, ever since you were a kid,

667
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,359
has really disappointed me.

668
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,839
And you, as my grandson,

669
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,239
have only one responsibility.

670
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,060
That is, to give me a good granddaughter.

671
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,580
Well, it seems that

672
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,599
you prefer girls to boys.

673
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,630
Nonsense. Be serious.

674
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,300
I even forgot to say goodbye.

675
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,020
Gosh.

676
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,780
How could I forget?

677
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,839
K&K is one of the two top clubs in China.

678
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,519
Han Shangyan, the founder and the initial investor,

679
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,669
is in the National CTF Hall of Fame.

680
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,879
Han Shangyan was the first investor and the main force

681
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,959
in Solo, the most famous team in the CTF.

682
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,480
He has won over ten international competitions

683
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,799
and was once ranked first in the world.

684
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,959
He has been nominated for the Most Destructive Sever-breaker,

685
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,710
the Top Decoder, and the Most Valuable Team Member.

686
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,639
He has millions of fans all over the world,

687
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,239
and his own fans site.

688
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,519
Some fans even name their keyboards, mice,

689
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,260
and other accessories after him.

690
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,849
His glorious achievements have helped change

691
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,639
the public's impression of the CTF.

692
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,679
Meanwhile, over his long career, he has witnessed

693
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,359
the highest and lowest points of the CTF in China.

694
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,639
However, when Solo won the championship

695
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,679
in the National CTF Competition,

696
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,839
he announced that he would retire.

697
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,519
Retire?

698
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,599
Since his retirement,

699
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,879
China's CTF has entered a difficult period.

700
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,879
Now, as the founder of a top-ranked club,

701
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,079
he has made a quiet come back.

702
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,700
Oh my god,

703
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,540
he's amazing!

704
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,540
Lan Mei.

705
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,260
Lan Mei, it's me.

706
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,700
Do you have a minute?

707
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,340
Yes.

708
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,359
Well, I'm sorry.

709
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,620
That's ok.

710
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,760
-What is it?  -Take a seat.

711
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,079
What's the matter?

712
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,079
I have a few questions about the CTF competition.

713
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,240
Does your husband know about this?

714
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,159
It seems you're really fascinated with the CTF.

715
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,960
You can't even play the simplest video games.

716
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,479
This guy,

717
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,180
do you know him?

718
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,759
Honey,

719
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,798
come and check him out.

720
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:20,639
I'm coming.

721
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,719
This man, this one.

722
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,860
Wait.

723
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,199
That's Gun, my idol!

724
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,199
He's always been my hero!

725
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,359
It's because of him that I came here.

726
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,749
Have you seen him with his gold medal and trophy?

727
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,900
No.

728
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,460
He's the most handsome man in the world.

729
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,140
Right right, come on.

730
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,460
Check this out.

731
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,859
I have the videos of the highlights

732
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,580
of the competitions he was in.

733
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,500
These are all the clips from the competitions

734
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:49,700
and how he detected bugs.

735
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,819
My Gun is really awesome!

736
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,980
Check this out.

737
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,500
Traffic fetching,

738
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,620
encrypting, cracking all at once.

739
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,339
Not to mention this,

740
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,620
system operation and maintenance

741
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,980
reinforcement all by himself.

742
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,739
What a stable performance!

743
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:04,700
-Isn't he awesome?  -Yes.

744
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:05,700
-Impressive?  -Yes.

745
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:07,460
Oh, right.

746
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,060
This one, this is the toughest of the toughest.

747
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,540
Losing nine nodes out of ten,

748
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,420
only one left.

749
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,339
With stable offense and defense,

750
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:16,339
he turned the table and won the championship.

751
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,900
This is a legendary moment.

752
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,779
Do you know what this is?

753
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:21,580
No idea.

754
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,819
When a legendary moment happens,

755
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,819
a mark would be left on the map of the country

756
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,259
where the contestant is from.

757
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,060
Han Shangyan is Chinese,

758
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,299
so the three marks here,

759
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:34,060
look here,

760
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,420
the three marks were all here because of him.

761
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,020
Look at this map.

762
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,580
It brings honor to our country.

763
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,739
You know what?

764
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:41,980
Everyone in the world

765
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,900
can see the three marks left by Gun.

766
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,219
Isn't Gun awesome?

767
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,779
Bravo. Bravo!

768
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:52,048
Honey, I had no idea you were such a fan.

769
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:53,168
Of course.

770
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:55,739
I can talk about my hero all day long.

771
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,789
What else do you want to know?

772
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:03,189
I want to know about his love life.

773
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,349
Love life?

774
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:12,509
You want gossip?

775
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:17,208
Me too.

776
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,808
Well, such a legend,

777
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:20,768
he's even got his symbol on the world map.

778
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:23,029
What kind of girls does he like?

779
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,909
Tell us.

780
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,749
Let me think.

781
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:29,688
I'm afraid that

782
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:33,819
my knowledge of his love life is a bit limited.

783
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,248
As you know, back then

784
00:40:36,249 --> 00:40:38,919
the CTF in China wasn't going so well.

785
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:39,928
At that time,

786
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:41,808
Han Shangyan was the only investor

787
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,928
and the key player of Solo.

788
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:46,029
Well, you can find all that online.

789
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:49,288
I'll tell you something you won't find on the Internet.

790
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,248
Ok.

791
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:54,568
When Solo were at their peak years ago,

792
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:55,728
they suddenly disbanded.

793
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:58,338
Some people said it was because the Captain Solo

794
00:40:58,339 --> 00:40:59,928
had a daughter with another woman

795
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:02,328
so he broke up with the main attacker, Appledog.

796
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:03,888
That's why the team disbanded.

797
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:05,528
Other people said that

798
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,568
Han Shangyan was the other man in their relationship,

799
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,008
because he'd fallen for Appledog.

800
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,488
That's why the team disbanded.

801
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:13,048
Which one is true?

802
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:13,768
I don't know.

803
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:15,229
It's still a secret.

804
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:18,088
So, it is possible that

805
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:19,885
the girl that Han Shangyan liked

806
00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:21,789
might have been Appledog?

807
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:23,448
It could be.

808
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:24,918
Have they ever been together?

809
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:26,768
Of course not.

810
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:29,069
If they had, it wouldn't be a secret.

811
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:31,849
I have one more question.

812
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:35,828
Is Appledog attractive?

813
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,649
Yes. They could be a perfect match.

814
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:41,648
But her looks aren't so important.

815
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:45,288
The point is, she has a dazzling career.

816
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:46,928
You can look her up online.

817
00:41:46,929 --> 00:41:50,039
Search Appledog or her original name, Ai Qing.

818
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:56,848
Solo had two main attackers.
= Ai Qing =

819
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:57,928
One man, one woman.

820
00:41:57,929 --> 00:41:59,648
The guy was Gun.

821
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:01,048
The girl was Appledog.

822
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:03,509
So they were really a perfect match.

823
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:05,528
I'd say so.

824
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:07,568
That's why, some people also say that

825
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:10,648
Han Shangyan established the K&K club

826
00:42:10,649 --> 00:42:12,368
to win back Appledog.

827
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:14,169
-Win her back?  -Yeah.
