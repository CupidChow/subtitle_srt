Why did you bring a kid?

27
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,580
Isn't it nice to have a kid?

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,250
That's one less person.

29
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,580
Four versus five.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,080
Isn't that more exciting?

31
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,990
Bro, you know what?

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,660
I haven't watched you play for a long time.

33
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,450
You look badass.

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,660
Not asleep yet?

35
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,100
Your parents won't spank you?

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,220
It's fine.

37
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,550
During vacation, they don't care.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,430
Grunt? He's offline.

39
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,600
What a shame!

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,930
We waited so long for Grunt to be online.

41
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,350
I know. Damn it!

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,640
He doesn't often appear.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Dang it!

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,300
I'm back.

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,640
I'll take care of my kid.

46
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,890
And you just take care of yourselves.

47
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,180
No problem.

48
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,010
All right, we get it.

49
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,350
You have my respect.

50
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,510
Hey, kid!

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
I'm Squid.

52
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,260
Please take good care of me.

53
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,800
Is my gamertag

54
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,090
not cool enough?

55
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,470
It seems a bit weird.

56
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,550
Do I need to

57
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,090
get a new one?

58
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,800
I can get a new one

59
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,510
before the next game.

60
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,050
Cover me and don't talk.

61
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,090
All right, I promise.

62
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,720
So,

63
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,760
you really pulled an all nighter

64
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,010
playing with him?

65
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,390
Of course.

66
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,180
He knew that I sucked,

67
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,930
so he was very protective.

68
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,050
He always had me hide

69
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,180
behind the doors.

70
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,260
So will you play with him again?

71
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,550
He went offline

72
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,510
before I had time to ask.

73
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,960
He must have ditched you

74
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,220
after he saw how bad you were.

75
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Shut up.

76
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,430
Just eat your food and cut the crap.

77
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,350
Oh no,

78
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,010
I didn't ask for

79
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,010
permission to leave.

80
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Leave from what?

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,550
Oh, I said

82
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,640
I'm going to Guangzhou

83
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
for the event.

84
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,760
So I told Dounan,

85
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,640
I can't watch the net café for him. Right?

86
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,420
Yes.

87
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,800
So is your flight

88
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,760
in the afternoon?

89
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,380
Yes.

90
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,800
Have you finished packing?

91
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,930
I packed yesterday.

92
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,280
I don't even know

93
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,850
what kind of event she's attending.

94
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,430
I'm going to

95
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,850
an offline music event.

96
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,550
It's a...

97
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,220
Never mind.

98
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,430
You wouldn't understand.

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,390
Don't think you're so smart.

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,470
You're making extra money every day.

101
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,010
Shush!

102
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,470
How many do you want?

103
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,260
Two, please.

104
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,090
Alright.

105
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,180
Here you go.

106
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,180
How many do you want?

107
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,090
-Two.  -Two, right?

108
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,090
Hi boss, two please.

109
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,050
8 Yuan.

110
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,350
The price has gone up a lot.

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,140
Not really.

112
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,550
I haven't raised the price in two years.

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,140
Wasn't it 1.3 Yuan before?

114
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,970
I don't recognize you.

115
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,100
I used to come here with friends.

116
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,390
It's been 10 years.

117
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,090
I've missed this taste the most.

118
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,600
1.3 Yuan.

119
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,550
It's tasty and cheap.

120
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,350
Yeah!

121
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,930
Awesome!

122
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,300
Ai Qing,

123
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,360
get fifty to go later.

124
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,010
50?

125
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,390
Dude, fifty?

126
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,720
So we'll just eat this for

127
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,550
the next three days?

128
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,510
Didn't Ou Qiang say

129
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,390
it was awesome?

130
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,350
I want to buy more for you.

131
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,800
Then you can have one

132
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,090
whenever you want.

133
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,260
Relax.

134
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,300
If you're with me,

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,090
you'll never be hungry.

136
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,180
Here I thought our team was broke.

137
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,100
And we couldn't afford proper food,

138
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,680
so we needed to live on these.

139
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,890
Shaofei.

140
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,930
I'll go get some cakes to go.

141
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,180
I'll go with you.

142
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,760
Let's go.

143
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,850
I'll pick out some other flavors.

144
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,510
50 sesame cakes.

145
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,470
Get in line, Ou Qiang.

146
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,260
Boss, 50 sesame cakes please.

147
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,430
Wang Hao.

148
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,300
I've been thinking,

149
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,720
should I borrow some money

150
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,640
for the club?

151
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,139
Don't.

152
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,800
What have I been saving up for

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,500
if not for the club?

154
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,930
I did that to make sure

155
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,970
you'd focus on training.

156
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,720
And I believe

157
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,640
you'll perform well soon.

158
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,350
Do you have a dream?

159
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,010
Yes.

160
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,350
To be the champion.

161
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,640
And you?

162
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,220
I want to be

163
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,430
the foundation of this industry.

164
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,970
I want CTF

165
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,220
to be as famous as ping pong.

166
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,850
And have more people accept it.

167
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,970
You're very ambitious.

168
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,600
You need to be confident!

169
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,600
And,

170
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,890
I think

171
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,010
we need to become

172
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,140
world champions first.

173
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,140
Then more people will believe us.

174
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,050
Yes, we'll be world champions soon!

175
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,510
World champions!

176
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,220
We're getting 50 sesame cakes!

177
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,470
50 sesame cakes!

178
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,260
World champions!

179
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,300
Come back again soon.

180
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,060
-Thanks.  -Sure.

181
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,100
Hi sir, two please.

182
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,850
Okay.

183
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,260
Wake up!

184
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,140
All of you, get up!

185
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,470
Get up! Do you know what time it is now?

186
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,600
Rise and shine!

187
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,600
Wake up!

188
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,300
I brought you breakfast. Hurry up!

189
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,220
Han Shangyan, stop knocking.

190
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,010
Last time you broke the door.

191
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,890
I don't want to pay to fix it again.

192
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,180
Boss,

193
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,090
why are you waking us up so early?

194
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,390
I brought you sesame cakes.

195
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,010
Hurry up and wash your faces!

196
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,970
Fine.

197
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,550
Look alive, everyone!

198
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,050
Do you want to be the champion

199
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,300
or the loser?

200
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,930
Next time we fight together,

201
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,680
I won't drag the team down.

202
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,100
Why isn't he online?

203
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,640
I wanted to say goodbye.

204
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,090
I need to go to Guangzhou for a few days.

205
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,640
So I won't be online to play with you.

206
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,930
When I'm back, I'll find you.

207
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Wait for me to be reborn.

208
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,420
The members of the first SP team

209
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,430
have now been confirmed.

210
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
These five people here.

211
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,430
Ling Shan,

212
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,120
please introduce them.

213
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,780
Sure.

214
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,050
Before we learn about SP team,

215
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,350
we need to first discuss

216
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,470
the legendary Solo team.

217
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,320
The Solo team

218
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,510
was the pioneer of CTF.

219
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Its captain, Wang Hao,

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,800
aka Solo,

221
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,680
is known as the best commander,

222
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,100
and best team captain.

223
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,050
However,

224
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,510
he only participated

225
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,180
in personal projects after the team was disbanded.

226
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,470
But all these years,

227
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,560
he's never left the

228
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,550
CTF circle.

229
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,970
He has made numerous contributions

230
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,870
to CTF.

231
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,230
Han Shangyan, aka Gun.

232
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,350
He is our boss.

233
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,470
His abilities

234
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,430
far exceed Wang Hao's.

235
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,270
And he is the reason

236
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,800
that we win every time.

237
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,550
Our boss is a genius.

238
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,930
And as you know, all geniuses

239
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,930
have a bad temper.

240
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,140
Exactly.

241
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,480
And our boss has a lot of female fans.

242
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,260
Do you know why?

243
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,640
He's good looking.

244
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,890
Exactly.

245
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,720
Next is Ai Qing,

246
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,700
aka Appledog.

247
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,510
The Solo team

248
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,640
had one male and one female attacker.

249
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,750
One was our boss,

250
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,760
the other was Ai Qing.

251
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,090
Ai Qing could also be considered as the mentor

252
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,640
of our team captain, Wu Bai.

253
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,970
Ou Qiang, aka All.

254
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,280
is both primary defender and secondary attacker.

255
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,010
There's no loophole he can't find.

256
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,850
He was

257
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,970
our boss's best sidekick back in the day.

258
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,140
Mi Shaofei, aka Xiaomi.

259
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,120
He's in charge of secondary defense.

260
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,010
Don't underestimate him.

261
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,430
He's good at analysis and operations.

262
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,760
He can both attack and defend.

263
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,010
As long as the tactics call for it,

264
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,220
he can get into anywhere.

265
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,430
Here's the main point.

266
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,579
Now four of them

267
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,099
are on the SP team.

268
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,859
Solo is the manager of SP China.

269
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,579
Appledog is the leader and coach.

270
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,739
Mi Shaofei,

271
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,219
and Ou Qiang are team members.

272
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,459
Following,

273
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,780
inin,

274
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:27,219
and Hua Ti are the new team members of SP.

275
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,249
After our boss left Solo team,

276
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:32,349
he didn't assemble

277
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:33,669
K&K team until two years ago.

278
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,569
Poor boss. He was abandoned.

279
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,199
He's the only one on K&K

280
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,039
and now needs to go up against

281
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,319
his old team members.

282
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,499
I feel bad for him.

283
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,199
Me too!

284
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:48,449
We will never understand

285
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:49,859
what he's been through.

286
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,859
Do you want to piss off your boss even more?

287
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:53,909
Don't talk so much.

288
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:55,199
Ling Shan, sit down.

289
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:00,569
Everyone,

290
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:02,899
I don't believe in yesterday's triumph.

291
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,609
I only believe in today.

292
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:06,919
We have already lost to SP in the group match.

293
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:08,359
So,

294
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:09,569
we must win the upcoming

295
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:11,699
Doppler Summit match, okay?

296
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,069
We will win!

297
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:29,959
= Doppler Summit =

298
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:36,889
= Guangzhou =

299
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,779
Wow, is this a famous basketball team?

300
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:08,449
Let's go.

301
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,109
Excuse me,

302
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,739
I was wondering if you saw

303
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:19,799
a group of guys wearing the same black coats?

304
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,029
I think

305
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,239
they headed towards the parking lot.

306
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:23,239
The one over there?

307
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:24,109
Yes, the parking lot over there.

308
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,029
-Thanks.  -Sure.

309
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,199
Hey, who's that girl?

310
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,529
She must be a fan.

311
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:35,779
Are you kidding?

312
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:36,949
How could she have known

313
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,359
when our flight came in?

314
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:53,949
She's not looking at you.

315
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:56,109
Can't I say hello?

316
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:05,489
The event will start soon.

317
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,319
Why hasn't she texted me back?

318
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:08,409
Lan Mei, are you ready?

319
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:09,239
We're about to begin.

320
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,659
All right, thanks.

321
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,779
= The event will begin in one hour, hurry! =

322
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,279
Where are you, little squid?

323
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:26,819
The event will begin in one hour.

324
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:27,699
Hurry up!

325
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:39,359
Thanks.

326
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:40,489
Thanks.

327
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:43,609
Thank you.

328
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:45,239
No worries. I'll get it.

329
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:45,899
Thanks.

330
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:50,529
Hello.

331
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,359
Are you Squid

332
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:51,949
from Weibo?

333
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:52,368
Yes, I am.

334
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:53,109
Call me Tong Nian.

335
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:53,899
I'm so sorry.

336
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,279
My flight was delayed,

337
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,319
that's why I am late.

338
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,569
You don't need to worry about my fee

339
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:58,609
since I kept you all waiting like this.

340
00:15:58,699 --> 00:15:59,989
No worries. Come on, we still have time.

341
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,659
Thanks.

342
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,569
I'm so sorry

343
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:04,859
to have kept you waiting.

344
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,409
My apologies.

345
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:08,109
Thanks.

346
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:09,279
Hurry up.

347
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:10,819
I'm so sorry

348
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:11,949
to have kept you waiting.

349
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:12,779
I'm really sorry.

350
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:14,029
That's all right.

351
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:14,909
It's okay!

352
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:16,319
I flew in from Shanghai and

353
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,529
all of the flights were delayed today.

354
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,159
Thank you for your understanding.

355
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:19,819
Hurry up!

356
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:20,409
You have a pile to sign.

357
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:21,449
I signed half already.

358
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:22,239
You are so slow.

359
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:24,659
Thanks!

360
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:25,909
Can I have a signature?

361
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:27,359
Thanks.

362
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:28,139
Thanks.

363
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,979
♪ You are always determined ♪

364
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:34,439
Thanks.

365
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:36,569
♪ You are faithful ♪

366
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:41,008
♪ Let's go break all the rules ♪

367
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,039
Okay, thanks.

368
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,029
♪ And overcome difficulties ♪

369
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:49,109
Your indifference

370
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,529
has reached a new level.

371
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,109
I'm teasing you.

372
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,449
Last time you forgot

373
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:54,949
to thank your fans,

374
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:56,239
and were badmouthed. Remember?

375
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,199
How could I forget?

376
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,449
I cried for two days at home.

377
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,359
Do you know

378
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,859
if there are any competitions nearby?

379
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:09,819
Like a basketball game,

380
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:10,739
or a soccer game?

381
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:11,409
They also go to

382
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,739
training, right?

383
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:13,909
Do you know

384
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:14,739
where they would train?

385
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:16,109
Are you okay?

386
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,949
Why are you interested in sports?

387
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:19,359
No reason.

388
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:20,279
I was just curious.

389
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,069
The CTF competition

390
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,949
my husband is so crazy about

391
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,809
is happening nearby.

392
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,569
Really?

393
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:28,409
When is it?

394
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:29,279
Today.

395
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:30,409
My husband is

396
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:31,159
a big CTF fan.

397
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,659
When I told him

398
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:33,899
my event was also in Guangzhou,

399
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:35,239
he decided to fly with me

400
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,739
just to watch the competition.

401
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,029
It started at 3pm.

402
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:40,489
So it's already started.

403
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:41,359
Oh right,

404
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:42,899
the CTF contestants

405
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:43,569
dress like athletes.

406
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:44,359
They also wear

407
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,029
the same uniforms, right?

408
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:46,859
Yes.

409
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:49,499
Hi, excuse me.

410
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:50,299
I was wondering

411
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:51,239
if you knew

412
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:52,839
about a CTF team competing today.

413
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,409
Their uniform is all black.

414
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:55,359
Know which team that is?

415
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:57,199
I think it's K&K.

416
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,449
Their team uniform is black.

417
00:17:58,529 --> 00:17:59,819
Do you know where they are competing?

418
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:01,069
In the stadium behind here.

419
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:01,859
It's started a while ago,

420
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:02,899
and should be almost finished now.

421
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:03,909
Thank you!

422
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,199
-Hurry!  -What's up?

423
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:05,909
Let's watch the competition!

424
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:06,609
I'm not going.

425
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:07,168
I need to collect the money.

426
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,069
You go ahead.

427
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,279
You might still see the very end.

428
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,449
Collect mine for me too, please!

429
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,199
No way!

430
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:12,569
Pretty please!

431
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,569
I will.

432
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:21,739
Are you okay?

433
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:23,569
I'm fine.

434
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:25,909
Our team leader

435
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,199
went to the pharmacy

436
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,409
to get some medicine for me.

437
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:30,779
But you look really sick.

438
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,239
Are you sick?

439
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,029
He has a bad stomachache.

440
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:37,659
Can you hang in there?

441
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,159
No problem.

442
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,699
Boss, don't worry.

443
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,449
I won't embarrass you.

444
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:55,319
Hang in there if you can.

445
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:56,609
It's going to be a battle.

446
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,609
I think

447
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:05,199
we should find a substitute.

448
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:07,609
Wait,

449
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:10,239
what substitute?

450
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,409
I don't need...

451
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,449
a substitute!

452
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,859
If I must die,

453
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,199
I'll die fighting!

454
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:28,899
Let's go.

455
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:30,699
Don't be so stubborn.

456
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:31,279
I'm okay.

457
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:33,279
Grunt, you should go to the hospital. Okay?

458
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:35,989
Keep an eye on him.

459
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,779
Don't worry, I will.

460
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:39,529
I've also contacted a doctor.

461
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:08,739
Excuse me, your ticket please.

462
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,109
My ticket?

463
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,449
Where can I buy one?

464
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:12,899
They're no longer being sold.

465
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:14,029
I can't buy one anywhere?

466
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:17,899
Hey miss,

467
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:18,699
do you want a ticket?

468
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:19,659
I have one here.

469
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:20,629
I'll give you a deal.

470
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:22,359
Are you a ticket scalper?

471
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,029
Yes.

472
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:23,909
What's wrong?

473
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,319
You're worried that I might give you a fake one?

474
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:25,989
Relax.

475
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:27,279
I will sell it to you right here,

476
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,109
and you can pay me

477
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,739
in front of the ticket checker.

478
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:30,779
No, thanks.

479
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:31,779
I don't buy from ticket scalpers.

480
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:32,409
Thanks.

481
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,779
Miss, I wonder

482
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:35,449
if there are

483
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:36,319
any online tickets.

484
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,069
Or any

485
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,029
extras anywhere?

486
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,449
I can buy it now.

487
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,239
I can give you the money now.

488
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:42,319
Well,

489
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,489
if you wait here,

490
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,109
maybe some people will return their tickets.

491
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:45,819
Please,

492
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,529
the contest is almost over.

493
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:48,789
Nobody will return their tickets now.

494
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,949
Please.

495
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:51,659
Clear the path in front of here.

496
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:52,859
Our team members

497
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:53,989
will get on the bus here.

498
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:55,359
Take care of it, thanks.

499
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:57,199
Please let me see Grunt.

500
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,569
There's nothing I can do.

501
00:20:58,699 --> 00:20:59,199
Really.

502
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,859
Please.

503
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,659
Are you a fan of K&K?

504
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:07,409
Yes, I like Grunt.

505
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,069
Grunt?

506
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,529
You like him?

507
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:13,659
Do you know him?

508
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,489
Are you also a CTF participant today?

509
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,109
No, I'm just a staff member.

510
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:21,019
It's been a while since I played.

511
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:22,569
I've retired.

512
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:24,368
You know,

513
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,029
the competition is almost over.

514
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,069
Do you still want to go in?

515
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,069
Yes! I'll be happy if I can see him

516
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:29,989
for just one second.

517
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:35,489
Hello.

518
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:37,389
Can I bring her in with me?

519
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:38,779
You can think of her as

520
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:39,739
a guest of the SP club.

521
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:40,949
Yes, that's fine.

522
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:42,169
You are very lucky, miss.

523
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:42,779
Go on in.

524
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:43,449
Thank you!

525
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:44,279
Thanks!

526
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,029
I appreciate it!

527
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,029
I can only bring you in this far.

528
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,359
If you walk down the

529
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,159
corridor in front of us,

530
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,109
and then turn right

531
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,739
you'll find a place to sit down and watch.

532
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:00,699
Thank you.

533
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:01,569
Thank you so much for this.

534
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:02,409
No worries.

535
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:03,448
Hurry up.

536
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:04,739
K&K's contest is almost over.

537
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:06,279
Okay, then I'd better hurry.

538
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:06,909
Thanks again.

539
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:07,569
Bye!

540
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:08,069
Bye!

541
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:17,049
K&K has already easily infiltrated server A.
= Doppler Summit semi-final, Guangzhou =

542
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,699
The attackers are Ling Shan and Dai Feng.

543
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:20,659
The two of them work really well with each other.

544
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,409
The vulnerability has been completely infiltrated.

545
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,989
The charm of this kind of competition

546
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:26,279
is the combat techniques.

547
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:28,659
The contestants will attack and penetrate

548
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:29,989
the opponent's server

549
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:31,069
in an closed environment.

550
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:32,239
At the same time, they also need to

551
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:34,469
protect their own server.

552
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:37,569
The magic is created by these network masters.

553
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,109
Overnight.

554
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:13,279
Overnight.

555
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,069
Dai Feng got through the backdoor!

556
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:15,659
Well done!

557
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:16,659
Ling Shan cracked their password

558
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:17,359
at the last second.

559
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,159
Congratulations, K&K!

560
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:27,089
Take them out for a nice meal.

561
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:27,569
Okay.

562
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:37,569
He saw me.

563
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:38,839
What should I say?

564
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:45,159
Came to watch the competition?

565
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,029
Where's your boyfriend?

566
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,569
The guy running the net café with you.

567
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:52,319
Did he come?

568
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,199
Don't you remember me?

569
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,779
I think I scared her.

570
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:03,279
Don't be scared.

571
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,819
I just wanted to say hi.

572
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:07,569
Guess you don't remember me.

573
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:08,449
Enjoy the show.

574
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,359
I remember you!

575
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:13,779
Last time at the net café...

576
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,469
What should I say to him?

577
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:22,779
...you won a prize.

578
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:27,359
Right.

579
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:29,909
I did.

580
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:34,449
Our boss is chatting

581
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:35,319
with a hot chick.

582
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:38,739
I didn't think he knew any hot girls.

583
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,989
I guess...

584
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:43,909
Isn't she from the airport?

585
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:44,819
Right.

586
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:46,319
Is that his girlfriend?

587
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:47,279
I knew it.

588
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:48,899
He must have

589
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:50,359
a super jealous girlfriend.

590
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,899
The whole point of this is to attract girls.

591
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,109
Even our leader has a girl.

592
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,239
And he's so weird.

593
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,659
Shush!

594
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:11,699
Why did she let go so soon?

595
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:18,529
You three

596
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:19,819
don't want to get some food, right?

597
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:21,109
Oh no, we do. We do.

598
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:22,859
Hurry, let's go.

599
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:31,449
I am so dumb.

600
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,359
Why did I tell him

601
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:34,699
he won a prize?

602
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:37,109
What was I thinking?

603
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:47,319
How is he?

604
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:50,779
As soon as he was done, he collapsed.

605
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:52,569
I'm fine.

606
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:55,199
Just get me some hot water.

607
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,319
No need to call a doctor.

608
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,259
If you die here, you won't get compensation!

609
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:02,569
Boss, please don't be mean

610
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,619
when I'm this sick.

611
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:05,899
Dai Feng, get some hot water.

612
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:06,739
-Hurry!  -Okay.

613
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:22,359
He really doesn't look good.

614
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:25,239
He's been throwing up since this morning.

615
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:26,609
Now his stomach is completely empty,

616
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,149
but he's still puking.

617
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,949
He's very weak now.

618
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:31,859
It might be gastrointestinal bleeding.

619
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:33,989
Where's the doctor?

620
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:35,339
On the way.

621
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:36,249
I'll go wait for him.

622
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:49,739
They were really good.

623
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,899
K&K team has

624
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,859
a lot of strong players.

625
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,069
Their opponent

626
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:55,279
is still unable to

627
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,069
maintain control of the situation.

628
00:26:58,069 --> 00:26:58,739
Right?

629
00:26:58,739 --> 00:26:59,859
Excuse me,

630
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:00,899
I was wondering

631
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:03,069
if you knew more about the team on the left,

632
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:04,199
K&K team.

633
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,899
What are they like?

634
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,069
Amazing!  -K&K

635
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:07,739
is one of the

636
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:09,029
two top clubs in the world.

637
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,609
Their boss recently returned from abroad

638
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:12,529
and the Chinese branch he put together

639
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,569
is obliterating everyone.

640
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,699
Everyone, except for SP,

641
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:17,949
is scared of them.

642
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,949
They have a team member called Grunt.

643
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:21,739
Do you know him?

644
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:22,609
Grunt?

645
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:23,279
What's he like?

646
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,359
Of course he's amazing.

647
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:25,279
He's one of

648
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:26,609
K&K's key members.

649
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:27,699
So of course he's great, right?

650
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,029
I came all the way from Suzhou

651
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,249
just to see him.

652
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:30,769
Really?

653
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,409
-Really?  -Yes.

654
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:32,949
Will they return to the stage later?

655
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,529
Return?

656
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:35,429
They just won their match and left.

657
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:37,779
So they won't come back?

658
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:38,249
Nope.

659
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:38,949
They usually

660
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,899
go directly back to their hotel

661
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,109
after a match.

662
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,909
We are here

663
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:43,319
waiting for the next match.

664
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:45,109
Thank you guys.

665
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,069
No worries.  -Sure.

666
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:47,989
So, I think

667
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,609
there's a slight chance

668
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:53,199
that K&K might still lose.

669
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:06,029
Did you hear

670
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:07,239
Grunt had stomach cramps this morning,

671
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:07,899
but he kept playing

672
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:09,199
the whole afternoon?

673
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:09,819
And he even won like that.

674
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:10,909
Excuse me,

675
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:12,029
what did you just say?

676
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,069
Grunt had stomach cramps?

677
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:13,659
Yes.

678
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:16,609
What are you doing?

679
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:17,289
Get out.

680
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:18,199
Excuse me, sir.

681
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,489
I was just watching a match in there

682
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:20,609
and left a minute ago.

683
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:21,249
But now I need to go back in

684
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:22,368
and then I'll leave very quickly.  -No, you can't.

685
00:28:22,449 --> 00:28:23,949
If you left, your ticket expired.

686
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:24,699
You can't enter again.

687
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,699
I can leave my luggage here, okay?

688
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:28,249
I'll be back out in a minute.  -Sorry, we have rules.

689
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:29,069
Please just leave.

690
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,699
Please sir, let me back in.

691
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,069
I really like Grunt.

692
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,069
I just heard he has stomach cramps,

693
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:34,699
so I need to check on him.

694
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:35,489
Is it any of your business

695
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:36,659
that he has cramps?

696
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:37,709
Leave now. Don't cause trouble.

697
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:38,529
I left something in there.

698
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:39,179
I need to get it now.

699
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,899
Don't you have your things here?

700
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:40,609
Don't lie to me.

701
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:41,979
Leave now. Don't cause trouble.

702
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:43,489
What are you doing?

703
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,949
Don't shove her like that.

704
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,109
I didn't.

705
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,359
I'm just doing my job.

706
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:49,199
One, two, three, four, five, six,

707
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:50,489
all of us saw you do it.

708
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:51,899
Leave, just leave.

709
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,069
Do you also like Grunt?

710
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:57,909
I made this for him.

711
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:58,989
You can have it.

712
00:28:59,199 --> 00:28:59,949
Thank you.

713
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,569
Next time,

714
00:29:00,648 --> 00:29:01,609
maybe we can watch their match together.

715
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:02,469
Ignore him.

716
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:03,489
Okay.

717
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:04,199
Bye.

718
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:06,949
Don't cause trouble here.

719
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,819
Just leave.

Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:39,949
Thanks for coming.

745
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:41,749
Tell him to take his medicine on time.

746
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:42,569
I will make sure he does.

747
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:43,239
Don't worry.

748
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:44,199
Good, it's important.

749
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,319
Got it. Bye.

750
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:46,319
Bye.

751
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:00,069
Why are you out here?

752
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:03,109
I saw you earlier downstairs.

753
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:05,359
You were talking with our boss.

754
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:06,909
He means Han Shangyan?

755
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:08,069
Although you two hid it well,

756
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,319
I still saw you.

757
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,779
You must have come

758
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:12,609
to see our boss.

759
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:14,029
Yes.

760
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:14,779
Then our boss

761
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:15,859
must be waiting for you.

762
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:17,449
Come in, come on in.

763
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:18,569
May I?

764
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:19,409
Sure. Absolutely.

765
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:20,609
Thank you.

766
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:21,359
Thank you.

767
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:28,899
How come boss didn't

768
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:29,909
give you a visitor's pass?

769
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,029
Why would he?

770
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:32,269
That wouldn't be right.

771
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:33,659
What's the big deal?

772
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,029
He's too inconsiderate.

773
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,589
He should've given you one.

774
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:37,949
But he's always like that.

775
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,319
When there's a match, that's all he thinks about.

776
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:40,489
No worries.

777
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:42,139
I should still pay for a ticket,

778
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:43,648
so I can support your team.

779
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:44,859
Hey, wait here.

780
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:45,609
I'll go ask.

781
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:46,239
Okay.

782
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:49,199
Jiahao, where's boss?

783
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,069
I don't know.

784
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:51,949
Wasn't he just here

785
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:52,779
a few minutes ago?

786
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:55,359
Who's the girl outside?

787
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:56,159
She's cute.

788
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:56,779
Yes.

789
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:58,159
That's boss's girlfriend.

790
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:58,859
Really?

791
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:01,199
I can't believe it.

792
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:02,739
Invite her in.

793
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:05,989
Wait inside.

794
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:07,279
Thank you.

795
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:16,749
Do you want some hot water?

796
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,469
Grunt, hi.

797
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,669
I don't mean to disturb you.

798
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:24,659
In fact,

799
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:26,279
I was leaving just now.

800
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:27,279
But then I heard

801
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,909
some staff members saying

802
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:30,449
that you had stomach cramps.

803
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:32,069
So I wanted to check on you.

804
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,659
How are you feeling?

805
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:34,839
Are you okay?

806
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:44,489
Who are you?

807
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:45,909
Who are you?

808
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:46,779
Who are you?

809
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:48,739
I'm asking you, who are you?

810
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:49,739
Well...

811
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:50,989
He's Grunt.

812
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:53,989
Grunt, she's boss's girlfriend.

813
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:55,359
Hold on.

814
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:02,529
What's going on here?

815
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:04,199
Who had stomach cramps?

816
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:05,909
Your girlfriend was outside,

817
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:07,109
so I brought her in.

818
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:08,239
She was waiting for you outside.

819
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,159
Didn't you know?

820
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,529
Why didn't you give her a visitor's pass?

821
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:11,699
That's so inconsiderate.

822
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,319
Who did you say she was?

823
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,199
Your girlfriend.

824
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,319
Why does he think you're my girlfriend?

825
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:30,529
I don't know.

826
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,109
Do you know her?

827
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:38,899
I don't.

828
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:39,779
Be honest.

829
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:41,859
It's true.

830
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:44,199
Boss, I'm really sick,

831
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,569
don't give me a hard time.

832
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:49,319
Do you know him?

833
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:50,159
I don't.

834
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:59,159
Go on. I'm listening.

835
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:01,989
She really listens to him.

836
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:04,609
He said go, and she followed.

837
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,569
Okay.

838
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:09,899
It's my job.

839
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:15,449
I got it.

840
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:21,279
It's all Dounan's fault.

841
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,609
He had no idea

842
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,079
and gave me the wrong name.

843
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:27,739
Grunt is that

844
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:29,159
sissy boy with glasses.

845
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,609
He's not the one I like.

846
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,159
Let me ask you.

847
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:46,199
Who else do you know in K&K?

848
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:47,159
Besides me.

849
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:48,859
No one.

850
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,409
So, at this whole competition,

851
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:54,819
I'm the only one you know?

852
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:02,489
So,

853
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:04,409
you came to see me.

854
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,529
Should I tell him this?

855
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:11,319
I fell in love with you a few days ago.

856
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,239
I saw you at the airport,

857
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,579
and then looked everywhere for you.

858
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,129
I even chased you all the way here

859
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,379
to CTF match just to see you.

860
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:19,819
Of course I can't say that.

861
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:24,239
No, I didn't come to see you.

862
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:25,529
That's strange then.

863
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:28,569
If you didn't come for me,

864
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:30,069
why would you enter

865
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,449
our rest area?

866
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:32,949
And why are you carrying this

867
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,109
Grunt's fan board?

868
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:37,699
That's a misunderstanding.

869
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:39,199
Really.

870
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:41,899
I happened to hear

871
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:43,359
that there would be a match today,

872
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:44,949
so I thought

873
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:46,699
I would come and watch since I was close.

874
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:49,739
Is that so?

875
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,659
Just passing by then?

876
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:58,409
You flew

877
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,069
all the way here from Shanghai

878
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:04,359
and just happened to be passing by this stadium.

879
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:05,739
That's why you bought a ticket

880
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:07,239
and watched our match.

881
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,569
Then you heard that

882
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:11,429
Grunt was having cramps.

883
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:13,279
So you felt bad for

884
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:14,199
the poor bloke

885
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:15,069
and entered

886
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,069
our lounge

887
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,929
just to check on him?

888
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:19,949
Oh right,

889
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:21,949
I forgot to mention

890
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:23,869
that you don't even know

891
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:26,199
this poor bloke.

892
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,529
So if I told you

893
00:36:29,949 --> 00:36:31,319
I really didn't know him

894
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:33,279
until today,

895
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:35,239
would you think I was lying?

896
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,859
Would you believe yourself?

897
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,569
Be honest.

898
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:49,659
If I tell him I mistook Grunt for him,

899
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:50,899
would he

900
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:51,989
kick me out?

901
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:55,029
I really want to get to know him.

902
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,609
Do you want to ask me something?

903
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:01,359
Can I ask you something?

904
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:03,779
Shoot.

905
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:07,819
Are you a pro, too?

906
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:10,449
Me?

907
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:15,449
Not really.

908
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:17,909
Then why do they call you boss?

909
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:22,659
I've never

910
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,699
told anyone outside our circle.

911
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,319
You tell boss.

912
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:32,159
I'm hungry.

913
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,859
Tell boss!

914
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:37,659
They participate in contests

915
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:39,359
and I'm in charge of their lives.

916
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:40,529
I understand now.

917
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:42,819
It's a lot like...

918
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:43,899
like...

919
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,739
a conference organizer, right?

920
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:47,279
You're in charge of who is coming,

921
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,859
and their food and accommodation.

922
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:49,609
You are also responsible

923
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:50,819
for the overall process.

924
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:52,699
So your job is very hard.

925
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,819
When you put it like that, they sound similar.

926
00:37:58,659 --> 00:37:59,699
I...

927
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:04,609
Boss,

928
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,909
are you done talking?

929
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:06,949
What's up?

930
00:38:07,779 --> 00:38:09,909
Well, the guys are starving.

931
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:10,989
Yeah. We're hungry.

932
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:13,779
Have them get on the bus.

933
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:31,529
Ling Shan,

934
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:33,609
escort the young lady out there

935
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:35,159
back to the hotel.

936
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:37,529
Okay.

937
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,739
Zhou Yi.

938
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,109
Boss, Ling Shan made me do it.

939
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,809
I didn't hear anything, really.

940
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:48,199
Find our team leader

941
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:50,199
and tell her I need to talk to her.

942
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:52,819
Okay.

943
00:38:57,529 --> 00:38:58,279
Guys,

944
00:38:58,359 --> 00:38:59,699
let's go eat.

945
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,889
I'll help you with your suitcases.

946
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:14,369
Let's go.

947
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:15,819
It's all right. I can take them.

948
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:16,529
It's fine, let me help.

949
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:17,409
Let's go. Hurry.

950
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,449
Where to?

951
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:19,319
Let's go eat.

952
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:20,909
What?

953
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:22,609
Boss told me to help you get on the bus

954
00:39:22,669 --> 00:39:23,449
so you can eat with us at the hotel.

955
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,859
I can go with you guys?

956
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:27,779
Of course.

957
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:28,899
You need to meet the team.

958
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:29,489
Let's go.

959
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:32,859
Don't be scared.

960
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:34,279
We don't bite. Let's go.

961
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:35,529
I need to know

962
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:38,029
if Han Shangyan said I could come?

963
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,109
Of course.

964
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:40,504
Boss told me to help you.

965
00:39:40,584 --> 00:39:41,544
Let's go.

966
00:39:41,664 --> 00:39:42,374
Okay.

967
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:48,834
Han Shangyan.

968
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:54,624
I heard your girlfriend is here.

969
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:55,954
That's bullshit.

970
00:39:57,084 --> 00:39:59,084
Right, there's something I want to ask.

971
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:02,024
Does Grunt have a girlfriend now?

972
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:06,484
He has some complicated relationships.

973
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:08,084
I'm not sure.

974
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:09,924
Sometimes he does and then he doesn't.

975
00:40:10,164 --> 00:40:11,584
He's so mysterious.

976
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:14,124
A girl has come looking for him.

977
00:40:14,254 --> 00:40:15,334
Really?

978
00:40:15,754 --> 00:40:17,254
I guess they dated.

979
00:40:17,954 --> 00:40:19,414
The girl wouldn't say anything

980
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:20,794
because she's protecting him.

981
00:40:20,914 --> 00:40:21,584
I asked a lot of questions,

982
00:40:21,704 --> 00:40:22,794
but didn't get any info from him or her.

983
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:23,834
He's scared of you.

984
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,124
That's why he won't admit it.

985
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:27,084
If he was, why would he do this?

986
00:40:27,254 --> 00:40:28,544
Do what?

987
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,544
Ling Shan thought she was my girl.

988
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:31,514
What?

989
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,334
They said she was my wife.

990
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:37,254
That's ridiculous.

991
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:40,374
They should handle their own affairs.

992
00:40:41,994 --> 00:40:44,124
So, I'm grateful

993
00:40:44,504 --> 00:40:45,664
and thankful.

994
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:46,584
Of course,

995
00:40:47,704 --> 00:40:49,914
our industry is still young.

996
00:40:50,624 --> 00:40:52,544
So we will keep improving

997
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:53,834
along the way.

998
00:40:55,254 --> 00:40:56,664
I hope that CTF

999
00:40:57,504 --> 00:40:58,624
will be the next big thing.

1000
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,044
Thank you!

1001
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:02,044
Thank you!

1002
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:03,254
Well said.

1003
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,544
Thank you, Wang Hao,

1004
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:05,454
for giving us this interview.

1005
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:06,204
Thank you all

1006
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:07,254
for coming here.

1007
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:07,954
Thank you!

1008
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:09,704
Thank you, everyone!

1009
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:10,834
Oh right.

1010
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:13,374
Grunt's stomach problem

1011
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:14,794
seems very serious.

1012
00:41:15,374 --> 00:41:16,754
Take him to a hospital

1013
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:17,914
for a physical check-up.

1014
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:19,124
Okay.

1015
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:20,624
You seem

1016
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:22,044
so mean on the outside,

1017
00:41:22,254 --> 00:41:23,544
but you care about them.

1018
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:24,374
You really don't know

1019
00:41:24,454 --> 00:41:25,874
how to be a good cop sometimes.

1020
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:28,124
You can be the good cop.

1021
00:41:28,294 --> 00:41:29,084
Yes, I like that.

1022
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:31,454
Also,

1023
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:33,994
pay attention

1024
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:35,834
to what they're eating.

1025
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,504
They should learn from Grunt's mistakes

1026
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:39,084
to take good care of themselves.

1027
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,084
Got it.

1028
00:41:40,204 --> 00:41:41,584
Anything else?

1029
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:44,254
Also,

1030
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:45,704
besides training

1031
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,084
from Monday to Friday,

1032
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,084
they need to rest

1033
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:49,954
on the weekends.

1034
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,254
They can read some books

1035
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:52,874
or play some sports

1036
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:54,004
or watch a movie.

1037
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:55,164
They should relax

1038
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:56,084
every now and then.

1039
00:41:56,204 --> 00:41:57,004
It's better for them that way.

1040
00:41:57,754 --> 00:41:59,004
They are all extremely talented

1041
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:01,124
and don't need that much training anyhow.

1042
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:02,334
Anything else?

1043
00:42:02,624 --> 00:42:04,044
You are such a team mother.

1044
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:04,794
Stop it.

1045
00:42:06,164 --> 00:42:06,994
Then excuse me.

1046
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,164
Why are you in a rush?

1047
00:42:08,504 --> 00:42:10,044
I want to see someone.

1048
00:42:10,584 --> 00:42:11,334
Who?

1049
00:42:11,504 --> 00:42:13,294
Your beautiful girlfriend.

1050
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:16,704
Get the kids on to the bus

1051
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,334
and send them back to the hotel to eat.

1052
00:42:18,544 --> 00:42:19,954
That organizer, Mr. Xiang,

1053
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:20,954
needs to talk to us.

1054
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:22,084
Come with me later.

1055
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:22,914
