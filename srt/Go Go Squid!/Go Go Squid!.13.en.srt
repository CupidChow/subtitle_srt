Who?

Who is it?

Han Shangyan.

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,480
What? Who were you talking to?

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,680
Who was it?

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,000

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,480
Tell me!

59
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,520
He called me

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,800
with Tong Nian's phone.

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,400
He said that Tong Nian's drunk.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,480
And?

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,800
And,

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,720
he asked us to take Tong Nian home.

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,200
I think he's afraid that sending her himself

66
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,120
will get her parents angry.

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,920
What are you waiting for?

68
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,160
Hurry up! Get dressed, let's go.

69
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,320
Hurry up, hurry!

70
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,600
I'm so tired.

71
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,280
Is that boss?

72
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,160
Tong Nian must be drunk.

73
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I guess so.

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,040
Check it out.

75
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,040
Why are we on a boat?

76
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,080
Where are they?

77
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,160
Honey, is that their car?

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,360
Let's see if that's them.

79
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,600
Get out, hurry!

80
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,200
Here he comes.

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,600
Gun!

82
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,280

83

Hi, hi!!

84

Sorry, I'm just excited.

85
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,200
Excuse me, sorry.

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,760
Just Han Shangyan is fine.

87
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,600
Thank you for coming.

88
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,560
My husband is a big fan of yours.

89
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:06,880
Yes! Yes!

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,600
He's followed you for many years, right?

91
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,460
So excited.

92
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,680
I don't know what to say

93
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,120
but you should believe that

94
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,000
many fans of team Solo

95
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,120
are still around.

96
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
You're the best!

97
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,860
Thank you!

98
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,680
May I take a picture with you?

99
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,040
Are you insane? He doesn't like taking pictures.

100
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,200
Don't push him.

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
Sorry, I forgot.

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,720
Hah, just too excited!

103
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,680
No pictures, no problem.

104
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,240
I still want to say that

105
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,880
you're super awesome!

106
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,880
You have fans like me

107

112
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,680

I'll make it a good one!

126
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,960
Okay.

127
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,120
Cheese!

128
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,260

129
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,760
Thank you.

130
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
Thank you, Gun, thank you.

131
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,000
Look.

132
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,560
You look great! So handsome.

133
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,320
You definitely did your duty

134
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,680
as a fan.

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,800
It wasn't embarrassing, was it?

136
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,480
Nope, you were great.

137
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680

143
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,320
don't disturb them.

144
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,120
Gun is amazing, isn't he?

145
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,640
Yeah, he's great.

146
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,280
So handsome.

147
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,880
There, there, there.

148
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,400
Slowly.

149
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,600
Careful!

150
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,280
Since you're here,

151
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,400
I wanna ask you one thing.

152
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
Do you like my friend

153
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,760
Tong Nian or not?

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,280
Honestly,

155
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,360
we're not close.

156
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,600
We've only hung out a few times.

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,320
There's not really any

158
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,520
'like or not' question to be asked.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,080
There isn't anything.

160
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,160
It's too early to say like or not.

161
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,240
Careful.

162
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,000
It's not important.

163
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,440
It's important.

164
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,880
We have a lot of time,

165
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
and only time will tell.

166
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,440
"Only time will tell"?

167
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
What does that mean?

168
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,520
Does that mean what I think it means?

169
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,080
That means he'll be responsible!

170
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,640
Really?

171
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,640
Of course!

172
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,120
My Gun said it pretty clear.

173
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,240
Of course he'll be responsible.

174
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,680
Tong Nian must be so thrilled.

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
Let me help.

176
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,480
Add me on the WeChat.

177
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,140
It'll be easier to get in touch.

178
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,320
Right, yes, yes.

179
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
Right, right, there, there.

180
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,680
Okay.

181
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,080
You can contact me

182
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,880
if you ever need something.

183
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,400
Okay, sure, sure.

184
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
Thank you, guys.

185
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,480
We're friends, right?

186
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,360
No need to say that.

187
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,920
Don't let her drink anymore.

188
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,040
See you, Gun.

189
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,160
What?

190
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,640
He let Tong Nian get drunk.

191
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
How is that my fault?

192
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,960
Don't be stupid.

193
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,600
He's just worried about her

194
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,800
and expressing it to you.

195
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,760
Oh, right.

196
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Who is it?

197
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,320
Mrs. Tong, hi.

198
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,360
Mrs. Tong.

199
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,280
What happened?

200
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
We were out with friends

201
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,200
and somebody poured some booze into her drink.

202
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,240
Don't worry,

203
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
she'll be better after some sleep.

204
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,680
Yes, Mrs. Tong, don't worry.

205
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,360
How much did she drink?

206
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,800
She doesn't drink.

207
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,880
No clue.

208
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
Come inside with me.

209
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,320
Okay.

210
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Mrs. Tong.

211
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,400
You're calling Mrs. Tong?

212
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm your mother.

213
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
How much did you drink?

214
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,920
You can't even recognize me?

215
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,920
Unbelievable.

216
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,240
Careful.

217
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,880
Why are you being so mean?

218
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,920
Why do you think?

219
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,400
I don't even want to talk to you.

220
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
Too many typos.

221
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,320
Rewrite it.

222
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
Just feel it,

223
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,160
isn't my face hot?

224
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
Chinese and English mixed together.

225
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,120
Who talks like that?

226
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
Where are you going?

227
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
What do you want?

228
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,320
What a bunch of drivel.

229
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Nothing remotely good.

230
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,600
All of you, rewrite it.

231
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,720
What's up with boss?

232
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
His head...

233
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Bashed into a wall.

234
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,440
Maybe Tong Nian did that last night.

235
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,000
Smacked him into a wall?

236
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,480
Why would she do that?

237
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,680
You didn't pick up my phone call last night.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,240
Jiajia called me

239
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
to ask you give that necklace to grandpa,

240
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,640
he'll take it back for her.

241
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,600
Where is it?

242
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,880
Thank you, I love it.

243
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,840
It's so pretty.

244
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,320
Thank you.

245
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,080
Han Shangyan, where's my necklace?

246
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,400
I lost it.

247
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
I think I lost it at the airport.

248
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,640
You lost it at the airport?

249
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,960
I'll pay back for it.

250
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,400
Stop.

251
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,680
I don't believe you.

252
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,920
I'd never lie to you.

253
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,400
You're my son.

254
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,520
I know we're not blood.

255
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,000
But you're still my son.

256
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,000
What are you on about,

257
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,400
told you I'll pay back.

258
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,320
I can never tell when you're lying

259
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,760
or telling the truth.

260
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
Give me a deadline.

261
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,200
When will you pay me back.

262
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,080
Within three days.

263
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,880
Alright, within three days then.

264
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,440
Was that a dream?

265
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,760
He was so close to me.

266
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,040
What happened yesterday?

267
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Where's my phone?

268
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,120
Sweetheart, call me

269
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,560
when you wake up.

270
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,440
Lan Mei.

271
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
I know you'd sleep till the afternoon.

272
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,840
I gotta tell you,

273
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,800
my husband was so happy.

274
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,200
He's not only met his beloved Gun

275
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,720
but also got to take a picture with him!

276
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
He told me to tell you to

277
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,560
be nice to his Gun.

278
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,160
Don't you dare break his heart!

279
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,760
Do you hear me?

280
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I... yesterday...

281
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,160
what did I do?

282
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,360
Right, well,

283
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,160
we should tell your mom that

284
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,840
we drank last night

285
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,160
because someone played a trick on us.

286
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,640
My husband and I took you home,

287
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,520
got it?

288
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,800
And,

289
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,320
Princess Squid,

290
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,720
you were so embarrassing.

291
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,080
Just a couple of beers

292
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,280
and you passed out.

293
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,440
Seriously,

294
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,080
what did you do before you got drunk?

295
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,600
Be honest,

296
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,720
just tell me.

297
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,840
I'll tell you later.

298
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,120
I have something to do.

299
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,720
Fine.

300
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,120
Gosh, what did I do last night?

301
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,920
How embarrassing.

302
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm so sorry about last night,

303
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,880
bothering you again.

304
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,480
= I'm so sorry about last night =

305
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,640
I must have scared him away.

306
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,440
He didn't respond to me.

307
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,480
He must be so annoyed with me.

308
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,160
I deserve it.

309
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,680
How did I let him see me

310
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,160
act so stupid?

311
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,400
I ruined my chances with him.

312
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,400
Wu Bai,

313
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,600
do me a favor.

314
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,440
The money in your account

315
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,800
plus that bonus you won in Norway,

316
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,160
how much is it in total?

317
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Fifty thousand dollars.

318
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Lend it to me, for a year.

319
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm running out of money.

320
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,480
The club is that poor?

321
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,040
Not for the club, for me.

322
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,440
Did you borrow money from the mob?

323
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,290
Piss off.

324
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,400
It's Jiajia...

325
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,720
she asked me to buy a necklace

326
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,440
but I gave it to Tong Nian by mistake.

327
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,640
Mistake?

328
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,000
Just ask for it back.

329
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,380
How can you ask for a gift

330
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,960
that you gave to somebody back?

331
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,560
Come on, lend me the money.

332
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,280
And,

333
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,200
don't tell anyone about it.

334
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,720
Fine.

335
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,040
Is this for me?

336
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,040
It's so pretty.

337
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,760
Thank you, I love it.

338
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
Let's break up.

339
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
It's not like this is real.

340
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,600
When should we break up?

341
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,080
You're the one

342
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,200
who should decide when we break up.

343
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,600
You just let me know.

344
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,920
Have you made up your mind?

345
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,440
Yes.

346
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:44,410
♪ I pretend I don't care about you ♪

347
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,280
OK.

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,090
♪ I began to pretend I'm someone else ♪

351
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:28,640
♪ Thinking he's just pretending he doesn't care ♪

352
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,240
I transferred the money,

353
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,320
have a look.

354
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:43,740
♪ I still can't pretend like I don't care ♪

355
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,540
♪ The self that doesn't care about you ♪

356
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,240
Tong Nian.

357
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,000
What's wrong?

358
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,960
Were you crying?

359
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,280
He broke up with you?

360
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,320
It's okay,

361
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,280
come and talk with me.

362
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,520
Cheer up.

363
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,640
What happened?

364
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,040
She's single now.

365
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,480
It's okay, girl.

366
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,200
You win some, you lose some,

367
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,000
right?

368
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,880
How can you say that?

369
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,480
You still have a lot of life to experience,

370
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,800
forget about this bad relationship.

371
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,080
Consider it a learning experience.

372
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
No, it's my fault.

373
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,480
Enough, get outta here.

374
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,760
It's definitely not my girl's fault.

375
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,520
Stop.

376
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,160
It's definitely that idiot's problem.

377
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,160
Tong Nian, listen,

378
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,000
the last thing girls should do

379
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,080
is blame themselves,

380
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,960
okay?

381
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,440
That Shangyan

382
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,840
barely spent any time with you.

383
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,640
As far as we were concerned,

384
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,440
he never acted

385
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
like your boyfriend.

386
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,560
It's not like that.

387
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,120
He's just so busy.

388
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,600
Stop thinking about him.

389
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,640
Just pretend you never met him.

390
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,920
Mom, please stop.

391
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,000
Tong Nian,

392
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,880
this is the first time

393
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,160
you've cried that hard over love,

394
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,960
right?

395
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,360
Let me tell you,

396
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,640
before I met your dad,

397
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,400
I had had a few relationships.

398
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,720
Every time I broke up with them

399
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,960
I was just like you.

400
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,560
Crying just like this.

401
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,160
At the time,

402
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,880
it felt like the end of the world.

403
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,720
But Tong Nian,

404
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,080
you have to believe me.

405
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,030
You will find a person

406
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,320
who loves you more than anything.

407
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,440
That person

408
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,240
won't ever let you cry, only laugh.

409
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,240
And he will

410
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,760
love you for what you are.

411
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,160
He'll cherish you like a pearl

412
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,680
and protect you.

413
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,240
Come on,

414
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,920
stop crying, my baby girl.

415
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,840
Mom will always

416
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,720
hold your hand,

417
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,120
just like when you were little.

418
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,480
Your dad and I

419
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,160
will always

420
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,800
be there for you,

421
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,640
no matter if you're sad or happy,

422
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,040
understand?

423
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,880
Tong Nian, don't worry.

424
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,280
I prepared everything we need

425
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,640
to file a police report.

426
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,880
I even called a cab.

427
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,360
Don't worry, it's okay.

428
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,120
Tong Nian, where are you going?

429
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,960
Bathroom.

430
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,800
I'll go with her.

431
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,360
Okay.

432
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,680
I wait for you here.

433
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,600
Tong Nian?

434
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,920
I don't know.

435
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,120
She hasn't come out yet?

436
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,680
I'll go check on her.

437
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,520
Okay, go ahead.

438
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,240
Tong Nian?

439
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,360
Tong Nian?

440
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,800
You've been in here forever.

441
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,800
Did you really not lock the door?

442
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,040
It's broken,

443
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,440
did you really not knock?

444
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,400
Sorry...

445
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,640
Sorry.

446
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm here.

447
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,400
What's wrong?

448
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,200
Why are you crying?

449
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,440
Nothing,

450
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,400
just a bit sad.

451
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,880
I... I don't wanna cry.

452
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,680
I should be strong.

453
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
But mom says

454
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,880
if I hold it in, it's not good

455
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,120
for my health.

456
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,600
I just needed to cry for a bit.

457
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,120
Why are you smiling?

458
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,360
I'm so sad.

459
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,240
Nope, you...

460
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,240
Nothing, nothing.

461
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,760
I never see you cry.

462
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
It's weird.

463
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,680
Yaya,

464
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,360
I have nothing to look forward to.

465
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,480
I'll never see him again.

466
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,200
Never...

467
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,840
You two broke up?

468
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,120
You two broke up too?

469
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,940
Don't be like me, break up, get together, repeat.

470
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,120
I just broke up with somebody,

471
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,800
and now you, too.

472
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,640
I feel so bad for you.

473
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Finally I met someone who's unluckier than me.

474
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
It took me two years, 24 months

475
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,400
to figure out I was with a playboy.

476
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,640
But you?

477
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,920
Two playboys in two months!

478
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,520
He's not a playboy

479
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,880
and it wasn't two.

480
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,800
Only one?

481
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,600
The same guy?

482
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,520
Nope, no way,

483
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,560
You absolutely have to tell me who it is.

484
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
You don't know him,

485
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,840
he doesn't go to our school.

486
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,440
Then tell me about him.

487
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
I want to cry a bit more.

488
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,800
No, Tong Nian,

489
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,320
we have to go to the police station later.

490
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,640
If you're crying like this,

491
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,440
the cops might think

492
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,480
you were mugged.

493
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,440
It's not good.

494
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,480
How about you rest a bit.

495
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,280
Zhang Hui and I will go, okay?

496
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,160
Nope,

497
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,040
I'm in charge of this project,

498
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,680
I have to go.

499
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,040
Let's go.

500
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,920
Don't push yourself too hard,

501
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,520
we...

502
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,480
I... work is work,

503
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,840
I can't neglect it.

504
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,040
Ten more seconds,

505
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,440
I'll be good.

506
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,120
Tong Nian!

507
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,640
Tong Nian!

508
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,840
Officer Wang is available now,

509
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,080
let's...

510
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,400
Let's go.

511
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,720
Let's go.

512
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,780
Go.

513
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,440
Look,

514
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,720
the fact is our brain

515
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,800
is not like a camera.

516
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,720
It can't capture and store

517
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,520
as much important info.

518
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,360
Our memories

519
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,720
clear as they may seem,

520
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
are not necessarily actually what happened.

521
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,640
Our brains process what we see

522
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,560
by separating, parsing, reorganizing,

523
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,480
and selectively deleting data

524
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,680
over and over again.

525
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,280
Human eyes, for example,

526
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,840
if we're looking at this computer

527
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,880
or looking at anything at all,

528
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,840
they may make mistakes.

529
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,680
But computers use a

530
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,440
Convolutional Neural Network.

531
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,360
That means it's more effective

532
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,520
and doesn't make mistakes in recording data.

533
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,200
After listening to your explanation,

534
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
I understand a lot more

535
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,440
about this project.

536
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,880
It's amazing that

537
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,440
you are so young but already so smart.

538
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,400
This project is very complicated,

539
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,880
I'm very impressed by you.

540
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,880
No, no,

541
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,240
it wasn't just me.

542
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,920
This is my teammate

543
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Zheng Hui.

544
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,960
He majors in medicine

545
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,480
and he joined our team

546
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,650
to help build this system.

547
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,640
Hi.

548
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,600
So young but so talented.

549
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,640
Officer Wang.

550
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,400
It wasn't my work,

551
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,720
it's all thanks to Tong Nian.

552
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,120
Nope, we did it together.

553
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,880
Officer Wang, thank you for listening.

554
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,520
Yaya,

555
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,960
how did I do?

556
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Did I say something wrong?

557
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,240
Nope, you were great.

558
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,240
For real?

559
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,720
Yes!

560
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,680
I'm so relieved.

561
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,760
Tong Nian, we did great!

562
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,800
Sorry, I'm not in the mood.

563
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,760
I'm getting out of here.

564
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,880
Yaya,

565
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,440
what happened to Tong Nian?

566
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
You won't understand.

567
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,280
I won't understand?

568
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,000
You finally calmed down.

569
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,200
Eat some more.

570
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,560
You must be starving.

571
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,880
I'm not hungry.

572
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,440
Not hungry?

573
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,880
Then how are you eating so much?

574
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,920
I don't realize that

575
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,280
I ordered so much.

576
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Tong Nian,

577
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,960
I think

578
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,320
you're very strong.

579
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,080
Obviously you're sad right now,

580
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,640
but you will pull through this.

581
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,080
Yaya,

582
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,200
I'm so sad.

583
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
No wonder there are

584
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,240
so many sad love songs.

585
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,120
There, there,

586
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,200
come on.

587
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,040
Did you know that

588
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,800
sadness is a biological thing.

589
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,240
After all the love cells

590
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,520
in your body totally die off,

591
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
you'll feel better

592
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,760
and more alive.

593
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,440
Cardiomyocytes cells don't regenerate.

594
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,320
It's so hard to comfort a nerd.

595
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,240
I'm so sad.

596
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,680
There, there, there.

597
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,720
I... I'm here.

598
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,280
Don't be sad.

599
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,680
I'm not sad, not sad.

600
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,760
I'm not sad, not sad.

601
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,520
But I'm still sad,

602
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,400
what should I do?

603
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,720
Don't be sad!

604
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,480
Two more laps!

605
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,840
Then you can take a break.

606
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
Okay.  -Okay.

607
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,400
You didn't count.

608
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,120
What's going on with you?

609
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,360
You look so distracted.

610
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,440
I'm fine.

611
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,480
Demo, what are you doing?

612
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,600
Faster!

613
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,040
Don't you think Demo

614
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,360
is acting a bit weird?

615
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,240
You're also acting weird.

616
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,640
Am I?

617
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,480
Everyone comes here.

618
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,960
Here are your packages and letters.

619
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,200
Okay, thanks.

620
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,120
Grunt.

621
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,880
Thanks Ms. Cheng.

622
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,080
Here, 97.

623
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,640
Thanks.

624
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,280
One, here's yours.

625
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,480
Thanks.

626
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,520
And here's yours.

627
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,640
Mine?

628
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,720
My daughter Xiao'ai

629
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,000
asked you to bring it to Tong Nian.

630
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
Why does she want me to do it?

631
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,760
Who else will do it?

632
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,920
Take a break.

633
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,960
Let's have lunch!

634
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,600
Okay.  -Okay.

635
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,160
Let's go.

636
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,880
Let's go.

637
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,560
No peeking.

638
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,600
Han Shangyan,

639
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,880
I had Xiao'ai find some photos

640
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,680
to help encourage you.

641
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,360
Although we're not together,

642
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,120
I still want you

643
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,960
to be happy.

Demo is not in a good mood.

667
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,680
We tried to comfort him but...

668
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,480
What if...

669
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,400
Boss doesn't seem to be in a good mood.

670
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,480
Boss, we're heading out,

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,120
Why are you crying?

678
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,520
You're here, what's to cry about?

679
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,400
I'm not in a good mood.

680
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Tell me,

681
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,160
what's going on with you?

682
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,640
My parents got divorced.

683
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,640
Neither of them want me.

684
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
How old are you?

685
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,240
Their divorce

686
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,600
has nothing to do with you.

687
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,560
That's different.

688
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,560
This is psychological dependence, you know?

689
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,400
Hah,

690
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,520
you're crying like a baby

691
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,680
but still have the guts to talk back.

692
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,080
At least it's dark,

693
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,120
I can't see your face

694
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,400
so I'm not afraid of you.

695
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,080
Boss,

696
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,600
you're also upset.

697
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,040
How do you know?

698
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,680
You eat candy when you're upset.

699
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,320
Everyone knows.

700
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
Are they that good?

701
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,520
Aren't you afraid of getting diabetes?

702
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,520
If you don't

703
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,480
treat diabetes,

704
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,240
you'll have all sorts of problems.

705
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,520
Even light diabetes

706
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,840
can cause blurred vision, headaches,

707
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,400
slow healing,

708
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,480
and itchy skin.

709
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,680
Severe diabetes

710
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,160
will lead to cardiovascular disease,

711
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,080
stroke, chronic kidney disease,

712
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,160
and retinopathy.

713
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,360
You need to pay more attention.

714
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,320
Alright, alright!

715
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,480
You're right, I was not in a good mood,

716
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,200
I wanted to comfort you and talk with you

717
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,240
since you were crying.

718
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,280
And you dare to talk to me like that.

719
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,960
I care about you.

720
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,160
Besides,

721
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm feeling so depressed and you still

722
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,320
think it's okay to yell at me.

723
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,120
My mom passed away not long

724
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,280
after giving birth to me.

725
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,120
My dad died

726
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,720
a few years later

727
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
due to illness.

728
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,680
I was raised

729
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,120
by my stepmother.

730
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,640
After hearing my story,

731
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,280
do you feel better?

732
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,040
Answer me,

733
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,480
do you feel better?

734
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,480
What are you looking at?

735
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,120
Can I have one?

736
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,820
You just said that eating candy can cause diabetes.

737
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,280
I see you eat a candy

738
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,360
every time you're upset,

739
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,160
and every time you do,

740
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,360
you seem a bit happier.

741
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,960
I also want to try it out.

742
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,360
I want that green one,

743
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Tong Nian's favorite.

744
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,880
Sounds so nice.

745
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,200
No more tears.

746
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,800
Really?

747
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,800
Any other color is fine!

748
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,560
Stingy jerk.

749
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,350
I'll take publicity photos of the boys

750
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,560
over the next two days.

751
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,440
Single photos and group photos

752
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,200
for PR.

753
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,880
And,

754
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,000
the organizer wants

755
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,680
a set of action photos of SP.

756
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,280
Boring.

757
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,320
Are we doing it or not?

758
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,800
Up to you.

759
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,240
I knew you'd reject it

760
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,240
but Mr. Xiang will

761
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,120
talk to you directly.

762
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,840
That's it.

763
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,960
Su Cheng.

764
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,560
These next few days,

765
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,440
please pay more attention to Demo

766
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,960
and talk more with him.

767
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,840
What happened to him?

768
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,160
His parents divorced and don't want him.

769
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,200
He's just a sensitive kid.

770
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Don't let it affect his ability to compete.

771
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,560
Okay.

772
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,120
