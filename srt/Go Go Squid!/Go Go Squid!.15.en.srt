Tong Nian,

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,680
got any plans for today?

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,040
For today?

29
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,490
Yeah.

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,320
The last time you invited us for dinner,

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,240
you mentioned your birthday, remember?

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,200
Isn't that today?

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,680
Yeah.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,440
How do you want to celebrate?

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,200
I don't really want to celebrate.

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
He's got a new girlfriend.

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,400
What's there to celebrate?

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
Celebrate me being single

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,040
and him getting a new girlfriend?

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,160
Tong Nian,

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,640
I'm... about to graduate.

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,120
Congratulations.

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,080
Tong Nian,

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,720
I...

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,480
I got a gift for you.

47
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,230
So I... I... I'm thinking...

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,280
What's with the long face?

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,840
No, I...

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,680
You picking on her?

51
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,600
No, I'm not.

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,200
I, I'm her senior,

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,880
and her teammate in the programming competition.

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,040
Please,

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
don't get the wrong idea, sir.

56
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,420
You mean the ACM-ICPC?

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,310
You know about ACM-ICPC?

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,640
You competed with the guy standing over there right?

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,880
What?

60
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,240
I... I remember him.

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,040
I remember him.

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,520
He...

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,920
He was also a contestant in the ACM-ICPC!

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,160
I remember

65
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,040
he was with two blonde guys.

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,480
They said everything in English.

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,000
The World champion!

68
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,960
Tong Nian,

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,320
he's the world champion!

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,900
His team won the world championship!

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,960
The world championship?

72
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,430
Yeah.

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,960
Oh. Don't feel bad about losing to him.

74
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,320
Young man,

75
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,520
be a good sport.

76
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,960
Can we go now?

77
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Where are we going?

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
To hang out and have fun.

79
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,640
We'll drive you back before 9.

80
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Bye-bye, Zheng Hui.

81
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,080
How did you know I was at school?

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,440
I asked Lan Mei's husband,

83
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
and he asked Lan Mei.

84
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,000
You've got so many informants.

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,790
I didn't know that you once won

86
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,710
the world championship of ACM-ICPC.

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,160
I did.

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,200
I'm impressed.

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,320
I need to watch you in the future.

90
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,210
I won't be joining you.

91
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,920
Give the car to me.

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,240
Why not come inside?

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,240
I have a hunch that

94
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,680
it's better this way.

95
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,240
I have a question.

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,120
So we're not going out,

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
we're just hanging out here right?

98
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,720
Grandpa wants to see you.

99
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,600
I have no choice.

100
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,440
Do me a favor.

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, I see.

102
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,280
I like to spend time with Mr. Han.

103
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,060
I'll help you this time.

104
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,720
Just this one time.

105
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,120
I won't do it again.

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,560
Isn't that supposed to be my line?

107
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,000
Then we'll be off.

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,680
Bye-bye.

109
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,810
Hey!

110
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
I brought her here.

111
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,760
-Tong Nian.  -Hello, Mr. Han.

112
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,840
It's good to see you.

113
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,920
Me too.

114
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,440
Have you been busy lately?

115
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,280
It's okay. I'm not that busy.

116
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,840
Hey, where's Wu Bai?

117
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,520
He ran away.

118
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,280
Ran...?

119
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,000
Wu Bai said...

120
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,520
he's got plans with a friend.

121
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,410
-So he went to see his friend.  -Oh.

122
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,040
Since when does he have friends?

123
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,480
This is the first time I've ever

124
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,560
ordered takeout food.

125
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,040
I don't know if it's good or not.

126
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,680
Oh!

127
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,320
Shangyan bought this cake just for you.

128
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,300
I asked him to cook steaks as well,

129
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,360
but he said it's too much trouble.

130
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,920
You know how to cook steaks?

131
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,920
If you live alone,

132
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,960
you learn some skills.

133
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,840
Tong Nian,

134
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm going back to Norway in a week.

135
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,240
I'm afraid from now on

136
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,760
it will be difficult to come back.

137
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,520
You know, it's a long flight.

138
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm too old for this.

139
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,360
Oh right.

140
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,310
Your parents said

141
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,360
you were scared of flying.

142
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,600
Is that still true?

143
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,560
Scared of flying?

144
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,840
What?

145
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,320
I...

146
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,520
I'm not scared of flying.

147
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,080
I often went abroad

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,760
to compete for my school.

149
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,120
I fly a lot.

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,360
Really?

151
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,800
This is weird.

152
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
I once told your mother that

153
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,160
if you had some spare time,

154
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
you could visit me in Norway,

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,920
and I'd ask Shangyan

156
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,520
to show you around.

157
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,720
But she said that

158
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,080
you were scared of flying

159
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
and couldn't go.

160
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Oh, my mom probably

161
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,320
didn't want me to travel alone.

162
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,080
She was worried about my safety,

163
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,280
so she made up an excuse.

164
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,230
I guess that's what she told everyone else.

165
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
Oh, that's a relief.

166
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,960
It'll save us a lot of trouble.

167
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Trouble?

168
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,220
Yeah.

169
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,550
I'm thinking about

170
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,720
whether to hold your wedding here,

171
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,040
or in Norway.

172
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
Wedding?!

173
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,920
I never said we'd get married.

174
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,970
What?

175
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,030
I'm full.  -Wait, wait, wait.

176
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,560
You refused to go on blind dates.

177
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,120
Now you've got such a lovely girlfriend.

178
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,160
But you won't get married?

179
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,320
What on earth do you want?

180
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,960
Hey, get back here!

181
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,440
I have a teleconference.

182
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,480
You guys enjoy.

183
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,400
Hey!

184
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,480
Han Shangyan!

185
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
Come back here!

186
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Hey, I'm talking to you!

187
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,120
Today is Tong Nian's birthday!  -No, no, it's okay.

188
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,600
Don't get mad.

189
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Let's eat.

190
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,240
When he was a teenager,

191
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,560
he was obsessed with computers.

192
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,080
Now he's a grown man,

193
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,560
and he's still like this.

194
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,880
He's got no ambitions at all!

195
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,080
He's got no manners.

196
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
Please don't mind him.

197
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,720
No, Mr. Han.

198
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,320
I like the way he is.

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,960
To be honest,

200
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,890
what he's doing now is kind of fun.

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
Stop trying to defend him.

202
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,520
He's played computers for so many years.

203
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,960
That worries me.

204
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,320
Good thing is, he cares about me.

205
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,840
He never talks back.

206
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,400
Otherwise I would have died of anger long ago!

207
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,600
Mr. Han, you've misunderstood him.

208
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,840
To be honest, he's not playing

209
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,080
or fooling around.

210
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,700
He's fighting for our country.

211
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
I know, I know.

212
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,600
That's what he and Wu Bai

213
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,760
have kept telling me,

214
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,160
saying that they are coaches,

215
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,000
and professional players,

216
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,680
Yeah.

217
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
That it was official.

218
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,160
I know, they say that

219
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,720
just to comfort me.

220
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
No it's not like that.

221
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,520
What they said is all true.

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,640
Mr. Han,

223
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,320
they've been working hard all these years

224
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,840
to get more people to know CTF.

225
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,120
Mr. Han, did you know?

226
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,920
Over a decade ago,

227
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,040
when he first got to know CTF,

228
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,880
he was beset

229
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,920
with many hardships here in China.

230
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,200
There were no coaches,

231
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,440
no clubs,

232
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,120
and no experienced players.

233
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
But they still managed to

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
make something for themselves.

235
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
They made the world know that

236
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
there was one great team

237
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,600
from China,

238
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,680
and its name was Solo.

239
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,120
The world also got to know

240
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,350
that there was a genius on this team,

241
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
whose name was Han Shangyan.

242
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,280
Mr. Han,

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
every time I think about this,

244
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,840
I'd feel very proud of him.

245
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,400
It breaks my heart

246
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,000
whenever I think about what he said

247
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,880
when he decided to retire.

248
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,280
I fully understand

249
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,160
his great passion and love for CTF.

250
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,960
Wait, wait, wait.

251
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,560
He retired?

252
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,360
Yeah.

253
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,440
He decided to retire when he was

254
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,360
at the peak of his career.

255
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,280
He gave a short speech back then.

256
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,600
I saw a lot of people

257
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,600
quoting what he said

258
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,280
on forums and social media.

259
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,800
It even appeared on the official website.

260
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
Could I take a look?

261
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,600
I've memorized it.

262
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,320
I can recite it to you.

263
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,840
Over the past 2 years and 3 months,

264
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,810
we've won,

265
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,480
and we've lost.

266
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,870
We've laughed,

267
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,760
and we've cried.

268
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,110
There were questions, scandals,

269
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,700
slanders, and misunderstandings.

270
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,990
We've never

271
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,120
attempted to explain.

272
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,000
All good things come to an end.

273
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,630
We've won,

274
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,280
but will we keep winning?

275
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,440
Mr. Han, do you understand now?

276
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,620
He's doing what he loves, just like me.

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,760
I love programming,

278
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,560
but probably not as much as he loves CTF.

279
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,620
Tong Nian,

280
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,160
I'm sorry.

281
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
I didn't mean what I said before.

282
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,040
For all these years,

283
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,000
I've been worried about him.

284
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,040
So I kept an eye

285
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,840
on his profession.

286
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,800
I guess this industry

287
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,670
belongs to the younger generation.

288
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,200
Yeah.

289
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,000
So I've been trying to

290
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,440
understand what he's doing,

291
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,520
and know more about it.

292
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,120
I understand.

293
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,000
Actually

294
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,210
many people still have no idea about what CTF is.

295
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,520
I've never heard of it when I was little.

296
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,240
I didn't know what

297
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
cyber security stands for.

298
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,240
I never imagined that

299
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,360
I'd get to know Han Shangyan.

300
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,040
I really

301
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,080
admire him for persevering

302
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,400
a career that only a few people knew.

303
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,880
It's just like

304
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,720
what you're studying now right?

305
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
Cutting-edge stuff like AI.

306
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,240
Sort of, yeah.

307
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,880
The more the society develops,

308
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,850
the more accommodating it is to new things.

309
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,120
Your generation

310
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,640
and so lucky.

311
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,200
If this happened one or two decades ago,

312
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,640
our society

313
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,920
wouldn't be too accepting of it,

314
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,040
and young people wouldn't have

315
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
the freedom

316
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,280
to choose their careers.

317
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,320
Right.

318
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,240
That's what my parents often say.

319
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,870
Mr. Han,

320
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,480
I think

321
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
judging from what you said to me,

322
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,750
I could tell

323
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,560
that deep down in your heart,

324
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,080
you understand him.

325
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,440
So why are you always unhappy with him?

326
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,120
I'm... getting old.

327
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,240
I try to look on the bright side of life.

328
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,400
But when I lose my temper,

329
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
I throw a fit,

330
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,720
and yell at him.

331
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,360
Then I regret it as soon as I'm done.

332
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,440
I'll try my best to

333
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,280
understand him more,

334
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
he's my grandson after all.

335
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
But if your parents

336
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,840
can't find a way to understand him,

337
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,280
they'll give you a hard time.

338
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,640
It will be a problem

339
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,680
when you two

340
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,200
want to get married.

341
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,360
Mr. Han, let's not talk about this now.

342
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,800
Your food is getting cold.

343
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,880
The food can wait.

344
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,840
That day,

345
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,320
I could already tell that

346
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,640
your parents

347
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,800
don't think much of Shangyan, right?

348
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,870
No.

349
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,480
I've never heard them say that.

350
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,840
That's good to know.

351
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,480
To be honest,

352
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,600
he has many flaws in his character.

353
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,140
But he's also got

354
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,160
merits as well.

355
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,960
You'll only see them

356
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
after you get to know him.

357
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,120
Yeah, I know that.

358
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,480
Like what I said earlier,

359
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,400
he's perfect in my eyes.

360
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,920
Good, good.

361
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,770
Tong Nian.

362
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,270
Yeah?

363
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,760
Today is your birthday.

364
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,120
I want you to be happy, okay?

365
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,800
Alright. I'm super happy today.

366
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,280
Oh... Are you saying

367
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,740
that it makes you super happy

368
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,960
to celebrate with Shangyan?

369
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,980
Alright, let's eat, let's eat.

370
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,020
Come on.

371
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,080
Okay. You too now.

372
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,560
A toast to you.

373
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Thank you, Mr. Han.

374
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,320
Over the past 2 years and 3 months,

375
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,470
we've won,

376
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,640
and we've lost.

377
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,220
We've laughed,

378
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,240
and we've cried.

379
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,390
There were questions,

380
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,200
scandals,

381
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
slanders, and misunderstandings.

382
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,200
We've never

383
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,320
attempted to explain.

384
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,440
All good things come to an end.

385
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,340
We've won,

386
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,520
but will we keep winning?

387
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,720
Don't do this!

388
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Don't leave! Don't!

389
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,760
Please stay!

390
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,640
Careful now.

391
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,120
Okay.

392
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,560
Mr. Han, get some rest.

393
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,440
I'll be in the living room.

394
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,520
Call me if you need anything.

395
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,080
No, no, you don't need to.

396
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,640
Go find Shangyan.

397
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,080
Look. He's prepared this for me.

398
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,160
When I press the button,

399
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,320
he'll come for me.

400
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,400
Go now.

401
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:24,960
Okay.

402
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,440
I'll draw the curtains for you then.

403
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,400
Keep you nice and cool.

404
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,120
Okay, okay.  -Done.

405
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,160
Mr. Han, get some sleep.

406
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,960
Okay, okay.

407
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,360
Something's wrong?

408
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,480
No... nothing's wrong.

409
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,440
He wants to take a nap.

410
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,080
But he just called...

411
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,800
He just showed me how it worked.

412
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,880
He's okay.

413
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,690
Oh.

414
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,120
Well...

415
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,760
You want to sit in the yard with me?

416
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,960
I'll get some fruit.

417
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,200
Okay.

418
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,360
I don't know what you like to eat.

419
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
Is mango okay?

420
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,320
Oh, okay.

421
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,200
That's good.

422
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,360
What else do you know about me

423
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,840
apart from my name?

424
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,760
I watched the videos

425
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,620
of the contests you took part in

426
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,800
and the interview you had.

427
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,000
That's all.

428
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,880
I was born

429
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,520
on February 14th

430
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,600
in Norway.

431
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
I chose Chinese citizenship at 18.

432
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,150
I was a professional CTF player for a few years.

433
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,840
As for the award I won and my ranking,

434
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,280
you can find it on the net.

435
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I retired after 2 years.

436
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,360
I went to college

437
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,880
to study industrial design,

438
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,580
and founded the K&K club in Norway after graduation.

439
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,080
I'm a major investor,

440
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,280
and one of the leaders of the club.

441
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,920
After we set up a division in China,

442
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,080
I've mainly stayed here.

443
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,720
I already know that.

444
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,680
I did my research.

445
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm not sociable.

446
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,540
I know that CTF is just a world composed of codes.

447
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,070
But that is the only world

448
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,940
where I could find peace and quiet.

449
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,640
I hate green peppers and eggplant.

450
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,080
But I like sweets.

451
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
Whenever I feel upset

452
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,270
and want to yell at someone,

453
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,840
I'd put a piece of candy into my mouth,

454
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,320
and tell myself to stay quiet.

455
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,640
I really hate

456
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,560
people trying to control me.

457
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Therefore, I often fight with my Grandpa.

458
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
I always hated him

459
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,480
trying to control my life.

460
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,800
I also hate those

461
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,190
who look upon CTF with suspicion and mistrust.

462
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,960
Because they don't understand

463
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,800
those kids have a dream.

464
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,440
They work hard

465
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,200
so that they can make their own way and own life.

466
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,120
Am I saying too much?

467
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,560
Not at all.

468
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,360
What you just said was interesting.

469
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,000
He just gave me so much info

470
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,240
which I could never find on the net.

471
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,480
I heard all this

472
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,080
straight from him

473
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,120
to me,

474
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,720
like he's saying

475
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
"Welcome to my world,

476
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,610
Tong Nian."

477
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,400
Now I've properly introduced myself.

478
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,120
Don't take me as a hero or something.

479
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
I'm not. Understand?

480
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,840
Yeah.

481
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,510
Do you feel upset and want to yell at me?

482
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,480
Isn't that why you're eating candy now?

483
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,840
What I'm trying to say is

484
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,080
that I'm not a man of great character.

485
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
I am not

486
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,480
a gentleman or a man of class.

487
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,960
I'm not a romantic guy.

488
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,280
I don't even have time to date.

489
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,480
K&K is my everything.

490
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,720
My team is all that I need.

491
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,800
My life is tediously boring.

492
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,480
I don't like to travel,

493
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,040
and I avoid social activities.

494
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,680
I don't have weekends

495
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,600
or holidays.

496
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,800
None at all.

497
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,800
So,

498
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,480
I'll ask you one more time:

499
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,680
do you want to end it?

500
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,880
♪ So many times I wish I could leave ♪

501
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,080
Yes, or no?

502
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,040
♪ Nothing to hide, not be afraid ♪

503
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,840
Don't have an answer yet?

504
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,600
♪ So many times I wish I could leave ♪

505
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Still need time to think about it?

506
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,040
No.

507
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,840
♪ You found another way, I believe ♪

508
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,240
I mean,

509
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,480
I don't want to break up.

510
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,140
♪ Trying to find that one is me ♪

511
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,530
♪ Nothing to hide, not be afraid ♪

512
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:10,540
♪ So many times I wish I could leave ♪

513
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,040
Then we won't.

514
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,480
If I did anything wrong before,

515
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,200
please forgive me.

516
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,520
Then it's settled.

517
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,600
Let's take it slow.

518
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,560
What do you think?

519
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,360
Yeah. Okay.

520
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,090
I'm not a ladies' man.

521
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,400
I'm terrible.

522
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,440
Soon you're going to find out,

523
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,000
there's nothing special about me.

524
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,520
Teleconference, gotta go.

525
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,200
Okay, go ahead.

526
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,320
You're back online, Boss.

527
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,960
Hello, Shangyan!

528
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Sorry, I was cut off just now.

529
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,280
Okay, let's continue?

530
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,440
There's two more covers that just teamed up together.

531
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,600
Alright, the game is on.

532
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,960
Boss, do you know

533
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,340
when China will start training for the new season?

534
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,960
Next month.

535
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,200
You guys go ahead.

536
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,400
I'm still listening.

537
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,860
Okay. There is two more teams

538
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,340
and they formed an alliance again.

539
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,240
But I feel so sorry for this case.

540
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,240
Because their sponsor

541
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,760
were responsible for their disbanding.

542
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,240
Law of the jungle:

543
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,200
the strongest survives.

544
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,560
Nothing to be sorry for.

545
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,160
Why are you staring at me?

546
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,240
No reason.

547
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,950
Go ahead.

548
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,800
Just ignore me.

549
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,480
Boss, your phone's still on.

550
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,460
Boss, trust me.

551
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,040
I don't understand Chinese.

552
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,160
And even if I couldn't hear everything,

553
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,720
I know there is a girl nearby you.

554
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,080
Awkward.

555
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,760
Frogs.

556
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,680
What? Frogs?

557
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,320
In your eyes we're frogs?

558
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,120
Don't forget that I can speak Chinese.

559
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,040
I can also speak the Shanghai dialect.

560
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,300
We've got women sitting in this room too.

561
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,400
So mind your language and behave yourself, ok?

562
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,050
Scoundrel.

563
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,170
Sorry, my bad.

564
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,760
My girlfriend is here.

565
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,640
She's on the mood.

566
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,720
I got to comfort her.

567
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,760
Just for a second.

568
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,800
I'll wait for you inside.

569
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,100
You go ahead.

570
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,080
I won't bother you.

571
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,360
Oh my. So sweet!

572
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Cut the crap.

573
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,400
Let's continue.

574
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,560
Shangyan, to be honest,

575
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,880
I'm worried about you.

576
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,040
What for?

577
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,770
Remember what you promised the shareholders?

578
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,040
If your team

579
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,420
fails to come in first place this year,

580
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,000
it will be disbanded.

581
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,880
Did I say that?

582
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,520
To whom?

583
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,960
When did I say that?

584
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,080
I'm not joking with you.

585
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,400
This is serious!

586
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,960
Do you have so little confidence in me

587
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,920
and so much with SP?

588
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,520
No, Shangyan.

589
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,400
That's not what I'm trying to say.

590
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,960
I have full confidence in you

591
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,760
if you were to take part in the contest.

592
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,560
But the problem is you've retired.

593
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,970
It's your team that would be competing.

594
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,640
When I first started playing,

595
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,440
no one thought I'd make it.

596
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,870
But we won the national championship more than once.

597
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,320
That was history.

598
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,120
What about now, man?

599
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,850
Give them a chance and these kids will surprise you.

600
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,840
I can assure you

601
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,960
we'll come in the first place.

602
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,840
Alright.

603
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,680
I hope you're right about them.

604
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,560
That's it then.

605
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,920
I have to drive a kid home.

606
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,320
What? A kid?

607
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,640
You're finally admitting the truth?

608
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,640
What truth?

609
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,720
Last time

610
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,330
you came to Norway,

611
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,840
you refused to admit

612
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,280
that she was your girlfriend.

613
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,150
You said that she was just a regular friend,

614
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,880
not your girlfriend.

615
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,800
There's nothing between you.

616
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,160
I knew you were lying!

617
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,760
Are you done?

618
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,800
Later.

619
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,200
Wu Bai?

620
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,130
Hey!

621
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,480
Wu Bai.

622
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,480
You're back.

623
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,920
What now?

624
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,320
You need money again?

625
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,200
Not happening.

626
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,880
I'll pay you back.

627
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,600
I'm broke.

628
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,880
Hey.

629
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,480
It's her birthday.

630
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,440
Thanks.

631
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,760
You don't have to do this.

632
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,440
It's okay. I already finished all of them.

633
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,720
A mosquito bite?

634
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,630
I can't let him know I'm allergic to mangoes.

635
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Yeah. A mosquito bite.

636
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,900
What are we going to...  -We're leaving.

637
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,560
Okay.

638
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,240
Thank you.

639
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,400
Do you... need my help with this?

640
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,290
It's okay.

641
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
I can do it myself.

642
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,470
Are we

643
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,800
going... somewhere else?

644
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,600
Where do you want to go?

645
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,760
No... nowhere.

646
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,000
Tong Nian.

647
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,920
Mr. Han.

648
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,880
You're going back?

649
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Yeah, I'm leaving.

650
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,520
Okay. Come visit me often.

651
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,560
Okay, I will.

652
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,040
Drive her back.

653
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,400
I'm planning to do so.

654
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Stop nagging me.

655
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,160
Let's go.

656
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,840
Mr. Han, see you then.

657
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,440
Oh, okay, okay.

658
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,640
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

659
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,000
Goodbye.

660
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,800
Does it still itch?

661
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,160
Oh it's okay.

662
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,000
I've sprayed something on it.

663
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,720
Don't worry.

664
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,720
Could I have a look at your car keys?

665
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,280
Wait a sec.

666
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,040
Here's a birthday present for you.

667
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
My birthday was a long time ago.

668
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,440
Keep it for yourself.

669
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,370
I bought this for you on your birthday.

670
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,400
Although it's been a long time,

671
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,480
you could still use it.

672
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,300
Let me do it.

673
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,020
Thanks.

674
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,400
Do you like it?

675
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,480
I had it modeled according to your screen name.

676
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,360
It's a Gun.

677
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,040
It's your birthday today right?

678
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,400
Yeah.

679
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,480
Let's go shopping.

680
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,280
No, no, there's no need.

681
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,960
Why not?

682
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,720
You gave me a present.

683
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,600
Buckle up.

684
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,160
Where are we going shopping?

685
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,160
Surprise me.

686
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,320
Where do you usually go?

687
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,650
I seldom have the chance to buy others gifts.

688
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,310
Well...

689
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,030
Have you bought gifts for other girls before?

690
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
I've told you I'm not a romantic guy.

691
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,800
I never did such things.

692
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
Will you do things us regular people do?

693
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,560
For example,

694
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,760
catch a movie,

695
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,440
or go out to eat?

696
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,890
Since I entered this field and started my career,

697
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,010
all I can think about

698
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,980
is the performance of my team

699
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,720
and how I could

700
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,000
get them to win the next world championship.

701
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,560
You've done great. Really.

702
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,920
You have your own dream.

703
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,040
That's amazing.

704
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,960
But I still think

705
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,810
it's not good

706
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,130
to push yourself too hard.

707
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,080
Winning is important, of course.

708
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,100
It's just, when your team wins,

709
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,840
you could share the joy

710
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,080
with everyone on your team.

711
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,120
But when you lose a game,

712
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,080
or you feel exhausted,

713
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,780
I'm sure you'd want someone to be there for you.

714
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,400
It feels good to be a winner.

715
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,400
But it can also be

716
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,120
the source of pressure.

717
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,840
At least that's what I thought.

718
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,480
If you don't mind,

719
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,890
I'd always be there for you,

720
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,680
to share your burdens, and sorrows.

721
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,480
We're here.

722
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,340
This is the place where I get most of my stuff.

723
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,960
What would you like?

724
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,560
Oh no need.

725
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,460
I've got tons of PC components at home.

726
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,320
I don't need them.

727
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
Tons of PC components?

728
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,720
Yeah.

729
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,240
Oh. You major in computer science right?

730
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,180
Yeah.

731
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,760
If you won't pick any,

732
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
I'll do it myself.

733
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,390
There's really no need.

734
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,800
I can't play games at all.

735
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,400
You'll just be wasting your money.

736
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,640
Those games are simple.

737
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,640
A smart girl like you,

738
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,120
you can learn in 10 minutes.

739
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,680
Alright then, I'll learn.

740
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,570
I'll do it if you want me to.

741
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,680
Sir, can I help you?

742
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,040
I can introduce the games to you.

743
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,720
They are all newly released.

744
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,320
Would you like to try some of them?

745
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,320
No, thanks.

746
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,640
That's a lot.

747
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,960
This way please.

748
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,560
Allow me.

749
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,920
Wait for me here.

750
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,000
What's this?

751
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,830
Turtle.

752
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
It moves really slowly.

753
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,160
So it stands for the easy ones.

754
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,360
The pig looks stupid,

755
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,640
but it's actually clever.

756
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,960
It stands for medium difficulty.

757
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Panda, the national treasure of China.

758
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,440
It stands for the most difficult ones.

759
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,560
I'll classify the games

760
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,720
into three categories.

761
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,320
You can tell the difficulty level

762
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,320
based on the labels

763
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,720
when you are playing them.

764
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,760
I'm really not good at playing games.

765
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,840
You can always ask me.

766
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,560
You'd love that, right?

767
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,200
You know what this means?

768
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,150
What does it mean?

769
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,120
Tong Nian is a pig.

770
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,680
You hungry?

771
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,440
No.

772
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,480
Thirsty?

773
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,120
No.

774
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,680
Want to buy clothes?

775
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,040
No thanks.

776
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,200
Shoes?

777
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,640
These are enough.

778
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,800
I can carry it myself.

779
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,160
What did you do on a date?

780
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:29,850
What?

781
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,630
I don't mean to pry into your personal life.

782
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
But I'm new to this,

783
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,360
so I want to ask you.

784
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,360
I...

785
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,840
You're my first boyfriend.

786
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
I'm leaving

787
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,170
for Sanya tomorrow for training.

788
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,920
I'll be back next week.

789
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,080
Okay.

790
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,960
Take care then.

791
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,160
I won't tell you the flight number.

792
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,080
No need to pick me up.

793
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,030
Okay.

794
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,680
Every day from 9 pm

795
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,480
till 3 am,

796
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,840
you can contact me.

797
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,260
For the rest of the time, it'd be better

798
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,990
if you don't call me, unless you have to.

799
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,100
I'll either be in a meeting or in the middle of training.

800
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,560
Okay.

801
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,720
Study hard.

802
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,880
My grades are good.

803
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,000
Then keep up the good work.

804
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,480
I've got enough credits to graduate.

805
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,480
School's almost over.

806
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,800
There's nothing to work on.

807
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,320
Well you can't stop learning.

808
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,000
Like the saying goes,

809
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,800
there is no best...

810
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,360
You need me to complete the sentence?

811
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,080
That's not complete?

812
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,400
There is no best but better.

813
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,510
Oh.

814
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,840
Well...

815
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,280
You, we...

816
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,800
Do you... want a hug or something?

817
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,190
No, no, no.

818
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,080
No need.

819
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,800
There are too many people here.

820
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,430
I mean, I didn't want a hug that much.

821
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,200
It's just... You're my girlfriend.

822
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,640
That's what couples would do.

823
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,240
Yeah, yeah, I know.

824
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,240
I know what you're saying.

825
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,480
Hey, you see that sweet potato stall?

826
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,960
All the students here love their sweet potatoes.

827
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,040
They are absolutely amazing.

828
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,530
Okay.

829
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,760
Wait for me here.

830
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,760
Where are you going?

831
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,240
How much?

832
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,400
20 for one.

833
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,080
I'm sorry.

834
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,980
I forgot you haven't had dinner today.

835
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,040
You bought this much?

836
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,570
I didn't know what you like to eat.

837
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,360
So I bought a bit of everything.

838
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,800
Take the ones you like.

839
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,120
I'll take away the rest.

840
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,120
I like them all.

841
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,280
I can finish them.

842
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,200
You... Are you sure?

843
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,440
Yes. Don't worry.

844
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,000
Give me.

845
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:05,800
Oh.

846
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,000
And the games.

847
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh.

848
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,520
Give them to me.

849
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,120
You sure you don't need help?

850
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,360
Yes, I'm okay. No problem.

851
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,720
See you then.

852
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,020
Goodbye.

853
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,600
Careful on the road.

854
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,440
Bye-bye.

855
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,680
Bye-bye.

856
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,800
Wow! You won the lottery?

857
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,360
I didn't.

858
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm so happy today

859
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,680
and have a good appetite.

860
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,000
I thought you wouldn't come back,

861
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,320
and planned to eat instant noodles.

862
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,560
Zheng Hui told me that

863
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,320
your older brother came by.

864
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,480
I didn't know you had an older brother.

865
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,840
That's not my brother.

866
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,440
Not your brother?

867
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,720
Oh, your new boyfriend!

868
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Let's eat together.

869
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,200
He bought these for you?

870
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah.

871
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
I'm impressed.

872
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,080
You've been single for so long,

873
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,560
now you've got a new guy.

874
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,560
Who is it?

875
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,360
I don't want to jinx it.

876
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,190
So sorry, I won't tell you.

877
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,440
What's wrong?

878
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,640
He bought these for you, too?

879
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,560
Yeah, my birthday gifts.

880
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,640
Oh my! That's nice.

881
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,800
But you don't play games.

882
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,280
Why did he give you these?

883
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,720
What do you know?

884
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,120
He likes to play games.

885
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,860
I'll learn anything that he likes.

886
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,360
I'll learn how to play games too.

887
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,000
Alright, fine.

888
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,080
This is super simple. It suits you.

889
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,840
A racing game, nice.

890
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,000
You know a lot about games.

891
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,600
Of course.

892
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,320
I'm an expert at playing games.

893
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,920
Wow! Look at these two!

894
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,400
Gun games! They used to be my favorite.

895
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,080
Really?

896
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:28,590
Yeah.

897
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,440
How come

898
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,120
there are

899
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,800
so many labels on the boxes?

900
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,800
There're pandas, turtles, and pigs?

901
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,620
Why?

902
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,080
He labeled them for me

903
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,880
so I could start from the easiest ones.

904
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,480
He's thoughtful.

905
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,000
Don't break anything okay?

906
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,280
Don't open the boxes, otherwise I'd...

907
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,200
Hey!

908
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,840
Tong Nian.

909
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,840
What did I just say?

910
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,560
I told you not to open it.

911
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,080
Give it back to me.

912
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,400
Tong Nian.

913
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,360
He labeled them for me.

914
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,000
Don't mess them up.

915
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,520
Oh, he labeled them for you.

916
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,960
Don't mess up the order...

917
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,480
Give it to me! Give it!

918
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,160
Come on!

919
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,720
Come on, give it back!

920
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,840
Jeez!

921
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,760
I hate you.
= Tong Nian =

922
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,040
Good you didn't tear it.

923
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,240
Eat and be quiet.

924
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,440
Boss.

925
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,960
Sorry I got up late.

926
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,880
I'll start the training after I finish eating.

927
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,920
It's okay.

928
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,040
Boss, could you live more like a boss should?

929
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,320
Boxed meal again?

930
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,160
Problem?

931
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,280
What's wrong with boxed meals?

932
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,680
No.

933
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,800
I know you're not into sports cars or villas.

934
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,960
But could you at least eat well?

935
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,240
If somebody saw you like this,

936
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,040
he'd start to think that we're going broke.

937
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,280
Are you asking me for more insurance money

938
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,400
or do you want a raise?

939
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,560
Don't beat around the bush.

940
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,520
No, no, I'm not.

941
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,640
I dare not. I dare not.

942
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,880
I'll leave you to it, Boss.

943
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,480
What's going on?

944
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,120
Leave him alone will you?

945
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:51,840
I was just asking...

946
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,680
I, I...

947
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,560
Don't you know what day it is?

948
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,320
You are asking for trouble.

949
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,640
What day is it today?  -What day is it today?

950
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,990
He seems to be in a good mood.

951
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,240
Today is Mi Shaofei's birthday.

952
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,150
Boss prepared a present for him.

953
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
It's Shaofei's birthday?

954
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,240
Yes.  -Are you sure?

955
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,000
