26

I can't bear the thought that he cheated.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,460
Who knows if your boyfriend is good at CTF or not.

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,580
He is. He's one of the best in CTF!

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,580
His CTF skills are really amazing.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,760
How amazing?

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,120
Well, all I know is they call him a Bonjwa Master.

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,240
Bon...

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,840
What an arrogant jerk!

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,040
He is...

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,240
Bonjwa means he is

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,520
someone who sets the trend for the industry,

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,680
to expand the China market of CTF,

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,440
and accomplish countless achievements.

39
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,080
That's what the name means.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,040
Only then can you get the title of "Bonjwa".

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,400
Over the past decade

42
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,280
there have been less than 20 who merit the name.

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,320
Did you know?

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,230
Yeah I know. He has always been influential.

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,880
Anyone who is called a Bonjwa Master

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,640
will be on the scroll of fame,

47
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,830
like Remon, and Stallman.

48
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,260
Of course, China has some figures like this as well.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,320
European countries were powerful,

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,240
but we also produced some excellent teams of our own.

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,400
They are very capable.

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Most importantly,

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,260
their contributions are not limited to one thing.

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,270
They set the domestic trend of the whole of CTF.

55
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,880
Making them the forerunners.

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,080
You mean Solo, right?

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,560
That's right!

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,740
You know all their team members

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,560
are my childhood idols.

60
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,680
Xiaomi, Gun,

61
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,040
Solo, Appledog,

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,200
and All.

63
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,160
I never knew you like them that much.

64
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,650
Tong Nian, in my lifetime

65
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,320
I have to meet them in person.

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,480
I have to!

67
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,980
They are the team that inspired my dream.

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,160
My boyfriend is Gun.

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,760
What... What did you say?

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
My boyfriend is Gun.

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,520
I didn't know you liked them so much.

72
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,640
So I didn't tell you before.

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,280
Are you kidding?

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,350
How can he pretend he's Gun?

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,320
What a coincidence!

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
Calm down. Calm down.

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,520
She is clueless,

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,160
about everything non-school related.

79
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,320
I can't blame her.

80
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Well, what time does your old man,

81
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,800
sorry, does Gun ask you to chat with him?

82
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,400
Nine.

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
Nine in the evening is when he likes to rest.

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,920
OK.

85
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll start preparing.

86
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,920
I'll join you in that conversation.

87
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,360
Tonight I will expose you.

88
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,520
You good for nothing pinchbeck.

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,120
Hey guys,

90
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,990
is our boss abusing his rights?

91
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,680
Give it a rest.

92
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,540
You complain too much. Just go along with it.

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,220
He's helped you a lot in the past as well.

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,000
97, I am nervous.

95
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,840
Oh come on, seriously?

96
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,990
Here, I'll play a song for you.

97
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,880
It's been a while since I played with the boss.

98
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,560
Can you understand what I'm feeling?

99
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,920
Eat.  -Here.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,640
What is it?

101
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,880
Listen. What do you think?

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,240
I really like this one.

103
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,520
It is a nice song.

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,760
But I am still nervous.

105
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
What if he finds out I haven't made any progress

106
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,960
and even moved backwards?

107
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,520
Have you now?

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
I remember your rank was rising.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,320
Compared to the boss,

110
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,840
everyone has gotten worse.

111
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,480
Exactly.

112
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,920
Right? Demo?

113
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
Could you please not joke with me now?

114
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,360
Is Tong Nian online?

115
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,990
Let's go look.  -Yeah let's find out.

116
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll invite her now.

117
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,560
= Grunt has invited Lolicat =

118
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,400
Check it out. I've invited you.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,080
Grunt.

120
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,270
97. Demo.

121
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,370
What's wrong? Who are they?

122
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,680
You won't understand.

123
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,770
Tong Nian.

124
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,750
Yaya, remember,

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,630
when we have to play later you have to help me out.

126
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,360
I don't know how to play.

127
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,860
I'm really nervous you understand?

128
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,300
When playing in their league

129
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,330
we are all bad.

130
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,460
You all came.

131
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,160
My roommate wants to join us. That cool?

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,770
Her roommate wants to join.

133
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,870
No problem. Pretty girls always have a spot.

134
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,480
You only care about looks and not skills?

135
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,270
No problem, pretty ladies are welcome.

136
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,300
Then I'll say hello to Tong Nian.

137
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,080
Hi, Tong Nian. How are you doing?

138
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,500
Let's start a voice call.

139
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,500
There is a button on the bottom to turn on the mic.

140
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,870
Yaya.

141
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,420
Put your earphones on.

142
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,590
They want to start a voice chat.

143
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,350
OK.

144
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,510
Hello. How are you guys doing?

145
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,320
I've just saw the strategies.

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,100
But I will probably still suck at this.

147
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,400
Please don't judge me.

148
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,330
But don't worry.

149
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,220
My roommate may be a girl,

150
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,630
but she can play very well.

151
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,770
She's been playing since middle school.

152
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,370
Maybe she's better than you.

153
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,380
Oh no. Don't play me up anymore, OK?

154
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,430
Compared to these people,

155
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,000
who are from one of the top clubs K&K,

156
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,990
I'd be the worst player in history.

157
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,700
Hello, miss roommate.

158
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,280
Hello, hello, hello.

159
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,260
Nice to make your acquaintance.

160
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,660
It's nice to meet you, too.

161
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,880
Nice to meet you.

162
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,480
Tong Nian. Don't worry.

163
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,170
The boss is with us.

164
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,940
So we promise there will be no trouble playing.

165
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
Right.

166
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,480
We just finished training then he ordered us here.

167
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,640
Are you really from K&K?

168
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,490
For the moment yeah.

169
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,340
Maybe someday SP will offer us more money,

170
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,040
then we switch.

171
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,280
Come on, you dare to change teams?

172
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm just kidding.

173
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,330
Tong Nian. The boss is here.

174
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,990
Hey Boss.

175
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,830
She is online with her roommate.

176
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,730
Is... Is Han Shangyan here?

177
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,060
Who told you to start a voice call?

178
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,290
Tong Nian said she'll introduce me to a girl.

179
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,570
So we start a voice call to chat.

180
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,400
Hang up.

181
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,440
Boss is jealous.

182
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,840
Ok ok. I'm hanging up.

183
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,200
= Account Name =

184
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,560
They turned it off.

185
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,000
Then let's turn ours off too.

186
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,600
Yaya.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
Did I tell 97

188
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
that I'd introduce a girl to him?

189
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,360
No.

190
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,760
That's strange.

191
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,040
Boss, since you are here, I'll back out.

192
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,120
You guys have fun.

193
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,920
And enjoy.

194
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,880
Boss. I'll invite you.

195
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,740
OK.

196
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,200
Come on. We are in. We are in.

197
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,720
Which gun should I use?

198
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,320
Whichever.

199
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,800
Which one can help you?

200
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,520
Dagger. Simple.

201
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,120
OK.

202
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,440
Gun is really your boyfriend?

203
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,120
Of course.

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
I didn't lie to you.

205
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,440
He plays very well.

206
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,200
Can we really describe him as "very well"?

207
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,140
Such simple words don't do him justice.

208
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,520
How should I know?

209
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,640
I haven't played these games.

210
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,700
I don't know how to describe him.

211
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,640
I always thought Solo and Appledog were a couple.

212
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,280
Gun was the third one.

213
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
Don't say that anymore.

214
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,200
Rumors only spread, you got it?

215
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,790
If someone told you things like that,

216
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,000
you'd better clarify it.

217
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,000
No problem.

218
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,800
I always thought he would like girls

219
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,400
who played CTF well.

220
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,640
Who would have guessed that he didn't care

221
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,240
if his girlfriend was good at CTF or not.

222
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,480
What?

223
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,320
Why did you buy nothing and only carry a dagger?

224
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,360
What do you know?

225
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,240
I just asked him what to choose.

226
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
He told me a dagger is enough for me.

227
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,960
How can we play like this?

228
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,760
I don't know.

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,210
But it must be a superior way to play.

230
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,970
Enough chit chat. The game is starting.

231
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,560
OK. OK.

232
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,720
Yaya.

233
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm starting a private call.

234
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,820
Go on, go on. Do whatever you want.

235
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,600
Can you hear me?

236
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,920
Loud and clear.

237
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,920
Do as I say.

238
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
Why are you coughing?

239
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,400
It's OK. I ate too many candies.

240
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,520
See the boxes in front of you?

241
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,400
I see it.

242
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,960
Go and practice.

243
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,120
Do you see the boxes over there?

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
Go and practice.

245
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,220
OK.

246
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,440
W is to go forward.

247
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Space is for jumping.

248
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,640
Press the two together to jump forward.

249
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,360
Here I go.

250
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,050
By the way, if I'm practicing like this,

251
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,320
won't someone attack me?

252
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,340
Don't worry.

253
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,760
I'll keep you safe.

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,640
Got it.

255
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,960
The box is a little unstable.

256
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,320
Am I learning too slowly for you?

257
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,400
No.

258
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,120
Really?

259
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,840
I didn't expect you to learn.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,440
Then why did you teach me?

261
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,960
To pass the time.

262
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,000
Go on.

263
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,960
Got it.

264
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,120
My shoe's untied.

265
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,000
Why do you have that look on your face?

266
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,640
You will never know.

267
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,560
Tong Nian,

268
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,720
how did you meet him?

269
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,080
Didn't I just tell you that?

270
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,600
No you didn't.

271
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,480
When did you tell me anything at all?

272
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,000
What did you tell me?

273
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,760
Just now. I just told you.

274
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,400
I said that we met at an Internet cafe.

275
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,800
An Internet cafe?

276
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,640
That's right.

277
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,160
But, what year is it, seriously!?

278
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,440
Why can't he just stay in his office?

279
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,520
Why go to an Internet cafe?

280
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
You are right.

281
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,960
I don't get it either.

282
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,160
How strange.

283
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,800
Forget it. Forget it.

284
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
What I just told you, all of it is true.

285
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,920
It's true, you know?

286
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,920
I know.

287
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,680
Let me tell you,

288
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,750
when I admired them I was in middle school.

289
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,890
I admired them together with my cousin.

290
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,000
I like them

291
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,390
not just because I like CTF.

292
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
How to put it...

293
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,880
When I was a child, my parents were often absent.

294
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,880
So I lived at school.

295
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,320
Back then, I was kinda dumb.

296
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,840
You're still dumb now.

297
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,890
No, I was just really quiet, so introverted.

298
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,680
I got bullied a lot.

299
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,630
Afterwards, I started watching their games.

300
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,760
At that time,

301
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,960
the world was different,

302
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,360
nobody understood them.

303
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,080
It was like

304
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,760
they were fighting a lone battle.

305
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
You know what that's like?

306
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,320
I know exactly how that feels.

307
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,240
Right. Right.

308
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,780
Yeah.

309
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,446
I liked them back then

310
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:04,460
the way most girls chase after idols.

311
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,600
Because they can do what I only dream of.

312
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,320
Something I could never dare to do.

313
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,560
At that time, I watched them fight for success,

314
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,240
this inspired me to be better.

315
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,520
Because I thought

316
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,120
my idols were so excellent,

317
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,210
so strong, I should be like them.

318
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,040
So later I got better and better grades.

319
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,480
Yaya.

320
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,680
You matured so early in life.

321
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,750
I was young then too.

322
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,320
But I never knew who they were.

323
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,760
You are still a child.

324
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,360
But Tong Nian,

325
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,640
it really is a pity

326
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,670
that we missed the era when Gun was in his prime.

327
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,720
Did you know?

328
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,000
The night they announced their disbanding,

329
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,640
I cried.

330
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,560
Almost all people in the forum cried.

331
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,840
An era was over.

332
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,040
Don't be sad.

333
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,120
I'm not, I'm not.

334
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,310
So are you ready to tell us all

335
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,480
the details about how you met him?

336
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,800
Isn't it time to tell us?

337
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
I wanna know, too.  -Tell us. Tell us.

338
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
Hurry up. Hurry up.

339
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,800
-Tell us.  -Are you sure about this?

340
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,240
Say it, say it, say it.

341
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,800
Well, my boyfriend is Han Shangyan.

342
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,720
You both know that, huh?

343
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,770
He is the most handsome one.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,640
Right. Right. Right.

345
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,920
There used to be a lot of girls crushing on him.

346
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,320
No, no.

347
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,320
That was in the past.

348
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,010
And he actually didn't like any of them.

349
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,560
Really?

350
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,080
Stop doing that. You didn't know.

351
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
In short,

352
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
we met each other at the Internet cafe.

353
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,720
Tong Nian.

354
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,600
Tong Nian.

355
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,880
Tong Nian. Tong Nian. Tong Nian.

356
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
Can I ask you something?

357
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,960
Have you met Mi Shaofei?

358
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,160
Have you met him in person?

359
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,080
He's on Team SP.

360
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,320
His name is Mi Shaofei.

361
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,700
When I went to Sanya, SP was there, too.

362
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,720
I've seen him. Maybe.

363
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,640
Really?

364
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,160
I'm so jealous.

365
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,840
I never got to meet him!

366
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,920
I remember back then

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,400
I had no money to watch the game.

368
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,280
And then when their team was disbanded,

369
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,960
only Han Shangyan and Mi Shaofei

370
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,480
retired from the team.

371
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,000
I had no more chances to watch him play.

372
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
I was sad for a long time.

373
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,600
Did you know?

374
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,720
In their team,

375
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,240
he was the most versatile.

376
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,080
He could play every role using any strategy.

377
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Look, look.

378
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,890
These are all the stats and photos

379
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,160
I collected from before.

380
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,700
You see.

381
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,240
When I was free

382
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,560
I like watching videos of his games.

383
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,720
And then I downloaded his games to watch later.

384
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,800
You like Mi Shaofei?

385
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,480
I thought you liked Solo.

386
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,000
He... Is he a nice person?

387
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,950
I didn't really get to talk to him.

388
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
Let me think.

389
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,600
He... is...

390
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,280
Doctor, is he OK?

391
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,680
You have a fever caused by tonsillitis.

392
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,560
You just need rest.

393
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,660
The IV will finish in an hour.

394
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,520
Don't move around.

395
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,600
Thank you.

396
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,390
I just heard from the staff that you are sick.

397
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,040
That night

398
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,600
I went back and thought it over.

399
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,280
I'm too impatient.

400
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,480
And I said some things I regret.

401
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,800
From a professional stand point,

402
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,680
playing tricks on ranking

403
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,160
might bring success but only temporarily.

404
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,880
Not if you can't really play.

405
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,400
It's been so many days.

406
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,000
Does saying that make a difference?

407
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,190
I just don't want you to take the wrong idea.

408
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,400
If everything is ok with you two,

409
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,120
we'll leave you be.

410
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,290
Would you please help me take her away?

411
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,040
I won't be ok if she is here.

412
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,080
OK, I'll come with you.

413
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,600
Thank you.

414
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,240
OK. OK.

415
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,160
Could you do me a favor?

416
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,560
I heard you caught a cold.

417
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,280
Are you OK?

418
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,160
Feeling better, it's fine.

419
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,840
Stop torturing yourself here.

420
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,000
Go in and rest.

421
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,160
You wanted to see me?

422
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,560
Do me a favor.

423
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,080
Han Shangyan, is asking me for a favor?

424
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,280
What's up?

425
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,480
Help Tong Nian.

426
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,300
I don't even know her well.

427
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,530
Why should I help her?

428
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,110
However, she is your girlfriend, so I'll consider it.

429
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Stop flapping your lip.

430
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,560
Alright. How can I help?

431
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,920
I'll need one more day before I go back.

432
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,200
OK.

433
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,790
= Pick Han Shangyan up at the airport =

434
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,600
This is our first trip together.

435
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,760
It wasn't exactly what we expected,

436
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
but isn't that what love is?

437
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,880
Full of surprises and accidents.

438
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,320
Only when I spend time with him,

439
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
can I see how good he is.

440
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,470
Does this make me look really old?

441
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,520
Is it right for me?

442
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,510
But then, he gave it to me.

443
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,980
Whatever, I'll wear it anyway for our love.

444
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,000
Yu Qingwei from Class 6 is so handsome.

445
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,840
He's alright I guess.

446
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Look, that's my dad.

447
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,320
Handsome, right?

448
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,640
Goodbye, Mr. Wang.

449
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,440
Bye.

450
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,480
Dad, don't leave for business again.

451
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,640
You have my word,

452
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,240
I'll stay home as much as I can.

453
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,040
Pinkie swear.

454
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,920
Dad, I missed you.

455
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,120
I have an appointment later.

456
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,120
Let's have a meal together.

457
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,960
Delicious food again.

458
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,500
Who is it?

459
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,520
Your mom.

460
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,420
Mrs. Zhao.

461
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,740
Su Cheng.

462
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,640
I was cleaning the room

463
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,340
when I found some magazines and materials.

464
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,680
Please tidy them up.

465
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,560
I have something urgent.

466
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,160
But you just came back.

467
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah, to have dinner with my daughter.

468
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm not going.

469
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,440
Why not?

470
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,160
I have a lot of homework.

471
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,600
I don't have time to eat.

472
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,760
Dad, I can do homework in your office.

473
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,160
I'll be with you when you work.

474
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,480
Can you just relax for once?

475
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,560
Your mom just came back.

476
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,120
She just wants to have a meal with you.

477
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,200
Stop fussing.

478
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,740
Get in.

479
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,480
Dad, do you not love me?

480
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,480
Trying to make me feel sorry?

481
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,120
I'm not.

482
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,400
We don't have to go.

483
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,360
I'm too tired to take you there anyway.

484
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,030
I promise I will study hard in your office.

485
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
You're the boss.

486
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,440
You've picked her up?

487
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,280
I'll go out right away.

488
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,240
Sorry, Su Cheng.

489
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
I have something at hand.

490
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,960
Mrs. Zhao,

491
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,760
I'll deal with the magazines.

492
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,400
Thank you anyway.

493
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,240
OK.

494
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,000
Xiao'ai, you stay here.

495
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,040
I have a meeting.

496
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,680
I just got back and you need me?
= He Nana, Global Operations Director for SP=

497
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,840
What's so urgent?

498
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,120
Sit down.

499
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,360
It's Mi Shaofei.

500
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,680
These are the e-mails between some bosses and myself.

501
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,920
Have a look first, then we can talk.

502
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,880
Mi Shaofei is your friend.

503
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
It was because of you that he could be signed.

504
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,920
So the problem

505
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,200
requires your authority to be truly resolved.

506
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,490
I know he didn't score very well this season,

507
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,480
but...

508
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,600
Have a look first.

509
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,040
Ready.

510
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,200
Three, two, one.

511
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,130
Good. Come here. Come. Come.

512
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,400
We are done. She's here.

513
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,000
Sorry, Mr. Xiang.

514
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,640
It's OK.  -I'm a bit late.

515
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,280
Don't worry.

516
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,740
You had to travel so far, I should say sorry.

517
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,420
Don't worry.

518
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,720
Don't be so polite.

519
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,640
It's not our first meeting.

520
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,680
Come on, let me show you in.

521
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,760
-Okay.  -Come on.

522
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,080
You have so many fans.

523
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,240
I wouldn't have guessed.

524
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,480
Hello, everyone.

525
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,370
Tong Nian, after the signing,

526
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,960
I want to invite Lan Mei for a drink.

527
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,760
Do you want to join us?

528
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,020
Let's talk about it later. I'll sign the copies first.

529
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,080
OK, go on.

530
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,160
Squid.

531
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,460
So punctual. I thought you were in Sanya.

532
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,620
No, I'm back. Han Shangyan is still there.

533
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,720
You must miss him terribly.

534
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,280
Shut up. Sign already.

535
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,400
I know.

536
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,280
It's almost ready.

537
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,920
All right.

538
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,920
-Let's get started.  -OK.

539
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,280
Attention,

540
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,230
welcome everybody to our official signing session.

541
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,360
We will now officially begin.

542
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,710
Hello.  -I really like you.

543
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,120
You are so beautiful and elegant.

544
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,720
I like you so much.

545
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,640
Thank you.

546
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,810
Hello. This is for you.

547
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,520
So cute. Thank you.

548
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,440
OK, no problem.

549
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,060
I really like you.  -Thank you. Thanks.

550
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,500
Hello.

551
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,960
Thank you.

552
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,530
Goddess, could you please sign here?

553
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,220
Go ahead. He's such a loyal fan.

554
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,740
Yes.

555
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,580
I've been listening to your songs

556
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,320
since middle school.

557
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,640
I'm definitely a loyal fan.

558
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
I hope you'll always keep singing and posting videos,

559
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,040
and maybe write your own songs,

560
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,080
with your own albums.

561
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,840
By then, I'll buy a hundred copies.

562
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,560
Me, too. Me, too.

563
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,620
Your singles will be sold out in less than a minute!

564
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,280
Right.

565
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,480
Well, well...

566
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,600
Then, I'll sign one for you.

567
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,640
Can I get one too?

568
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,300
-Right here?  -Yes.

569
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,440
Thank you. Thank you.

570
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,940
Bye.

571
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,020
Hello.  -Hello.

572
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,240
Thank you.

573
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,080
How did you...?

574
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,320
Young lady, you are quite popular.

575
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,840
Why are you back early?

576
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,000
Weren't you... coming back tomorrow?

577
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,160
Didn't you say you like me?

578
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,120
How come you were so quick

579
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,760
to sign other guy's chests?

580
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,080
It's not like that.

581
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,160
He said...

582
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
He said that he's my loyal fan.

583
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,720
That he's loved my music for years.

584
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,630
I was moved. So I signed his chest for him.

585
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,800
Keep signing then.

586
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,400
I'll just walk around a bit.

587
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,240
I'll sign as soon as I can.

588
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,200
He truly is the idol of my husband.

589
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,880
So handsome.

590
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,440
Gun, I really like you.

591
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,240
I fell in love with CTF all because of you.

592
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,640
Can you take a photo with me?

593
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,640
No photography at the session.

594
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,240
Thank you.

595
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm sorry.

596
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,480
You came here from the airport?

597
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,320
Look at her.

598
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,160
She's so popular.

599
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,640
No ego or exaggeration.

600
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,240
Do you think her husband would be stressing over this?

601
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,480
So many fans.

602
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,160
Not really.

603
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,960
I have a lot of fans, too.

604
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,240
I said her husband.

605
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,190
What does that have to do with you?

606
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,240
Wait. What did you say?

607
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,320
Lan Mei is married, isn't she?

608
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,840
Her husband is not you.

609
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,640
She's having an affair?

610
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
I didn't mean Lan Mei.

611
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,800
So it's... Tong Nian?

612
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,200
Oh, my goodness.

613
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,440
Well, I'll leave you to it then.

614
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,200
Lan Mei.

615
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,920
He has been waiting for me for a while.

616
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,880
I'll head out then.

617
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,880
Ok. See you later.

618
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,680
-Bye.  -Bye.

619
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,560
OK. We are finished.

620
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,960
-Start packing up.  -OK.

621
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,300
Tong Nian.

622
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:04,980
Mr. Xiang.

623
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,440
I can't join you for coffee like we planned.

624
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,420
I didn't expect he would pick me up today.

625
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,600
I'll see you later.

626
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,240
Shangyan.

627
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,560
She helps you with the signing session

628
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,240
and has to get coffee with you?

629
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,000
No. It's not like that.

630
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,440
I invited Lan Mei to get coffee.

631
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,560
So I asked her if she wanted to go.

632
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,440
Let's go.

633
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,940
We are leaving, Mr. Xiang. Bye.

634
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,600
Bye.

635
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,480
Mr. Xiang.

636
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,680
I'm leaving, too.

637
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,060
-Thank you.  -Bye.

638
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,040
Lan Mei.

639
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,440
Tong Nian is with Han Shangyan?

640
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,240
Yes. Are they perfectly matched?

641
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,760
Yes, yes.

642
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,800
They are destined for each other.

643
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,900
Exactly. Then I'm going now.

644
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,080
Bye, Mr. Xiang.

645
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,960
Thank goodness I gave up.

646
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,160
If Han Shangyan found out I liked her girlfriend,

647
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,600
that would have been terrible.

648
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,040
What?

649
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,550
I'm a little nervous seeing you so unexpectedly like this.

650
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,120
You worry too much.

651
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,680
Get in the car.

652
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,000
He is on the way to your uni.

653
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,360
You... You mean Mi Shaofei?

654
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,960
You told him?

655
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,320
You'll know when you see him.

656
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,270
Hey, let's go to the cinema later.

657
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,280
I'm busy.

658
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,440
I know a really cool movie that just came out.

659
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,400
Do you want to go with me?

660
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,280
Hey, excuse me, I...

661
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Can't you see I'm studying?

662
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,240
I am Xiaomi,

663
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,520
Mi Shaofei from SP.

664
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,440
I...

665
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,160
I know.

666
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,120
I... I know.

667
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,080
You...

668
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,470
Am I disturbing you? Should I leave?

669
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,640
No, no, no.

670
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,550
No. No. No.

671
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,360
Not at all.

672
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,680
No, no.

673
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,280
My god.

674
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,120
Are you crying or laughing?

675
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,440
Could you tell me?

676
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,760
I... I don't know what to say.

677
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,760
Wanna talk outside?

678
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,710
OK. OK. Let me pack.

679
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,520
Let me pack.

680
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,460
OK. OK. I'll be quick. I...

681
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,800
Let me help you.

682
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,120
No, no, you don't have to.

683
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:21,840
You don't need to help me.

684
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,800
I can do it myself.

685
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,080
I'll do it myself.

686
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,160
Why do you keep smiling at me?

687
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,390
I... I'm so happy, so excited.

688
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,520
I can't help it.

689
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,920
When you smile I don't know what to say.

690
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,840
Tong Nian.

691
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,390
What did I tell you?

692
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,390
I told you she's a big fan of yours.

693
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,320
Talk to her. I'm bad at talking to girls.

694
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,080
She's so happy and can't think straight.

695
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,840
Yeah, can't think straight.

696
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
I'm not Han Shangyan or Solo.

697
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,720
Why are you so happy?

698
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,000
What? What are you saying?

699
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,690
You don't know how many fans you have.

700
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,480
Do you know we have a fan group for you

701
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,480
with tons of loyal fans?

702
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,160
Since the time of Team Solo

703
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,440
we've loved you to this very day.

704
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,840
Really?

705
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,120
Really!

706
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,800
Come on.

707
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,280
You... Huh?

708
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,520
Stop smiling.

709
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,240
You look silly like that.

710
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,680
OK. I'm OK. But I can't control myself.

711
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
You don't know that feeling.

712
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,730
I know. I know.

713
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,160
He is leaving. Follow him.

714
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,720
April 1st.

715
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,480
April 1st this year

716
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,470
is the first time I got to meet my idol.

717
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,400
No, no, no.

718
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,160
From now on every April 1st

719
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,400
will be my anniversary.

720
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,800
Don't be silly.

721
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,200
April 1st is April Fool's Day.

722
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,400
Why would you set your anniversary on April Fool's day?

723
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,120
April Fool's Day.

724
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,000
Wait. Is this all a sick prank?

725
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,400
It's OK.

726
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,200
Even if it's an illusion, I'm still happy with it.

727
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,040
Look.

728
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,800
You have a fan now.

729
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,000
How does that feel?

730
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,400
She keeps crying and smiling at me.

731
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,920
I don't know what to say.

732
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,960
Stop showing off man.

733
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,680
Sorry about that guys.

734
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,720
Say hello.

735
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,080
Gun.

736
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,640
Ou... Ou Qiang.

737
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,800
This... This is my classmate Yaya.

738
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,360
Yaya.

739
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,920
Hello, I'm Han Shangyan.

740
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,280
Stop being so uptight will you?

741
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,720
Seriously.

742
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,880
Hello.

743
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,200
Hello.

744
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,240
I am the amazing,

745
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,800
Ou Qiang.

746
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,280
Nice to meet you. Give me a hug.

747
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,570
Don't you dare.  -How could you...

748
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,200
You could scare my fan.

749
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,560
He... He is always like that.

750
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,440
I'm so sorry about that.

751
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,590
How old are you? Can you be serious?

752
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,560
Stop being such a stiff Han Shangyan.

753
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,720
That's enough.

754
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,600
Today is the 10th anniversary of Team Solo.

755
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,920
Most members are here.

756
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,280
Why don't we celebrate?

757
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,720
Alright then.

758
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,640
So... Can I join you?

759
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,680
Of course.

760
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,240
Tong Nian. Tong Nian. Tong Nian.

761
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,200
Does that mean

762
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,200
I'm also a member of Team Solo now?

763
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,680
Yes.

764
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,750
I think I'll run out of my happiness today.  -Let's go.

765
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,570
This is the best April Fool's Day I've had ever.

766
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,730
You know what? I'm so happy right now.

767
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,400
I know. I know.

768
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,150
I also know if you don't follow them,

769
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,640
you'll get left behind.

770
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,480
Let's go.

771
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,320
You almost killed me just now.

772
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,440
Make yourselves at home.

773
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,360
We're going to make some food,

774
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,600
then we can have a picnic later.

775
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,080
Sounds good.

776
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,160
Where is Mr. Han?

777
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,120
He's at a relative's place.

778
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,520
I'm afraid if he's here all alone,

779
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,120
he'll get bored with nobody here.

780
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,800
We should take him together with us to the picnic.

781
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,800
This place is amazing.

782
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
Now Shangyan is staging a comeback

783
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,800
and established K&K.

784
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,970
This is so much greater than Team Solo ever was.

785
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,720
Yeah we didn't have much,

786
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,640
but our bond is unforgettable.

787
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,120
If only Solo was here.

788
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,120
What are you doing?

789
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,360
Sorry,

790
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,910
but that name can't be spoken here.

791
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,520
Otherwise all the happiness of today will be destroyed.

792
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,480
Come here, a little closer.

793
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,960
Come on.

794
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,600
Do you have to stay so far?

795
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,560
Thank you for today.

796
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,240
Yaya is over the moon.

797
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,880
What does she want to drink?

798
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,120
I'll put on some tea.

799
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,240
There's no need.

800
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,640
She has already seen her idol.

801
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,640
She doesn't need a drink.

802
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,880
Otherwise she'll burst.

803
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,880
By the way, this is for Mr. Han.

804
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,840
How did you know he loves tea?

805
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,920
Because I'm sensible.

806
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,040
Don't mind me over here.

807
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,360
Stay with your fan,

808
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,920
or your girlfriend.

809
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,200
Make the best of your time here.

810
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,760
What's your problem?

811
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,480
I'm sorry, Shaofei.

812
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,880
Yaya, you know what.

813
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,520
Give me ten minutes.

814
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,420
And I'll tell you all the terrible things Mi Shaofei has done.

815
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,200
Then you'll never love him.

816
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,810
I...  -Mi Shaofei...

817
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,720
It's good to see everybody together.

818
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,800
Five to ten bowls of rice.

819
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,160
You must feel good

820
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,560
having them all together here right?

821
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,760
Why do you keep looking at me?

822
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,880
Am I that good-looking?

823
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,280
You are.

824
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,920
I'll wash the cups.

825
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

826
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,120
-Yeah?  -Shaofei. I'm sorry.

827
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,360
I give up.

828
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,680
Let me do this.

829
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,560
Go and play with them.

830
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,440
It's okay.

831
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,960
I know how to wash the cups.

832
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,400
Do as I say,

833
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,380
or I'll kiss you in front of them.

834
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,120
When he met girls,

835
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,660
he blushed like a monkey's butt.

836
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,280
Seriously look, it's like a red light.

837
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,920
Are you going to swim?

838
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,160
It's great here.

839
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,610
If I could buy a house here,

840
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,320
I'd be happy.

841
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,940
I believe in you. You can do it.

842
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
What's your major?

843
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,560
IT. Now I'm a post-graduate.

844
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,320
You're smart.

845
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,040
I'm not. Tong Nian is the smart one.

846
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,600
You have computer skills too,

847
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,240
just in a different area than me.

848
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,200
We can't compare to you.

849
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,680
You will be scientists of the future. But I...

850
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,480
Can I ask you a question?

851
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,320
For the girls in our group.

852
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,560
Lay it on me, try to relax ok?

853
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,480
Don't be so nervous.

854
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,760
But don't let other people know

855
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,760
what we talked about.

856
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,880
We have regulations in the club.

857
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
We can't leak private info.

858
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,480
I know. I know.

859
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,000
Are there a lot of rules in SP?

860
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,200
You can't date anybody right?

861
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,360
Cruel, isn't it?

862
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,560
So after you disbanded,

863
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,560
where did you go?

864
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,840
If it's a touchy subject,

865
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,640
you don't have to answer it.

866
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,320
You just mean a lot to me you know.

867
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,080
You suddenly disappeared like Han Shangyan did.

868
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,000
It's OK, no need to explain.

869
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,140
It's not a touchy subject.
