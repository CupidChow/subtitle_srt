26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,260
Do you want to know more about him?

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,400
Yes!

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,080
Tell me those I can't find online!

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,800
Let me see...

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
We had a cat when we were in Solo,

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,580
Han Shangyan was taking care of it.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,360
But when the cat died,

33
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,760
he forbade anyone to talk about it.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
So Solo and I worked out that

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,530
he must have a first love complex.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,110
He is a very possessive and jealous man,

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,590
but sometimes something tiny

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,240
can cheer him up, too.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,520
When he's in love,

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,120
he can be a difficult boyfriend!

41
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,720
A first love complex?

42
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,440
You're surprised?

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,680
But... who was his first love?

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,760
His first love?

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,520
I think...

46
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,280
it was you.

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,840
Me?

48
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,480
Yes.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,760
We'd never heard about his girlfriend before,

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,800
and the way he looks at you

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,630
makes me think of his beloved cat.

52
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Really?

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,660
I'm 90% sure about it,

54
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,760
but you can verify it with him.

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,960
A pretty girl conference, huh?

56
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,760
Shall I join you?

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,720
Ou Qiang, what are you doing?

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,640
I didn't dare look at her closely

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,790
in front of Shangyan.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,520
You're freaking her out!

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,660
Right,

62
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,870
Solo is looking for you.

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,320
OK, I see.

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,240
Let's go.

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,140
-Bye-bye!  -Bye-bye!

66
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,360
Ai Qing,

67
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,520
thank you for telling me this.

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,960
In fact, I should thank you.

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,120
Without support from family,

70
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,040
he's been fighting alone

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,320
just to win gold medals for China.

72
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,250
No family, no girlfriend,

73
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
he thought about nothing but winning,

74
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,640
and becoming a Chinese world champion.

75
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,200
So, we used to worry that

76
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,930
nobody could tolerate his bad temper

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
or his obsession with CTF.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
But look at him now,

79
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,400
it's perfect.

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Let's go.

81
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,320
Don't forget your card!

82
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,680
Thanks!

83
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,250
It's OK.

84
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,450
So that's why his grandpa's angry with him?

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,240
He's so successful.

86
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,930
He's won many competitions and suffered a lot,

87
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,160
but not understood by his family?

88
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,720
You must be tired!

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,960
It's too hot,

90
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,600
you got sunstroke?

91
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,080
Wait for me!

92
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,680
Han...

93
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,280
Shangyan.

94
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,080
Keep training!

95
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
Keep training!

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,140
I... I didn't mean to shout,

97
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,880
you didn't hear me,

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,030
so I... I raised my voice.

99
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,420
But, what were you saying outside?

100
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,760
I didn't understand at all!

101
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
I said you must be tired,

102
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,490
and wait for me here.

103
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,520
Here!

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,640
Listen to me,

105
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,070
we can be intimate privately,

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,580
but here's a public place.

107
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,130
You don't wanna be a laughing stock!

108
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,400
I see, try it!

109
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm not finished,

110
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,180
I'm a man, they can laugh at me,

111
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,040
but it'll ruin your reputation, you know?

112
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,720
Yes, understood!

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,200
Is that good?

114
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,610
Yes.

115
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,680
Drink more!

116
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,720
What's going on?

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,240
She's away for just 10 minutes, what happened?

118
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,200
Follow me, Shaofei.

119
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,440
Ai Qing, lead the training.

120
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,000
I lost my balance.

121
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,060
What are you doing?

122
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,640
Quiet!

123
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,080
Well,

124
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,370
do you feel bored here?

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,640
No, it's fun here.

126
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,960
There's a beach out the back

127
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,520
of the 1st floor,

128
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,400
you can go there.

129
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,040
Eat or drink anything you like,

130
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,160
and charge it to me.

131
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,350
There are several hotels on the beach,

132
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,200
don't get lost!

133
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,600
I won't!

134
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,400
Is your phone charged?

135
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,800
Yes, almost full!

136
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,930
Go to the lobby if you lose your phone...

137
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,190
Alright stop nagging, Mom.

138
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,060
I'm not a kid, I won't get lost!

139
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,880
Don't worry!

140
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,580
I've bought some fruit,

141
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,560
share it with them.

142
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,340
But the coconut is only for you.

143
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,440
Bye-bye!

144
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:15,940
Bye!

145
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:16,670
I'll come for you.

146
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,720
Well,

147
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,080
someone's bought fruit for you.

148
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,320
Who is "someone"?

149
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,160
Who is it?

150
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,520
"Someone"? You mean Mrs. Han?

151
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Come on, pass it!

152
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,320
Pass it, here, here!

153
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,840
Nice!

154
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,560
Hello!

155
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,280
Hello!

156
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,560
You're here alone?

157
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,080
Why don't you join them?

158
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,280
I didn't pack my bikini.

159
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,240
Hello, I'm Mi Shaofei.

160
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,240
Hello, hello.

161
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
Shangyan and I are good friends!

162
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
Yes, I know you.

163
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,280
You've read CTF Magazine?

164
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,040
No, I've done some research since I met him,

165
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,680
so I know all of you guys.

166
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,560
Sweet!

167
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,620
I'll buy you a drink, OK?

168
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,600
OK, that's good.

169
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,760
No, don't bother!

170
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,960
It's OK, we're friends.

171
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,890
-Come back soon!  -OK!

172
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,600
Thanks!

173
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,210
He's so kind.

174
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,960
Let's chat.

175
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,650
Yeah, OK.

176
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,430
That day I heard you singing sadly,

177
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,920
anything happened between you two?

178
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,760
Sorry,

179
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,050
I'm not being nosy.

180
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,160
I was his captain

181
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,000
and I'm now managing a team,

182
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
so I'm good at reading people's mind.

183
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,520
I know you were unhappy.

184
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,120
Han Shangyan used to live in Norway,

185
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,400
how did you meet each other?

186
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,480
I knew you would ask about him.

187
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,840
Online.

188
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,760
And when was that?

189
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,320
I think it was in 2005.

190
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,300
We got along well on the Internet,

191
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,000
so he came to visit me from Norway.

192
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,360
He came to you from Norway

193
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,720
because you were a nice e-pal?

194
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,620
Shangyan is a weird man,

195
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,190
he's different from normal people.

196
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,040
All Aquarians are weirdos.

197
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,800
And you like weirdos?

198
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,400
I'm back!

199
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,120
Thanks!

200
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,400
Can you drink it cold?

201
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,320
Yes, yes, I can.

202
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
Here.

203
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,040
Here you are.

204
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,360
Thanks, thanks!

205
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,320
Welcome!

206
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,520
Training's done?

207
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,840
Try this.

208
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,400
What is it?

209
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,920
Mi Shaofei gave it to me.

210
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
It's wine.

211
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,320
No wine for kids!

212
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,560
Shangyan, don't worry,

213
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,870
it's low-alcohol.

214
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,310
Everyone likes to drink iced peach wine!

215
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
Thanks for looking after my girl.

216
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,800
It's OK, man.

217
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,600
I want to talk to you

218
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,880
when you're free.

219
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
Anytime!

220
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,160
We gotta go.

221
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,290
Bye-bye!

222
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,859
Cheers.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,880
Don't bother him,

224
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,200
and don't go to him too often.

225
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,120
He's very busy.

226
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,200
Don't interrupt him.

227
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
I can stay alone!

228
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,360
Tong Nian, you're alone?

229
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,800
I understand,

230
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,310
they're all busy training.

231
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,960
I can stay with you.

232
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,320
It's OK, don't bother.

233
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,030
Never mind, I have nothing to do.

234
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,160
I haven't eaten yet, let's get seafood!

235
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,260
I'm fine, really.

236
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,360
You should have a meal anyway.

237
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,180
I'll take you to some interesting sites,

238
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,640
then let's eat seafood!

239
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,160
It's here!

240
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,280
Thank you!

241
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,080
Be careful.

242
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,000
Thanks!

243
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,320
The boss here is my friend,

244
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,610
their seafood is great!

245
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,760
Anything you wanna eat in particular?

246
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,650
No, anything's fine.

247
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,290
OK.

248
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,040
Then we'll have the specialty here.

249
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,620
OK.

250
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Training's advanced,

251
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,780
I only have 10 minutes.

252
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,200
Come on, what is it?

253
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,280
It was in a rush last time,

254
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,720
we didn't have time to chat.

255
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,820
It's unnecessary between us,

256
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,240
we're bros forever.

257
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,200
Shaofei, join K&K.

258
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,620
Han Shangyan,

259
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,610
I have no value,

260
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,170
why do you keep inviting me?

261
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,520
Every one of you is priceless to me.

262
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,990
You value your buddies and friends,

263
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,020
but the value of a player can be calculated.

264
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
I performed poorly,

265
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
I'll hinder your team if I join K&K.

266
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,520
Solo is working for his boss,

267
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,360
he can't protect you forever.

268
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,840
It was hard for you to come back,

269
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
I don't want you to quit again.

270
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,320
I still need to train,

271
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,240
or I'd grab a beer with you.

272
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't change the subject.

273
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,560
Come on, man!

274
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,650
We almost fought because of this!

275
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,520
You're too stubborn.

276
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,400
OK, OK, OK.

277
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,520
Go training!

278
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,440
Bye-bye!

279
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,620
= Atlantis Sanya Hotel =

280
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,440
-Hello!  -Hello!

281
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,770
How can I get to this location, please?

282
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,860
Go in that direction for about 3km,

283
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,120
it's a seafood restaurant.

284
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,579
Thank you!

285
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,340
You're welcome!

286
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,720
Sir, do you need an umbrella?

287
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,240
It's about to rain.

288
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,440
No, thanks.

289
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,020
It's OK!

290
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,460
You really have ordered too much.

291
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,990
Relax, I know the boss here.

292
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,720
Eat more,

293
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
it's not expensive.

294
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,800
Thanks!

295
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,760
This is good.

296
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,640
Here!

297
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,920
It's OK, I can serve myself.

298
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,800
Have some more!

299
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,800
Try this.

300
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,570
OK, thank you!

301
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,400
Why aren't you eating?

302
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
It's OK, I eat it frequently.

303
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,880
It feels weird to be watched.

304
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,960
Shall we eat together?

305
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,960
It's OK, I'm not hungry.

306
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,530
You have a question for me?

307
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,200
Not really,

308
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,520
it's just rare...

309
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,720
to see someone walking with Shangyan,

310
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,680
so I'm curious.

311
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,520
Oh, OK.

312
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,800
You're his girlfriend?

313
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,960
Yes, I'm his girlfriend.

314
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,790
Our parents have already met.

315
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,420
They ate together on New Year's Eve.

316
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,560
It was just a meal!

317
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,440
You're too young,

318
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,470
you don't understand society, yet.

319
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,500
I don't think Shangyan is suitable for you.

320
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,400
I became his fan

321
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,370
the first day he entered the CTF field.

322
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,480
I didn't know about CTF, either.

323
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,340
But my brother liked programming,

324
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,160
so I learned from him

325
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,900
and got to known CTF.

326
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
That is how I know him.

327
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,200
I liked Shangyan so much!

328
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,320
But, he suddenly retired!

329
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,920
You know what,

330
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,080
Tong Nian, Tong Nian?

331
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,040
Do you know?

332
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,330
I chose this career because of Shangyan!

333
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,560
I know!

334
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,170
Ai Qing told me he had a lot of fans,

335
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,720
I can totally understand you.

336
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,500
I'm not only a fan, OK?

337
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
If I were there,

338
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,550
Shangyan wouldn't have retired.

339
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,200
With my help,

340
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,480
within 3 years,

341
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,290
he'll become a world champion,

342
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,080
the first in China.

343
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,960
You...

344
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,500
seem pretty young.

345
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,250
You're much younger than him, right?

346
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,160
You're a college student?

347
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,520
I'm a postgraduate.

348
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,920
I didn't know that!

349
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,540
I won't tell you I was in gifted class!

350
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,480
What's wrong with my age? Grandma!

351
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,530
Behind every successful man,

352
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,930
there is an important woman.

353
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,760
I know that!

354
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,320
I understand him and support him,

355
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,640
don't worry about us.

356
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,840
That's not enough!

357
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,840
Men are all of great enterprise,

358
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,280
only the women who can help them

359
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,930
can stay with them forever.

360
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,900
Those pretty young things

361
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,870
who hinder a man's development

362
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,440
are only a passing fancy.

363
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,800
That's only a transitory thing.

364
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,120
There are too many flies!

365
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,470
Fly, fly, buzz, buzz, so annoying!

366
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't move!

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,530
There's one!

368
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:21,980
Let me kill it!

369
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,770
So why are you telling me this?

370
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,120
No reason, nothing special.

371
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,320
You're too young,

372
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,620
you might get hurt.

373
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,710
You don't know about a man like Shangyan.

374
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,800
You're not suitable for him.

375
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,360
Then who is suitable for me?

376
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,640
Shangyan!  -Shangyan!

377
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,680
How did you know I was here?

378
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,760
Because I care about you!

379
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,830
Shangyan, we were talking about you.

380
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,840
Come on, eat with us!

381
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,360
Here.

382
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,840
You are too busy,

383
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,680
poor girl has to stay alone.

384
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,360
So I brought her here

385
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,880
and treated her to Sanya's specialty.

386
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,000
You should try it, too!

387
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,120
Do you like it?

388
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,860
Do you like it?

389
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,150
I don't think anyone would like such a meal!

390
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,690
But you'll like it this way.

391
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,520
Close enough?

392
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,060
Right, Grandpa just called me.

393
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,800
He missed you.

394
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,680
Really?

395
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,160
I'll call him back later.

396
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,380
-I miss him, too!  -OK.

397
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,560
You seem very happy.

398
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,770
I still have some work,

399
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,520
I gotta go.

400
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,880
Go ahead.

401
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
I'm leaving now.

402
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,160
Bye-bye!

403
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,040
See yourself out.

404
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,720
Bye.

405
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Is Mr. Han at home?

406
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,290
Should I call him now?

407
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,000
Never mind, he didn't call.

408
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,520
You were jealous of her,

409
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,720
so I helped you mess with her!

410
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,800
Look at your face,

411
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,040
what did she say?

412
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,520
She said she was your fan.

413
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,120
You've known her for a long time?

414
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,520
She's only a crazy sycophant

415
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,040
who wants to enter this field.

416
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,030
She said she had competed in CTF,

417
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,960
that's impressive, but I...

418
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,440
That's meaningless,

419
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,650
I don't like her anyway,

420
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,660
you understand?

421
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,520
Your T-shirt is wet?

422
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,040
The rain suddenly poured under a blue sky.

423
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,780
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

424
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,040
I was worried and in a rush.

425
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,600
Do you like it?

426
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,280
It's delicious!

427
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,200
She's a mean person,

428
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,310
but she has picked a nice restaurant!

429
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,480
Eat more!

430
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,480
I ate a lot of things while she was chattering.

431
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,440
This one is good!

432
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,640
Right?

433
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,560
Yes.

434
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,240
What's wrong?

435
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,200
Nothing.

436
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,760
You can start a new life.

437
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,120
The kid will hinder you from remarrying!

438
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,840
I don't want to,

439
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,080
I'm good with her.

440
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
Solo, I miss my daughter a lot.

441
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,440
She's my daughter, too!

442
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,560
Why are they arguing?

443
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,400
Do you know?

444
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,760
You were my first love,

445
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,060
the first man I ever loved.

446
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,620
I never regret being with you,

447
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,960
but I wouldn't have kept her

448
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,560
if I had a second chance.

449
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,760
I kept the baby because I loved you too much.

450
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,080
It's meaningless to mention that,

451
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,240
it has all passed.

452
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,240
Solo, I want my daughter back.

453
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,360
Give me a chance.

454
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,280
I'm her birth mother.

455
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,720
Just give me a chance!

456
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,600
There will be many things

457
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,310
that must be explained by her mother.

458
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,240
Don't you know?

459
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
For example,

460
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,610
I was so scared when I

461
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,970
had my first period

462
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,520
in the 6th grade.

463
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,680
It was my mom who explained it to me.

464
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,740
I didn't dare talk to my dad about it.

465
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,290
That's just one of those things.

466
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,440
You can't explain those girl's stuff to her

467
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,360
as a father!

468
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,640
Don't you know that?

469
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,640
Have you finished?

470
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,750
Let me think about it.

471
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,570
What are you doing?

472
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,120
What's up?

473
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,520
You scared me!

474
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,400
Are you OK?

475
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,320
Never better!

476
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,480
What's up with you?

477
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,640
Shangyan came to me today.

478
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,480
What did he want?

479
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,120
He wanted me to join K&K.

480
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,240
To join K&K?

481
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,120
He hasn't changed,

482
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,470
he's too emotional!

483
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
What did you say?

484
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,440
Only a coward would leave

485
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,690
at this crucial moment!

486
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,510
You know I'm not a coward.

487
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,160
I do have regrets, but...

488
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,410
There's no "but",

489
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,310
buddy,

490
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,520
I got you!

491
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,160
I should face the facts!

492
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,360
I'll try harder,

493
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,520
and I'll quit if I can't make any progress.

494
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,200
You're the best!

495
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,160
White whale!

496
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,140
It's so cute!

497
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,350
Recently, I've come here often

498
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,880
when I feel tired after training.

499
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,040
If I have poor memory like them,

500
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,680
I'll forget all troubles easily.

501
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,480
Right,

502
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,160
they look so carefree swimming around there.

503
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,940
You haven't told me

504
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,200
what happened to Su Cheng and Solo.

505
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,080
I feel sorry for Xiao'ai.

506
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,000
They were each other's first loves,

507
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,880
but they've broken up.

508
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,080
So Xiao'ai is...

509
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,840
She was born after that,

510
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,520
Solo didn't know.

511
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,320
Solo didn't know?

512
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,750
When Su Cheng couldn't afford Xiao'ai,

513
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,930
she went to Solo.

514
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,540
They married to get a legal identity for Xiao'ai

515
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,030
and then divorced.

516
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,620
Solo's been caring for Xiao'ai alone since then.

517
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,130
They even got married?

518
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,390
It was for Xiao'ai's household registration,

519
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,880
they divorced soon after.

520
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,520
But...

521
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,160
but Xiao'ai...

522
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,920
Don't be a gossip, kid.

523
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,350
What's wrong?

524
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,550
Are you sick?

525
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,240
I have a headache,

526
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,660
Zhou Shan was annoying.

527
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
You wanna go back and rest?

528
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,400
I'm fine.

529
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,270
I finally have some time for you,

530

did you go to Sanya with your boyfriend?

552
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,560
Yes.

553
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,320
Really?

554
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,160
You've just got together, idiot!

555
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,200
It's late!

556
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,640
Go back to your own room!

557
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,480
And, don't stay with him after 9 p.m!

558
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,070
Watch cartoons in your room!

559
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,750
Do you think...

560
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,910
they're sharing a room?

561
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,260
No way!

562
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,080
Go back and have a rest.

563
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,440
You're awake?

564
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,990
How are you?

565
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,120
Feel better?

566
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
I'll train tomorrow for the whole day.

567
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,400
Will you be OK to stay alone?

568
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,680
Yes, of course!

569
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,980
Get some rest,

570
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,230
I'm leaving.

571
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,080
Wait!

572
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,240
Here's my room card, take it.

573
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,930
Don't sneak in while I'm sleeping!

574
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
I... I'm not a perv!

575

Order whatever you want,

576
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,920
I'll pay.

577
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,360
No, I have money.

578
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,560
I invited you here,

579
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,040
I must pay!

580
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,640
I've gotta go now.

581
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:33,280
OK.

582
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,900
Bye-bye!

583
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,830

585
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,210
Hello?

586
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,660
Hi.

587
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,290
I wanted to let you know I'm back.

588
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,140
You're back?

589
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,500
Why so early today?

590
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,160
They can practice by themselves,

591
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,820
so I came back.

592
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,940
Since you're back,

593
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,320
can... can I come to you now?

594
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,700
OK, let's go out.

595

it's so ugly!

It's like,

607
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,600
look at me, like this!

608
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,150
We should hold an imitation contest!

No, it's stupid!

612
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,800
We've made a deal to imitate it!

613
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,330
We came here to chase our troubles away!

614
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,580
Don't you wanna be happy?

615
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,780
See, fish have very short memories.

616
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,700
In fact I kinda envy it,

617
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,860
it doesn't remember its troubles, right?

618
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,580
You even rolled your eyes!

619
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,820
You should swim.

620
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,370
I'm your tail!

621
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,360
Look at it, this one,

622
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,140
it's even uglier,

623
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,970
you see?

624
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,020
Its face looks like this.

625
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,420
Where did you go today?

626
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,780
I didn't go out today.

627
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,960
I was in the hotel

628
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,560
and prepared a gift for you.

629
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,620
A gift?

630
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,860
To celebrate us being together!

631
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,420
So...

632
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,110
shall I prepare a gift, too?

633
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,870
No, no, no need at all,

634
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,460
I don't need anything!

635
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,800
My gift is very special.

636
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,340
I can't tell you now,

637
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,420
it's a secret.

638
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,540
What will you do tonight?

639
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,820
Chinese business by day,

640
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,740
headquarter's business by night.

641
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,900
You're upset?

642
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,190
I'm not, I know you're busy.

643
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,740
Since you have nothing to do,

644
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,140
do you want to go to the cybercafe

645
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,500
with us tomorrow?

646
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,880
Can I? Yes, yes!

647
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,820
Go to bed early tonight.

648
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,980
Don't get too tired,

649
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,230
take care of yourself!

650
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,100
Still working?

651
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,740
Even on such a beautiful beach,

652
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,600
you can't relax for a while?

653
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,540
We're here to train, not to rest.

654
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,900
You've talked with Shaofei?

655
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,800
You really want to recruit him?

656
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,540
His ranking is...

657
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,860
Don't talk about it anymore.

658
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,060
He won't join K&K.

659
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,640
He has refused me.

660
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,710
I've always wanted to ask you something.

661
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,180
Yes?

662
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,700
In the final,

663
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,380
do you want us to win,

664
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,040
or SP?

665
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,340
There'll be only one champion.

666
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,900
We all want to win.

667
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,160
I hope you can give priority to K&K's grade

668
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,780
when making any decisions.

669
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,590
Now it's your turn to educate me?

670
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,860
And, you don't know me yet?

671
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,380
Go back to sleep!

672
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,120
OK.

673
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,780
1, 2, 1, 2, K&K champions!

674
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,140
1, 2, 1, 2, K&K champions!

675
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,070
1, 2, 1, 2, K&K champions!

676
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,920
1, 2, 1, 2, K&K champions!

677
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,830
1, 2, 1, 2, K&K champions!

678
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,940
They do that every day?

679
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,810
More or less.

680
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,220
How about you?

681
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,620
Solo team did the same thing?

682
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,180
Us?

683
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,660
We were less professional.

684
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,620
We trained day and night.

685
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,780
I usually had a stomachache and insomnia.

686
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,140
That's true.

687
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,660
I hated P.E. when I was little,

688
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,540
I skipped it cuz it was tiring.

689
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,180
So I got sick all the time.

690
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,540
I gradually realized

691
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,330
that exercise is very important.

692
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,160
See, I'm very healthy now!

693
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,310
I was a short kid.

694
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,840
Exercise helped me to grow a little taller.

695
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,140
Your 800-meter race record?

696
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,300
2 min and 30 sec!

697
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,420
Is that good?

698
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,380
Far above average!

699
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,900
Run faster!
