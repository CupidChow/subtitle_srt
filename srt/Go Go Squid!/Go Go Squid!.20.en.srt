If it's a touchy subject,

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,200
you don't have to answer it.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,800
You just mean a lot to me you know.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,600
You suddenly disappeared like Han Shangyan did.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,560
It's ok, no need to explain.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,680
It's not a touchy subject.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm not ambitious like Han Shangyan

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,560
and haven't done anything big.

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,320
All these years, I've done nothing but stay at home.

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
You could've kept competing.

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,000
You are good at that.

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,160
Something feels wrong.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
I feel the same way Han Shangyan did.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,040
Once Solo disbanded,

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,040
it felt pointless to stay.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,320
It's just as I thought.

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,600
So you understand?

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,060
So you've come back this time for Solo, right?

44
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,760
I know Solo has felt guilty for many years.

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,500
So I came back to help ease some of that guilt.

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
But I also came back for myself.

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
I want to try my best again.

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,865
This feels like an interview.

49
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,000
Talk about something else.

50
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
But...

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,790
talking to you still makes me really nervous.

52
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,240
I hope you can understand.

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,120
It's just that I like you so much!

54
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,095
No, no, no, no, no.

55
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:06,880
I don't like you like that.

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,120
I just mean I'm a fan who adores and worships you.

57
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,080
You don't believe it?

58
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,740
Honestly, I never thought that I had any fans.

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,270
When Han Shangyan told me about this,

60
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,709
I thought you two were going to

61
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,210
play an April Fool's trick on me.

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,200
No way! I'll show you your fan group.

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,360
You have more than a hundred fans.

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
You're kidding.

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm not!

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,680
All of us are your hardcore fans.

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
Although you don't have as many as Han Shangyan,

68
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,480
look, all of us are seriously fans.

69
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,680
Look.

70
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,680
Look, look at her.

71
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,300
Every year on your birthday,

72
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,670
she will make a cake for you and then eat it herself.

73
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
Just to celebrate for you.

74
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,280
And this girl

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,330
has written you over a thousand letters

76
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,160
but didn't send them to you.

77
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,800
And this girl, this girl here.

78
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,520
She really loves travelling abroad.

79
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,760
Whenever she goes somewhere,

80
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,840
she always takes your photo

81
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,610
and then takes a picture with it.

82
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
Is this for real?

83
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,840
Of course!

84
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,160
When you came back,

85
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,160
everyone in the group cried.

86
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,120
Why?

87
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,320
Out of excitement!

88
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,920
We finally heard some news from you.

89
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Every single person in the group chat

90
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,720
sent a voice message that day.

91
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,380
You could tell by their voices that they were crying.

92
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,960
I cried, too.

93
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,540
My eyes were swollen from crying.

94
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,740
Just like a walnut.

95
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,120
I looked awful.

96
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,880
Look.

97
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,400
Do you want to say something to them?

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,010
= He's the best in my heart. =
= He's still on good form after so many years. =

99
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,960
Here, right here.

100
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,080
Faster, faster.

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,520
Hit him, hit him, hit him.

102
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,600
Come on, idol.  -I'm coming.

103
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,380
Hurry up.

104
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Step on the accelerator and hit him.

105
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
I am stepping on it!

106
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,280
Hit him, step on it.

107
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,160
After this bend,

108
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,920
you won't even see my taillights.

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,620
Almost to the finish line!

110
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,620
Pass him, pass him!

111
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,060
Come on, come on!

112
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,220
Step on it!

113
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,280
So close.

114
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,040
Mi Shaofei, what the crap?

115
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Thought you could win a game for me.

116
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,080
You try then, go ahead!

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,200
Let's go eat, stop playing.

118
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,560
C'mon. Help me with everything.

119
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,440
Let's go.

120
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,860
I never imagined that I would personally get to

121
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,600
watch them playing games together.

122
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,360
I used to think they were like gods before,

123
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,400
but now I realize they're just like little kids.

124
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,240
Yeah.

125
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,020
This is how they should look when they're happy.

126
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,840
Let's go.

127
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,680
What?

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,560
I used to bring the team here to run.

129
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,870
This is the first time I've come for a picnic.

130
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,840
What's that thing on top of your neck? A tumor?

131
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,240
You have no outside interests at all.

132
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,840
Besides running, this is a great place

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,560
for flying kites, fishing,

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
and blowing bubbles.

135
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,400
If anyone wants to be with you,

136
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,520
they'll be bored to death.

137
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,600
Mi Shaofei.

138
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,960
This is really his first time to have a picnic?

139
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,880
This is the first time since I have known him.

140
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,400
But not sure if he went before I met him.

141
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,640
He always thinks of others

142
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
before he thinks of himself.

143
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,780
Haven't you noticed besides K&K team members,

144
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
the rest are all old people?

145
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,050
I guess, he may want to take care of these people.

146
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,480
Let's start, everyone.

147
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,760
Time to eat.

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,000
You don't need any help?

149
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,000
Pretty much done.

150
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,000
Come on, let's play with bubbles.

151
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
Try what I brought you.

152
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,510
I've noticed you eat quickly every time you eat.

153
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,240
You didn't even look at it.

154
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,640
Do you know that

155
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,220
all the food we brought

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,460
was carefully prepared for this meal?

157
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,960
Notice the details, OK?

158
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,000
What do you mean?

159
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,360
They were made with love?

160
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,600
Know what I want to do most?

161
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,040
Travel around the world?

162
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,720
Then I have no idea.

163
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Anyway, my dream is...

164
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,600
To win the world championship,

165
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
am I right about it?

166
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,710
In fact, many times, I wanted to ask you,

167
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
if you could open your heart

168
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,200
just a little bit more

169
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,560
and leave more space for yourself?

170
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,680
And also me?

171
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,880
In fact, what I want to do the most

172
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,640
are things just like this.

173
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
Try to feel it.

174
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,120
We are standing here right now.

175
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,640
Just you and me.

176
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,200
Enjoying a leisurely afternoon.

177
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
The wind is blowing.

178
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,840
Close your eyes and feel it.

179
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,360
There's a breeze,

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,920
insects chirping,

181
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
the sound of running water,

182
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,840
and,

183
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
me holding your hand.

184
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,240
Bye.

185
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
Whenever you have free time,

186
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
remember to visit me more often.

187
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,880
Study hard.

188
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,320
Don't just think about dating.

189
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,880
See?

190
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,560
I will wear it for the rest of my life.

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,560
Do you like it?

192
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,000
Of course I do.

193
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,740
But it's really a long bracelet.

194
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,200
I have to wrap it around many times.

195
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,560
Make sure it's tight.

196
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Don't lose it.

197
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,920
How much was it?

198
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Is it very expensive?

199
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,400
Very cheap.

200
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,960
I like cheap jewelry too.

201
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,280
Go back.

202
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Remember to call me.

203
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:37,960
Bye.

204
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,400
If you need anything,

205
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,800
just send me a message.

206
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,080
I had a nice day.

207
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,320
Bye.  -Bye.

208
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,200
Look at how happy you are, Sun Yaya.

209
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,720
I almost fell!

210
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,110
Why does it seem that you're more excited than I am?

211
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,440
You... go away.

212
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,200
Happy?

213
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,880
Yes, yes. Love you.

214
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Annoying.

215
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,200
I should have taken a shot

216
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,630
of your silly madly-in-love face just now.

217
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,560
Enough, OK?

218
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,080
Do you want to make a short video

219
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,680
and post it online?

220
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,020
I do!

221
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,830
So everyone can see how lovey-dovey you look.

222
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,880
You jerk.  -Seriously,

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,640
did you add your idol's WeChat?

224
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,030
-Yes.  -How does it feel?

225
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,880
You know what,

226
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,640
when I scanned his QR code,

227
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
my hands were shaking.

228
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,960
Idiot.

229
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,280
Thank you, Shangyan.

230
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Thank you.

231
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,880
Come on. Come have a look.

232
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,720
A look at what?

233
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
Aren't you afraid of me seeing confidential things?

234
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,840
Like what?

235
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,960
My keyboard washing technique?

236
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,520
Or the color of my underwear?

237
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,200
Just go on up already.

238
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,570
Otherwise, Solo will think I want to dig from his well.

239
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Shangyan,

240
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,600
can you please stop acting like a recluse?

241
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,440
Keep in touch with us more often.

242
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,180
Do you know what 'ungrateful' means?

243
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,080
Mi Shaofei helped me finish a task.

244
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,320
So why would I need to still contact you two?

245
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,200
I don't like hearing something like that.

246
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,680
A person with a girlfriend,

247
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
should act a bit more sensible.

248
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
Stop wasting your time. C'mon.

249
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,840
Shangyan, since we're all in Shanghai,

250
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,820
we should get together more often.

251
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,180
Just get out of here.

252
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,720
Enough of the sentimental goodbyes.

253
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,480
See you.

254
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,120
Do your best.

255
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,880
Okay!

256
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,960
-Work hard.  -I will.

257
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,370
-Work hard!  -I will!

258
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,840
You have to drink if you lose.

259
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,720
Is that everything?

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,080
Let's go hand in the papers.

261
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,400
That's it.

262
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,320
Tong Nian.

263
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,720
Zheng Hui.

264
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,990
Zheng Hui?

265
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,920
Tong Nian.

266
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,480
I heard that your father is

267
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,000
an expert on liver tumors, right?

268
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,920
Yes, why?

269
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,400
My mother's liver is not good.

270
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,640
The hospital in our hometown,

271
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,000
said she needs a liver transplant. So...

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,840
A liver transplant?

273
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,420
Then that means it's already very serious.

274
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,290
In that case, try to stay calm.

275
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,810
You should have her moved to a better hospital.

276
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,640
Come to Shanghai.

277
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,340
Have her liver checked here.

278
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,360
Maybe it's not that serious.

279
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,900
-I'll let my dad know now.  -OK.

280
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,360
But he may be in surgery.

281
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,640
I don't know if he'll see it right away.

282
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,880
He will reply when he sees it.

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,800
No worries.

284
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Tong Nian, thank you.

285
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,110
Don't thank me! There's no need.

286
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,200
Really, thank you.

287
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
The Han family's oldest grandson

288
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,550
is so spoiled by his stepmother.

289
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,000
The moment I talk to Mr. Han about him,

290
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,800
Mr. Han gets furious.

291
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,000
Do you know why?

292
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,880
Actually, I rarely have any contact with their family.

293
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,120
I didn't know much about them either.

294
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,840
But Yuejiao was seeing him back then.

295
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,970
However, after I saw that boy,

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,680
I felt he is very strange.

297
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,600
So I thought I should learn more about him.

298
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,240
It turns out

299
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,450
his mother died when he was little.

300
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,280
So his dad married another woman.

301
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,880
But it was not long before his father died.

302
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,160
Terrible, right?

303
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,680
Fortunately, his stepmother was good to him,

304
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,120
but also spoiled him.

305
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,600
So when he grew up

306
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,600
he was very rebellious.

307
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,810
The more you say no, the more he wants to do it.

308
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,160
No one can control him.

309
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,160
After graduating, he started a business.

310
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,040
An online club or something.

311
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,720
By the way,

312
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,870
have Tong Nian find out more about it.

313
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,680
Let's not rush to make a decision.

314
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,300
No need. They have broken up.

315
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
So soon?

316
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,590
Yes, Tong Nian is very sad about it.

317
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,510
So, in front of her,

318
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,860
please don't mention that Han boy again.

319
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,700
OK.

320
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,080
Goodness.

321
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,090
Well, I really hope this boy wasn't just

322
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,480
messing with Tong Nian's feelings.

323
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,020
If he was, let's talk to Mr. Han.

324
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,620
No need.

325
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,080
Here, sir.

326
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,080
Sir, don't take hers.

327
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,000
I still have more than 20 in mine.

328
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,500
It's enough.

329
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,760
I have a lot of money in mine.

330
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,800
Take mine, sir.

331
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,240
Fine.

332
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,920
Take it.

333
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,840
I'll use yours.

334
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,480
What a pity.

335
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,940
I hope this won't negatively influence

336
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,320
our families' friendship.

337
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,980
In fact, we don't really care if she likes someone

338
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,840
who has a different family background from ours.

339
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,400
We just hope she'll find someone

340
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,920
who will treat her well.  -Right.

341
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,800
Mom.

342
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,480
You're back?

343
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,520
Hi Aunt.

344
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,240
Zheng Hui, this is my dad's sister.

345
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,240
Hello, nice to meet you both.

346
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Hi, Zheng Hui.

347
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
Come, sit down.

348
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,040
Where's dad?

349
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Upstairs in his study.

350
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Then I'll take him up to see dad first.

351
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,120
We need to ask him something.

352
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,040
All right, go ahead.

353
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,280
Thank you.

354
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,550
Then we'll go see him first.  -Come on.

355
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,320
Okay.

356
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,560
You see?

357
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,290
Although Zheng Hui is from a poor family,

358
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,560
this kid is extremely polite,

359
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,480
and has a good temperament.

360
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,020
But more importantly, he has ambition.

361
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,520
You like him that much?

362
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Why does it sound like you're

363
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,000
praising your son-in-law?

364
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,720
Nonsense.

365
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,080
Don't deny it.

366
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,960
Well,

367
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,230
I suggest you bring your mother

368
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,680
to Shanghai and to our hospital

369
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,120
for further examination.

370
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,720
And if you're closer,

371
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,160
we can care for her.

372
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,840
That way everyone will be at ease.

373
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,800
Is that all right?

374
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,120
Dad, I forgot to tell you

375
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,640
his family is in dire straits.

376
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,960
It's just him and his mother.

377
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,320
He had to take out a school loan.

378
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,990
There's no way they have the money for her to come here.

379
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,920
Hotels are too expensive.

380
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,210
Look young man,

381
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,320
if your mother comes to Shanghai,

382
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,840
I suggest that she can live in our house.

383
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,520
Mr. Tong, we couldn't impose.

384
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,760
Listen to me, young man,

385
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,430
you and Tong Nian have been classmates for many years.

386
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,320
And you two also competed together.

387
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,240
If your mom comes all the way to Shanghai,

388
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,200
she won't know anyone else here.

389
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,040
So, of course, we should help you two out.

390
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,920
You're classmates. We should help you.

391
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,800
Am I right, Tong Nian?

392
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,860
Just listen to my dad

393
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,000
and have your mom live with us.

394
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,150
Besides, your mother won't stay very long.

395
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,360
If she really needs an operation,

396
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,640
then she will stay in the hospital.

397
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,240
If there is no need for a surgery,

398
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,240
think of this as our gratitude for

399
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
competing with Tong Nian abroad last year.

400
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
A thanks for all your help.

401
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,600
Have her come to Shanghai and stop worrying.

402
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,560
Exactly.

403
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,500
When I attended the ACM Competition, I was sick.

404
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,680
You took care of me then.

405
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,160
Let me help you this time.

406
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,240
Thank you, thank you.

407
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,520
You're welcome.

408
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Alright, then it's settled.

409
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,080
Okay, thank you.

410
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,120
Sure.

411
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,740
You had your wife go back early.

412
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
That's fine.

413
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,160
But at least you should give me

414
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,160
half a month to handover the work.

415
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,400
No problem.

416
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,320
Your stepmother is getting married.

417
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,720
Do you plan to bring your girlfriend here with you?

418
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
I've no time to think about that.

419
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,560
Just bring her, alright?

420
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,880
We want to see our sister-in-law.

421
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,219
You married early

422
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,080
so you think every other man in the world

423
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
should do the same, right?

424
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,260
Come on, we also want to see her.

425
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,100
You see.

426
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,460
We all helped you start this business.

427
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,370
Can't we at least get to meet your girlfriend?

428
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,040
We've prepared a big gift for her.

429
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,960
Come on.

430
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,680
Do you want to show us your girlfriend

431
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,640
until you are married?

432
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,960
Come on. Show us, show us, show us!

433
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,440
We haven't been dating long.

434
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,920
I'm not used to it myself.

435
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,400
Stop heckling me.

436
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,000
You'll meet her one day.

437
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,840
Good, you said so yourself.

438
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,400
Don't replace her with someone else.

439
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,320
I promise.

440
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,440
See you later, then.

441
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Goodbye.  -Okay, bye, bye, bye.

442
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,480
Mrs. Zheng, please come in.

443
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,760
Mom, Zheng Hui's mom's here.

444
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,680
Hello.

445
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,560
Hello, hello.

446
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
This is really too much trouble for you.

447
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,140
Going to Mr. Tong's hospital,

448
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,240
and living in your house.

449
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,080
Don't say that. It's nothing.

450
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,670
Look, our children are good friends.

451
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,020
So we should also help each other when needed.

452
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,600
It's fine.  -Thank you, thank you.

453
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,860
Take them up to see the room she'll stay in.

454
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,840
Okay. Please come with me.

455
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,560
I'll get it.

456
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,720
It's okay. I'll do it.

457
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,280
OK.

458
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,120
This way.

459
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,580
Be careful.

460
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,260
Careful.

461
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,440
Do you need any help?

462
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,920
It's okay. I can do it.

463
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,620
Tong Nian.

464
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,320
What does Zheng Hui's mom

465
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,520
think of the room?

466
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,363
She likes it.

467
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:10,430
She is already resting.

468
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,520
Hey, is Zheng Hui a good student?

469
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,470
Last year, when you two went abroad together

470
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,640
for the competition,

471
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,480
I discovered he seems very nice.

472
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,420
Yes, he is.

473
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,720
The teachers also like him very much.

474
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,040
Alright, then.

475
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,990
You should ask Zheng Hui

476
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,160
to come and visit us more often.

477
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,090
That way, he can take care of his mother

478
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,400
and discuss school matters

479
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,970
with you as well. Right?

480
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,140
That's not OK, right?

481
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,480
He is a boy.

482
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,240
Tong Nian, listen.

483
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,120
I know you're just friends.

484
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,800
I won't object to it.

485
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,300
No way.

486
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,040
What if other people misunderstand?

487
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,480
You're so silly.

488
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,400
You're not old, but are quite conservative.

489
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,640
I'm a teacher, you know,

490
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,600
and I like good students like him.

491
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,600
Do you like Han Shangyan as well?

492
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,720
Are you two still in contact?

493
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,720
Look, since you two broke up,

494
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,680
don't contact each other anymore.

495
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,510
And no, I don't like him at all.

496
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,040
Why?

497
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,360
Why don't you like him?

498
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,440
Why?

499
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,480
Look at him, he's always so serious,

500
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,400
like someone owes him money.

501
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,000
He didn't even smile when he met us.

502
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,080
And I...

503
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,120
I don't think he seems very honest either.

504
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,640
You've misunderstood him.

505
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,520
He is actually very nice.

506
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,120
And he's very generous with his friends,

507
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,120
and also very sincere.

508
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,700
You're too young.

509
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,470
You lack experience.

510
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,440
You're too biased about him.

511
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,280
Remember, at that New Year's Eve dinner,

512
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,330
when he admitted you were his girlfriend,

513
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,000
remember how reluctant he was?

514
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,760
Everyone saw that.

515
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,400
The next day when he came to our house,

516
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,840
as your boyfriend,

517
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,360
it was his first time coming here during a holiday.

518
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,190
But he didn't prepare any special presents.

519
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,840
He just bought several boxes of fruit from the gate.

520
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,800
And nothing else.

521
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,690
How is that sincere? He's insincere.

522
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,560
Mom, will you please stop?

523
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,040
Fortunately, you two broke up.

524
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,110
If not, your father and I wouldn't agree to it.

525
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,800
Stop it.

526
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,160
I said stop it.

527
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,120
He is over thirty years old.

528
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,720
He's been around!

529
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,680
You are too naive.

530
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't trust whatever he says.

531
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,680
Later, you'll meet a lot of guys better than him.

532
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,080
Don't rush things.

533
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,840
You should

534
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,890
think about whether I'm right or not.

535
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,320
Do you hear me?

536
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,240
Yaya.

537
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,320
Poor Shangyan.

538
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,280
Why?

539
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,580
Everyone hates him.

540
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,150
I feel bad for him.

541
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,920
People hate him?

542
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,680
His grandfather, his stepmother,

543
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,880
and my parents.

544
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,880
Why?

545
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,820
My mother said a lot of bad things about him.

546
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
She doesn't like him.

547
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,960
What did she say?

548
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,840
She brought up things about when he was young.

549
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,800
But...

550
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,280
Even though what she said was true,

551
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,080
when she said it, it sounded worse.

552
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,720
She said he was lazy,

553
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,270
and a liar, and a big child.

554
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,100
A god like him was pulled off his throne

555
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,800
by his future mother-in-law.

556
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,060
Don't say nonsense.

557
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,120
I'm not kidding here, okay?

558
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,640
I am also serious.

559
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,510
In my heart, he is like a god.

560
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,720
He's already in the CTF history books.

561
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,880
I have to be nicer to him.

562
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,480
A lot nicer.

563
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,840
I really want to buy the whole world for him.

564
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,150
He loves his job so much that he's a workaholic.

565
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,720
So how can I make him happy?

566
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,720
I really can't think of

567
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,160
anything that would make him happy.

568
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,760
Let me help you

569
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,280
think of something good.

570
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,960
Within the next 6 months,

571
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,480
try your best again.

572
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,870
I'm trying to get you back on team one.

573
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,520
But not before this year's national competition.

574
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,320
I see.

575
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,400
They rate us by our scores

576
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,960
so I can accept their decision.

577
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,000
Sorry.

578
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,620
For what?

579
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,080
You've taken very good care of me.

580
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,540
If you continue to show your preferences,

581
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,820
people will complain.

582
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,800
I don't care about that.

583
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,880
I like treating you well.

584
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,440
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

585
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,000
Let's get down to business.

586
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,560
When will HQ make the switch?

587
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,080
The next match will be the last group match.

588
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,320
SP has already qualified.

589
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,720
After the next match,

590
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,040
you and captain of team two will swap.

591
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,160
As long as you get

592
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,400
back into the top 30 nationwide,

593
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,560
I'll transfer you back.

594
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,400
OK.

595
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,770
So I can still fight one last battle with Ou Qiang?

596
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,320
Thanks.

597
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,210
Can we not announce this just yet?

598
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,600
I don't want Ou Qiang to know.

599
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,880
It may affect his performance.

600
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,240
You know how he is.

601
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,640
He seems so carefree on the outside,

602
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,400
but he's fragile on the inside.

603
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,160
OK.

604
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,000
I will play well in this next match.

605
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,920
I'm off to my meeting.

606
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,380
OK.

607
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,590
-We're ready.  -OK.

608
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,180
Let's go.

609
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,100
Listen,

610
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,200
I found the loophole and attacked with force.

611
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,480
I then broke three of their nodes.

612
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,480
Really?

613
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm not bragging.

614
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,420
When they saw me,

615
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,790
it was like a mouse seeing a cat.

616
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
They had their heads down.

617
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
Impressive. Nice, dude.

618
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,640
-Wanna learn how?  -Yes!

619
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,160
I'll teach you one day.

620
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,880
For free?

621
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,800
Thinking I'd charge you money hurts.  -Nice deal!

622
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,360
You scared me!

623
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,480
What are you doing?

624
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,260
Listen to you brag.

625
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,000
I thought he was pretty amazing.

626
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,880
But he was just bragging.

627
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,884
I wasn't bragging.

628
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:24,160
I only said the truth.

629
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,160
Who's that?

630
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,020
Idol, do you know what Han Shangyan likes?

631
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,200
"Idol"?

632
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,880
I'll help you find out.

633
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,290
You won't show me?  -Come on, just a question.

634
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,640
What does Han Shangyan like?

635
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,160
Shangyan?

636
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,120
He likes...

637
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,800
scolding people.

638
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,840
Let me see.

639
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,030
Just really quick.

640
00:26:59,031 --> 00:26:59,500
Super quick.

641
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,689
Come on, man.

642
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,930
Aren't we brothers?

643
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,680
Thanks, my favorite idol.

644
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,480
I owe you a meal.

645
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,860
Tell me who it is!

646
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,060
What are you scared of?

647
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,580
Let me see.

648
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,640
No.

649
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,400
You jerk.

650
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,280
My question is not important.

651
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,580
What's important here is

652
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,220
you want to ask him out, right?

653
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,960
Yes.

654
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,280
What's going on?

655
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
He's winning.

656
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,840
You will clean

657
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,760
all the dorms, game halls,

658
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,030
meeting rooms, and the front desk for one week.

659
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,340
Fine.

660
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,920
I lost the bet.

661
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,800
Wanna beat me?

662
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,020
You didn't stand a chance.

663
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,400
And never will.

664
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,960
How could you compete with boss?

665
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:10,560
Are you stupid?

666
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,980
What's wrong with him?

667
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,700
Always making fun of us.

668
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,740
I mean, isn't he in love? Love is sweet.

669
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,840
Not bitter, right?

670
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,260
Why doesn't he go see Squid?

671
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,120
Good grief.

672
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,360
Boss!

673
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,440
Boss.

674
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,140
What?

675
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,400
You have a visitor.

676
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,800
Who?

677
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,400
Your girl.

678
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,480
I can't hear you.

679
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,120
Your girl.

680
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,120
Why didn't you just come up?

681
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,560
I thought I should wait for you.

682
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,160
I have a present for you.

683
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,440
What is it?

684
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,240
You can't open it now.

685
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,260
I'll show it to you in your office.

686
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:57,980
Come on.

687
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,160
Since it's for me, why can't I see it?

688
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,960
You just can't for now.

689
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,560
I'll show you up there.

690
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Hey! No peeking.

691
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,760
I didn't know what you liked,

692
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,400
so I chose this for you to make you happy.

693
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
I hope you like it.

694
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,320
Ready?

695
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,320
Come out.

696
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,360
Hello, I am a little kitten.

697
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,520
I've never had a cat before.

698
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,760
The owner of the pet shop

699
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,020
gave me a lot of tips for taking care of cats.

700
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,160
I don't understand it all,

701
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,300
but I'll send it to you.

702
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,940
No need.

703
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,560
I had a cat before.

704
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,100
What's the matter?

705
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,200
Are you unhappy?

706
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,160
Look, he's saying hello to you.

707
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,240
Put it back in the box.

708
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Then you have to remember to play with him.

709
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,560
Why haven't you come to see me lately?

710
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,680
You didn't contact me.

711
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,480
I was afraid you were busy.

712
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,640
I'm really busy now.

713
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,720
Then after I leave this kitty here,

714
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,440
you should tell me about him frequently.

715
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,280
You want to tie me down with a cat?

716
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,920
Look at you, why would you think that?

717
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,970
I just want you to have a companion

718
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,520
so you won't be bored. Got it?

719
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,720
There are boys running around here all day

720
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,520
and you think I'm bored?

721
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,860
That's different.

722
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,240
I gave this guy to you.

723
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,920
You're giving me more trouble.

724
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,080
What's wrong?

725
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,680
Don't you like him?

726
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,320
He's just so-so.

727
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,640
I spent the whole afternoon choosing him.

728
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,430
It looks a little bit like the one I had before.

729
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,780
It does, right?

730
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,450
I specifically asked Mi Shaofei.

731
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,560
Mi Shaofei?

732
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,200
What else did he tell you?

733
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,880
Anyways, he's yours now.

734
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,880
You have to take good care of him, okay?

735
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,800
Hey, Tong Nian, your cat...

736
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,760
What are you looking at?

737
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,200
Uh...

738
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,890
Boss. We didn't see anything.

739
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,840
Boss, since your girlfriend is here,

740
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,840
let's have dinner together.

741
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,120
We haven't had dinner together for a while.

742
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,010
No need. I'm on a diet now.

743
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,880
You guys go ahead.

744
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,440
You're so dumb.

745
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,520
Boss wants to have a romantic candlelight dinner with her.

746
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,160
Then let me help you close the door.

747
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,680
Hey, no need.

748
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,600
I'm leaving soon.

749
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,520
Oh. Then we'll...

750
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
...leave you two alone.

751
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,150
Let's go.  -We're leaving.

752
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,240
Close the door?

753
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,920
That was so awkward.

754
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,060
Oh right,

755
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,980
on top of that box is an envelope.

756
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,640
Remember to open it.

757
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,560
And,

758
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,720
remember to think of me.

759
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,100
Are you gonna come back again?

760
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,160
Otherwise, I'm closing the door.

761
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,120
I'm leaving. Bye.

762
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,880
That tactic you used...

763
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,960
You should do some attack analysis first.

764
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,420
Guard the back door.

765
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Add some reinforcements.

766
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,440
That's what I suggest.

767
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,440
That would be smart.

768
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,130
Didn't I tell you to follow through?

769
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
The past is in the past.

770
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,960
They'll be here in the future.

771
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,080
I'll be here too.

772
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,400
Tong Nian.

773
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,940
And then, a stray cat too.

774
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,540
There.

775
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,060
You can pet him.

776
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,540
Hi there.

777
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,080
Get up and play with me.

778
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,680
He's not scared of strangers.

779
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,480
Shangyan.

780
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,700
I always thought

781
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,880
you would prefer large dogs.

782
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,630
I didn't expect you'd like a small animal

783
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,460
that always sticks itself to you

784
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,340
and is always attached to you,

785
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,960
and who would gently scratch you with its little claws.

786
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,120
Which class are you going to now?

787
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,160
That devil's class.

788
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,760
Good luck.

789
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,200
-Just stop here.  -OK.

790
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,660
OK.

791
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,800
Thank you for your bicycle.

792
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,080
You're welcome.

793
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,480
Time to change it though.

794
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,580
I'm off to class.

795
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,219
-Bye.  -Bye.

796
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,240
Oh, no, I don't look cute.

797
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,600
How can I see my idol like this?

798
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,560
Guess where I am?

799
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,240
Why did you suddenly come to see me?

800
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,020
Wait a minute.

801
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,900
Don't run away.

802
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,940
Don't go anywhere.

803
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,400
I'll come find you.

804
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,840
This color looks pretty good.

805
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,120
Where are you going?

806
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,360
I'm in a rush.

807
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,920
Bye.

808
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,080
Let me just catch my breath.

809
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,180
Take your time.

810
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,820
Take three minutes. OK?

811
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,120
I don't need three minutes.

812
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,280
I'm fine.

813
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,760
What's wrong, idol?

814
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,400
You've seen me before.

815
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,120
What's with that look on your face?

816
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,920
Oh, it's nothing.

817
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,070
You... just seem a little different than before.

818
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,280
But I don't know why.

819
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,640
Oh. I never expected you'd really come to see me.

820
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,110
Someone told me they'd treat me to a meal

821
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
so I had to come.

822
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,360
Is that a problem?

823
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,080
No, not at all.

824
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,200
I just didn't expect it.

825
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,000
Didn't expect what?

826
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,920
Well... you see in my heart

827
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,720
you're still just a photo to me.

828
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,490
I'm a living person, not a picture, okay?

829
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,600
No, no, no, no, that's not what I meant.

830
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,280
I just wanted to say that I still can't

831
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,960
think of you as an ordinary person.

832
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,000
You know?

833
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,320
Shall we go to the canteen?

834
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,600
Just eat in the canteen?

835
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,920
Because I haven't been here for years

836
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,120
so I want to relive my college days.

837
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,880
All right. C'mon.

838
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,620
Go.

839
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,120
Here, let me.

840
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,840
Enough, enough, enough.

841
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,070
This is enough. It's fine.

842
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
What's wrong?

843
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,760
It's enough.

844
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,910
This is enough for ten people. Sit.

845
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,680
Let's start.

846
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,960
You said you haven't had this before.

847
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,200
So I wanted you to try everything.

848
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,740
My mother instilled in me from a young age

849
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,240
to finish all my food.

850
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,440
So let's finish everything.

851
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,760
Eat up.

852
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,400
I guess it is too much.

853
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,280
It's OK.

854
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,913
If it's too much,

855
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:44,890
I'll take it back to the club.

856
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,200
What are you phys. ed. classes like?

857
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,080
Pretty much like what we did in high school.

858
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,200
Physical tests.

859
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,540
When I was admitted to college I thought

860
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,000
I wouldn't have to take more physical exams.

861
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
But it turns out that

862
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,120
both freshmen and sophomores are tested a lot.

863
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,320
Must be hard.

864
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,920
Yeah. I hate the long distance running.

865
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,000
It's terrible.

866
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,160
At my high school sports events,

867
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,320
I was the best long-distance runner.

868
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,040
Really?

869
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,600
That's incredible!

870
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,440
I have to tell the group.

871
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,840
What are you doing?

872
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,240
Oh, it's just a habit.

873
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,540
In our group,

874
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,520
no matter who learned new news about you,

875
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,400
they shared it right away.

876
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,640
So when you meet the real person,

877
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,240
don't you feel a bit disappointed?

878
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,400
Why would I?

879
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,600
Do you currently ever run long distance?

880
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,880
Haven't done that for years.

881
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,360
It's in the past.

882
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,360
When I was a student,

883
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,720
I always felt that I was so good at sports.

884
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,400
I even won the CTF national championship.

885
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,440
I was amazing then.

886
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,800
But now it seems

887
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,520
I'm good at nothing.

888
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,920
But you're part of SP now.

889
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,630
It's the largest online club in the whole country.

890
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,880
How can you say you're good at nothing?

891
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,760
The next match

892
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,920
is in Shanghai.

893
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,680
Come.

894
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,600
I can't even buy tickets for this one!

895
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,219
I...

896
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,360
Isn't there someone more important

897
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,240
you want to give it to?

898
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,880
I have no one else to give it to.

899
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,560
Just take it.

900
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,840
It's a good seat in the VIP area.

901
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,260
Think of it as a thank you for

902
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,880
your support over the years.

903
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,880
Really?

904
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,280
Thank you, then.

905
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,070
I have to frame this ticket and then

906
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,320
hang it on the wall.

907
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,240
If you do that, how can you come?

908
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,280
Remember to come.

909
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,480
Yes. I'll go for sure.

910
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,560
No matter what happens.

911
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,120
Mr. Han.

912
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,600
You don't often come home.

913
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,320
Spend more time here.

914
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,440
Don't be in a hurry to go back.

915
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,400
All right.

916
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,960
Shangyan isn't here?

917
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,880
He works day and night.

918
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,810
He lives in the club

919
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,800
and never comes here.

920
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,440
Playing on computers can keep him so busy?

921
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,740
He wants me to understand,

922
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,500
but I just can't, right?

923
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,520
By the way, where is Tong Nian?

924
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,920
I haven't seen her for a long time.

925
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,840
She's taking an exam?

926
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,960
She's on holiday. No more exams.

927
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,440
Oh, I see.

928
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,080
Recently,

929
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,720
the mother of one of her classmates is ill,

930
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,600
and came to ask for help.

931
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,820
My sister-in-law said they are from another province

932
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,320
and didn't have money for a hotel.

933
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,880
So she let them live at their home.

934
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,800
She has a kind heart.

935
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,300
You guys are all warmhearted and kindhearted.

936
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,800
You know, I met that male classmate before.

937
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,680
He is nice and diligent.

938
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,120
I heard that he's studying for his doctorate.

939
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,520
My brother and his wife like him very much.

940
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,040
They said his future looks very bright.

941
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,920
And he really has great potential.
