= Episode 30 =

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
I think you know how I am

27
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,040
cuz we have competed for several times.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,000
So let's just skip the introductions,

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,320
and get down to business,

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,230
talk something about team Buff,

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,960
our rival in the semi-finals.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,260
I think you've done your research on your rivals.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,040
But the point is,

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,560
first,

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,560
you've never competed with them in the groups.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,320
Second, they were out five years

37
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,130
and have only just come back this year,

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,800
so we don't have much background info on them.

39
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,240
But,

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,720
they were my opponents years ago

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,190
and I was up against them in the groups this year.

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,560
Trust me,

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,930
my experience can be helpful for you.

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,240
Buff

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,040
is their planner.

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,720
Mi Na

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
is their main attacker

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,910
and the other three are sub-attackers.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,720
And...

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,960
And what?

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,220
We all know that.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,950
Hey,

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,500
now I'm going to tell you something you don't know.

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,120
Buff

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,910
actually has no clue how to lead a team.

56
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,840
Did you know that?

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,360
Did you?

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,250
Even though he's visionary and skilled,

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,600
he's a bad loser.

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,690
You win a few,

61
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,130
then he panics,

62
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,600
then he has no idea what to do.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,600
Being too keen to win

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
is the weakness that he'll never overcome.

65
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,800
Especially since they're all pushing thirty.

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,200
They're getting desperate.

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,400
The way to win

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,160
is to push him,

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,040
push him to the end.

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,480
What I want is a fierce competition,

71
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,690
I want to attack his last line of defence.

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,840
Your boss was the greatest player

73
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,240
to pull that off.

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,940
Now you know Xiaomi's strength.

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,820
He has the Chinese team's stats in his head.

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,760
Even info from ten years ago,

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,130
he can still recall the

78
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,320
earliest days of the CTF.

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,650
I know what you're thinking,

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,930
but if you don't want him to help you improve,

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,130
then carry on as you are.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,470
They have fatal weaknesses,

83
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,360
their old ideas

84
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,720
and old strategies.

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,680
Hey, does that,

86
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,630
does that mean they accept Mi Shaofei?

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
They're pretty naïve,

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,570
they'll accept him as long as they can be convinced.

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
I got a question,

90
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,640
why you came today?

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,400
I came to see Little Squid.

92
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,160
Haven't seen him for a while,

93
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,040
right, Little Squid?

94
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,760
You're getting fatter, Little Squid.

95
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,570
Do you miss me?

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,970
Are you going to come to the semi-finals?

97
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,040
Next Wednesday,

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,440
we'll be in Shanghai

99
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,640
and SP in Guangzhou.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,280
Two teams in two cities

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,120
competing at the same time.

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,440
Wanna come?

103
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,440
Want tickets?

104
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,680
Do you have tickets?

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,040
It's a huge event, of course I don't.

106
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,200
No tickets?

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,280
But...

108
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,040
you can come with me

109
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
and you won't need them.

110
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,680
What about Yaya?

111
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,070
What if Yaya wants to come too?

112
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,480
She can ask Mi Shaofei.

113
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Now we're...

114
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,880
Am I your, your..

115
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,520
Hmm?

116
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,640
My what?

117
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,160
Girlfriend.

118
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Or what?

119
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,990
How do you get away with it?

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,640
It's that easy to get a girlfriend.

121
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,880
You wanted to break up,

122
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,100
but now you're asking me back.

123
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,140
Or, is there some kind of ceremony?

124
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,000
Tong Nian,

125
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,520
do you want...

126
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,160
to kiss?

127
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,280
How can you say that?

128
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,730
I don't...

129
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,000
Sorry to have made you unhappy.

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,880
Sorry.

131
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,640
Stop kissing me,

132
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,720
kiss Little Squid.

133
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,200
Won't you be jealous?

134
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,320
Nope!

135
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,760
Little Squid, kiss him.

136
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,280
Gently, gently.

137
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,720
I need to give it a clean.

138
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,000
They're so good.

139
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,800
See you.

140
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,960
You're leaving?

141
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,040
See you, Tong Nian.

142
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,440
Bye bye.

143
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,840
Keep it up.

144
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm off, bye.

145
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,360
See you, bye.

146
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,160
-Bye.  -Bye.

147
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,680
You're leaving?

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,400
See you, bye.

149
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,240
Mi Shaofei,

150
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,080
come on.

151
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,000
Relax,

152
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,040
I'll always support you.

153
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,840
Don't afraid.

154
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,920
Chill, I won't let Han Shangyan down.

155
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,280
I'll take her back

156
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,000
and come meet you later.

157
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,160
Bye.

158
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,120
See you.

159
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,960
Working so hard.

160
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,840
Nope,

161
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,040
I'm thinking about how to take us out of mediocrity?

162
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,080
The skill gap between the two sides is too big.

163
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,400
Here, look.

164
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,120
Wu Bai,

165
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,910
Grunt,

166
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,910
97,

167
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,050
rank within the top ten.

168
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,120
The other two...

169
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,280
It's true,

170
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,300
Demo is improving all the time,

171
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,510
but One is 73th as usual.

172
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,560
He'll drag the whole team down.

173
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,680
Players who rank top

174
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,360
all have their own teams.

175
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
We need time to find new blood.

176
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
We need be quick.

177
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,200
You should know

178
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,900
SP's performance got better on average

179
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,680
in group competitions after I left.

180
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,520
Just be patient.

181
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
Now the most important thing is

182
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,450
to beat team Buff.

183
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,280
= Welcome aboard!
Mi Shaofei is now the coach of K&K China =

184
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,360
What do you think?

185
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,090
Han Shangyan has found a good assistant.

186
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,290
No one is more suitable than Mi Shaofei to take the lead.

187
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,600
He's from team Solo,

188
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,270
and he's seen the development of CTF in China.

189
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,440
He knows the strengths and weaknesses

190
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,970
of their opponents.

191
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,240
And he also knows us.

192
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,440
That's the most horrible thing.
= Team SP COO, He Nana =

193
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,320
Solo,

194
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,360
it's so important to win this time.

195
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,490
You lose, you'll not only embarrass the team,

196
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,640
you'll embarrass yourself.

197
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,980
Headquarters will doubt your ability.

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,030
Knowing too much

199
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,440
can be a weakness.

200
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,840
It's okay,

201
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
our coach is the best.

202
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,360
Tell us about your thoughts,

203
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,360
our great coach.

204
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,560
I...

205
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,560
I'm happy.

206
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,510
I definitely need to get Mi Shaofei to treat me.

207
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,380
I didn't come to your last reunion.

208
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,880
Say something else,

209
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,640
do you have any strategies?

210
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,480
Strategies?

211
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
Strategy to me means trust.

212
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,080
Going by our average performance,

213
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,030
SP is sure

214
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,790
to win this time.

239
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,720
bread and butter are destined to be together.

240
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,070

00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
turns out I'm not your butter

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,400
and I don't have any bread.

244
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,840
I'll never eat bread or butter,

245
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,600
and I don't like grilled squid anymore.

I'm really sad right now,

What?

256
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,850
Tong Nian's just uploaded a new song

257
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,240
on NetEase Cloud Music.

258
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,400

Tong Nian is awesome!

262
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
She received so many comments on Weibo,

263
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,160
and the boss gets it in the neck.

264
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,640
What does the title mean?

265
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,230
A declaration of love,

266
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,570
Tong Nian was here,

267
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,920
maybe she understands what love means.

268
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,800
Boss...

269
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,840
Say it.

270
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,640
97.

271
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,880
Tell me.

272
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,440
Why are you always asking me?

273
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,880
Tong Nian expressed her love

274
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,200
and we were talking about that.

275
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,840
Our hearts are breaking tonight.

276
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,440
Squid is mine.

277
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
Mine, she's mine!

278
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
Squid has fallen in love?

279
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,400
Maybe the guy

280
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,600
was a superhero

281
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,080
in a past life.

282
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,560
Register for me.

283
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,840
Boss, you've finally come around.

284
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,730
Last time you registered on NetEase for Tong Nian,

285
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,040
and now on Weibo,

286
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,070
It's great!

287
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,120
Be with you in a minute.

288
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,880
Register on Weibo?

289
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,000
No way!

290
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,160
Yaya,

291
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,240
Chunxuan,

292
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
come here!

293
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,000
Let me show you something.

294
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,920
What is it?

295
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,390
Han Shangyan has created an Weibo account.

296
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,820
Oh god!

297
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,920
Gosh!

298
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,800
Look, look.

299
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,030
The boss says he wants an Weibo account.

300
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,860
A true legend of CTF

301
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,370
and the head of K&K China has finally shown up!

302
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,120
Welcome!

303
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,280
Welcome boss!

304
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,640
Our spiritual leader

305
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,240
finally has an account!

306
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,120
Welcome back.

307
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,830
Wow,

308
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,240
welcome Gun!

309
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,520
The devil,

310
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,880
a legend of CTF is back.

311
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,680
Ten years!

312
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,720
And the pioneer

313
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,680
has finally gone public.

314
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,090
It's exciting, right?

315
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,740
Follow, follow!

316
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,360
A hero to so many people,

317
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,640
an inspiration to so many people!

318
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,740
Look at that!

319
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,110
This is a great day for CTF!

320
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,910
I thought he'd never sign up his whole life.

321
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,630
Why does he want an Weibo account?

322
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,280
To promote his club

323
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,120
or to recruit new players?

324
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,520
No idea.

325
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,440
Your boyfriend registered on Weibo,

326
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,480
but you don't know?

327
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,040
I really have no idea.

328
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,080
Let's see what he's posted.

329
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,320
-Quickly.  -Right, right.

330
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,760
The official website of K&K club.
= K&K Club =

331
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,720
He's using it for publicity.

332
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,440
That's not professional,

333
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,870
at least say something.

334
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,080
But the number of fans is shooting up.

335
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,720
Let me see...

336
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,480
Gosh!

337
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,200
So many fans.

338
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,680
The boss is amazing,

339
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,610
he's got over 100,000 followers already.

340
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,880
Oh, my god.

341
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,000
I've only managed 60,000 in three years.

342
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,880
The superhero's back,

343
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,220
that doesn't seem like many to me.

344
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,320
A few days from now,

345
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,840
his fanbase

346
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,720
will be growing even faster than this.

347
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,920
My fans...

348
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Look at the comments,

349
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,920
I've got over 30,000 comments.

350
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,200
You, you just posted a new song.

351
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,880
Right.  -Yes.

352
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,160
Normally I have 1,000 comments,

353
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,040
but how come I got so many today?

354
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,520
Let's see what they're talking about.

355
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,520
Gosh, what happened?

356
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,000
My hero is being attacked?

357
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,880
= His Friends: 1, Squid =

358
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,240
Actually he added me,

359
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,000
he only added me on Weibo.

360
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,400
Yes, yes!

361
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,520
Let me check,

362
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,800
he's left me a comment.

363
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,100
So, you're the bread and I'm the butter or

364
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,180
I'm the bread and you're the butter?

365
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,480
Should I respond?

366
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,880
Of course.

367
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,080
Quickly.   -Be quick.

368
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,840
Okay then!

369
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,600
Good for you, Squid,

370
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,260
your relationship is making me jealous.

371
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,080
Never mind,

372
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,730
I'll have bread and butter for breakfast.

373
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:52,880
Send it?

374
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,440
Nope, no,

375
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,960
I want my phone.

376
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,360
What are you doing?

377
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,560
So keen to flirt with him?

378
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,760
I'm not telling you,

379
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,640
bye.

380
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,760
Don't follow me,

381
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,000
no eavesdropping.

382
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,440
= Tong Nian =

383
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,760
Is that Tong Nian?

384
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,680
Advert.

385
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,240
Advert?

386
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,240
Advert?

387
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,800
97,

388
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,000
do you know why you're still single?

389
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Learn from our boss.

390
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,040
Winning in one move

391
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,240
is the best outcome.

392
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,280
Why do you always hurt me?

393
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,350
If I were Tong Nian,

394
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,680
I'd be moved to tears.

395
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:38,830
Buddies,

396
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,880
over here, over here.

397
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,960
Let's go, come on.

398
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,040
Wait a sec.

399
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,960
What?

400
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Alright, alright,

401
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,920
you can talk to him in the room.

402
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,280
we think

403
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,960
there are too many people on the corridor,

404
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,880
it's not a good place to talk.

405
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,640
We're going shopping.

406
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,400
Yep, yep.

407
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,360
Okay, just go inside.

408
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
I'll close the door for you.

409
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,760
Let's go.

410
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,800
Okay, you can talk now.

411
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,800
You signed up to Weibo?

412
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,880
You already know that.

413
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,320
I'll hang up if you don't have anything to say.

414
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,260
They still need to practice

415
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,400
and tomorrow they have a competition.

416
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,640
Okay, hang up then.

417
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,380
You first.

418
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,320
Nope, I want you to hang up first,

419
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,020
then you can hear my voice before you hang up.

420
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,880
Okay, bye.

421
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,480
But...

422
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,080
Fine, five more minutes.

423
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,270
Okay, five minutes then.

424
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,720
Five seconds are gone.

425
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,120
That fast?

426
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,760
Ten seconds are gone.

427
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,520
Wait,

428
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,800
I wanted to say

429
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,440
you signed up to Weibo for me

430
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,120
and you only added me,

431
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,960
I'm very happy.

432
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,720
Twenty seconds are gone.

433
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,360
I still wanna say

434
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,800
what if I do something for you?

435
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,730
Like building a facial recognition system,

436
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,470
so you can come in and out without a key?

437
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
And,

438
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,120
and...

439
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,320
Half a minute left.

440
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,160
That was fast!

441
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,360
Seriously,

442
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,520
I miss you.

443
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,600
I finally know how it feels

444
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,430
having someone cares about me.

445
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,000
How do you feel?

446
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,400
You know it.

447
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,360
I know.

448
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,600
To be honest,

449
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,280
it feels great.

450
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,480
Hang up now.

451
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,320
Now?

452
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,560
Okay.

453
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,080
You hang up first.

454
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,600
Okay, bye.

455
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,600
Bye bye.

456
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,160

come in please.

-Miss you all.  -Let me help.

480
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
This must be expensive.

481
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,120
Thank you, thanks.

482
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,880
No worries.

483
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,040
Let's go, come on.

484
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,920
Summer, look, we have guests.

485
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,840
So cute.

486
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,200
Tong Nian, what're you doing?

487
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,320
What's this?

488
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,020
I want to watch the game.

489
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,570
Then just go.

490
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,680
How can I go?

491
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,860
We got so many guests at home.

492
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,380
Tell your mom

493
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,420
that you want to watch the game.

494
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,920
My mom doesn't like Han Shangyan,

495
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,800
How can I tell her that?

496
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,650
How about telling her you want to see a concert?

497
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,840
My mom's not like you,

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,960
she'll just search to see if there're any concerts.

499
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,080
Going to school?

500
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,320
My mom will just say,

501
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,720
Tong Nian,

502
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,350
you can wait to solve those problems after lunch,

503
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,320
you naughty child.

504
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,950
Besides, the internet connection here is so slow.

505
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,920
I want to watch the game downstairs,

506
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,440
but they'll be chatting down there.

507
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,260
There's just no way to watch it.

508
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,120
What do you think?

509
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,060
I made some decorations,

510
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,000
got some new curtains.

511
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,590
Isn't that good?

512
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,820
Looks great.

513
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,120
Let me see.

514
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,880
Oh yeah,

515
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,030
I have some new clothes that I haven't worn yet,

516
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,400
try them on.

517
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,320
Thank you.

518
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,800
I'll try them on.

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,950
Even though we've been out for a few years,

521
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,280
I believe

522
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,760
you've seen our performance after we came back.

523
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,280
We're ready!

524
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,930
Five of us are pretty strong.

525
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,880
I know our team doesn't have superstars like Wu Bai,

526
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,230
but I think

527
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,970
the five of us together

528
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,810
can defeat K&K.

529
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,600
After all,

530
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,900
CTF is about teamwork and cooperation.

531
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,660
Don't forget that

532
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,880
I defeated Han Shangyan once.

533
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,410
I was his main rival,

534
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,920
and I'll always have ways to defeat him.

535
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,520
Team Buff!

536
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,800
Champions!

537
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,760
Come on guys, it's time,

538
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,200
get your stuff,

539
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,400
let's do this!

540
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,200
Chill,

541
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,000
try your best

542
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,090
just as usual.

543
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,160
Come on, let's go!

544
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,440
Come on!

545
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,600
Go!

546
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,400
Xiaomi,

547
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,160
I forgot to give you this.

With this,

550
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
from this moment on,

551
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,770
you're one of us at K&K.

I'd never thought that we would meet

558
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,600
at a game.

559
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,400
I really admire you,

560
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,600
over thirty and you're still competing.

561
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,240
Nothing to be afraid of,

562
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,720
just gotta keep fighting.

563
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,640
Oh yes,

564
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,200
cowards like you

565
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,350
who just quit at the first sign of trouble

566
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,720
will never understand.

567
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,400
Don't forget,

568
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,480
I defeated you.

569
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,560
You lost before,

570
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,730
and today you'll lose again to my team members.

571
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,760
Do you hear me?

572
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,320
Of course, boss!

573
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,200
Han Shangyan is still so arrogant.

574
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,800
Forget about what he said,

575
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,160
keep at it!

576
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,480
This battle is very important,

577
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,800
if we defeat K&K,

578
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,840
we're in second place.

579
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,400
If we lose,

580
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,040
this will be our last match,

581
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,080
we'll never compete in another match.

582
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,800
Guys,

583
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,960
come on!

584
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,680
Let's go.

585
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,000
Tong Nian, come, it's connected.

586
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,040
Connected?

587
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,080
Let me see.

588
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,480
Great!

589
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,200
See, your boyfriend.

590
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,680
Lower your voice, ok?

591
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,880
He's my idol.

592
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,480
They're still playing like that, no coach.

593
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,360
Buff is the coach.

594
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,010
I don't think there's any need to introduce

595
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,320
team K&K to you.

596
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,330
K&K is also one of the teams that might win.

597
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,080
Yes.

598
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,280
Come on.

599
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,880
Relax.

600
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
They're always fighting and struggling on.

601
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,370
Yes.

602
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,240
Yesterday,

603
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,520
the boss of K&K signed up a Weibo account.

604
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,960
I wonder if he did it to support his team.

605
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,590
We're looking forward to watching their performance.

606
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,120
Let's take a look at the other side.

607
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,030
Team Buff has actually been working very hard

608
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,480
from the very beginning,

609
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,840
which is no easy job,

610
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,600
especially without sponsorship and without a club.

611
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,100
It's so hard to go on like that.

612
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,840
Right.

613
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,560
At the beginning,

614
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,140
people always said that they were the dark horse.

615
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,920
It seems they don't understand their training regime.

616
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,170
Those five guys won the national championship.

617
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,250
This might be their last game.

618
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,400
They want to make this a perfect ending

619
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,470
to their career.

620
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,600
It's worth mentioning that

621
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,650
the only game Gun ever lost with team Solo

622
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,760
was ten years ago when

623
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,830
he fought against team Buff.

624
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Now we're connected

625
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,470
to Guangzhou.

626
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,640
We can see they're ready.

627
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,840
= Semi-finals of China Division Qualifiers, Guangzhou=

628
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,610
The organizer says it's time to start.

629
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,500
No need to cheer you up, right?

630
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,160
Yes, there is!

631
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,040
The game starts at the same time.

632
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,120
Keep that relaxed attitude

633
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,890
and believe that you're the best.

634
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,560
Ready, let's go.

635
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,620
Give me your name tags,

636
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,760
that's so uncomfortable to wear them.

637
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,519
I'm a little worried about Shangyan,

638
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,480
he's up against team Buff again.

639
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,840
Don't you worry,

640
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,160
he'll be fine.

641
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,000
Last time he only lost to Buff

642
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,060
because he had a bad fever

643
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
and had to get a shot beforehand.

644
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,640
This time,

645
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,150
Han Shangyan won't let Buff win.

646
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,710
Now we have 400 thousand viewers online.

647
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,270
Come on in.

648
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,680
Say hello to your uncle and auntie.

649
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,680
Hi, uncle and auntie...

650
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,320
Hi, uncle and auntie.

651
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,480
You can sit here.

652
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,320
-Have a seat.  -I've seen great changes in your house.

653
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,720
Yep, I bought some furniture.

654
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,920
Did you grow that?

655
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,720
Yeah, I did.

656
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,240
Here, sit.

657
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,680
Okay.

658
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,640
Have a seat, let's sit.

659
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,680
Earphones, give them to me.

660
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,480
Lucky I thought about that in advance.

661
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,480
Have a seat.

662
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,520
It really changed a lot.

663
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,440
Tong Nian,

664
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,560
what's wrong with you two?

665
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,920
Your uncle and aunty have come to visit you,

666
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,920
and you're just ignoring them?

667
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,980
She hasn't changed a bit.

668
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,480
These are not for you.

669
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,640
Here, have some fruit.

670
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,440
Thank you, thank you.

671
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,600
Here, have some fruit.

672
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,240
-Okay, okay.   -Help yourselves.

673
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,400
Hurry, here.

674
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,040
Here, have some fruit.

675
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,840
Okay, thank you.

676
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,600
These grapes are really fresh.

677
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,120
Tong Nian.

678
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,000
Tong Nian!

679
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:30,900
Yeah?

680
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,000
Come here,

681
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,440
chat with us.

682
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,960
Aunt,

683
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,720
we're watching a live match.

684
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:36,520
What is it?

685
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,360
Diving?

686
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,680
It's CTF.

687
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,000
What's CTF?

688
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,680
Not a clue.

689
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,960
Leave her alone, here.

690
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,160
Tong Nian.

691
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
What does this BO5 mean?

692
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,600
BO1 means

693
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,680
a single game decides who wins.

694
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,120
BO3 means best of three.

695
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,040
Got it.

696
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,960
BO5 means best of five.

697
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,480
I'm impressed,

698
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
you're an expert.

699
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,720
Tong Nian, you know a lot.

700
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,750
Kids these days are really impressive.

701
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,799
Tong Nian is awesome!

702
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,680
How about I show you around?

703
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,720
Great.   -Sounds good.

704
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,960
Let's go to the yard.

705
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,440
Come on.

706
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,300
-Let's go.  -Come on.

707
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,320
You guys enjoy.

708
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,200
Okay.   -Go on.

709
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,040
Forget about them, let's continue.

710
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,140
How long's my mom been standing there?

711
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,280
No idea.

712
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,240
No idea? Stupid!

713
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,560
Don't hit me.

714
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,840
So stupid.

715
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,520
How can you be that stupid?

716
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,480
You're wearing the wrong side of it.

717
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,390
Now they're going against each other.

718
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,000
Bravo!

719
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,650
Okay. Congrats, K&K gets to choose first.

720
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,400
Nice!

721
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,840
Nice!

722
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,330
Ladies and gentlemen, CTF Season 8

723
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,380
semi-finals of China qualifiers are about to start!

724
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,510
= Team K&K VS Team Buff =

725
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,040
Let's take a look at both sides.

726
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,460
Under the captain Buff's leadership,

727
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
they have chosen the most common strategy.

728
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,600
At the same time,

729
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,320
Buff has been infiltrated!

730
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,240
DT is going to get in!

731
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,920
97, what's wrong?

732
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,080
97 failed to guard!

733
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,240
Congrats to team Buff,  -Good job!

734
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,280
they got off to a good start.

735
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,060
But since Buff got the first node at beginning,  -Nice!

736
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,280
they haven't scored so far.

737
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,040
Right. And on this side,

738
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
we can see a rivalry between the main attackers.

739
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,280
There's one opponent's gotten through!

740
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,690
Both attackers have done a great job!

741
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,040
Congrats K&K

742
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,040
on winning the first round.

743
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,120
We hope Buff

744
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,480
can reinvigorate themselves

745
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,280
after a bit of a rest.

746
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,080
= Team K&K VS Team Buff =
= 1:0 =

747
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,880
Now we can see that

748
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,520
Buff wants to make a hole,

749
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,550
but DT has quickly built a security wall.

750
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,520
Two nodes!

751
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,160
That was fantastic!

752
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,880
Demo has gotten in

753
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,680
and Buff lost his last node.

754
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,940
So congrats to K&K, they've got the point!

755
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,720
Congrats!

756
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,560
= Team K&K VS Team Buff =
= 2:0 =

757
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,940
Okay, great!

758
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,840
Buff still has it in him, congrats Buff!

759
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,600
Good job!

760
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,280
Buff has won this round,

761
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,040
but his expression remains serious.

762
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Best of five,

763
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,920
the following round is the most important.

764
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,840
= Team K&K VS Team Buff =
= 2:1 =

765
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,320
Bro,

766
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,920
hold it, come on!

767
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,360
Captain, what's our strategy for next round?

768
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,520
Full-frontal attack.

769
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,560
Sure.

770
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,560
Come on!

771
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,240
Come on, bro!

772
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,680
We cannot fail!

773
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:51,960
Come on!

774
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,240
Ok, now we can see that

775
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,420
K&K has the match point now.

776
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,170
In this round,

777
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,480
will it be K&K

778
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,340
who's powerful enough to win,

779
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,760
and becomes champions?

780
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,920
Or will Buff win this round

781
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,680
and square up with K&K?

782
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,040
Hold it!

783
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,400
One-on-one competition.

784
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,000
One player on each side.

785
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,840
DT gets through!

786
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,320
DT still has one node left!

787
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,240
I'm sure all of you can guess who will win.

788
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,070
They're so happy.

789
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,300
What're they doing?

790
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,360
Good job!

791
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,480
Excellent!

792
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,230
At the same time,

793
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,960
we got news from Guangzhou.

794
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,840
Team SP

795
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,320
beat his opponent and won

796
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,880
almost at the same time.

797
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,120
Made it to the finals!

798
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,420
= Semi-finals at Guangzhou =

799
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,480
SP, SP, SP!

800
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,560
SP, SP, SP!

801
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,320
SP, SP, SP!

802
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,800
Solo! Solo! Solo!

803
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,000
Thank you to our audience at home,

804
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,220
thank you for your support!

805
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,270
The live coverage is about to end.

806
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,640
The CTF finals

807
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,080
will be held in Beijing next month.

808
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,560
Let's meet in Beijing.

809
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,400
See you in Beijing!

810
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,160
Bye!

811
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,200
Congrats!

812
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,800
They put all their bets on this.

813
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,140
Ai Qing said that

814
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,400
five of them quit their jobs,

815
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,200
so they could compete.

816
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,820
Thirty years old,

817
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,440
they were fighting for their dreams.

818
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
Come on Buff,

819
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,520
let's go grab a drink.

820
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,680
Yes,

821
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,300
we'll go back to our homes.

822
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,140
We don't know when we shall meet.

823
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,560
We were national champions,

824
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,679
don't dwell on it, just let go.

825
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,420
I don't believe it either,

826
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,880
but I have no choice.

827
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,470
We can't take too much time off work.

828
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,980
Let's consider this part of the journey,

829
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,240
the past glory might provide some comfort.

830
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,050
You're still here.

831
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,780
I got the standings.

832
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,160
You got higher scores

833
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,120
than the team defeated by SP.

834
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,570
Congrats everyone,

835
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,130
you came in third.

836
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,550
Actually, that's pretty good.

837
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,160
Old players getting third place,

838
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,280
that's really not bad.

839
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
You should be happy.

840
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,480
We're going to close the stadium,

841
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,720
hurry up guys.

842
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,920
Okay.

843
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,330
Captain, let's get out of here,

844
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,920
the staff want us to leave.

845
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,360
Okay.

846
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,230
Well, you can leave now,

847
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,240
I'll pack my things.

848
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,730
We'll be off then.

849
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,410
Bye.

850
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Congrats, Gun.

851
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,170
I think your performance was amazing this time.

852
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,090
I've been excited the whole time.

853
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,000
It's true.

854
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,360
Can't wait your next competition

855
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,240
Congrats.

856
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,160
Thanks.

857
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,040
Oh sorry,

858
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,360
I didn't notice you're there.

859
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,420
Well,

860
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,100
we're going to close the building.

861
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,760
Would you please close the door for me

862
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,200
