Hey,

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,920
do you have anything

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
to tell me?

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,590
I can't just see you when I want to?

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,280
Of course, you can!

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,160
It's fine.

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,640
Tong Nian. I'm here.

35
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,111
Hey.

36
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:16,800
What are you doing here?

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,480
What's he doing here?

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,480
The professor is coming!

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
I saw you rushing in here.

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,960
You're late again.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Got up late again?

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,880
No, I didn't...

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,920
I just went to get breakfast after the exam.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,480
Breakfast?

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,240
Alright, give me the papers.

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,300
You can just say that you're my brother

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,190
and came to take me home.

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,160
No, wait.

49
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,040
Say you went to the wrong classroom.

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,720
You've all written your names?

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Just make up an excuse.

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,720
Any excuse.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,880
OK.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
Professor.

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,520
Who are you?

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,600
Why are you here?

57
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,600
Are you in the wrong classroom?

58
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,320
This university is famous.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,280
I came from far away to visit this place.

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Here visiting?

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,280
Then you should be walking outside.

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,520
Why are you in here?

63
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,560
We just finished a test here.

64
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,150
All the students here are proctors.

65
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,770
Do you know someone here?

66
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,800
Of course.

67
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,410
Of course?

68
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,520
Who's that?

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Who knows this guy?

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,560
Who?

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,800
Is she your girlfriend?

72
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,280
She is.

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,640
Then this is my business now.

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,110
After all, she is my student.

75
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,120
So...

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,810
are you taking her out later?

77
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,880
Maybe to watch a movie?

78
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,440
A movie?

79
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,650
I haven't seen a movie in years.

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,520
Really?

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,320
Bro.

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,760
Your life is really boring then.

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,340
Despite this,

84
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,080
he somehow caught one of our own.

85
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,880
You're right.

86
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,760
Hasn't she ever complained to you?

87
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,280
It must be boring to be your girlfriend.

88
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Complain?

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,920
Not really.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,240
She's a lovely girlfriend.

91
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,480
Poor little Tong Nian.

92
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,960
The professor is giving him a hard time.

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,400
What if

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,480
her boyfriend

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,120
feels too embarrassed

96
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,660
and breaks up with her?

97
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,160
The universe may punish you

98
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,320
if you make them break up!

99
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,760
She is right, professor.

100
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,800
Tong Nian is only good at studying, nothing else.

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,480
I...  -What's more,

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,280
it's her first time bringing her boyfriend here.

103
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,920
It would be terrible

104
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
to break them up.

105
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,160
She'd cry herself to death.

106
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Alright, enough.

107
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Don't you worry.

108
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,680
Just look at him.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,400
Does he look like I could embarrass him?

110
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,640
You...

111
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,000
You haven't changed a bit.

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,200
Neither have you.

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,320
You still like to joke.

114
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Alright, students.

115
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,400
Let me introduce him.

116
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,120
We

117
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,530
had a class together back in the day.

118
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,880
I remember during our first class,

119
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,040
when I was introducing myself,

120
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,240
I told you that

121
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,560
I spent half my life studying.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,320
I learned a lot of skills,

123
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,850
one of which was industrial design.

124
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,370
So he was sort of my classmate.

125
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,520
He's famous in this field.

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,640
I never forgot him.

127
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,860
Hey, don't misunderstand.

128
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,040
He joined our class in his late 30s.

129
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,840
You!

130
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,760
Alright! You're all dismissed.

131
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,420
It's okay, professor.

132
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,960
Since your classmate is here.

133
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,720
We can stay longer.

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,680
Yeah, professor!

135
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,440
Tell us some more stories.

136
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,380
We want to hear more.

137
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,640
Just go! Get out of here!

138
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,800
Did I get all the papers?

139
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,400
Tong Nian.

140
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,360
Your boyfriend is handsome.

141
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,490
We didn't have time to talk long yesterday.

142
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,470
I heard you started a business

143
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,720
in some emerging industry.

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,980
Yes, computer security.

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,520
I founded a cyber club.

146
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,280
That sounds interesting.

147
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,160
Come on,

148
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,440
let's chat in my office.

149
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's chat another day.

150
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,480
Later, we're going to...

151
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,250
Alright, fine!

152
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,440
Got it.

153
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,800
I get it.

154
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,400
Alright.

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,920
I won't interrupt your plans.

156
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,090
Bye, professor.

157
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,070
I can't believe you know my professor.

158
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,550
See you!

159
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,640
Enjoy your date!

160
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,320
What are you doing?

161
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,800
Your handwriting is good.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,286
My mom forced me to practice a lot

163
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:26,930
when I was young.

164
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,570
How is yours?

165
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,170
Let me see your handwriting.

166
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
Look at them.

167
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,480
Is this the best you can do?

168
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,280
I was forced to practice a lot

169
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,990
when I was young, too.

170
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,880
But it's been a while.

171
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,520
You sure you practiced a lot?

172
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
And they still look like that?

173
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,540
Who forced you?

174
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,480
My stepmother.

175
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,990
I can see she's not a strict woman.

176
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,160
What are you doing?

177
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,600
Let's go.

178
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,640
Okay, hang on.

179
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,480
Oh, wait!

180
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,720
I need to clean off the board first.

181
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,280
Otherwise, others will see it.

182
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,800
-Wait a sec!  -Hey!

183
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,600
Finished!

184
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,380
Tong Nian!

185
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,250
Tong Nian!

186
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,000
Zheng Hui?

187
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,570
I've been looking for you.

188
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,080
I heard you were supervising a test.

189
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,320
I thought I'd miss you.

190
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,120
Why are you looking for me?

191
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
Do you have a minute to talk?

192
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,160
Hi.

193
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,720
I...

194
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
I went past a comics shop a few days ago

195
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
and saw this.

196
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,280
I thought you would like it.

197
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,000
So I bought it for you.

198
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,680
Thank you.

199
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,570
But why did you buy me something?

200
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,370
May I talk with you privately?

201
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,880
It's okay.

202
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,800
You can just tell me.

203
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,600
He's not an outsider.

204
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,160
And we are in a hurry.

205
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,880
Tong Nian,

206
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,020
we've known each other for a long time.

207
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,810
I think...

208
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,840
Hey, come here.

209
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,400
Come here, bro.

210
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,640
I need to talk with you.

211
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Wait for me by the car.

212
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll be out soon.

213
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,080
Okay.

214
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,400
Bro.

215
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,030
This is the 3rd time.

216
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,400
You've brazenly undermined me

217
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,300
three times now.

218
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,520
Don't you think I should teach you a lesson,

219
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,910
so you'd stop doing that?

220
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,000
Undermined you? 3 times?

221
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,480
Tong Nian and you are...

222
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,040
Yes.

223
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,720
Next month,

224
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,120
she will become my wife.

225
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,640
So if you keep doing this,

226
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
I'll make you regret it.

227
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,840
I didn't know.

228
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,240
You do now, right?

229
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,050
Just leave her alone, hear me?

230
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,840
Hey!

231
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,400
You're too old for Tong Nian!

232
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,480
Do you even know what she likes?

233
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,800
Let me tell you something!

234
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,720
Tong Nian and I are both smart.

235
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,410
We share the same interests.

236
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,360
We have a lot in common.

237
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,790
You know what?

238
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,540
Loving someone is not like raising a pet.

239
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
So listen carefully!

240
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,580
Unless I hear Tong Nian tell me herself

241
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,700
that you are the one she loves,

242
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,040
I promise I will never give up!

243
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,040
I never will!

244
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,640
This is our sports field.

245
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,360
Over there is our assembly hall.

246
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,280
This is the chemistry building.

247
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,250
Oh, and the canteen and my dorm are behind us.

248
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,750
I can't believe you know my professor.

249
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,810
He's a good guy.

250
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,780
A good guy?

251
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,710
What's wrong?

252
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,960
Do you know what his nickname is?

253
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,800
He's called the devil professor.

254
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,550
Many students fail because of him.

255
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,280
He is actually an interesting person.

256
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,840
He taught English until he was over 40.

257
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,640
Then he wanted to take a break,

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,530
so he went to study industrial design.

259
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,890
Industrial design?

260
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,390
But he is teaching English literature now.

261
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,280
Why did he study industrial design?

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,920
Maybe just for fun.

263
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Some people like travelling,

264
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,340
and some like reading.

265
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,550
I like playing on the computer.

266
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,880
If we do everything for a good reason,

267
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,160
life would be boring.

268
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,120
I almost forgot.

269
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,000
What?

270
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,760
Would you tell me

271
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,000
if you thought I

272
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,360
was really bad at dating?

273
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,880
I can't answer that question because

274
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,640
I haven't dated before,

275
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,920
so I don't have any past experience.

276
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,240
I don't know if you're good or not.

277
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,270
But it's not a problem,

278
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,860
because we are both new to this.

279
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,200
It's more interesting.

280
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,090
Let's make progress together.

281
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,080
Do you think I look like a tough guy

282
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,320
who is not easy to get along with?

283
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,960
Of course not!

284
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,030
Because I know why you're like that.

285
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,320
You are the leader of a young team of boys.

286
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,360
you have to be strict.

287
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,880
But you know what?

288
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
They are not afraid of you at all.

289
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,760
So you mean

290
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,440
I should be a lot harder on them, right?

291
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,120
Why are you laughing?

292
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,240
The stricter you are,

293
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,200
the cuter you are.

294
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,930
I feel like you treat me like a pet.

295
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,280
I love my pets!

296
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,920
What did you say?

297
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Nothing.

298
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,350
Why did you come to my school today?

299
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,440
Any special reason?

300
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,280
Not really.

301
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,480
Did you come just to see me?

302
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,270
Mi Shaofei told me that

303
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,960
you are losing out

304
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,700
by having me as your boyfriend.

305
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,560
And I think he is right.

306
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,640
So I came to hang out with you.

307
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,680
It's been years since I was in school.

308
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,920
I almost forgot what it felt like.

309
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,080
If I were a senior here,

310
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,280
what would you like me to do for you?

311
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,480
Come with me.

312
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,360
Do you see that hotpot line?

313
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,680
It is the most popular food in the canteen.

314
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,200
When I was an undergrad,

315
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,800
I wished I had a boyfriend

316
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,840
who would queue for me.

317
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,120
That's all you want?

318
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,680
Yeah.

319
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,520
Come here.

320
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,480
Let me wait here.

321
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,850
It's okay. Let's wait together.

322
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,000
Go find a place to sit.

323
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,960
Alright.

324
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,880
I'll go find a place to sit then.

Do you like it or not?

340
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,760
It's much better

341
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,000
than the lunches we get at the club.

342
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,000
Why are you laughing?

343
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,440
You should be eating.

344
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,000
I just feel happy.

345
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,840
Finally, I have someone to queue for me.

346
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,920
Finally?

347
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,520
This is the first time.

348
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,280
The first time someone queued for me.

349
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,580
Hasn't Zheng Hui queued for you before?

350
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,720
He's one year older than me.

351
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,690
We don't see each other very often.

352
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,080
Have some more.

353
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,600
Look,

354
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,930
the world team finals will be in Norway this year.

355
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,400
Do you want to come?

356
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,200
Get a visa when you have time.

357
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,600
Okay!

358
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
Wipe your mouth.

359
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,920
You too. Wipe your mouth.

360
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
It's covered in oil.

361
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
I can't believe you have tissues with you.

362
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,680
I bring it everywhere.

363
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,200
Okay, okay.

364
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,000
Have some more food.

365
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,520
Although the final battle hasn't started,

366
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,240
at this moment,

367
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,320
I have complete trust in him.

368
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,480
Han Shangyan

369
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,720
will definitely ensure K&K

370
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,600
makes it to the final.

371
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,120
The national finals are approaching.

372
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,520
This time

373
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,440
I feel I'm a member of the team.

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,720
Their life is more tedious than I thought.

375
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,660
Every competition is the same,

376
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,840
and they have to practice every day,

377
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,190
every month, and every year.

378
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,080
They practice the same moves

379
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,240
hundreds of thousands of times.

380
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,840
1 year passes, then 2 years.

381
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,120
Every day is the same for them.

382
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,880
Day after day.

383
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:50,750
Here.

384
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,200
This is the mask I mentioned last time.

385
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,030
I got you all one for free!

386
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,640
Did you win a lottery?

387
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,400
Fantastic.

388
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,280
I'll take 2.

389
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,480
My savior!

390
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,960
My skin is as dry as a desert

391
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,200
sitting in front of the computer.

392
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,040
Listen.

393
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,720
I need this whole box.

394
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,680
You can split the rest.

395
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
You can't do that!  -Split them!

396
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,960
They are all mine. All mine!

397
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Alright, boys! Time to eat!

398
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,200
I bought the good stuff.

399
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,760
Is it a special day today?

400
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,490
Masks and good food?

401
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,920
-What's going on?  -Come on!

402
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,880
Hey wait for me.

403
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,920
Leave some for me.

404
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,760
Where's boss?

405
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,400
Boss? He is in his room.

406
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,160
Won't he join us?

407
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,040
You bought plenty.

408
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,760
I'll go get him.

409
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,760
No, don't!

410
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,480
He's with his sweetheart.

411
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,520
With his sweetheart.

412
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,280
He still needs to eat.

413
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,960
No he doesn't.

414
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,900
Time to eat.

415
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,730
I'm not hungry.

416
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,230
Knock it off, Shaofei.

417
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,560
Right,

418
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,940
did you buy the team some food to eat?

419
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
I did.

420
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,150
What's wrong with your voice?

421
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,320
Who is feeding you?

422
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,480
Why did you call me Shaofei?

423
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,240
Eat yourself.

424
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,560
That's right.

425
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,200
You need to eat more, okay?

426
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,960
Is it good?

427
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,360
It is.

428
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,200
This bite is good.

429
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,640
I can eat by myself.

430
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,200
No. I'll feed you.

431
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,100
Can you slow down a bit?

432
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,460
= PL Finals, Beijing =

433
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,440
Good luck!

434
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
What are you doing?

435
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,070
It's almost the finals.

436
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,120
Don't you understand how I feel now?

437
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,240
I am so nervous for them.

438
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,880
Of course I understand.

439
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,200
I am nervous too.

440
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,840
This is the most important match

441
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,400
since Shaofei became their coach.

442
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,400
You are nervous for Shaofei, huh?

443
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,760
Shangyan.

444
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,490
Hmm?

445
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,400
You have so many trophies!

446
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
You are amazing!

447
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,280
I told you to come earlier.

448
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,160
I am flying to Beijing tomorrow.

449
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,170
I was waiting for a cheap ticket.

450
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
You never saved money before.

451
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,920
I'm saving money for you,

452
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,000
so you can get married.

453
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,400
I don't need your money.

454
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,360
You may not need it,

455
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
but I want to give it to you.

456
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,880
Take this.

457
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,960
Know what?

458
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,920
What you are doing right now

459
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,800
makes me feel so proud.

460
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,240
You are cultivating champions

461
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,660
for our country in the future, right?

462
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,800
You're really a pioneer of this industry.

463
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,600
You're so great.

464
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,920
Enough small talk.

465
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,080
This isn't small talk!

466
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,800
I guess you want to talk about

467
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,000
my future in-laws?

468
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,240
Her parents...

469
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,560
don't like me very much.

470
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,080
Why not?

471
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,960
You're talented

472
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,920
and successful!

473
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,760
They have no reason to dislike you.

474
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,760
They like me a bit more now,

475
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,160
but still only like me this much.

476
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,840
What about your girlfriend?

477
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,720
She's about to graduate, right?

478
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,800
What will she do?

479
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,600
I...

480
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,600
I have no idea.

481
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,800
You have no idea?

482
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,560
Goodness, boy.

483
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,460
Is she really your girlfriend?

484
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,640
We had some difficulties in the past.

485
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,120
You don't need to know the details.

486
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,720
Anyways,

487
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
we've known each other for 200 days,

488
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,870
and haven't been together that long.

489
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,200
So are you sure...

490
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,640
she's the one?

491
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,510
Do you know how to love someone?

492
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,720
Child,

493
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,760
if you really love someone,

494
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,440
you should be ready to give her all you have.

495
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,560
This

496
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,160
is the meaning of love.

497
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,130
Hello?

498
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,640
What's your plan after graduation?

499
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,200
I had planned to start working.

500
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,840
But my professor insisted that

501
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,440
I get my PhD instead.

502
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,800
Since I'm still young,

503
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,320
I thought I might as well keep studying.

504
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,120
So I'll start my doctorate next year.

505
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,040
Why ask that?

506
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
I was just curious.

507
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,640
My stepmother is here.

508
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,560
Your stepmother?

509
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,680
When did she arrive?

510
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,890
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

511
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,680
She suddenly came back.

512
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Don't be nervous.

513
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,440
Should I...

514
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,140
meet her while she's here?

515
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,960
If you want to.

516
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,080
We're going to see your parents this evening.

517
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,960
This evening?

518
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,720
Yes.

519
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,040
You don't have to come if you are busy.

520
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,160
I'll take care of things.

521
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,840
Wait, hang on.

522
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,400
I am a bit confused.

523
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,080
So your stepmother came back to China,

524
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,600
and you are both going to

525
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,840
meet my parents tonight, is that right?

526
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,520
She said she would like to

527
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,440
officially meet your parents.

528
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,440
Officially meet them?

529
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,880
But I have class this evening.

530
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,280
It's alright.

531
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,000
I will..

532
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,240
I will take care of it.

533
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,600
I will definitely be there.

534
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,080
Alright, bye.

535
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
She said she planned to work,

536
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,160
but her professor dissuaded her.

537
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,480
So she's helping out in the lab this year,

538
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,800
and will start her doctorate next year.

539
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,160
That's why her parents don't like you.

540
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,900
Your IQ is clearly lower than hers.

541
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,020
This is the first time I'll meet them.

542
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,600
I should bring them some gifts.

543
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,640
What do you think?

544
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,920
I'll go and buy some.

545
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,080
There's no time for that.

546
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,320
We're meeting them at 6.

547
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,840
At 6?

548
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,320
Then there's not much time left.

549
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,800
We can't be late.

550
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,770
We should be at least 30 minutes early.

551
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,760
Hey,

552
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,600
are you going to

553
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,680
meet her parents

554
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,240
in these clothes?

555
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
This is an official meeting.

556
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,050
Don't you have something more formal?

557
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,640
Go and get changed.

558
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,160
Okay.

559
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,280
I'll wait for you downstairs.

560
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,840
Okay.

561
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,760
What's this?

562
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,680
It's formal enough, right?

563
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:50,840
Not bad.

564
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,400
They're here.

565
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,360
Hi, hello.

566
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,120
Nice to meet you.

567
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,240
Nice to meet you too.

568
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,240
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Tong.

569
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,560
Let me introduce you.

570
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,680
This is my mom.

571
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,000
Nice to meet you.

572
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,280
Nice to meet you.

573
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,600
Your mom looks so young.

574
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,280
Thank you.

575
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,160
I am sorry for the short notice.

576
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,460
I should have contacted you earlier.

577
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Sorry for any inconvenience.

578
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,760
It's alright. No worries.

579
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,560
We know you seldom come back here.

580
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,000
We didn't prepare anything much.

581
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
Just this little gift.

582
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,320
Forgive us for that.

583
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,560
Oh, no need to say that.

584
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,400
It's some local Shanghai snacks.

585
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,400
Hope you like them.

586
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,040
You are so kind.

587
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,600
I love local Shanghai snacks.

588
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,800
Every time my friends come to visit me,

589
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,760
I ask them to bring me some.

590
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,920
I'm glad you like it.

591
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,030
Hey, let's go inside and sit.

592
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,720
Okay.

593
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,840
-Please.  -After you.

594
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,200
This wine is for Tong Nian's dad.

595
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,920
Hope you like it.

596
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,480
Thank you.

597
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,410
And some cosmetics for you.

598
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,360
You are so considerate.

599
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,920
Thank you.

600
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,160
You are welcome.

601
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,400
Let's sit at the table.

602
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,280
Okay, okay.

603
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,720
Please have a seat here, Mr. Tong.

604
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Mrs. Tong, would you like to sit here?

605
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,200
No problem.

606
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,520
You should sit as well.

607
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,880
Okay. Please sit.

608
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,000
Sit down.

609
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,890
Is anyone else joining us tonight?

610
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,060
I thought Tong Nian might come.

611
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,600
She might not be able to make it.

612
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
Let's have some tea first.

613
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,560
Good.

614
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,420
Pour them some tea.

615
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,030
Okay.

616
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,440
Mr. Tong.

617
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,280
Thanks.

618
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,280
Why are there so many cars?

619
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,720
It's normal at this hour.

620
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,430
It's not a good time to go out.

621
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,800
Sir. Can you please drive faster

622
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,920
after we get past this traffic jam?

623
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,520
My boyfriend and his mom

624
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,480
are meeting my parents.

625
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,880
I have to be there.

626
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,720
Why didn't you two go together?

627
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,480
It's your boyfriend's fault.

628
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,530
I don't know why he didn't tell me earlier.

629
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,200
Anyways,

630
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,880
my parents don't like him very much.

631
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
I have to be there to protect him.

632
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,520
You're worried?

633
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,160
Don't worry.

634
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,480
He is a man.

635
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,360
If he can't make your parents like him,

636
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
he doesn't deserve you.

637
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,320
I was in the same situation.

638
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,320
My in-laws didn't like me.

639
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,440
So I went to their home

640
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,800
and did the housework for them every day.

641
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,000
And then what?

642
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,200
I went to the market and cooked.

643
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,120
I fixed the toilet and painted the wall.

644
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,040
Whatever housework you can think of,

645
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,200
I did everything.

646
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,040
And then,

647
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,400
my wife started to appreciate me more.

648
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,560
She doesn't do any housework now.

649
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,760
Her father was moved too.

650
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,480
Working hard will help you succeed.

651
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,640
It brings you wealth,

652
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,960
and a wife as well.

653
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,080
Many young men nowadays

654
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
complain they don't have a girlfriend,

655
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,080
but they are just too lazy.

656
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,400
If they did all the housework,

657
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,280
they would definitely have one.

658
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,640
My boyfriend treats me really well.

659
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,360
He doesn't let me do anything.

660
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,760
He won't even let me clean one cup.

661
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,720
Really?

662
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,360
Then you should keep him.

663
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,600
Was he born in the 90s?

664
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,880
The 80s.

665
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,040
No matter how old he is,

666
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,720
he sounds a good catch.

667
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,760
After this traffic jam,

668
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,240
I'll take a shortcut.

669
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,080
Maybe we can arrive earlier.

670
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,600
Thank you, sir!

671
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
My son went to Shanghai alone

672
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,920
when he was only 19 years old.

673
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,920
He had to work hard all by himself.

674
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,490
I know it was a tough time for him.

675
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
And at that time,

676
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,960
I didn't give him any money.

677
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,790
I wanted to stop him from going to Shanghai

678
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,560
because he'd never had to fend for himself before.

679
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,210
I didn't think he would last long here,

680
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,240
and would come back soon.

681
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,120
But unexpectedly, a year later,

682
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,410
he still hadn't returned.

683
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,160
I was so worried.

684
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,360
Because I feared

685
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,410
I had let his late father down.

686
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,110
So I bought a ticket and flew to Shanghai.

687
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,820
I just wanted to see

688
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,110
what my son was doing in Shanghai.

689
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,430
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

690
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,680
I wouldn't have known.

691
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,040
Time helps us understand people.

692
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,480
After you get to know my son better,

693
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,920
you will discover he's a really good kid.

694
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,600
Although, I'm not his birth mother,

695
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,400
he's the only son

696
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,000
that I have in this life.

697
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
Han Shangyan!

698
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,200
Han Shangyan. Come out!

699
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,280
I know you are in there.

700
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,760
I just saw you.

701
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,360
Han Shangyan. Get down here.

702
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,000
Listen up.

703
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,250
I will bring you back with me no matter what.

704
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,920
Han Shangyan.

705
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,430
Is this how you repay me for raising you?

706
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,210
I started raising you when I was 20.

707
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,880
I've raised you this whole time.

708
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,040
Why?

709
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,640
Tell me why?

710
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,600
How could you treat me like this?

711
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,490
Why did you do this to me?

712
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,840
Your father

713
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,560
left that money

714
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,480
for your future.

715
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
Look at you now.

716
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,320
How can I face your late father?

717
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,640
Does it matter if I use the money now or later?

718
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,600
I became a Chinese citizen and came back

719
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,880
to help China win a championship.

720
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,970
If you ask me to go back now,

721
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,600
you are asking me to give up my dream.

722
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,280
I don't care about some championship.

723
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,520
Are you going to play this

724
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,710
for the rest of your life?

725
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,080
I am not playing.

726
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,560
This is a competition

727
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,760
that requires skills and intelligence.

728
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,800
Although it is not yet popular in China,

729
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,400
I believe someday,

730
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,150
we can make China the best in this field!

731
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,680
You...

732
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,640
How can you compete against them?

733
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,080
Why can't I?

734
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
China has a lot of talented people!

735
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,520
What's wrong?

736
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,200
Why are you quarrelling out here?

737
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,240
Mrs. Wang,

738
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,600
he's so unreasonable.

739
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,558
Han Shangyan.

740
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,960
What did you say to her?

741
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,240
Let's go inside.

742
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,680
Don't let the neighbors gossip.

743
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,680
I won't go in.

744
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,260
Go in.

745
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,560
Let me show you a video.

746
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,880
Watch them

747
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,200
winning a competition.

748
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,160
They look so cool.

749
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,280
I'm not interested.

750
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,430
Watch first.

751
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,030
If you're not satisfied,

752
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,160
I'll make sure he goes back

753
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,840
with you to Norway.

754
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,000
Let's go.

755
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,920
After that day,

756
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,360
I gradually understood

757
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,820
how difficult it was for them to be champions.

758
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,840
The training was tough,

759
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,290
but they never complained.

760
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,740
Their life was difficult, you know?

761
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,070
Many people

762
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,760
don't know this industry well.

763
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,100
So my son never told others

764
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,510
how difficult it was for him.

765
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,040
He chose to handle it all by himself.

766
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,920
I admit,

767
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,290
Shangyan has his shortcomings.

768
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,880
But I promise you,

769
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,800
he is a good boy.

770
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,880
I remember,

771
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,400
he started to

772
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,720
support the whole team financially

773
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,320
within only

774
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,240
two and a half years

775
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,110
all by himself.

776
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,000
Now he has his own team,

777
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,930
and he is devoted to them.

778
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,680
He doesn't do this to make money.

779
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,490
Even if he loses money,

780
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,310
he would never give up on his team.

781
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,140
He once told me before that

782
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,960
this was his dream.

783
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,560
But now,

784
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,580
he is doing it for his players' dreams.

785
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,150
From my perspective as a mom,

786
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,620
I believe he is really great.

787
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,480
Goodness, I am sorry.

788
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,460
I've talked too much.

789
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,800
I am sorry.

790
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,680
I hope you don't think I'm exaggerating.

791
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,560
It feels like I'm trying to sell you on him.

792
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,400
No, I understand.

793
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
It's good to know more about him.

794
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,360
Yes.

795
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,800
We are parents, too.

796
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
We understand how you feel about him.

797
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,860
All parents are proud of their children.

798
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,080
We are all the same.

799
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,440
We all think our children are the best.

800
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,600
You are right.

801
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,560
The reason why I came back this time

802
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,040
is to ask your permission about something

803
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,760
on my son's behalf.

804
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,120
If you're not opposed to it,

805
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,320
I suggest that

806
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,700
they get engaged as soon as possible.

807
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
What?

808
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,680
Engaged?

809
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,760
I even brought betrothal presents.

810
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,200
Well, it's a bit too soon to discuss that.

811
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,670
Or maybe we don't ever need to talk about it.

812
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,600
We are not that traditional,

813
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,200
so we don't care about

814
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,560
old-fashioned traditions like betrothal presents.

815
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,280
What we are concerned about is that

816
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,770
they haven't known each other for very long.

817
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,400
I feel it is still too early

818
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,790
for them to get engaged.

819
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,560
Yes. I agree.

820
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,040
It is too early.

821
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,200
I totally understand your concern.

822
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,400
I came back here this time

823
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,560
just to meet you both

824
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,540
and discuss everything with you.

825
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,930
Please rest assured

826
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
that we are very sincere.

827
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,360
We know that.

828
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,960
But I suggest we give them more time

829
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,000
to get to know more about each other.

830
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,440
I don't think there's any need

831
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,040
for them to get engaged right now.

832
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,800
Right?

833
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,040
I agree.

834
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,680
We can just get married directly.

835
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,400
Why would you say that?

836
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,640
All that nonsense you just said

837
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,740
took forever to get to the point.

838
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,880
Don't you understand strategy?

839
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,360
Do things quickly to triumph in the end.

840
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,120
My son loves Tong Nian,

841
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,480
so he's a bit emotional

842
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,720
and spoke without thinking.

843
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,320
I am so sorry.

844
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,500
Let's start eating.

845
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,880
We can talk while enjoying the meal.

846
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,040
-Please.  -Okay, okay.

847
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,680
Let's start.

848
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,800
Shangyan,

849
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,280
This restaurant has some appetizers

850
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,730
that Tong Nian loves to eat.

851
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,160
I want to take some back for her.

852
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,520
No problem. Let me get the waiter.

853
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,400
Waiter!  - No need.

854
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,160
You don't know what she likes to eat.

855
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,080
I'll go and order them myself.

856
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,720
Why don't you come with me, okay?

857
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,480
Hurry and go.

858
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,840
Mr. Tong, eat up.

859
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,760
-Try the salmon here.  -Thanks.

860
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,120
Shangyan come here. We need to talk.

861
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,240
What are you doing?

862
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,720
Do you think you can change our minds

863
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,005
by getting your mom involved?

864
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:39,600
Well?

865
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,160
Of course not.

866
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,880
I brought my mom to meet you

867
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,320
because I want to let you know

868
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,240
that I am serious about this relationship.

869
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,880
I'm not messing around.

870
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,360
How could you suddenly

871
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,470
bring up getting engaged?

872
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,400
I feel like you're

873
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,900
pushing us to agree against our will.

874
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,850
That wasn't my purpose.

875
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
I proposed it

876
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,080
because I love Tong Nian deeply,

877
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,650
and I want to see her every day.

878
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
I really want to be with her

879
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,960
for the rest of my life.

880
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,120
That's why we brought this up.

881
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,880
What about Tong Nian?

882
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,700
Wait.

883
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,280
Don't tell me you two...

884
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,840
Did you...

885
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,600
I'll just be direct.

886
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,920
Is Tong Nian pregnant?

887
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Is this why you are in such a hurry?

888
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,840
No, she isn't.

889
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,960
That is not the reason.

890
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,360
I promised before marriage

891
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,720
I would not do anything

892
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,360
improper with Tong Nian.

893
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,040
What about Tong Nian?

894
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,630
Does she love you?

895
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,840
I shouldn't have asked this.

896
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,320
I can clearly see she loves you very much.

897
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,807
I believe

898
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,370
we are both truly in love.

899
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,760
We'll be as happy as you and Mr. Tong.

900
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,480
You don't know this,

901
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,120
but we quarrel quite often.

902
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,760
But you care about your family

903
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
and love each other.

904
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,040
And you love your daughter very much.

905
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,080
You've set a very good example for me.

906
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,520
Mrs. Tong.

907
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Please trust me

908
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,840
and give me a chance.

909
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,380
If Tong Nian doesn't want to marry me,

910
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,920
I promise I will not force her

911
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,360
and will leave her alone.

912
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,720
Trust me.

913
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,520
Listen up.

914
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,080
Tong Nian has never had a boyfriend.

915
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,280
So you must

916
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,240
take extra good care of her

917
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,240
and cherish her.

918
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,080
Will you?

919
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,480
Not good enough.

920
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,250
You must promise me.

921
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,760
Please rest assured.

922
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,160
I will not let her down.

923
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Thanks for the invitation.

924
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,480
No worries. It's been a pleasure.

925
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,760
Mrs. Tong,

926
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,800
could you please keep our discussion

927
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,440
a secret for now?

928
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,290
I want to surprise Tong Nian.

929
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,240
Okay.

930
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,360
-We're leaving then.  -Good bye.

931
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,160
-See you.  -Thank you.

932
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,400
See you.

933
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,440
One more thing,

934
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm about to take my team to the national finals.

935
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,580
Please allow Tong Nian to come with me to Beijing.

936
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,480
Please rest assured.

937
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,440
I will book two separate rooms

938
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,840
for the two of us.

939
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,510
So I hope I have your permission.

940
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Tong Nian is a grown-up now.

941
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,520
Shangyan, listen,

942
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,290
you two can make decisions for yourselves.

943
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,030
You don't have to report to us.

944
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
I appreciate that.

945
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,160
-See you.  -Okay then.

946
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Drive carefully.

947
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,600
-See you.  -Bye.

948
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,640
Thank you for today.

949
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,440
If you want to thank me,

950
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,880
come with me somewhere.

951
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,250
You don't have any friends in China.

952
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,360
Of course I do.

953
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,760
It's not too late.

954
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,760
