I've had my own gaggle of kids

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
to deal with alright?

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,240
Go ahead.

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
Don't lie to me.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
Come on kiddo,

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,120
why would I lie to you?

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,440
Such a jerk.

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,080
I don't know why Tong Nian

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,240
likes you so much.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,440
If it were me,

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,440
I'd rather be alone.

Get over yourself!

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,080
Tell me.

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,960
What do you want to know?

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,040
How did my parents meet each other?

42
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,360
Dreams.

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,800
Your mom was also a professional player.

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,880
Before I came back,

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,240
they got to know each other.

46
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,780
Before Ai Qing met my dad?

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,440
Your parents and I,

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,330
we were friends since the very beginning.

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,000
Before I moved back permanently,

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,090
I came back twice.

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
At that time,

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,320
they were still together.

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,520
Then,

54
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,000
why did they break up?

55
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,890
There're tons of reasons for lovers to break up.

56
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,040
How would I know?

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,870
I thought you know all of it.

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,240
Maybe they fought too much.

59
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,920
A lot of people choose to take a break,

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,440
maybe they tried that.

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,720
That's all?

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,000
Let me think.

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,440
My dad,

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,040
he didn't want to have me?

65
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,440
My dad didn't want a kid,

66
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,640
but my mom insisted?

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,320
Tell me!

68
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,160
Just let me think.

70

71

OK.

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,240
Stay circumspect.

73
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,320
Today you all performed well.

74
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,680
Captain,

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,400
the last technique you used was brilliant!

76
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Really awesome!  -Yeah!

77
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,680
Solo, wait.

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,760
Let's go.

79
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,640
Su Cheng,

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,200
sorry,

81
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,920
I beat you today.

82
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,360
You misunderstand,

83
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,040
I'm not mad.

84
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,200
On the contrary,

85
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,920
I'm really impressed.

86
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,360
But why didn't you go harder?

87
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,400
Me?

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,080
When we were fighting 1 on 1,

89
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,040
you attacked my point in round 3,

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,320
penetrated in round 6,

91
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
and found my weakness in round 10.

92
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,540
You had several chances to win already,

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
why did you go easy on me?

94
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,120
You do know how the competition works.

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Come on,

96
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,920
I was thinking that

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,850
since I won so many rounds,

98
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,360
the last few ones,

99
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,000
I decided to relax a bit.

100
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
You know what?

101
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,390
That is even more humiliating.

102
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,120
Don't cry.

103
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,280
It's just a game!

104
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,680
Next time you will win!

105
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,710
I don't want to be so weak in front of you.

106
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,200
I don't want to disappoint you.

107
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,720
I'm different from the others.

108
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,800
Do they like you as much as I do?

109
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,520
=Ten years ago=

110
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
Su Cheng?

111
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,720
I haven't seen you for what, two years?

112
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,520
Is Solo here?

113
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,320
No, he isn't.

114
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Everyone is out.

115
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,120
Can I wait for him inside?

116
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,560
Take a seat.

117
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,600
You should know that

118
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,000
he has a girlfriend.

119
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,560
I know.

120
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,400
Then you must know,

121
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,920
who his girlfriend is, right?

122
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,880
His girlfriend is Ai Qing.

123
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,560
Appledog,

124
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,560
the first female striker on your team.

125
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,360
OK, OK.

126
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,880
Tell me why.

127
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,380
I have the right to be informed.

128
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,430
You gave birth to my child.

129
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,920
At least, you should let me know,

130
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,880
right?

131
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,720
Solo,

132
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,680
I'm desperate now.

133
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,440
I can't afford her.

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,400
You can't?

135
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,960
Then why did you keep her?

136
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,760
Why would you do this?

137
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,320
She's sick.

138
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,840
And she needs treatment.

139
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,800
But I can't even feed myself.

140
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,280
I really don't want to blackmail you.

141
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,520
I just don't want her to suffer with me.

142
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,040
Solo,

143
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,520
she's your daughter.

144
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,800
Can you please keep her?

145
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,920
Your team is doing so well.

146
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,360
It won't be a problem to raise a little girl,

147
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,440
right?

148
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Please, I'm begging you.

149
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,960
She really is your daughter.

150
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,800
I, I have her birth certificate.

151
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,920
If you want to check her DNA,

152
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,060
I'll go with you.

153
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,560
I beg you.

154
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,920
Please keep her.

155
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,710
I, I can't afford her treatment.

156
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,640
I can't save her.

157
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,320
I beg you.

158
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,200
I have no doubt about her identity.

159
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
That's not the issue.

160
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
All I want to know is,

161
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,520
you had my child,

162
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,080
why didn't you tell me?

163
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,960
This kid was not in my plan,

164
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,760
nor yours.

165
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,880
And at that time,

166
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
we already broke up.

167
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,720
You know what?

168
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,720
When I found out I was pregnant

169
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,080
the baby was three months old.

170
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,360
What could I do?

171
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,240
Your team was on the up,

172
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,560
I really didn't want me or my child

173
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,360
to your burden or distraction.

174
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,320
Ai Qing,

175
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,320
not now.

176
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,240
I will explain it later tonight.

177
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,680
Mama is here. Mama is here.

178
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Mama will come out soon.

179
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,600
Why wait till tonight?

180
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,180
Everyone is here now.

181
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,520
Explain it to me right now.

182
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
Who is that kid

183
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,800
outside?

184
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,480
Ai Qing,

185
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,620
I never did anything to hurt you.

186
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,800
Su Cheng and I,

187
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,720
we split up two years ago.

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,480
At that time, I didn't know you.

189
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,770
Just tell me, whose baby is that?

190
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,240
Come here!

191
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,120
Tell me,

192
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,840
who is this kid?

193
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,520
Mama, Mama!

194
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
Ai Qing, we haven't...

195
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,240
Shut up!

196
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,440
Maybe it isn't true.

197
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,640
You can't believe anything she says.

198
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,390
Ai Qing, you need to give Solo some time.

199
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,080
What if it's not true?

200
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,840
Did he check the DNA?

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,600
There is no need.

202
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,280
Mama, Mama.

203
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
She is my daughter.

204
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,630
Yes, she is my daughter.

205
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,320
Mama!

206
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,000
Out of my way!

207
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,520
Ai Qing!  -Ai Qing!

208
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,680
Mama.

209
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,800
Mama.

210
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,520
My dad chose me

211
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,680
over his team.

212
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes.

213
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,560
That's why you won't forgive him.

214
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,640
Yes.

215
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,000
I can tell Ai Qing,

216
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,920
that's my baby.

217
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,360
You have nothing to do with it.

218
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,160
I'll raise the kid for you.

219
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,080
You go find Ai Qing.

220
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,800
Don't let her fall apart.

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,550
We still have the national final coming up.

222
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,320
How can you raise a kid?

223
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,120
Also,

224
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,160
That's how you think of me?

225
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,760
How I think of you?

226
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,240
Tell me, what should I think of you?

227
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,080
You want all our efforts to

228
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,400
go down the drain?

229
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,200
Only one final step

230
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,040
and we can win the national championship.

231
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,440
I know.

232
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,600
Solo.

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,640
It's not just about you.

234
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,880
There is Ai Qing,

235
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Xiao Mi, Ou Qiang,

236
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,120
and everybody else.

237
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,880
The Solo team

238
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,400
isn't just about you!

239
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,280
I never expected this.

240
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,590
Why did this have to happen to me?

241
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,240
But,

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,440
the kid is innocent.

243
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,600
Now is not the time to feel guilty.

244
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,140
If you break up with Ai Qing,

245
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,400
our team will lose.

246
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,840
All our hard work

247
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,600
over all these years.

248
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,150
We can't just end like this.

249
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,660
♪ Nothing to hide, not be afraid ♪

250
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,560
Solo,

251
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,440
is this what you want?

252
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,280
We created this team all by ourselves.

253
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,960
Do you remember

254
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
how many sponsors you talked to,

255
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,880
how many doors slammed in your face,

256
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
do you remember?

257
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,710
You won them over one by one!

258
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,360
We are all here for you!

259
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,920
We are all in this because of you.

260
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,480
Just let me think.

261
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,600
Think about what?

262
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,380
Just do it as I told you.

263
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,300
♪ Trying to find the one that is me ♪

264
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,040
Just give me some time.

265
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,960
♪ Nothing to guide, not be afraid ♪

266
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:37,200
♪ So many times I wish I could leave ♪

267
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,280
My dad...

268
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,600
He is a good dad.

269
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,290
But he isn't a good leader.

270
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,020
But he's been trying to make up.

271
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,160
Like Shaofei and Ou Qiang,

272
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,280
they both came back because of Dad.

273
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,310
You know what "golden years" means?

274
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,800
As professional gamers,

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,520
they have wasted their golden years.

276
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,520
You're still upset about that?

277
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,750
♪ So many times I wish I could leave ♪

278
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,190
♪ You're walking away, begging to me ♪

279
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,200
Tong Nian,

280
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,520
Where's Han Shangyan and Xiao'ai?

281
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,240
Over there.

282
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,440
OK.

283
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,540
From your point of view,

284
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,560
my dad has truly disappointed you.

285
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,240
But, can you

286
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,480
think of it from my point of view?

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,360
How innocent I was?

288
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,840
I was so little!

289
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,960
And I was disabled.

290
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,450
My dad couldn't leave me behind.

291
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,440
I'm lucky

292
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,640
my dad didn't hand me

293
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,830
to you as your daughter.

294
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,840
If you were my dad,

295
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,200
we would fight every single day.

296
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
You think I was willing to do that?

297
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,520
You wish!

298
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,510
Xiao'ai.

299
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,760
Her luggage is still in Tong Nian's room.

300
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,680
When you are finished,

301
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,080
don't forget to get it.

302
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,640
Can I have a word with you?

303
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,440
This is the first time

304
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,630
your eyes were not on me.

305
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,280
I, I'm paying attention to them.

306
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,440
What do you think about their conversation?

307
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,960
What's gonna happen?

308
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,520
What do you want to happen?

309
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,440
This new hearing aid,

310
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,040
Han Shangyan bought it for you?

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,160
Of course not.

312
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,480
He wanted to,

313
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,920
but he knows nothing about this.

314
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,640
He thought it was like

315
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,880
buying some headphones.

316
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,200
That's why I always

317
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:41,920
have a spare.

318
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,920
You're just like your dad.

319
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,200
Always prepared.

320
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,520
You're mad at his attitude,

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,120
so was I.

322
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,040
Were you ever in love with my dad?

323
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,000
Were you?

324
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,880
He was my first love.

325
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,840
What about him?

326
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,880
Were you his first love?

327
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,200
I never asked him.

328
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Probably.

329
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,880
You...

330
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,480
Say it.

331
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,320
Just ask what you want to ask.

332
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,640
I'll answer them all.

333
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,560
I only took care of you for a short time.

334
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,320
And I don't have any other kids.

335
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,760
So I actually don't know how to be a mom.

336
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,320
Why don't we treat each other like friends,

337
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,120
how about that?

338
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,120
Why did you have me?

339
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,600
You didn't love my dad or me,

340
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,430
why did you give birth to me?

341
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,680
I did.

342
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Xiao'ai, I used to love him so much.

343
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,920
That's why I had you

344
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,440
as a memory of our love.

345
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,620
So I'm a souvenir of your relationship?

346
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,530
I was too naive.

348
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,330
I thought I could raise you by myself.

349
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,960
But you didn't expect me

350
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,080
to be an unhealthy baby

351
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,480
so you didn't want me anymore?

352
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,240
It's not like that.

353
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,490
My team's performance was really bad then.

354
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,150
But I wanted to give you a good life.

355
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,290
I thought you would be happier

356
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,650
if you lived with him.

357
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
You ruined him and his career!

358
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,680
Yes.

359
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,000
I was really selfish about that.

360
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,520
Or I should say,

361
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,040
I didn't expect

362
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,720
it would hurt everybody so much.

363
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,950
I also didn't expect that

364
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,420
Solo team would disband.

365
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
And you just married another man?

366
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,190
My husband

367
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,170
was the leader of my team.

368
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,360
I knew him before I knew your dad.

369
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,250
He always cared about me

370
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,700
and helped me out.

371
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,680
When I was alone, he was always by my side.

372
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,240
So why did you

373
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,760
break up with my dad?

374
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,360
At that time,

375
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
your dad's team was just getting started.

376
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,790
He was consumed every day

377
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,880
with how to improve the team.

378
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,520
I admired him.

379
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,560
But I was also mad at him.

380
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,190
As his girlfriend,

381
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,050
he didn't even have the time

382
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,680
to go for a walk with me.

383
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,960
We were constantly fighting.

384
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,880
It was my fault.

385
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,130
I was so young.

386
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,120
His career was important.

387
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,200
But I also needed his company.

388
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,280
Are you cold?

389
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,160
Nope.

390
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,880
Look.

391
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,880
Why are you so beautiful today?

392
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,840
I know,

393
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,880
though Xiao'ai is rebellious,

394
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,560
deep down she cares a lot about her dad.

395
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,720
Solo is the same.

396
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,350
He really loves his daughter.

397
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,240
Right?

398
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,950
You should ask her not me.

399
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,860
Why do you always pretend you don't care?

400
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,470
You're starving,

401
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,600
but you still helped Solo comfort his daughter.

402
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,640
Then you pretend that

403
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,150
it's none of your business.

404
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,920
Actually in your heart,

405
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,560
you've already forgiven him, right?

406
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,960
You talk too much.

407
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,520
How can you say that to me?

408
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,640
Then what do you want?

409
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,360
I'll drop you off here.

410
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,360
Do you know

411
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,360
why he wants to leave us here

412
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,720
and not any closer?

413
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,870
This area was Solo team's dormitory

414
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,120
and training base.

415
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,410
When he gets upset about the past,

416
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,240
you should comfort him

417
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,600
and he will love you more.

418
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Let me walk her home.

419
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,030
You don't need to get out.

420
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,600
I don't plan to.

421
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,120
Be careful.

422
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,640
My dad already has a cute daughter like me,

423
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,360
and you're still unmarried,

424
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,600
I pity you.

425
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,960
-Bye.  -Bye.

426
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,800
Bye.

427
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,600
I'll just stay here, OK?

428
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,840
Thank you for respecting me.

429
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,800
Thanks for talking with me.

430
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,080
Then we have a deal.

431
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,650
If I want to go see you,

432
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,980
I'll talk to you directly.

433
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,280
You don't need to ask my dad,

434
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,160
just ask me.

435
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,480
OK.

436
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,120
My dad,

437
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,840
he has his issues.

438
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,320
I know.

439
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,760
Go inside.

440
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,920
OK, bye-bye.

441
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,560
Xiao'ai.

442
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,320
Dad.

443
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,640
It is raining hard outside,

444
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,840
and you don't have an umbrella?

445
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,920
Your hair is all wet!

446
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,560
Sit down.

447
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,640
It's only been a month,

448
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,040
but your hair is noticeably longer.

449
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,810
Why are you eating take-out again?

450
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,160
It's all over the news.

451
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,040
It's oily and unhealthy.

452
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,510
You shouldn't eat those junk food!

453
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,280
I'm too lazy to cook for myself.

454
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,920
Well, I'm back now.

455
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,820
You should cook for me,

456
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,740
as an apology.

457
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,960
OK.

458
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,240
Let me dry your hair

459
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,240
and then I'll cook for you.

460
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,160
Tell me, what do you want to eat?

461
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,000
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

462
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
We can have that.

463
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,280
Sweet and sour spare ribs.

464
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,360
Deal.

465
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,560
And braised pork.

466
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Too big a challenge?

467
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,320
No!

468
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,360
Whatever you want to eat,

469
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,280
I'll cook it for you.

470
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,020
Dad, you're so slow.

471
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,720
Do it like this.

472
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,640
This is faster!

473
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,360
I won't get in the car.

474
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,960
I'm just going to walk a bit.

475
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
But it's raining outside.

476
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,040
Are you sure?

477
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,440
We're not going the same direction.

478
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,280
I'll be fine.

479
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,080
Take care of yourself then.

480
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,480
Xiao'ai just texted me.

481
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,880
She said that Solo caught a cold.

482
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,700
He got sick because

483
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,960
he missed her so much.

484
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,560
Before,

485
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,400
this whole area was full of factories.

486
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,720
I didn't expect it

487
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,560
to turn into an industrial park.

488
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,460
The roads were really awful.

489
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
When it rained, the ground was full of mud.

490
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,000
Back then,

491
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,600
Solo would carry Ai Qing home

492
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,020
so her shoes wouldn't get muddy.

493
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,320
It wasn't easy for Ai Qing,

494
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,280
she suffered a lot

495
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,920
being with him all those years.

496
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,360
I don't know

497
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,800
why she loves Solo so much.

498
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,680
How did they get to know each other?

499
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,650
Ai Qing fell in love with Solo

500
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
at first sight at an internet café.

501
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,480
Just like me.

502
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,440
What are you talking about?

503
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,900
Solo just broke up with Su Cheng

504
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,660
about six months prior then.

505
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,120
His heart was broken.

506
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
And I was totally fine.

507
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,800
Dad, leave that.

508
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,720
Come here first.

509
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,080
Here, drink the medicine.

510
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,400
Now it's you taking care of me.

511
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,120
Xiao'ai,

512
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,640
I was wrong.

513
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,840
No, you weren't.

514
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,600
Even if the whole world is wrong,

515
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,240
my dad can't be wrong.

516
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
It's because of me.

517
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,200
Without me,

518
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,900
you'd have already won the world championship.

519
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,640
Dad,

520
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,320
in my heart,

521
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,350
you're the best captain in all of China.

522
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,920
I know.

523
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,160
Thank you.

524
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,560
I will cook for you.

525
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,920
Time is a cruel mistress.

526
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,160
If

527
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,080
they knew things would end up like this,

528
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,280
perhaps they would've

529
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,170
made very different choices.

530
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,120
By the way,

531
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
who drove you home?

532
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,440
Han Shangyan.

533
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,560
Thanks for driving Xiao'ai home.

534
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,280
Would you like to have a cup of tea?

535
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,130
Su Cheng will go back to Norway.

536
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,880
I have lots of work to do.

537
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,550
No thanks.

538
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,120
Maybe next time.

539
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,670
It's raining.

540
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,200
Be careful on the road.

541
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,480
Hi.

542
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:13,960
Thank you for coming.

543
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
I'm so sorry that

544
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:15,870
I didn't call ahead

545
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,280
to make an appointment.

546
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:18,910
No, it's OK.

547
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,120
Here is your water.

548
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,480
Here is our menu.

549
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,620
Just give me a glass of juice.

550
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,020
OK.

551
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,520
A cup of coffee, thank you.

552
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:26,990
OK.

553
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,870
So, what did you want

554
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,040
to talk to me about?

555
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,680
Actually,

556
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,910
I've owed you an apology.

557
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,480
For what happened in the past?

558
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,970
You don't owe me anything.

559
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,050
Because in my heart,

560
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,640
the past is past.

561
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,940
I'm not like Han Shangyan.

562
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,110
I don't bear grudges.

563
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,350
At that time,

564
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,980
I was really desperate.

565
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,850
It felt like I was drowning in water,

566
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,680
looking for a piece of driftwood to cling to.

567
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,580
So instinctively,

568
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,420
I went to Xiao'ai's dad for help.

569
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,030
To be honest,

570
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,770
I didn't blame you

571
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,730
for bringing Xiao'ai over.

572
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,560
I blamed Solo.

573
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,760
I blamed him because

574
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,370
he never discussed with me

575
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,800
about his decision to take Xiao'ai in.

576
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,450
This led me to an emotional collapse,

577
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,080
I couldn't stay in the team at all.

578
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,510
And as it turned out,

579
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,720
he decided to quit

580
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,160
which caused the team to disband.

581
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,280
I was the last one to find out.

582
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
So,

583
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
maybe each player in the Solo team

584
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,170
was more important than his girlfriend.

585
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,310
I'm relieved that Solo decided to

586
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,560
take care of Xiao'ai.

587
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,120
I know he would try his best

588
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,400
to take care of her.

589
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,480
But I feel sorry for you.

590
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,610
The person you should feel sorry for is Solo.

591
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,830
For a man who didn't know

592
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,160
how to take care of a child,

593
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,590
he learned from books every single day.

594
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,960
Come on.

595
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,350
Try this.

596
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,840
I cooked it just for you.

597
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,240
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

598
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Do you want some water

599
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,320
before you eat?

600
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,200
OK.

601
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,480
Good, good girl.

602
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,600
Here.

603
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,000
Come on, drink some water.

604
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,600
Solo,

605
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,720
it's been three years.

606
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,320
Will you join back up with us?

607
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,040
Let me help you eat.

608
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,400
Take care of yourself then.

609
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,960
Please stay for a bit.

610
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,720
When I finish this,

611
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
we can talk.

612
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,600
Bye.

613
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,200
I wasn't mad at him anymore.

614
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,580
But like I said,

615
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,840
the past is past.

616
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,720
So just let it go.

617
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,680
I guess the reason you wanted to

618
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,680
see me today is not about the past.

619
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,400
Here is your coffee.

620
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,200
Thank you.

621
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,560
And your juice.

622
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,800
Yeah, I don't know how to start this talk.

623
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,520
I want to ask you...

624
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,080
If I take Xiao'ai

625
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,730
to Norway to cure her ears and

626
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,720
give her an education there,

627
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,440
do you think that it will hurt Solo?

628
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,800
Although he gave me his permission,

629
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm still worried about him.

630
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,000
I see.

631
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,030
And I suggest,

632
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,250
maybe you should go ask Xiao'ai herself.

633
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,330
After all, she is 12 years old.

634
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,400
And if you want to know what I think

635
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,640
about how she'd choose to live with,

636
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,050
you should remember

637
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,150
you've only taken care of her for 2 years.

638
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,530
But Solo's taken care of her for 10 years,

639
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,310
he was there in her entire childhood.

640
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,720
If you were her,

641
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,840
who would you choose to live with?

642
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,570
I have to go grab some stuff.

643
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,740
I will drive you home after.

644
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,800
What?

645
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,420
You wanna come in?

646
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,930
No, I don't.

647
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,070
Your grandpa might get the wrong idea.

648
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
About what?

649
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,490
You know what!

650
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,230
We can't keep up with this lie.

651
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,570
Besides, it's your grandpa.

652
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,400
Then we won't.

653
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,640
You know,

654
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,040
I am so happy to see you two

655
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,680
back together again.

656
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,320
Mr. Han,

657
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,480
I'm also happy to see you.

658
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,000
Really?

659
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,640
Of course.

660
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,320
Juice.

661
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,280
Don't drink it here.

662
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,650
Bring it upstairs.

663
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,680
Right right,

664
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,840
pick some movies

665
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,920
and watch upstairs.

666
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,560
Can we just watch movies here?

667
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,240
This is my place.

668
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,850
You should go to your place.

669
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,440
Go, go, go.

670
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Be quick, go.

671
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,200
OK.

672
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,640
Alright, we'll go upstairs then.

673
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,650
By the way,

674
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,400
since we sent the cat to the club,

675
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,880
there's no need to keep the cat food here.

676
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,280
Take them to the club!

677
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,700
OK.

678
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,040
He still has the cat!

679
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,920
Mr. Han, we're going upstairs!

680
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,520
OK.

681
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,280
Enjoy yourselves!

682
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,350
Take your time.

683
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,260
So you didn't give the cat away.

684
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,520
Why is the cat food spilled everywhere?

685
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,200
Let me help you.

686
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,360
No, leave that to me.

687
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,740
Do you have a rag or something?

688
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,480
In the bathroom.

689
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,080
So this is his bathroom.

690
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,880
Let me help you.

691
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,920
In his house,

692
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,840
doing housework with him.

693
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,840
I'm so happy.

694
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,840
You haven't explained it!

695
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,520
Explained what?

696
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,680
You didn't give the cat away!

697
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,840
Why did you lie to me?

698
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,040
How is the cat I got you?

699
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,280
Is he good?

700
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,880
It almost bit me.

701
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,120
If he did, I'd have to get vaccinated.

702
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,600
Why are you always a problem?

703
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,880
Sorry.

704
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,520
How about you give it back to me?

705
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,200
I'll raise it for you.

706
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,080
I gave him away.

707
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,680
To whom?

708
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,240
Our maid.

709
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,000
I was in a bad mood.

710
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,000
So I lied.

711
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,400
Were you angry with me that day?

712
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,810
Or was it something else that happened?

713
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,960
You must be the one

714
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,720
to end all of this.

715
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,760
Do you understand?

716
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,160
OK.

717
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,560
Can I really trust you?

718
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,120
Do you think

719
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,040
I'm really that unreliable?

720
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,400
I'll say it again,

721
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,600
I promise you.

722
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,160
Don't ask me questions like that.

723
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,320
If I don't tell you why,

724
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,960
it's because I don't want to hurt you.

725
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,720
What about your date in Norway?

726
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
That was a lie, too.

727
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,920
I went to Norway

728
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,040
to report on my work

729
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,360
and see my stepmother.

730
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,480
