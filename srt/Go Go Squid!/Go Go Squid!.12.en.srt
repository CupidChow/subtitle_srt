Obviously Solo didn't raise her right.

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,920
You could probably have done a better job.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,920
What's your problem?

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,680
You don't like your mother,

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
but you need to be polite to your seniors.

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,640
Didn't your dad teach you that?

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,520
If he didn't, then he's not a good dad.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,740
What do you mean? I'm not polite?

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,520
I will go.

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,560
You said it.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,410
You have to go now.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,040
You need to come, too.

38
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,880
Fine,

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,440
I'll see you downstairs in 10 minutes.

40
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,800
Han Shangyan, you tricked me!

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,950
Han Shangyan, why are we here?

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,880
I just need a second.

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,840
I've finished the software.

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,520
It's better to tweak it on your computer.

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
With access to the Internet,

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,680
you'll be able to see everyone's score.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,320
That was quick.

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
It's pretty simple.

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,920
Do you want to hang out with us?

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Where are you going?

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,200
The amusement park.

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,920
Amusement park?

53
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,120
Come with us.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,680
Isn't it weird for me to go?

55
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,840
Do you like kids?

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,040
Then it's not weird.

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,160
Get in.

58
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,370
Why don't you play with them?

59
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,600
I'm not interested.

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,120
Why are you afraid of him?

61
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,600
Did you hear me?

62
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,879
Yes.

63
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,520
I didn't understand what you meant,

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
but I get it now.

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm not afraid of him. It's just...

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,280
Forget it.

67
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,040
You're too young to understand.

68
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
You have a crush on him right?

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,160
It's nothing complicated.

70
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
How old are you?

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,920
Younger than you anyway.

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,600
Tell me, besides the fact that he's handsome,

73
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,230
he has no good virtues whatsoever.

74
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,360
He's not a good guy.

75
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,160
Why do you like him?

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,439
Of course he has virtues.

77
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,060
He's got tons of them!

78
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,400
He's the best.

79
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,000
Fine. Number one fan over here.

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,040
Let's check out the boats.

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,320
So you can get some alone time with him.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,800
Gun, go buy boat tickets.

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,640
Why don't you get them yourself?

84
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
You dragged me here.

85
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,240
It's your responsibility.

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,080
Wanna go check out the boat?

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,850
Okay.

88
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,280
Worried about her?

89
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,080
You gave her up ten years ago.

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,640
So now,

91
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
what are you gonna do?

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I've always been a weak person.

93
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,840
So I couldn't be a professional competitor.

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,200
You are different.

95
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,280
You set a goal and you chase it.

96
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
You never quit.

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,280
For Xiao'ai,

98
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,160
I hurt her so deeply

99
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,640
when I abandoned her.

100
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,980
I don't know how I will ever make it up to her.

101
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,640
There is only do or do not.

102
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,240
You've gotta give it a try.

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,760
If you never try,

104
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,320
you'll never succeed.

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,070
Right?

106
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
Tong Nian!

107
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,880
This was your idea.

108
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,400
Why are you so far away from us?

109
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,880
It's too crowded in your boat.

110
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,760
Hand me your phone.

111
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,720
Why?

112
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,600
Don't you girls love taking photos

113
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,970
and posting them on WeChat?

114
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,920
I'll take photos for you.

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,000
No, thanks. I don't do that very often.

116
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,560
Do you need me to take one for you?

117
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,440
I... I'm good at photo-taking.

118
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,000
No need.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,920
Tong Nian!

120
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Han Shangyan!

121
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,720
Delete the photo.

122
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,880
Hear me?

123
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,520
Never.

124
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,250
It's going on my WeChat moments.

125
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,400
Don't you dare!

126
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,280
I'll throw you into the river

127
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,240
when we get off this boat.

128
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,160
Be careful!

129
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,800
It's dangerous. Dangerous.

130
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,240
Stop taking photos!

131
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,290
Or I'll beat you up later!

132
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,240
I'll rough you up!

133
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,080
What's so funny?

134
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,800
Careful, careful!

135
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,920
Give me your phone.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,920
You violated my portraiture rights.

137
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,440
You're violating my privacy rights!

138
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
You can't check people's phones!

139
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,360
You are thirty, Gun.

140
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,730
Look at the wrinkles on your face and forehead.

141
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
You aren't a spring chicken anymore!

142
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,040
It looks like we are on a picnic

143
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,440
with a couple kids.

144
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,640
Hungry? What do you want to eat?

145
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,960
Anything's fine.

146
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,400
I'll eat what you eat.

147
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
What if I don't eat?

148
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,800
Leave us alone if you don't eat.

149
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,080
Watch what you say.

150
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,080
Don't get all sweet on me

151
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,040
when I come back with yummy food.

152
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,840
Don't be cocky.

153
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,280
You can never match my dad.

154
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,400
You were born into a rich family,

155
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,630
but you always pretend you relied on your hard work.

156
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,010
My dad is the one who started from nothing

157
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,960
in a small village.

158
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,500
You're just another one of his blind fans, you know?

159
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,480
Alright, alright.

160
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,320
I'm hungry. Let's get some food.

161
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,800
Any allergies?

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Nope.

163
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,640
Alright, I'll go.

164
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,880
Wait.

165
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,600
Let me go with you.

166
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,040
Xiao'ai, what's wrong?

167
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
Are you feeling alright?

168
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,480
Tell me.

169
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,480
Is it a stomachache?

170
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Leave me alone.

171
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
Or are you going to come swooping in

172
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,080
to save the day every month?

173
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,640
Is it that time of the month?

174
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,600
I have these.

175
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,060
Just tell me if you need them, okay?

176
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,520
What should we do next?

177
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,800
Roller Coaster.

178
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,760
Okay, let's go.

179
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,200
Come.

180
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,960
Let's go.

181
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,200
Wait for me.

182
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,200
Aren't you going?

183
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,560
I have to reply to several emails.

184
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,130
You go ahead.

185
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
Come on. Come with us.

186
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,080
I said no.

187
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,360
Leave me alone.

188
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,880
Okay. We'll find you later.

189
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,240
Yummy?

190
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,760
Do you want more?

191
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
Han Shangyan.

192
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,480
Let's go!

193
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,520
How do you not know?

194
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,840
Han Shangyan's afraid of heights.

195
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,400
He what?!

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,610
The great Han Shangyan is actually afraid of something?

197
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,000
That's not right.

198
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,040
What a shame to our team,

199
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,870
having somebody afraid of heights.

200
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,580
Come here. Come on.

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,960
Just once.

202
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,640
Han Shangyan.

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,440
Life is about challenges.

204
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,520
Just try it once.

205
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,440
Just once, okay?

206
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,480
Calm down. Calm down.

207
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,830
It's fine. I'll be with you. I'm here.

208
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
Shout if you get scared.

209
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,570
-Han Shangyan!  -I'll take photos for you.

210
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,060
Wait for me. Wait.

211
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,360
Where are you going?

212
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,920
Coward.

213
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,080
Han Shangyan.

214
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,760
Han Shangyan, why didn't you come?

215
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,880
It was awesome!

216
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,880
Are you not interested,

217
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,130
or are you too scared?

218
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
Gun is capable of anything.

219
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,140
He's not scared.

220
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,120
Ridiculous.

221
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,000
Isn't this a kids' game?

222
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,320
Why are you playing it?

223
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,980
I stopped playing it centuries ago.

224
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,800
You little pipsqueak.

225
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,960
You talk a big game for a little kid.

226
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,040
Here, I'll let you play a round.

227
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,240
If you beat my high score,

228
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,840
I'll buy you a drink.

229
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,120
But if your scores are lower,

230
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,760
you're buying.

231
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,640
Easy.

232
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,330
You're doomed.

233
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,770
You tricked me! You sped it up.

234
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,680
You're mad because you are weak.

235
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,360
You cheated!

236
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,880
Watch carefully.

237
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,560
You play every day.

238
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,940
That's why I can't beat you.

239
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,680
Who's cheating now!

240
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,960
I can beat you too with a single hand.

241
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,270
Look, even just a few seconds

242
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,280
and my score's higher than yours.

243
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
Tong Nian,

244
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,240
why are you in love with such a jerk?

245
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,520
Don't say that.

246
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,240
Han Shangyan, enough.

247
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,560
Xiao'ai,

248
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,640
you're a match for anybody else except for Gun.

249
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,240
Even your dad can't beat him.

250
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,240
Well, can you let me have a try?

251
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,280
You can play?

252
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,200
Everyone knows how to play.

253
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,560
Don't look down on people.

254
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm not a gamer.

255
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,540
But I know simple games like this one.

256
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,200
Thank you.

257
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,320
Look.

258
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,430
Tong Nian. Come on! Come on! Come on!

259
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,000
Nice! Come on!

260
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,400
Come on, beat his score!

261
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,730
Han Shangyan, she's just as good.

262
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,160
Come on. Come on.

263
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,280
I could have gotten a higher score.

264
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,520
Missed it by just a bit!

265
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,160
Your score is already higher than mine.

266
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,880
Was it higher than yours?

267
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,800
Tong Nian!

268
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,760
We beat Gun!

269
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,360
I didn't know you're so talented.

270
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,800
Let's have a contest sometime.

271
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,000
When?

272
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,240
I'm free anytime.

273
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,640
Dude, you are awesome!

274
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,280
Tong Nian.

275
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,680
Honestly, nobody's ever beaten him.

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,520
You are an actual rival for him.

277
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,480
My hero, let's go get some rice cakes.

278
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,040
Come on.  -Let's go.

279
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,540
Tong Nian's parents raised her well.

280
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,960
This is how a girl should be,

281
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,280
pure and innocent,

282
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,840
and smiling all the time.

283
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,720
She's just a child.

284
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,480
Come on. Don't be so critical.

285
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,290
Haven't you considered giving it a try with her?

286
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,320
Are you envious of her?

287
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,080
Xiao'ai, wake up.

288
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,080
Time to go.

289
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,720
We're here.

290
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,920
You're so soft, how cute.

291
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,760
Get outta here!

292
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,040
-Bye.  -Bye.

293
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,320
Find me on WeChat. Let's hang out sometime.

294
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,480
You are too young.

295
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,650
I'm not gonna hang out with you!

296
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
Go do your homework, okay?

297
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,360
Go check the photo of you I posted!

298
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,520
Bye.

299
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,120
I just love these candid photos.

300
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
An idiot and a cutie.

301
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,040
Guess which one's the idiot?

302
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,000
You just paid the debt for my dad at the train station.

303
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,600
But you still need to pay back

304
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,750
the debt of his leading you to the championship.

305
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,980
Also, show my dad some respect.

306
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,080
Bye.

307
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,680
I'm so tired.

308
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,560
I'll send you back to uni.

309
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,570
But I haven't shown you the software.

310
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,680
I didn't get anything done today.

311
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,480
I haven't even shown you the software.

312
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,920
How long will it take?

313
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,040
I can finish it in about an hour.

314
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,070
I can go home by myself after that.

315
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,680
Okay.

316
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,760
What did you say?

317
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,680
Get rid of Shaofei?

318
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,480
Shaofei performed poorly in the personal global rankings.

319
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,560
That's the main reason.

320
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,280
In addition,

321
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,920
ever since he joined SP,

322
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,040
his national ranking has been very low.

323
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,200
It's natural the Headquarters want a change.

324
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,520
But I have one request.

325
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,440
Go ahead.

326
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,280
One chance.

327
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,960
We need to give him another chance.

328
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,880
Before the quarter finals,

329
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,270
we'll go to Sanya to attend an elite training camp.

330
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,380
This might be his last chance.

331
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,140
If he fails to rank among the national top ten,

332
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,360
he'll be transferred out of team one.

333
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,460
Hurry.  -Stop pushing me.

334
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,000
Guess who's here.

335
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,080
It's me.

336
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,400
Stop messing around.

337
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,310
Your baby girl is here.

338
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,400
You're back.

339
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,000
Dad.

340
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,960
Look what I got for you.

341
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,320
You brought me a gift?

342
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,000
Not a gift, but this.

343
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Han Shangyan?

344
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,720
Let me see.

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,480
Tell me,

346
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,670
who's the best and kindest person to you?

347
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,120
Of course it's you.

348
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,320
Take a look.

349
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,920
There's more.

350
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,240
Did you have fun?

351
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,920
Who bought you these gifts?

352
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,680
Mom did.

353
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,480
Amusement park?

354
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
This is Shangyan's nightmare.

355
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,120
Shangyan's only weakness is his fear of heights!

356
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,920
This one, look.

357
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,120
Remember this?

358
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,740
We forced Shangyan onto the roller coaster,

359
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,480
but he ran away

360
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,050
before we could stop him.

361
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,080
Look at his face.

362
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,800
This one, this one.

363
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,560
This one, this one.

364
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,080
There are three computers,

365
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,300
with Internet access, no password.

366
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
You can use any of them.

367
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,250
I'll come back in an hour.

368
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,760
Can I go with you?

369
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,760
I want to stay with you.

370
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,520
Can I do it with you?

371
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,640
Go with me?

372
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,600
Do you mean

373
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,990
you want to go to my room?

374
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Your room?

375
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,520
Here's my plan:

376
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,520
10 minutes to take a shower,

377
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,480
and 50 minutes to take a nap.

378
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,760
Still going?

379
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,600
No. I'll stay here, never mind.

380
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,920
You can take your time.

381
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,000
Are you sure?

382
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,800
Yes, thank you.

383
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,360
I'll stay right here.

384
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,240
Well, I've installed the software.

385
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,240
Take a look.

386
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,190
It's here.

387
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,680
I made one with color variations

388
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,060
to test APM.

389
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,290
The other is a piglet game.

390
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
I developed two.

391
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,130
So the team can play when they are bored.

392
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,400
They can have fun,

393
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,860
and improve their APM at the same time.

394
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,440
APM is integral to their training.

395
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,680
It's not just for fun.

396
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,800
I get it.

397
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,160
I've explored the software Wu Bai mentioned.

398
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,840
I developed several programs...

399
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,350
like the software he mentioned.

400
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,820
And selected these two since they're easier.

401
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,280
You can try it out.

402
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,400
1.002 seconds.

403
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,360
No doubt you are the worst.

404
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,240
Well, then, you try it out.

405
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
Come on, give it a try.

406
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,240
0.102 second.

407
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,040
Wow, so fast!

408
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,480
Thirsty?

409
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,400
I don't have any soft drinks, only beer.

410
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,160
Beer?

411
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280
Oh, kids don't drink bear.

412
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,440
I'll go get you some water.

413
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,360
I'm not a kid.

414
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,720
I can drink.

415
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,320
It's only 3% ABV anyway.

416
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,000
It's basically water.

417
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,840
Don't like it?

418
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,680
It's great.

419
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,960
It's so hot.

420
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,680
Hot?

421
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,680
The AC is on.

422
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,400
Are you...

423
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
Just feel it.

424
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,720
Isn't my face really hot?

425
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
What... what are you doing?

426
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,560
Do you like the software?

427
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,720
I...

428
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,800
Are you drunk?

429
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,680
Is that the only thing you want to say to me?

430
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,570
Don't you have anything else you want to say?

431
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,760
Like what?

432
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,130
Like... like...

433
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,290
do you like the software?

434
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,840
I picked you up in the heavy rain that day,

435
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,400
and I made that software for you.

436
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,470
Can't you just tell me that you like it?

437
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,280
Answer my question.

438
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,540
Can you keep your hands off me?

439
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,360
Okay.

440
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,560
I like your software.

441
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
I can keep my hands off you.

442
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,520
So can you stand a little bit farther from me?

443
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,160
Okay.

444
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,920
Then I'll keep my hands off you too.

445
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,320
Tong Nian.

446
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,230
I'll find more people to test

447
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,440
the software you made, okay?

448
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm leaving.

449
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,520
Sit and wait for me here.

450
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,000
Where are you going?

451
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,240
What do you want?

452
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,240
Boss,

453
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,190
we brought some sweets for your girlfriend.

454
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,280
Let me go first.

455
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,400
I'm dizzy.

456
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,520
I'll go get some food for you.

457
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,120
No, I don't want it.

458
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,480
Don't interrupt them.

459
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,120
Let's go.

460
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,560
I'll give you a gift.

461
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,960
Really?

462
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,160
Yes.

463
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,600
Let me go first.

464
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,400
So I can get you the gift.

465
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,480
Wait for me here.

466
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,800
Get in here.

467
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,680
Tong Nian.

468
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,640
Tong Nian.

469
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,320
Tong Nian.

470
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,360
You can't lay on my bed.

471
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,240
If someone sees this,

472
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,590
they'll get the wrong idea.

473
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,040
Go lay on the couch.

474
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,600
Lay on the couch.

475
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,840
Let me sleep for a moment.

476
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,840
Go lay on the couch.

477
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,000
Lego!

478
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,080
Don't touch it!

479
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,040
Don't touch it!

480
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,560
So mean.

481
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,200
Why won't you turn on the light?

482
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,160
Are you going to do something bad?

483
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,240
No!

484
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
I'm turning the light on.

485
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,280
You sit here and don't move.

486
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Don't go anywhere,

487
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,320
don't touch anything.

488
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:51,960
Are we clear?

489
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,800
Is this for me?

490
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,760
It's beautiful.

491
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Tong Nian, put that down.

492
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:54,970
Tong Nian.

493
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,920
Fine, it's for you.

494
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,040
Take it off, come on.

495
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,240
Thank you. I love it.

496
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,160
It's beautiful.

497
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,600
Thank you.

498
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,000
Tong Nian.

499
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,960
Tong Nian.

500
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,760
Tong Nian, wake up.

501
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,440
Where's your phone?

502
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,910
Call your friends to pick you up.

503
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,160
Why is the door open?

504
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,600
Go take a look.

505
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,240
Tong Nian.

506
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,800
-Boss.  -Boss.

507
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,280
Hello?

508
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,450
Come on. Be quiet.

509
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,880
Be quiet.

510
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,920
Where are they?

511
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,280
They were drinking!

512
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,320
What?

513
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,920
Don't you get it?

514
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,880
Drinking sets the mood.

515
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,160
It can help

516
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,160
to heat up their relationship.

517
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,040
So right now they are....

518
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,560
If they're not here, they must be in his room.

519
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,580
I didn't expect him to make

520
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,560
such quick moves.

521
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,640
What are you doing?

522
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,960
Come on.

523
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,320
Well, we just...

524
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,840
we just finished training, and came back to take a shower.

525
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,080
Yes yes.

526
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,680
Shower in the guest room?

527
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,720
We, we forgot something there.  -Right.

528
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,000
Right? We forgot something there.

529
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,680
Yes, yes.

530
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,000
Yes, yes.

531
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,880
Since you are not in a hurry,

532
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,880
tell me what you've been doing.

533
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,520
Seriously?

534
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,240
Grunt, you go first.

535
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,040
Me?

536
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,180
Boss, I've been doing a lot of reading.

537
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,960
Grunt, do you have a girlfriend or not?

538
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,760
Listen, your personal life is too complicated.

539
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,670
The leader is keeping a close eye on you.

540
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Watch out there.

541
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,240
Don't let the public know.

542
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,880
Understand?

543
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,480
Okay.

544
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,560
I get it, boss.

545
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,010
97, when will you find a girlfriend?

546
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,650
Your mom has called me about it so many times.

547
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,040
If you don't find a girlfriend soon,

548
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,240
she'll bring girls here and force you on blind dates.

549
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:06,960
But, boss,

550
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,360
you said we can't have relationships here.

551
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,720
When did that rule change?

552
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,600
I said, don't make it public,

553
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,120
but I never said no relationships.

554
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,480
Just tell me when.

555
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,960
But, boss, how should I know?

556
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,000
I only go home once a year.

557
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,440
I stay in the Club all year around.

558
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,200
Girlfriends...

559
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,760
there are never even any girls here at all!

560
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,160
Oh, there are some.

561
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,250
One's mom,

562
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,480
the housekeeper, Mrs. Zhou,

563
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
and our married team leader.

564
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,840
What can I do?

565
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,160
Stop making excuses. Set a goal.

566
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,180
Boss, so can I also find a...

567
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,320
Well...

568
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,040
No, you are just a kid.

569
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,230
Why do I have a different set of rules?

570
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,600
I'm not a kid.

571
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,480
I'm not young at all.

572
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,800
Don't worry about me, boss.

573
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,440
My mom is looking for girls for me.

574
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,840
Boss, is there something...

575
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,000
between you and Tong Nian?

576
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,440
Why are you suddenly talking about relationships?

577
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,360
Have you, well...  -None of your business.

578
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,080
Aren't you going to take a shower?

579
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,280
Get to it!

580
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,720
Yes, yes. Shower.

581
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,320
Bye, boss.

582
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,320
The door is broken.

583
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,280
Come on, come on.

584
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,400
Oh yes, boss.

585
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,800
Don't drink too much.

586
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,440
Okay we're getting inside.  -It's okay.

587
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,800
So embarrassing.

588
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,760
Tong Nian.

589
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,000
I've got your backpack.

590
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,800
Where's your phone?

591
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,280
= Strategic Analysis of Top Teams =

592
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,840
Awesome.

593
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,640
Tong Nian.

594
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,120
What's your password?

595
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,200
Call your friend.

596
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,480
How was it?

597
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,560
How was your day with Gun today?

598
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,120
Did you make any progress?

599
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,160
Did you kiss each other?

600
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,810
Hello, this is Han Shangyan.

601
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,120
Who?

602
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,480
Who is it?

603
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,840
