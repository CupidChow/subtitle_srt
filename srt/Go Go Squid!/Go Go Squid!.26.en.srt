How's it going?

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,120
Tong Nian.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,800
How was the operation?

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,320
It went well.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,200
Thanks to your dad.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,080
The operation took way less time than I expected.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,960
That's good.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,120
Tong Nian.

35
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,040
You didn't have to come down here.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,160
Of course I did!

37
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,560
Your mom had surgery today,

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,960
I had to come

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,370
and see if there's anything I can do to help.

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,230
Thank you.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,540
Tong Nian.

42
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,600
Let's talk over there.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,400
-Sit down and then talk.  -Okay.

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,900
Come on.

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,620
Okay.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
Excuse me, could you tell me

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,470
which floor the I.C.U for patients who had liver surgery is on?

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,360
The third floor.

49
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,680
Okay, thank you.

50
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,760
It's okay, I'll do it myself.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,600
All right.

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,160
Thank you.

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,760
How's your mom? Is she all right?

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,760
She's all right.

55
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,680
Your dad said it went well.

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,480
But tonight I'm going to stay outside the ward all night.

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,640
Your mom had her operation today,

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,160
so it is good for you to stay here.

59
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,880
Good on you.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,120
Well, it would be better

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,040
if you stayed with me tonight.

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,360
I'm afraid I can't

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,240
stay with you all night.

64
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,200
Are you hungry?

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,120
I bet you're hungry, right?

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,420
Then, would you like to have dinner with me?

67
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,960
Sorry, I had dinner before I got here.

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,640
That's all right.

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,840
You're hungry?

70
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,080
If you're hungry,

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,020
we can get something to eat.

72
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,020
No.

73
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,400
Because you need to stay here all night.

74
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,360
I'm not hungry.

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,280
I'm not hungry.

76
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,160
Let's have something to drink, okay?

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,320
Rest a bit.

78
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,960
Okay.

79
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,280
Tong Nian, I...

80
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,750
Are you worried about your mom?

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,160
Don't worry.

82
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,620
Your mother is just a little older,

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
so she has to stay here

84
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,480
a half day longer than most other patients.

85
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,800
My dad is on call tonight,

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
so don't worry.

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
It's gonna be fine.

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,240
Thank you.

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,860
Well...

90
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,400
Actually, I...

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,280
Actually, I...

92
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,320
If...

93
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,080
Weren't you going to get something to drink?

94
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,960
What are you doing here?

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
Hello, Tong Nian's brother.

96
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,710
I'm not her brother.

97
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,270
He's not my brother.

98
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,680
What should I call him?

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,480
Our families are

100
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,480
very close.

101
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,360
Hello, Tong Nian's Uncle.

102
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,960
You were going to eat something, weren't you?

103
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
How did you know that?

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,200
You heard?

105
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,880
I was just passing by,

106
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,040
and I overheard you speaking.

107
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,420
Come on.

108
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,040
Don't waste too much time.

109
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,280
Thank you, Uncle.

110
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,120
Tong Nian, let's go.

111
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Let's get something to...

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't remember saying that

113
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,800
I wasn't going with you.

114
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,920
Alright, let's all go.

115
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,940
Let's go.

116
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,520
Be careful.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Let's sit here.

118
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,080
Okay.

119
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,800
-Here, be careful.  -Thank you.

120
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
-Alright, please sit.  -Thank you.

121
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,880
Thank you.

122
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,520
I'll sit opposite you.

123
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,040
Okay.

124
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,280
Waiter!

125
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,840
This is so awkward.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,120
What is he thinking?

127
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,880
-Here you are.  -Thank you.

128
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,960
Thank you.

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm so thirsty.

130
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,360
You're welcome.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
Hello, what can I get you?

132
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,760
Thank you.

133
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,480
Tong Nian,

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,280
you like strawberries, right?

135
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,790
Yeah.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
Then, two strawberry tarts.

137
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,120
Okay, thank you.

138
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,520
It's on me.

139
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,320
I'd like Australian beef curry fried rice,

140
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,520
Spaghetti Bolognese,

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,600
a snack platter,

142
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,920
and chicken wings.

143
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,780
And a red velvet cake for dessert.

144
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,480
Okay.

145
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,640
Thank you.

146
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,260
I have to find a way to end this date quickly.

147
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,400
You're not going to get rid of me.

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
Didn't you say that

149
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,920
you were going back to the club?

150
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,320
I just remembered

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,440
that a friend of mine is hospitalized

152
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,640
and I'll go see him later.

153
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,840
Who? Which department?

154
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,760
Yeah, who?

155
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,120
Zheng Hui, my dad said

156
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,520
someone has to be outside the I.C.U. at all times.

157
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,670
You've been here a long time.

158
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,760
It's dangerous to leave your mother alone there.

159
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,140
I think you should back to the hospital now.

160
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,280
You need to stay there

161
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
in case something happens with your mother.

162
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,480
Go.

163
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,680
Come on, go back to the hospital.

164
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,800
Call me if you need my help.

165
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,080
But...

166
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,880
Oh, this,

167
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,840
I'll pack it up,

168
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
and bring it to you later.

169
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,920
Goodbye!

170
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,680
Wait.

171
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,280
Don't forget to pay the bill.

172
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,760
Just kidding!

173
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,560
I'll pay.

174
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,440
You should go.

175
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,920
Thank you.

176
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,080
Zheng Hui is from a single-parent family,

177
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,440
and grew up without a dad.

178
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,880
It's awful, right?

179
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
But he's a Ph.D. now,

180
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,000
pretty cool, right?

181
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,280
What do you want to hear from me?

182
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,280
My parents died when I was very young,

183
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,920
and my stepmother raised me.

184
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,170
I've heard this story before.

185
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,300
I went back to Norway to report on my work

186
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,340
and attend my stepmother's wedding.

187
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,080
It's just Grandpa and me at home.

188
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,230
Well, that's good right?

189
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,720
It's a good thing

190
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,230
for your stepmother to remarry.

191
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,020
She gets another chance to be happy.

192
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,520
It's a good thing.

193
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,600
Ten years ago,

194
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,880
I travelled all the way back to China,

195
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,460
but I didn't think I'd live in a basement with Solo.

196
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,200
Without money and an apartment,

197
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,620
we worked hard and started a club.

198
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,440
We were shooting for the stars,

199
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,080
but?

200
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,240
But the club disbanded.

201
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
You ask me

202
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,120
if he has an awful life?

203
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,160
What about my life?

204
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,440
It's okay.

205
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,560
Don't be sad.

206
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,840
You have K&K,

207
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,680
and I'm here for you.

208
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,240
I'll always be here for you.

209
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,560
She's so gullible.

210
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,520
Why are you smiling?

211
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
I'm just pretending to smile.

212
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
Don't cry.

213
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,240
Eat.

214
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,600
Here, you eat.

215
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,360
You ordered it all.

216
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,682
I never thought

217
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:49,440
I'd see you take the initiative to clean.

218
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,360
Let me do it.

219
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Thank you.

220
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,680
For what?

221
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,640
I'm the one who should say thank you.

222
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,160
No, you don't have to.

223
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,360
Anyway, you're my idol,

224
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm willing to help you.

225
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,500
Here you are.

226
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,340
It's dirty.

227
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
Thank you, idol.

228
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
May I offer you a piece of advice?

229
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,990
Could you stop calling me "idol"?

230
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,760
We know each other so well.

231
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,800
But I think it's fun.

232
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
You can call me Mi Shaofei or Xiaomi.

233
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,720
What, you don't like my name?

234
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
I think it sounds as good as Han Shangyan.

235
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,330
It should be much better than Wang Hao.

236
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,280
Yeah.

237
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,360
Right.

238
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,080
Good.

239
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,870
I think it's a pretty name.

240
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,040
I thought you left,

241
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,360
what are you doing here all of a sudden?

242
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,560
Actually, I want to ask you,

243
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,080
a few days ago,

244
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,040
I saw you shared something on your Moments.

245
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
I was thinking...

246
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,880
I didn't share it.

247
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,040
Yaya did that.

248
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,870
I deleted it as soon as I found out.

249
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,520
But you still saw it.

250
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,880
Well, about those words...

251
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,420
I... I didn't mean it like that.

252
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,000
I...

253
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
That coat means a lot to me.

254
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,480
I couldn't say that.

255
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,060
Oh.

256
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,280
It's a nice night tonight,

257
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,400
some wind in our faces,

258
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,800
walking and talking.

259
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,320
It's very comfortable.

260
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,680
It seems like we can only really

261
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
have quality time like this.

262
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,280
I hope if we can get out more

263
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
in the future,

264
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,720
if we get a chance.

265
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,920
Actually,

266
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,600
I've been pretty sad

267
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,720
these past few days.

268
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,360
As soon as I spoke up,

269
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,520
I regretted it.

270
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,600
I think maybe you...

271
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,560
Why are you smiling?

272
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,840
I know you're sad.

273
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,800
You're sad because of me,

274
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,460
right?

275
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,800
Well, I'm very happy now.

276
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,760
What're you doing?

277
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,200
What are you doing?

278
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,760
Sun Yaya!

279
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,200
What's up, idol?

280
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,880
What did you just call me?

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,160
Xiaomi.

282
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,400
It's getting late.

283
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,160
I'll take you to the subway, okay?

284
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,500
Go.

285
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,200
Why are you looking at me?

286
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,360
What are you smiling about?

287
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,640
I... I'm watching a video.

288
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,640
It's funny.

289
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,360
You weren't watching anything.

290
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,660
You were smiling like a blossoming flower.

291
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,200
Tell me,

292
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,880
who took you back to the dorm today?

293
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
You were mistaken.

294
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,240
It was the campus police.

295
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,640
I didn't say who it was,

296
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,920
but you said I was mistaken.

297
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,240
The campus police?

298
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
If the campus police had sent you back,

299
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,970
why would you be so giddy?

300
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,040
Really?

301
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,560
Look, look, you're lying to me!

302
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,160
Who was it?

303
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,660
Tell me!

304
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,200
I...

305
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,280
How dare you question me?

306
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,830
Did you make any progress today?

307
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,680
I haven't made any progress.

308
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,480
Who would I have to make progress with?

309
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,880
No?

310
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,420
No.

311
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,360
Does it mean that

312
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,480
Zheng Hui confessed his love to you

313
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,720
when you went to the hospital today?

314
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,120
And then you found out Zheng Hui is your Mr. Right?

315
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,040
Zheng Hui? No way!

316
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,640
I'd never be with Zheng Hui!

317
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,300
Yeah, okay.

318
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,880
Then it's Han Shangyan, right?

319
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,890
I don't understand what you're saying.

320
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,640
I refuse to answer.

321
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,400
Look at yourself,

322
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,400
I'm gonna take a picture of you.

323
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,440
Look over here Tong Nian!

324
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,380
No!  -Come on, let everyone see you.

325
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,140
Just take a selfie alone and send it to Mi Shaofei.

326
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,760
No, no!

327
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
I have to take a picture of you.

328
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,390
Come on.

329
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,440
Look, look here!

330
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,480
I hate you!

331
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
Have you ever seen Tong Nian like this?

332
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,280
So ugly.

333
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,680
Mrs. Zhou, thank you

334
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,640
for taking such good care of him.

335
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
He's very docile.

336
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,960
Hey, hey, hey,

337
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,120
this cat is so annoying.

338
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,930
He keeps meowing all the time.

339
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,840
Don't worry.

340
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,680
I'll take it to K&K tonight.

341
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,400
You can't even take care yourself,

342
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
and now you have a cat.

343
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,580
I bet you won't be able to take care of this cat.

344
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
I had a cat.

345
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,960
Come on, he's very careful.

346
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,640
Do you want to hold it?

347
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,040
No, no, no, don't come any closer.

348
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,200
No, don't come over here!

349
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,020
Hold it.

350
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,600
Stay away from me!

351
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,880
Grandpa.

352
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,040
Grandpa.

353
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,840
Why are you so happy today?

354
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,440
Did you win something?

355
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,360
Almost, we made it to the semifinals.

356
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,200
Give me the cat.

357
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,040
Well,

358
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,160
your efforts have not been in vain.

359
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,320
Grandpa,

360
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,280
are you bored of listening

361
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,040
to these Peking Opera DVDs?

362
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,230
I'll go out and get you some new ones later.

363
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,480
Why are you looking at me like that?

364
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,080
You don't sound like yourself.

365
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,880
It's rare for you to be so good to me.

366
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,320
Oh,

367
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,050
I remember the camera on your phone broke, right?

368
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,320
Check out these phones.

369
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,280
This one's new,

370
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,440
use it for the time being.

371
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,780
Hey, hey,

372
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,960
is your club losing money

373
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,080
and you need to borrow money from me?

374
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,680
Don't worry.

375
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,480
Everything's going just fine.

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,920
Is there anything else you want?

377
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,640
Make a list.

378
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,050
I'll buy it for you one by one.

379
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,040
The Han family

380
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,680
only has you and me.

381
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,840
We have to take care of each other.

382
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,520
Let me know what you need.

383
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,920
Kitty, let's go back to K&K.

384
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,440
What's wrong with him?

385
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,200
Go in, let's go back to K&K.

386
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,840
If you agree,

387
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,100
I'm going to handle the process

388
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:02,410
to send Xiao'ai abroad.

389
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
Give me a few more days.

390
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,760
I want to talk to Xiao'ai first.

391
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,520
Thank you, Solo.

392
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
You're right.

393
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,730
It's better for a girl to live with her mother.

394
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,240
I'm a man, it's inconvenient for me

395
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,280
to talk with her about certain things.

396
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm sure you and Nan Wei

397
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,620
will provide her with the best education possible.

398
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,600
Living with your family

399
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,480
is better for her.

400
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,720
Alright, then I'll wait for your answer.

401
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,160
Will Han Shangyan be able to

402
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,650
handle things alone once you're gone?

403
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,480
You know him.

404
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,280
There's nothing he can't handle.

405
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,980
He has his own way of managing those kids,

406
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,200
and it's very effective.

407
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,020
He is convincing with his strength.

408
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,760
And so are you.

409
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,960
You weren't born into this position,

410
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,200
you got it by sheer force of will.

411
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,800
Solo.

412
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,600
All those years, instead of helping you,

413
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,720
I hurt you.

414
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
I hope you get better and better,

415
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,440
every single day.

416
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,560
Xiao' ai is my daughter,

417
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,520
and she is yours as well.

418
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,640
Boss, after Mi Shaofei retired,

419
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,480
SP found someone even better to fill his position.

420
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,560
Somebody named Fu Ying.

421
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,720
Do you know him?

422
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,880
He's a good player,

423
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,760
he's the captain of SP team two.

424
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,640
Technically,

425
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,080
he is as good as Grunt.

426
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,320
If he's so good,

427
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,800
why is he on the secondary team?

428
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,360
Over the past few years,

429
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,340
Solo has done a great job running team SP.

430
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,520
They want to train two teams

431
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,160
that can compete with each other.

432
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,040
That way

433
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,050
they can get two medals in one championship.

434
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,640
Two?

435
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,360
Give me my cat.

436
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
Their goal is

437
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,630
to win both gold and bronze medals.

438
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,160
If we aren't doing well,

439
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,040
they want to get both the gold and the silver

440
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,440
and kick us out.

441
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,360
That's ambitious.

442
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,360
97,

443
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,920
could I have a word with your boss?

444
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,400
Sure.

445
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,570
There's something I have to tell you.

446
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,480
I'm going to take Xiao'ai abroad.

447
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,840
You're taking his daughter?

448
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,240
She's my daughter, too.

449
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,800
Actually,

450
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
you don't have to tell me about this.

451
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,480
When we returned home

452
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,840
to set up the China branch,

453
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,120
I told you that

454
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,200
your business with Solo, is yours alone, not mine.

455
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,160
Xiao'ai.

456
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,720
Xiao'ai.

457
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
What are you doing?

458
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,320
Can you hear me?

459
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,920
Wait a minute. I'm changing.

460
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,480
What's taking so long to change clothes?

461
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,080
I was knocking forever before you opened the door.

462
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,200
I was just applying some medicine

463
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,440
and didn't have my hearing aid in.

464
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,760
Don't lock the door

465
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,960
if you aren't going to wear your hearing aids.

466
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
It's fine.

467
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,110
It's not like we live in a bungalow anymore.

468
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,040
And you know,

469
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
no one uses gas anymore,

470
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,920
I won't die of carbon monoxide poisoning.

471
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,920
Dad, you care too much about me.

472
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,230
Of course, I'm your dad.

473
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,000
Is it still itchy?

474
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,720
Very itchy.

475
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,800
Grandma's not home

476
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,480
and no one can help me to apply medicine.

477
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,320
Tell me!

478
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,720
Did you pass the hives onto me?

479
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,280
It's not my fault.

480
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,880
It's your mother's fault.

481
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,400
Of course it is.

482
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,550
She couldn't pass on anything good to me.

483
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,640
Xiao'ai,

484
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
she's your mother,

485
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,160
you can't say that.

486
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,920
She gave birth to me, but she didn't raise me.

487
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,200
I call her mom

488
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,360
to make you feel better.

489
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,360
Xiao'ai.

490
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,880
We need to talk about something.

491
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,240
Besides going to live with my mother,

492
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
we can talk about anything you want.

493
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,840
You really are my daughter.

494
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,480
So smart.

495
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,400
Are you really gonna send me away?

496
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,760
Dad.

497
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,760
She abandoned you to go abroad,

498
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,680
so I hated her.

499
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,200
Silly girl.

500
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,720
Your mother and I ended it peacefully.

501
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,840
No, you're lying.

502
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,640
When have I ever lied to you?

503
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,960
That's impossible.

504
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,320
I've seen your divorce certificate.

505
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,720
Grandma showed it to me.

506
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,880
And grandma said,

507
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,960
you got married,

508
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,160
then you got divorced after I was born,

509
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,800
and then she went abroad.

510
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,280
She abandoned you.

511
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,040
Because you were poor,

512
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,040
she abandoned you and me.

513
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,200
Now that I've grown up,

514
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,560
she wants me to live with her.

515
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,600
What a bad woman.

516
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,640
Xiao'ai,

517
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,400
you misunderstand your mother.

518
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,200
When you grow up,

519
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,360
I'll explain it to you.

520
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,560
I want you, I don't want her!

521
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,320
Xiao'ai.

522
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,840
Xiao'ai.

523
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,240
Open the door, Xiao'ai.

524
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,440
Didn't we have an agreement on this already?

525
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,120
Some ground rules.

526
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,960
Don't lock the door just because we are fighting.

527
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,800
Open the door, Xiao'ai.

528
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,120
Open the door!

529
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
I can't hear you

530
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,240
without my hearing aids.

531
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,720
Mom, do you have a minute?

532
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,320
There's something I need your help with.

533
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,200
I'm going to the club tonight,

534
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,710
but I don't feel comfortable leaving Xiao'ai alone at home.

535
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,440
Can you come and stay with her?

536
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,040
Okay.

537
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,160
I'll wait until you get here.

538
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,200
What's wrong with your throat?

539
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,920
I don't know,

540
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,400
maybe because it's getting cold.  -Does it hurt?

541
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,920
No, it's just itchy.

542
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,480
What is she doing here?

543
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,040
Why are you here?

544
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,240
I ran away from home.

545
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,418
I'm impressed that

546
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:12,400
you knew the way straight to the dorm.

547
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,880
You know who my dad is?

548
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,320
Yeah, your dad is Solo.

549
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,360
You're proud of your dad.

550
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,280
You're so great!

551
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,360
You're so great!

552
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,680
But, seriously,

553
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
why did you run away again?

554
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,600
What happened?

555
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,400
I feel like my dad hasn't loved me as much

556
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,680
since my mom came back.

557
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,560
What should I do?

558
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,360
Let's talk inside.

559
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:33,960
Come inside.

560
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,800
Your suitcase.

561
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,520
You don't want it, do you?

562
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
I'll bring it in for you.

563
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,880
She won't come out.

564
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,600
I'm sorry she's giving you trouble again.

565
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,360
No.

566
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,480
It's no trouble.

567
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,350
Actually, Yaya and I both like her very much.

568
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,840
She's welcome to hang out with us.

569
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,440
But she often runs away from home.

570
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,360
If she went somewhere else,

571
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,440
instead of talking it through with us,

572
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,120
who knows what would happen.

573
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,000
She'll be okay.

574
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,600
How do you know it will be okay?

575
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,080
I know my daughter.

576
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,440
She's just a little moody,

577
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,200
but she knows how to protect herself.

578
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,440
She came to you

579
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,040
to teach me a lesson.

580
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,920
Tong Nian, this is a girls' dormitory,

581
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,960
and it's not okay for us to go in.

582
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,320
Could you get her to come out here?

583
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,520
I'll wait for her at the door.

584
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,720
I want to talk to her.

585
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,690
Well, this building is for graduates,

586
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
so it's not that strict.

587
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,040
How about I'll ask them if you can go in?

588
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,040
Give me a minute.

589
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,760
Ma'am,

590
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,160
they're my family,

591
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,000
and they want to come in and talk about something.

592
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,680
Half an hour.

593
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,320
They'll be out of here in half an hour, okay?

594
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,080
Okay.

595
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,560
Just pay attention to the time.

596
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,440
Thank you.

597
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,600
Be quiet.

598
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,680
I'm sorry.

599
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,920
Give me three minutes.

600
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,120
I'll be right there.

601
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,440
Come on, come on.

602
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Pack up your things.

603
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,280
They're at the door!

604
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,480
What? They're here?

605
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,680
Chunxuan, your underwear.

606
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,240
This, this, this.

607
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,120
Stop laughing.

608
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,400
It's all your fault, you know?

609
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,680
Yaya, there are crumbs everywhere.

610
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

611
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,440
Is it okay?

612
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,240
That's it, right?

613
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,360
I'll let them in.

614
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,120
Okay, okay.

615
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,960
All right, come in.

616
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,400
Yaya, Chunxuan,

617
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,720
don't you have something to go do?

618
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,160
Yeah, yeah.

619
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,960
Go, go, go.

620
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,720
Xiao'ai.

621
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,200
I've been thinking about this the whole way here.

622
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,400
You are very mistaken

623
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,560
about me and your mother,

624
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,060
so I need to make it clear to you here and now.

625
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
I hope they can work things out this time,

626
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,120
right?

627
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,680
Solo used to be the captain,

628
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,240
and now he is in charge of an entire club.

629
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,880
He knows how to deal with people.

630
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,800
Don't worry.

631
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,680
If he's the best at dealing with people,

632
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,200
why didn't he succeed with you?

633
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,010
It must be so difficult to raise a child, right?

634
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,160
After you give birth to a child,

635
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,080
you have to raise him and be responsible for him,

636
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,280
and educate him.

637
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,200
Anyway,

638
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,760
if I have children in the future,

639
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,750
I will make sure that I am a very competent mother.

640
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,760
I know.

641
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,680
You know what?

642
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,160
What does it have to do with you?

643
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,920
Don't talk about it!

644
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,040
I don't want to hear it.

645
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,200
Listen to me, Xiao'ai.

646
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,040
Xiao'ai, listen to me.

647
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,440
You don't want to hear what I'm saying.

648
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,200
You didn't want me from the very beginning!

649
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,880
You didn't even know I was born.

650
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,480
If you didn't want me,

651
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,470
why did you promise my mom that you would raise me?

652
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,880
Just throw me in an orphanage.

653
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,360
Xiao'ai,

654
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,920
it's not what you think.

655
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,120
I was hesitant at first.

656
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,240
But, listen to me,

657
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,640
I never wanted to abandon you.

658
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,560
Never.

659
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,800
I... I...

660
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,320
I don't believe you!

661
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
Mom didn't want me when I was born.

662
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,800
You never thought I would exist.

663
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,760
You're both the same!

664
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,440
Neither of you wanted me.

665
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,080
You both wish you didn't have me.

666
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,560
If I wasn't born,

667
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,960
your good life wouldn't have been ruined!

668
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,960
Xiao'ai,

669
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,360
in my life,

670
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,600
all the pains and failures were caused

671
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,640
by my own poor choices.

672
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
I regret all of them.

673
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,760
But I've never regretted having you,

674
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,440
my daughter.

675
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,320
Because of you,

676
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,070
I learned how to cherish life.

677
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,920
Watching you

678
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,720
grow from a child

679
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,000
to a big girl.

680
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,630
All the pains and pleasures I went through with you,

681
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,440
you know,

682
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,920
they're the best memories

683
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,760
of my life.

684
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,000
Are you looking for a hearing aid?

685
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,240
I have it.

686
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,760
But she broke it.

687
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Keep an eye on her for me.

688
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,430
I'll be back as soon as I fix it.

689
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,910
Solo,

690
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,800
let her stay with me

691
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,040
for a couple days.

692
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,240
When she calms down,

693
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,280
you can pick her up

694
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,320
and talk to her.

695
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,080
What do you think?

696
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,830
Okay.

697
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,350
Well, here's some money...

698
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,720
No, no.

699
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,830
She doesn't need money with me.

700
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,080
I have a meal card to get dinner.

701
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,640
You need money for your card.

702
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,140
Here you are.

703
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,040
Take it back.

704
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,800
We can afford a few meals.

705
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:56,960
All right.

706
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,040
I'll keep my phone on,

707
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,880
if you have any problems,

708
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,320
you can call me at any time.

709
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,520
Okay.

710
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,600
Xiao'ai.

711
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,840
Xiao'ai, it's me.

712
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,040
Don't cry.

713
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,760
They're gone.

714
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,640
Here, look at me.

715
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,520
Look, I know

716
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,210
you're not mad at your dad,

717
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,030
and that you love him very much, right?

718
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,520
Don't cry.

719
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,240
It's okay.

720
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,920
Don't cry, Xiao'ai.

721
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:26,360
♪ I still can't pretend like I don't care ♪

722
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:32,270
♪ The self that doesn't care about you ♪

723
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,360
Mom didn't want me when I was born.

724
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,210
You never thought I would exist!

725
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,120
You're both the same.

726
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,920
Neither of you wanted me.

727
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,480
You both wish you didn't have me.

728
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,000
If I wasn't born,

729
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,350
your good life wouldn't have been ruined!

730
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,360
Thank you for your help.

731
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,520
She's the one who's helping you,

732
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,880
so you should thank her, not me.

733
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,320
I wasn't feeling right.

734
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,760
After saying thank you,

735
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,520
I feel better.

736
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,920
If you're so hard pressed to leave Xiao'ai,

737
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,440
why do you have to be a crowd-pleaser?

738
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,560
You used to be,

739
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,000
and you still are.

740
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,610
Sometimes you should listen to your daughter.

741
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,720
I'm not a crowd-pleaser.

742
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,320
After all, she's a girl.

743
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,960
It's better to live with her mother.

744
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,200
I can't take care of my family all year-round,

745
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
and I'm sorry for her.

746
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,960
I didn't take good care of her.

747
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,600
She had hives when she was little,

748
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,000
and I would help her apply the medicine.

749
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,840
But now, I can't even do that.

750
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,800
Mom is different.

751
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,640
Her mom can help her.

752
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,280
When she gets a little older,

753
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,770
there will be a lot of things that I can't do as her father.

754
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,200
Shangyan,

755
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,280
to tell you the truth,

756
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
I don't know what she thinks at all.

757
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,560
You don't have kids,

758
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,320
so I don't know if you can understand.

759
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,600
Sometimes I look at her

760
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,800
and I'm satisfied.

761
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,920
But sometimes,

762
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,120
I think I'm a loser.

763
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,960
Her hearing aid is broken,

764
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,600
she can't hear anything now.

765
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,960
Solo didn't get her to come around?

766
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,360
She's such a big fan of her dad,

767
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,720
and even he couldn't convince her,

768
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,680
I don't think there's anything we can do.

769
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,160
I don't know.

770
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,000
Hello?

771
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,000
Bring Xiao'ai outside.

772
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,840
Now?

773
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
It's Han Shangyan.

774
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,440
He asked me to bring her outside.

775
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,680
What does he want to do?

776
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,480
He didn't say.

777
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,640
You didn't ask him?

778
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,920
No.

779
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,420
I need to find a way to get her to come out with me.

780
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,080
I know you're angry,

781
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,360
but I'm hungry,

782
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,560
I bet you must be hungry, too.

783
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,160
Let's go get dinner.

784
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,080
I tricked her.

785
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,400
But even though she's here,

786
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,000
maybe you can't convince her to go with you.

787
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,920
Your parents and I are old friends.

788
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,080
If you want to know their story,

789
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,000
come with me to buy a new hearing aid.

790
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,600
Dummy.

791
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,440
Hearing aids are custom-made,

792
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,720
you can't just go and buy one.

793
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,560
I bet you have a spare hearing aid.

794
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,880
How do you know that?

795
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,760
If you want to know their story,

796
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,880
put on your hearing aid.

797
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,520
It's in my bag.

798
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,640
Go get her bag.

799
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,520
I'll keep an eye on her.

800
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,920
Don't be too hard on her.

801
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,920
Xiao'ai,

802
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,840
I'll go get your hearing aid.

803
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,840
