Dad!

33
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,050
If I knew you were here,

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,880
I wouldn't have come.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,480
What're you talking about?

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,200
This place

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,320
hasn't changed in years.

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,890
Get back early.

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,960
You're not coming in with me?

40
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,280
It's weird if I go in alone!

41
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,850
Don't forget

42
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,090
how Wang Hao's mom

43
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,320
took of you all those years.

44
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,640
You've been back for so long,

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,600
you should pay her a visit.

46
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,440
Get out of the car.

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,440
You don't understand.

48
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,040
Hurry up.

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,280
Let's go!

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,680
Look at you.

51
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,210
Get out of the car!

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,450
I'm going to scream your name.

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,610
Do you want everyone

54
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,880
to know you're here?

55
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,880
Fine.

56
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,930
Han Shang...

57
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,680
Fine, fine.

58
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,840
Hurry up, get out.

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,020
Now that Wang Hao is the boss of China's CTF,

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,880
why doesn't he move into a villa?

61
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,920
You've really done your research.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,240
Done my research?

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,840
All his info is on the SP website.

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,680
Come here.

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,520
Coming!

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,240
Be energetic.

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
They're coming.

68
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,880
Mrs. Wang.

69
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,920
Don't you recognize me?

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,560
You're...

71
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,120
Shangyan's mom.

72
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
Of course I know you.

73
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,440
It's been over ten years

74
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,280
and you haven't changed a bit!

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,200
Still so beautiful.

76
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
How could I not recognize you?

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
You're so kind.

78
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm much older.

79
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,400
Come in.

80
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,760
Why stand there, come in!

81
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,070
Don't be shy.

82
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,280
Xiao'ai, come down.

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,960
See who's here.

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,600
Oh my god, it's him!

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,360
You monster,

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,800
why are you in our house?

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,760
What're you talking about?

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
Say hi to Mrs. Han.

89
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,680
Hi, Mrs. Han.

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,760
This is?

91
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,120
Wang Hao's daughter.

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,000
She's all grown up!

93
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,800
What a pretty girl!

94
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,120
Mrs. Han, you're beautiful, too.

95
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Such a sweet girl.

96
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,250
Sai hi to Mr. Han.

97
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,320
Monster.

98
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,000
It's Mr. Han.

99
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,720
Hello Mr. Han.

100
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,720
Go and get us two glasses of water.

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
Please sit down.

102
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,240
So cute.

103
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,240
Shangyan, have a seat.

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,180
OK.

105
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,360
Shangyan,

106
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,880
you've been back so long

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,520
and you never came to see me!

108
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm sorry, I couldn't find the time.

109
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,400
I already scolded him for it.

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,420
I told him you took care of him

111
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,500
for so many years,

112
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,580
how could he not come visit you

113
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,800
after moving back?

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,720
Mrs. Han.

115
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,530
Here's your tea.

116
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
OK OK, thank you.

117
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,400
Oh right! Your red packet.

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,330
Thank you, Mrs. Han.

119
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:42,960
There's no need.

120
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,200
Take it.

121
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,480
This is the first time I met Xiao'ai,

122
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,960
I must give her a gift.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
I heard that

124
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,320
Wang Hao has achieved many great things

125
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,260
in his career.

126
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,040
No.

127
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,240
He's so successful,

128
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
why doesn't he move into a villa?

129
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,240
He just likes this place.

130
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,760
But he will marry again anyway.

131
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,780
He should get a new house for his new marriage.

132
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,160
My dad won't get married again.

133
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,760
Why?

134
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,280
Wang Hao is still very young.

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,720
Why won't he get married again?

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,680
Let's not talk about him.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
How's Shangyan doing now?

138
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,720
My son has...

139
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,960
A child?

140
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,440
No, no.

141
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,920
A girlfriend.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,080
He's getting married soon.

143
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,920
Great.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
You're gonna marry Tong Nian?

145
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,840
Xiao'ai, you won't be calling her that.

146
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,080
I'm Mrs. Han.

147
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,940
And Tong Nian will be Mrs. Han too.

148
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,800
Tong Nian is not even ten years older than me.

149
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,280
Why will she be Mrs. Han so soon?

150
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,440
Go, do your homework.

151
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,800
Go.

152
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,920
Hurry up, get to it!

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
Butt out!

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,800
Such a little brat.

155
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,840
When you first came to our home,

156
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
you weren't even 20.

157
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,720
Now look at you, so successful!

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
How time flies.

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,440
That's true.

160
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
Are you in good health?

161
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,840
Doing fine!

162
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,480
Really?

163
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,720
That's great.

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,690
Wang Hao is really successful now.  -Happy New Year!

165
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,760
Let's have a whole new start in Shanghai.

166
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,040
Happy New Year!

167
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,680
Happy New Year!

168
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,100
Cheers.

169
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,700
Here we go.

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,940
Shangyan is also very successful now.

171
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,290
Yes, he has done a fantastic job.

172
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,560
The two of them are good brothers.

173
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,920
They've both done so well.

174
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,760
Yes, both so well.

175
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,700
What's this?

176
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
Cold medicine.

177
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
All of you

178
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
must take care of yourselves.

179
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,000
Cap,

180
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,880
where's our medicine then?

181
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,160
You gave her the last box.

182
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
Buy one yourself.

183
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,760
Why look at me like that?

184
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,280
Dad, Mr. Han is here.

185
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,120
Dad, you're back.

186
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,760
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

187
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,590
I didn't bring it.

188
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,120
It's charging in the kitchen.

189
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,080
Where did you go?

190
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,520
We just went to see his step-mother.

191
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,280
Why are you so nervous?

192
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,240
How can I not be nervous?

193
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,720
What did you talk to

194
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
his step-mother?

195
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
Was it about me?

196
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,600
What could we talk about?

197
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,840
We chatted about her schedule in Shanghai.

198
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,160
Just some trivial stuff.

199
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,760
But,

200
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,520
we got to know Shangyan

201
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,400
a lot better through his step-mom.

202
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,800
Then what do you know about him?

203
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,200
Tong Nian,

204
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,080
are you going to Beijing

205
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
to watch the competition tomorrow?

206
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,930
I was planning to tell you this evening.

207
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,320
Yes, I'm going to Beijing.

208
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,520
Listen Tong Nian,

209
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,760
you should just tell us your plans in the future.

210
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,370
If you lie to us,

211
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,700
you will be in big trouble.

212
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,170
So you're in a relationship,

213
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,210
there's no need to hide anything from us.

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,160
Really.

215
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,440
You haven't had dinner, right?

216
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
I'll make something.

217
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,080
So you have nothing to tell me?

218
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,600
Nope.

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,520
Oh right,

220
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,080
send my best wishes to Shangyan.

221
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,440
Dad, what did you talk about?

222
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,880
Oh right!

223
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,420
I have to read up some of my patient reports.

224
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,720
My memory's really going.

225
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,000
Why are they both acting so strange?

226
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,720
Here, look.

227
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,360
This is Wang Hao's room.

228
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,000
It's been so many years.

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,840
He still won't let me move anything.

230
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,800
You must have many memories

231
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,900
of this room, right?

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,720
Come, have a look.

233
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,080
So many trophies.

234
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,040
Look at you.

235
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,680
Why are you standing there?

236
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
Come and have a look.

237
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,840
Wang Hao values his friends very much.

238
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,780
Look, the trophies you won together

239
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,330
have always been right there.

240
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,760
They haven't been moved even once.

241
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,400
He won't even allow me

242
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,440
to polish them.

243
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,880
That's right.

244
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,280
You see, Wang Hao

245
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,920
is more loyal to his friends than you.

246
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,360
My father buries his emotions in his heart.

247
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
Mr. Han

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,090
shows his emotion all over his face.

249
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,960
Talk like this again,

250
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,160
and I'll tell your dad.

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,840
= Happy hours =

252
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,120
Come here. Come on.

253
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,210
Shangyan.

254
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,560
Just once.

255
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,960
Life is about challenges.

256
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,840
Just try it once.

257
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,090
Just once, OK?

258
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,900
Once. Calm down.

259
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,100
Calm down. Calm down.

260
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,490
I'll be with you. I'm here.

261
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,600
Shout if you get scared.

262
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,240
Han Shangyan!  -I'll take photos for you.

263
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,040
Wait for me. Wait. Wait for me.

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,920
Shangyan,

265
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,480
you must have many memories of this room.

266
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Walk around and check it out.

267
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,880
You see, they've won

268
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,840
so many trophies together back then.

269
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,760
It was wonderful.

270
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,100
I don't know what happened to them.

271
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
Why they won't talk to each other now.

272
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,940
♪ So many times I wish I could leave ♪

273

283
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,040
Where are you?

284
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,560
The old place at your home.

285
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,120
It's beautiful here.

286
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,440
You still remember?

287
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,120
We were

288
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,000
just a bunch of silly guys

289
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,400
and drank beer after beer on that roof,

290
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
talking about our dreams.

291
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,240
Look on the east side.

292
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,320
You used to curse in that area.

293
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,960
Do you know that

294
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,700
the house price in that area

295
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,120
is now over 90,000 yuan a square meter?

296
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,800
Why do you keep this old house?

297
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,440
I can't let it go.

298
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,370
I must buy it if I become rich one day.

299
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,520
Then every time we win a competition

300
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,760
we can drink and sing up here

301
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,920
without worrying about the landlady!

302
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,280
This will be our future home!

303
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,400
Shaofei,

304
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,120
are you an idiot?

305
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,720
Even if you own the whole roof,

306
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,760
she can still throw you out

307
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,770
for being too noisy!

308
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,620
Right, Shaofei, forget it.

309
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,490
I don't think the national champion reward

310
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,210
is enough money to buy a roof!

311
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,360
But we should keep fighting and fighting

312
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,320
until we become world champions.

313
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Right,

314
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,890
when we become world champions,

315
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,120
we can buy all the houses here

316
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,370
and shout as loud as we want!

317
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,040
Yes, that's right!

318
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,860
World champions!

319
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,940
World champions!

320
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,080
I spent the most splendid

321
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,240
and diligent years of my life

322
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,560
in that house.

323
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
I don't want other people to live there.

324
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,000
It's only because you're rich.

325
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,560
You're still so cynical.

326
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,450
How about dinner tomorrow evening?

327
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,720
Bring your girlfriend with you.

328
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,280
Consider it a ceremony.

329
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
Didn't we agree that

330
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,720
if anyone found a spouse,

331
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,880
all of us should see the spouse first?

332
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,080
Maybe next time.

333
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll wait for you forever.

334
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,240
I don't believe you'd keep refusing me.

335
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,160
I'm hanging up.

336
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,040
You frightened me, boss!

337
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,560
What are you scared of?

338
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,800
Don't be silly.

339
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,170
I'm your team member.

340
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,340
No need to be scared.

341
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,500
Why are you still awake?

342
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,240
I'm too excited.

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,200
Excited?

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,080
About what?

345
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,660
I began my career in CTF because of you.

346
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,090
Tomorrow we're playing in the same place

347
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,880
where you won the championship before.

348
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
How can I not be excited?

349
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,040
It's like my life goal's been fulfilled.

350
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,680
But it's a lot of pressure.

351
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,120
Well, it does

352
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,480
have a lot of meaning.

353
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,480
Of course.

354
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,960
Boss, you may not know

355
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,960
what this means to me.

356
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,480
OK.

357
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,120
Go to bed early.

358
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,519
Boss,

359
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,220
the finals are tomorrow.

360
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,620

Yes, I'm listening.

The strong one is silent.

366
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,840
The weak one is loquacious.

367
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,280
Understand?

368
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,760

Why're you smiling so happily?

391
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,880
You won the lottery?

392
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,320
No, this is the first time I go out with you

393
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,600
with my parents' permission.

394
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Well, it's not the first time.

395
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,240
I went to Sanya on my own,

396
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,180
my parents didn't know.

397
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,440
So it doesn't count.

398
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,640
Look at me.

399
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,720
Am I dressed appropriately?

400
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,880
Is it OK to see your mom like this?

401
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,680
Of course!

402
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,320
Really?

403
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,060
But why does she have to leave so quickly?

404
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,480
We'll come back in two days.

405
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,640
Why not see her after we come back?

406
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Her husband is so annoying.

407
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,360
Twenty phone calls a day.

408
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,460
Today marks the longest time

409
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,440
they've been apart.

410
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,200
That's so sweet.

411
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,460
Sweet?

412
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,120
Of course.

413
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,620
The purpose of getting married

414
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
is to be with each other every day.

415
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
My parents are the same, too.

416
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,400
Whenever my dad works overtime,

417
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,680
my mom will go and dine with him.

418
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,400
Nothing will stop her.

419
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,280
What about you?

420
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,200
I can only go to my aunt's home.

421
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,320
Sometimes I feel that I'm an outsider.

422
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,960
Listen,

423
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,120
from now on wherever I go,

424
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,880
I'll let you know.

425
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,520
If you want to come with me,

426
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,680
I'll bring you with me.

427
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,600
Understand?

428
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
And,

429
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,250
even if I don't call you for an entire day,

430
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
I'll let you know

431
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
that I miss you.

432
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,880
Get in.

433
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,800
Be quick.

434
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
You only have five minutes.

435
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,360
We will board soon.

436
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,730
If she keeps talking to you,

437
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,280
don't listen to her.

438
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,680
No, I can't.

439
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,170
This is my first time seeing your mom.

440
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,240
I must leave a good impression.

441
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,400
What matters is I like you.

442
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,480
That's not the same.

443
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,210
Anyway, you can't ruin

444
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,640
my first meeting with your mom.

445
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,520
You should cooperate with me, OK?

446
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,240
Don't worry.

447
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,800
She'll like you anyway.

448
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,800
Where is she?

449
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,560
In the VIP room.

450
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,640
This is Tong Nian.

451
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,920
Hello, Mrs. Han.

452
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
Hello, nice to see you.

453
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,300
We were stuck in a traffic jam.

454
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,260
Sorry we're late.

455
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,200
We will board very soon.

456
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,250
We can't chat for too long.

457
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,200
No need to rush.

458
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,720
I know when your plane will take off.

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,920
Tong Nian.

460
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,720
Mrs. Han.

461
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,600
I'm so happy to finally see you today.

462
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,200
It's glad to see you, too.

463
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,240
Your bracelet

464
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,210
is so beautiful.

465
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,160
Thank you.

466
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,130
Have a seat.

467
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,640
You,

468
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
sit over there.

469
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,560
Take a seat.

470
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,280
Mrs. Han, please have a seat.

471
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,080
OK, OK.

472
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,640
Such a polite girl.

473
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,520
There are only two things

474
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,450
on Han Shangyan's mind.

475
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,960
His club, and you.

476
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,200
The more unfriendly he is to a person,

477
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,600
the more he cares for them.

478
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,120
So you can't judge him from his actions.

479
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,040
He pretends to be calm

480
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,840
every time he is worried.

481
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,320
I know that, Mrs. Han.

482
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,080
I was right.

483
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,600
You're a clever girl.

484
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,800
Is your PhD. hard?

485
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,600
No, it's alright.

486
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,080
In the future,

487
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,640
you just pay attention to your studies.

488
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,400
Leave all the chores

489
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,400
to him.

490
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,800
If he doesn't' do the housework,

491
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,760
then who will?

492
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,600
He's been the one doing the housework.

493
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,720
I never do it.

494
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,880
Really?

495
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,600
I know he cares for you.

496
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,970
My son has many drawbacks.

497
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,600
I'm the one to blame.

498
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,480
You just be patient with him.

499
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,920
No, he's a good man indeed.

500
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,800
One more thing.

501
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,880
Though he's a man,

502
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
he's very vulnerable inside.

503
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,040
He's afraid to lose,

504
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,400
especially in a relationship.

505
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,560
He looks highly on

506
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,040
his relationships with people.

507
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,800
He's very stubborn.

508
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,960
If you two have a fight,

509
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,680
don't let it last too long.

510
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,180
And don't threaten to break up with him.

511
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,440
He can't bear it.

512
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,300
What if he were to kill himself?

513
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,160
Got it, don't worry!

514
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,880
We've only been talking a few minutes!

515
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,200
Don't push us.

516
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,760
Tong Nian,

517
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,880
do you know

518
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,980
how Han Shangyan established K&K?

519
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,620
He has devoted a lot to K&K

520
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,900
these years and he's been through

521
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,720
lots of difficulties.

522
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,540
Do you know this?

523
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,840
I didn't know that, actually.

524
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,080
But after I came back

525
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,720
I saw all the trophies he won.

526
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,200
It was only then that I realized

527
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,960
all those trophies were the result

528
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,700
of the efforts put forth by the entire team.

529
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,600
He doesn't want to tell you

530
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,040
much about his past.

531
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:53,960
Right.

532
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,560
What?

533
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,280
Boss, do you need help?

534
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,840
No.

535
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,490
Are you hungry?

536
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,480
There's a bunch of snacks.

537
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,040
They're all for you.

538
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
I can't eat all that.

539
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,480
It's not that much.

540
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,200
You have so many weird habits.

541
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,760
You like watching others eat?

542
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,280
You're criticizing me

543
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,780
because I brought snacks for you?

544
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,930
Alright I'm sorry.

545
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,880
Thank you.

546
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,720
Do you want one?

547
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,000
No.

548
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,050
You?

549
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,050
No.

550
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,080
Is this a new product?

551
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,920
The weather is too hot.

552
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,840
They're sticking together.

553
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,400
Good for you, Han Shangyan.

554
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,610
This is my first time seeing Twizzlers like this.

555
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,280
Still edible.

556
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,280
Are you thirsty?

557
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,160
Are you hungry?

558
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,800
Is the A.C. too cold?

559
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,600
No.

560
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,600
It's fine. It's fine.

561
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,600
I'll grab some napkins to wipe it up.

562
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
If she keeps eating like this,

563
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,040
Mrs. Han will gain ten pounds before we get off.

564
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,440
He's not used to treating others well.

565
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,320
He only knows to buy her food.

566
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,480
No wonder he didn't have a girlfriend before.

567
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,360
Have you learned a lesson?

568
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,640
If you're single, don't blame others.

569
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,120
Look at yourself.

570
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,240
Coach, what do you mean?

571
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,560
You got a girlfriend not long ago.

572
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,040
Don't look down on us bachelors.

573
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,440
Yummy.

574
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,120
Then eat more.

575
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:16,960
Slow down.

576
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,400
Hurry up.

577
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,480
What?

578
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,400
Finally, you're here.

579
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,520
I've been waiting outside the hotel

580
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,720
this whole morning.

581
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,240
Shaofei,

582
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,080
your boss will be with me tonight.

583
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,000
OK.

584
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,090
Don't keep him out too late.

585
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,160
He's our anchor.

586
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,000
He can't be away for too long.

587
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,760
Alright.

588
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,920
OK, everybody.

589
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,380
Go upstairs and get some rest.

590
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,480
Dinner's at 6:00 p.m. on the second floor.

591
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,360
Training starts at 8:00 p.m.

592
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,400
No problem.

593
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,080
I should go up with them.

594
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,880
Come with us.

595
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,440
No, it's okay.

596
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,000
You seldom have the chance to talk.

597
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,200
I don't want to interfere.

598
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,960
This is a club rule.

599
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,000
If anyone has a spouse,

600
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,320
everybody else has to meet her.

601
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,680
Are you scared?

602
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,760
Let's go.

603
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,360
To the old place.

604
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,360
It hasn't closed?

605
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,560
If we go to eat, it will stay open.

606
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,760
Here we are.

607
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,820
We're going to have dinner here.

608
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,530
Is this the place where you used to go to a lot?

609
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,600
This is in fact our old haunt.

610
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,840
They specialize in Beijing food.

611
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,800
You can find everything you want.

612
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,440
They have all sorts of good stuff?

613
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,920
In the past,

614
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,080
whether we won or lost,

615
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
me and Shangyan would get drunk here.

616
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,680
Until we were

617
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,370
happy again.

618
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,440
Let's go.

619
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,840
How is it, Tong Nian?

620
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,160
The view here is beautiful right?

621
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,680
Order anything you want.

622
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,160
It's on me.

623
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,040
Thank you.

624
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,320
You paid for our last meal.

625
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,760
This time,

626
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,960
it's on me.

627
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,240
Let's drink!

628
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,730
OK.

629
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,680
After all, we're retired.

630
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,930
It won't affect the game.

631
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,120
Whatever.

632
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,600
One dozen.

633
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,410
Two dozen.

634
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,960
Three dozen.

635
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,840
Four dozen.

636
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,040
I think you should

637
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,800
order one dozen first.

638
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,800
OK.

639
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,120
Waiter, six dozen beer.

640
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,840
OK.

641
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,640
Tong Nian, order something.

642
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,840
The food's pretty good.

643
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,280
Here, Shangyan.

644
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,400
Cheers.

645
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,120
Enough with the scowling.

646
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,760
Give me a smile!

647
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,680
I think he is drunk.

648
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,800
He never could drink well.

649
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,480
Then why did he order six dozens beer?

650
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,760
He likes to get wasted.

651
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,280
Who says I can't drink?

652
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,320
No, no one.

653
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,920
Here, cheers.

654
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,440
Drink!

655
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,200
Don't drink so quickly.

656
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,680
What were the five of you like before?

657
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,600
It was wonderful.

658
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,080
But at the same time,

659
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,320
we had a lot going on,

660
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,360
a lot of pressure.

661
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,340
But, every time I was worried,

662
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,560
I would remember

663
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,090
one sentence.

664
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,520
Let me recite it.

665
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,720
Shangyan knows it, too.

666
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,760
Shangyan, listen.

667
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,860
You know this one.

668
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,380
Our dream

669
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,620
has been sleeping for so long.

670
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,400
All the experience and glory

671
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,380
will be renewed

672
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,180
starting from this moment.

673
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,160
How is that, Tong Nian?

674
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,760
Great.  -Good poem.

675
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,040
Here, cheers.

676
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,920
He's crying.

677
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,400
Are you OK, Solo?

678
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,040
Go pay the bill.

679
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,420
Wait.

680
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,280
Take this.

681
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,800
I'll pay the bill.

682
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,040
Shangyan.

683
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,200
Stop drinking, let's go.

684
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,500
Look at you! You're so drunk.

685
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,420
Go.

686
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,400
We're here.

687
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,320
Boss, what's the big rush?

688
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,360
Take his arms.

689
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,620
Boss, you're gonna take down

690
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,000
our enemy's leader before the game?

691
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,280
Put him here.

692
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,320
Go to the bathroom.

693
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,240
Slowly.

694
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Be careful.

695
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Tong Nian,

696
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,960
you go out first.

697
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
Leave us alone for a bit.

698
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,720
OK.

699
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,600
I, I'll go out first.

700
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
Call me if you need help.

701
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,340
Shangyan.

702
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,880
Tonight I feel very happy.

703
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,000
How long has it been

704
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,000
since we've been this drunk?

705
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,720
Do you know how long I've been

706
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,000
waiting to get drunk with you like this?

707
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,460
Every time, whether I was happy,

708
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
or sad,

709
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,000
whether we won a game or lost,

710
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,140
I always hoped I could share my feelings with you.

711
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,120
But you?

712
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Where were you?

713
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
You were just a coward who hid from me!

714
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,920
I didn't!

715
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,360
How old was I back then?

716
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,770
I suddenly became a father.

717
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
A father! Do you understand?

718
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,440
I didn't want to drag you down.

719
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,400
Han Shangyan,

720
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,100
you're gonna stand on the international stage.

721
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,240
The international stage!

722
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,040
Do you understand?

723
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,880
So you abandoned us all

724
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,560
so we could be on top of the world?

725
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,400
Wang Hao,

726
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
I'm telling you,

727
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,210
no matter how high we fly,

728
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,600
no matter how far we go,

729
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,560
I always hope you will be

730
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,130
the wind that supports us.

731
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,280
Do you have any idea

732
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,040
how lonely I am?

733
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,140
Shangyan,

734
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,640
I'm sorry.

735
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,460
Do you know

736
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
how long I've been waiting

737
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,920
for your apology?

738
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,240
I'm sorry!

739
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,280
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

740
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,840
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

741
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,080
Get up.

742
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,760
Sorry.

743
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,880
You're here.

744
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:54,850
They're in the bathroom.

745
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,770
Are they alright?

746
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,360
They're drunk.

747
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,940
The two of them

748
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,960
had at least twenty bottles of beer,

749
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,680
plus two and a half bottles of booze.

750
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,060
Han Shangyan and Solo are both in there.

751
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,880
They won't allow anybody in.

752
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,840
I know.

753
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,650
He called me over.

754
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,920
Don't worry.

755
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,120
They can drink a lot.

756
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,890
Han Shangyan told me that

757
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,120
Solo couldn't drink that much.

758
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,600
He was lying to you.

759
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,760
Lying to me?

760
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,320
He likes lying to others.

761
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,010
You don't know him well.

762
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
I should go in there.

763
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,410
They're talking inside.

764
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,280
They won't let others in.

765
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,800
Don't worry.

766
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,120
OK, get up and grab a towel.

767
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,200
Hurry up, move!

768
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,200
Take this.

769
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,160
We won our first championship in Beijing.

770
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,400
And also the last one.

771
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,970
Han Shangyan.

772
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,610
I'm sorry.

773
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,560
I've wanted to say this to you

774
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,160
for so many years.

775
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,240
I'm sorry.

776
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Today, I finally have the chance to

777
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,460
say this to you.

778
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,540
When you were at the peak of your career,

779
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,810
we became your burden.

780
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,160
If it weren't for us,

781
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,360
you'd have been even greater.

782
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,880
It was all because of me.

783
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,480
Ai Qing.

784
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,720
It was all my fault.

Han, Solo

800
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,770
your room is so luxurious!

801
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,920
It's king-size!

802
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,200
We can all live here together!

803
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,170
Not bad, right?

804
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,440
Champions

805
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,080
deserve a room that fits their status.

806
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,480
Go inside and have a look.

807
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,880
Such a big bed!

808
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,330
We can all roll around on this!

809
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,130
Really?

810
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,210
Let's do it!

811
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,080
Get off, Shangyan!

812
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,280
Find your own room!

813
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,920
Go check up there.

814
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,760
There are more surprises.

815
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,000
Really?

816
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,400
There's even a kitchen?

817
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,440
We can cook here.

818
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,840
I'll cook for you tonight.

819
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,480
Look what I brought!

820
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,740
Orange juice.

821
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,840
Look at the price tag first.

822
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,610
It's more expensive than the convenience store.

823
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,600
Right.

824
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,600
How expensive can it be?

825
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,720
Twenty yuan a bottle.

826
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,600
So expensive!

827
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,520
We're the champions!

828
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,120
Don't worry, it's on me.

829
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,720
No.

830
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,600
Wait.

831
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,680
The three of us

832
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,680
can share one bottle.

833
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,240
Let me think.

834
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,120
Less than seven yuan

835
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,840
per person.

836
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,960
Great.

837
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,320
Come on.

838
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
Cheers.

839
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,280
Why does this juice

840
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,680
taste better than convenience store juice?

841
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:29,820
Is it because it's expensive?

842
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,860
That's just in your head.

843
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,180
When we become the national champions,

844
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,760
I'll buy you a whole truckload.

845
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,320
And we'll be the spokespeople for this juice.

846
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,580
Drink as much as you like.

847
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,160
That's right.

848
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,800
When we become the national champions,

849
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,480
we can represent any products we want.

850
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
Not only this juice,

851
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,040
but clothing, hats, shoes and others.

852
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,520
Right?

853
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,280
A toast to Shangyan's success.

854
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,840
Cheers!
