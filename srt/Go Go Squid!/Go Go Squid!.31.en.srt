00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,360
Seems that all the games with shooting

173
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,760
are not your cup of tea.

174
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,120
This happens. Just a swing and a miss.

175
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,120
I'll try again.

176
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,480
Second time's the charm.

177
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,880
I... I have one more dart.

178
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,520
Definitely gonna nail it.

179
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,840
You see? Am I not a master?

180
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,080
I nailed it!

181
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,920
Why are you drinking hot water?

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,960
Isn't it hot enough already?

183
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,280
My stomach is upset.

184
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,080
What's wrong?

185
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,240
Are you sick?

186
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
I'm just nervous.

187
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,960
After an important match,

188
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,600
he's more nervous than his team members,

189
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,600
but no one knows.

190
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,000
Why are you staring at me again?

191
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,120
I have something to show you.

192
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,880
Follow me.

193
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,780
I planned to show you this as a surprise

194
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,840
on one of our anniversaries.

195
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,200
Considering the victory K&K has just made,

196
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,240
I'll show it to you today.

197
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,680
Let me guess what it is.

198
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,920
There's no way you'll guess right.

199
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,000
K&K's website.

200
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,560
How did you know?

201
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,600
Was it difficult?

202
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,960
A piece of cake.

203
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,760
You've posted my video on the website.

204
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,120
You know that as well?

205
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,720
It was easy to guess.

206
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,800
You've spoilt the fun.

207
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,000
I thought I'd surprise you.

208
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,020
= Doppler Summit 2019 =

209
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,320
To be honest,

210
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,920
I'm delighted.

211
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Thank you.

212
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,680
Han Shangyan,

213
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
what's so urgent that you need to see me now?

214
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
Why not wait for me in the meeting room?

215
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,560
I'll join you later.

216
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,200
Okay.

217
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,930
You texted me last night,

218
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,160
saying I should come find you early today.

219
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,840
Tong Nian, it's not my fault.

220
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,480
If I had known this,

221
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,200
I wouldn't have come back so early.

222
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,840
Am I right?

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,160
We just had our karaoke night

224
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,840
and were going to have breakfast.

225
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,560
Am I interrupting

226
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,880
something important?

227
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,660
Leave!

228
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,760
You guys continue.

229
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,240
Need me to close the door?

230
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
Take your time.

231
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,840
I'll be slowly eating my breakfast downstairs.

232
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,880
If you've got work to do,

233
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,800
don't let me stop you.

234
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,640
Just ignore me.

235
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,720
What's the rush?

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,280
I have him on the payroll.

237
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,660
You're not a good boss, you know?

238
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,840
Why do you say so?

239
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,080
Out with it.

240
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,440
Didn't you have an upset stomach?

241
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,440
Make yourself at home.

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,280
I have to get back to work.

243
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,120
We'll continue later.

244
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,680
What do you mean?

245
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,680
What's wrong?

246
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,840
I need to talk to you.

247
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,720
You're my boss,

248
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,160
whatever you say.

249
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,000
Can we talk as friends?

250
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,080
Sure.

251
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,280
Who is on the Top 10 list now?

252
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,160
Your cousin, Wu Bai, still ranks first.

253
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,680
Grunt comes fifth in the ranking,

254
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,920
along with a SP member.

255
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,920
97 is ninth.

256
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,680
What about Buff?

257
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,600
Buff?

258
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,760
Buff is ranked fourth.

259
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,560
What's wrong?

260
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,880
You have an idea?

261
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,240
You guessed it.

262
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,040
You think I don't know what you're thinking?

263
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,320
You want to ask him to join us

264
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,200
and replace the player

265
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,520
with the worst results.

266
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,680
Is it practical?

267
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,240
It is if we focus only on performance.

268
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,480
I think,

269
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,900
it would be easy for the team

270
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,160
to accept such an arrangement.

271
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,960
Except for Wu Bai.

272
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,250
Because he's ranked first on the list.

273
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Do you have any concerns?

274
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,080
Yes.

275
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,040
My first concern is

276
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,850
he's in his 30s after all.

277
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,770
I'm not sure how long

278
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,880
he will stay in this field.

279
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,280
If he joins us,

280
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,600
he'll be the oldest in the team.

281
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,080
Right.

282
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,640
My second concern is

283
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,960
he wasn't friendly to you before

284
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,520
and we just eliminated his team.

285
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,730
Do you think you can persuade him?

286
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,560
He will do what's best for him.

287
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,080
If he wants to compete,

288
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,880
joining us would be the easiest way.

289
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,240
Yeah.

290
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,400
What about his team?

291
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,920
I only want him.

292
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,920
What's on your mind?

293
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,680
I'm just thinking

294
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,680
if I make him an offer and take him in,

295
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,040
I'll have to replace

296
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,930
one of the members of our own team.

297
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,400
Having second thoughts?

298
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,480
We're building a team

299
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,120
that's aiming at becoming world champions.

300
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,480
If they aren't good enough,

301
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,440
even if we don't replace them,

302
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,160
they'll be eliminated in competition.

303
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
You want me to reach out to him?

304
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,680
I'll do it myself.

305
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,280
Help me find out where he lives.

306
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay. I'm on it.

307
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,920
I'll find him before he leaves Shanghai.

308
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,000
DT.

309
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,600
Grunt.

310
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,360
97.

311
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,240
Demo.

312
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,160
One.

313
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,320
You want to be left alone?

314
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,880
Okay, okay.

315
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,720
I'll let you play by yourself.

316
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,240
Go on.

317
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,200
You should know

318
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,280
that these days, even a small-scale club

319
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,680
will have more than one team.

320
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,850
We need to make preparations for other contests.

321
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,160
Yes.

322
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,760
It makes sense

323
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,520
to ask the top-ranked players

324
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,170
to come join us.

325
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,180
I understand.

326
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,240
Okay.

327
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,980
Give me a call

328
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,890
whenever you locate Buff.

329
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,070
Okay, that's it. Bye.

330
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,130
Our budget...

331
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:00,760
This one...

332
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:01,960
It's Han Shangyan.

333
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,680
Hey, Han Shangyan.

334
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,040
Hello, you busy?

335
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,800
We're in a meeting.

336
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,560
Are you able to get me the money?

337
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,360
It's okay with me.

338
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,400
It's also a good decision

339
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,160
for the team itself.

340
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,960
But the problem is...

341
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,920
Boss,

342
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,920
you went over budget.

343
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,880
Yes.

344
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,000
That's the biggest problem here.

345
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,880
Boss,

346
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,960
we've got other matches going on

347
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,880
outside of China.

348
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,160
You're way too partial.

349
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,800
You spent all your budget

350
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,760
using the Ace of Spades

351
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,420
the last time you were here.

352
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,200
What can I do?

353
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,920
Okay.

354
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,720
I'll deal with it myself.

355
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,450
Wait, how are you gonna deal with it?

356
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,120
Do you have money?

357
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,120
Do you have the budget?

358
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,640
Whether I have money or not,

359
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,600
I'll solve the problem myself.

360
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,800
Man,

361
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,330
don't push yourself too hard, okay?

362
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,600
Got it.

363
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,080
Bye then.

364
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
You're running out of money?

365
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,520
You eavesdropped on me.

366
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,500
That's not eavesdropping.

367
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,560
You put it on speaker.

368
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,200
How much money do you need?

369
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,880
I've got some.

370
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,960
I've been saving up.

371
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,280
It's not much. I don't know if it'll help.

372
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,320
What do you have on your wrist?

373
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,600
It's a present from you.

374
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,880
Don't you think it's old-fashioned?

375
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,240
No at all.

376
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,880
I actually think it's cute.

377
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,720
Not bad.

378
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,560
You have your own savings

379
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,760
even before you graduate.

380
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,760
I sing songs in my spare time.

381
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
It's not that much.

382
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,720
I don't need it.

383
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,400
Thank you.

384
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,840
Speak.

385
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,240
Han Shangyan,

386
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,880
I feel uneasy about it.

387
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,080
What's wrong?

388
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,600
Are you going to

389
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,570
put all your money into the club again?

390
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,410
Can you leave some money for yourself?

391
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,010
Save some money

392
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,000
for your wedding.

393
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Don't go broke like you did before

394
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,800
that you couldn't even afford new clothes.

395
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,650
No girl will be willing to be with you.

396
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,080
If I go broke,

397
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,000
would you still be with me?

398
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,160
No doubt.

399
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,520
Oh my god.

400
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,020
Your girlfriend is there with you?

401
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,200
What?

402
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,160
I'm so embarrassed.

403
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,120
I gotta go.

404
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,060
What's wrong?

405
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,560
I don't know.

406
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,480
He was with his wife!

407
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,040
He's with his wife right now.

408
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,160
So crazy.

409
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Unbelievable.

410
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,760
Let's continue.

411
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,240
Han Shangyan.

412
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,560
I can support you.

413
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,250
I mean if you run out of money someday,

414
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,280
I'll make money.

415
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,680
I'm sure I'll land a high paying job.

416
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,640
I know. Let's get you home.

417
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,640
I mean it.

418
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,400
Computer science majors

419
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,920
make a lot of money.

420
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,980
I know you'll be rich, alright?

421
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,920
But... But...

422
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,650
Alright, I got it.

423
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,000
But it'd be ridiculous if I ask you

424
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,000
to support me.

425
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,760
Don't say that again.

426
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
Go get your purse. I'll drive you home.

427
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,340
Oh.

428
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,640
Shaofei, what are you up to?

429
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,600
I wasn't eavesdropping.

430
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,000
I just came to tell you

431
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,280
I have some news about Buff.

432
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,040
He's leaving by train tomorrow morning.

433
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,570
So, you'd better get started early tomorrow,

434
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,080
to catch him at his hotel.

435
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,760
Okay.

436
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,890
Text me the address of the hotel.

437
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,960
Go ahead.

438
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,480
See you.

439
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,560
Bye.

440
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,560
I'll go inside.

441
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,240
I see you are frowning again.

442
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
You know what?

443
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,050
I often see you frowning like this.

444
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,840
It makes me very upset

445
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,800
whenever I see it.

446
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,680
Could you remove

447
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
at least a few things

448
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,200
weighing on your mind?

449
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,920
Okay.

450
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,920
I'll stop worrying about

451
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,210
the thing that bothers me the most.

452
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
But,

453
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,700
what's the thing that bothers you the most?

454
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,320
What do you think?

455
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,840
It's okay.

456
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,920
No matter how many problems,

457
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,810
solving them one by one

458
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,800
will be much easier.

459
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,840
What's more,

460
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,280
I've got you standing by my side, right?

461
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,680
Good night.

462
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,560
Young man,

463
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,440
you're here again?

464
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,680
Why are you fighting so often?

465
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,840
It's bad for your relationship.

466
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:45,960
We didn't fight.

467
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,160
Then what's happening?

468
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,280
You're waiting for her here?

469
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,960
I went back home

470
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,920
after seeing you last time

471
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
and told my wife about you.

472
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,490
I said, some guy infatuated with a girl,

473
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,720
and waited in front of her house at midnight.

474
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,560
My wife blamed me

475
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,840
for not encouraging you.

476
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,840
What did she say?

477
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:04,880
Oh right.

478
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,560
As long as you're handsome

479
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,920
and keep waiting for her here,

480
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,440
she'll come back to you sooner or later.

481
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,000
What's so funny?

482
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,240
Judging from your smile,

483
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,840
I guess you've won her back, right?

484
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,560
If I hadn't driven here,

485
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,160
I'd like to have a drink with you.

486
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,040
I can't drink.

487
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,440
I'm on duty now.

488
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,200
Alright then.

489
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
You wait for her here.

490
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,480
I'll go patrol the housing estate.

491
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,600
See you.

492
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,840
Good luck.

493
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,720
Today is the four-month anniversary of us meeting.

494
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,280
Four months and a day.

495
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,040
When I went into the Internet cafe

496
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,160
on December 23rd last year,

497
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,200
it wasn't yet twelve o'clock.

498
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,720
I miss you.

499
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,840
Come downstairs if you do.

500
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,320
Be good.

501
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
I just fed you.

502
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,680
Why are you still so hungry?

503
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,560
Don't move.

504
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,200
Don't move. Don't move.

505
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,280
Don't move.

506
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,480
Don't move.

507
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,320
Yes.

508
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,840
Good.

509
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Let's try another round.

510
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,280
Don't move. Don't move.

511
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,560
Don't move.

512
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
You're so good at jumping.

513
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,800
It's a pity you're not a high jumper.

514
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,200
You stayed here all night?

515
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,040
I had nothing else to do.

516
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,530
It feels good to wait here,

517
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,480
listening to songs.

518
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,560
The environment here is pleasant.

519
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,320
It's quiet, but not too deserted.

520
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,800
And the tree cover is also good.

521
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,840
Hey, what are you doing?

522
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,880
I'm sorry.

523
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,280
I just thought that was so sweet.

524
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,480
I'm leaving in ten minutes.

525
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,300
Want to sit in the car and have a chat?

526
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,180
Mhmm.

527
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,780
You're blushing.

528
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,640
I'm not.

529
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
I'm not blushing.

530
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,320
It's cold in the morning.

531
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,820
Cover yourself with this.

532
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,610
Don't catch cold.

533
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,970
You didn't sleep at all last night?

534
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,400
I didn't sleep much.

535
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,600
Are you sleepy?

536
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,640
No.

537
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,720
I often stayed up all night

538
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,480
when we were busy with training and preparing

539
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,840
before the matches.

540
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,120
Do you have time to get some sleep later?

541
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,600
I already refreshed

542
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,280
from seeing your smile.

543
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,720
Are you hungry?

544
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,440
Do you want me to get you something to eat?

545
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,080
Don't waste the time

546
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,880
we could be spending together.

547
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,840
It's been four months.

548
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,440
What gift do you want?

549
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,920
I don't want anything.

550
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,080
Think about it now.

551
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,640
Still nothing?

552
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,920
I want...

553
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,600
I want to be with you forever.

554
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,000
Forever?

555
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,680
What's wrong?

556
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,480
Are you saying that

557
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,200
you want to marry me?

558
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,140
What?

559
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,760
Don't you think

560
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,000
it's too early to get married?

561
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,080
Are you that eager?

562
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,440
I'm not.

563
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,440
I just mean that...

564
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,360
I'm afraid your parents won't agree.

565
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,480
We haven't been dating for long at all.

566
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,480
You haven't graduated yet.

567
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,840
You may not know this.

568
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,440
Your mom's got a problem with me.

569
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,080
I haven't figured out how to clear the air.

570
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,440
If I go tell her we are going to get married,

571
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm afraid

572
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,640
she'll come after me with a knife.

573
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,400
My mom's got a problem with you?

574
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,760
How do you know that?

575
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,480
Wild guess.

576
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,480
I thought you didn't know.

577
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,760
Let's put off the marriage issue.

578
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,800
Think of something else.

579
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,860
I'll try my best to make you happy.

580
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,520
You misunderstood me.

581
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,320
I didn't mean that

582
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,960
I want to get married now.

583
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,200
What... What's wrong?

584
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Your dad's coming.

585
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,600
My dad!

586
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,210
He walks the dog every morning.

587
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,160
Don't let him see me,

588
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,280
or he'll kill me.

589
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,760
Careful. Don't move.

590
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,680
How about this?

591
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,200
I'll go distract your dad.

592
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,680
When I manage to divert his attention,

593
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,600
you find an opportunity

594
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,560
to sneak back into the house.

595
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,740
Oh.

596
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,820
Could you move your head a bit?

597
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,540
Oh.

598
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,290
Go, Summer.

599
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Slow down. Slow down.

600
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,520
Come on.

601
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,320
Hi. Yeah, it's me.

602
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,920
Yeah, right.

603
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,680
Yes.

604
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,160
Don't give yourself away.

605
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,880
Shangyan?

606
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,240
Mr. Tong.

607
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,640
Wait a sec.

608
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,200
Okay. That's it for today.

609
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,160
Mr. Tong.

610
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,640
What are you doing here

611
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,680
so early in the morning?

612
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,280
I was just passing this place

613
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,560
and wanted to have a look.

614
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
You were just passing?

615
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,320
Be honest with me, young man.

616
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,050
Do you still have feelings

617
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,480
for Tong Nian right now, huh?

618
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,600
Mr. Tong, don't get me wrong.

619
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,520
It's true I was just passing by.

620
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,160
I...

621
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,400
I suddenly recalled memories

622
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,220
of driving her home.

623
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,200
I feel so sad.

624
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,600
Mr. Tong, trust me.

625
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,240
I'm more serious than you thought I'd be

626
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,120
about my relationship with Tong Nian.

627
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,100
In fact, you two didn't date for too long.

628
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm sure you'll get over her

629
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,720
given enough time.

630
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,200
But I have to admit

631
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,290
there are fewer guys who'd be as devoted

632
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,640
as you are.

633
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,640
Dad, can you leave now?

634
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
I really mean it.

635
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,600
I know, Mr. Tong.

636
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,640
Tell you what?

637
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,560
On our trip back to our hometown

638
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,610
with you and your grandpa,

639
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,440
I noticed that

640
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,440
you really liked my daughter.

641
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,720
You should know that

642
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,570
it takes two to tango, right?

643
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,380
Yeah, you're right about that.

644
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,240
When you two broke up,

645
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,040
my daughter cried her eyes out.

646
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,760
But luckily she's over it now.

647
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,360
I hope you understand.

648
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,040
I'm her father after all.

649
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,920
What's wrong? What happened?

650
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,360
Oh nothing.

651
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,920
Mr. Tong, go ahead.

652
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,160
Oh. I have no other choice.

653
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,760
As Tong Nian's father,

654
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,480
seeing her heartbroken

655
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,360
also really upset me.

656
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,200
What do you expect me to do?

657
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,800
I care about my baby.

658
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,200
I'm her father.

659
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,120
Am I right?

660
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,480
Hope you'd understand, kid.

661
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,680
It's okay. It's okay.

662
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,400
You'll get through this.

663
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,360
Alright?

664
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Everything will be okay.

665
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,100
What's wrong with your hand?

666
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,760
Huh?

667
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,120
It's shaking all about.

668
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,760
I'm fine, Mr. Tong.

669
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,840
I type a lot on my computer.

670
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,300
It's bad for your health,

671
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,440
and will ruin your eyesight.

672
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,160
Make some changes. You hear me?

673
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,800
-Yes, Mr. Tong.  -You are a handsome guy.

674
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Listen to me.

675
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,760
I hope you will

676
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,200
think about what I said.

677
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,230
I feel much better now.

678
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,280
Thank you for your advice. Thank you.

679
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,560
That's good. That's good.

680
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,190
My phone is ringing again.

681
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,630
I'm so sorry.

682
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,760
Go ahead. Answer it.

683
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,360
Yeah? Okay.

684
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,840
I'll be off, Mr. Tong.

685
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,480
See you.

686
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,190
Oh, okay. Bye.

687
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,040
Okay. I'm coming now. Okay.

688
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,670
You can give me a call

689
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,960
whenever you feel upset, okay?

690
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,120
Okay, I will.

691
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,710
Okay, okay.

692
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,920
Bye, Mr. Tong.

693
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,670
Tong Nian.

694
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,120
It's so early.

695
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,360
Are you going out?

696
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,360
No, I'm not.

697
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,560
I just got up.

698
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,920
I'm so sleepy.

699
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,960
Morning, mom.

700
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,420
Hey, wait.  -What?

701
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,280
If you're not going out,

702
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,630
why did you put on sneakers?

703
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,480
I... I was thinking of

704
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,500
walking the dog with my dad.

705
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,560
I wanna take Summer out for a walk with him.

706
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,560
Really?

707
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,520
Your dad left a long time ago.

708
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,320
Really?

709
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,600
It's just my luck.

710
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,380
Such a pity that

711
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,250
I couldn't walk the dog with my dad.

712
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
What's wrong with you today?

713
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,720
You usually don't get up until midday.

714
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,690
What happened today?

715
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,800
I've changed my ways.

716
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Starting from today,

717
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,840
I'll keep earlier hours,

718
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,880
make more efforts

719
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,720
to study hard and work hard

720
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,560
and be a good person.

721
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,159
Yeah!

722
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,840
That's enough.

723
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,720
Why do I feel that

724
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,360
something's up with you?

725
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
What is it?

726
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,200
What's not right?

727
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,320
My hairstyle?

728
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,880
I think it's okay.

729
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,680
But I have to say that

730
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,280
you deserve a commendation

731
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,040
for such determination.

732
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,920
Thanks, mom.

733
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,680
Alright. I still have chores to do.

734
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,760
You go ahead.

735
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,800
Oh right.

736
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,560
If you have time later,

737
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,280
water those flowers over there

738
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
that your dad grew.

739
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,920
You hear me?

740
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,600
Oh, flowers. They need watering.

741
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,920
Of course they do.

742
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,200
No problem. Leave it to me.

743
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,800
Don't worry.

744
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,680
That was close.

745
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,040
It's so nice of you

746
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,120
to water the flowers for me.

747
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,000
Why is she sleeping here?

748
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,680
She got up early and said that

749
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,960
she wanted to walk the dog with you.

750
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,400
Thank god she didn't go.

751
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,680
What happened?

752
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,600
Han Shangyan was here.

753
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,240
What did he come here for?

754
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Come here. Come here.

755
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,320
What?

756
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,400
I have something to ask you.

757
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,440
Do you know the reason

758
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,330
why they broke up in the first place?

759
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,120
Listen up.

760
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,320
You can't ask Tong Nian about it.

761
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,860
She cried her heart out last time.

762
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,040
You were there yourself.

763
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,640
No matter what happened,

764
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,800
it was his fault, understand?

765
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,600
Okay. I got it.

766
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,000
When I met Han Shangyan

767
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,440
outside the house,

768
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,920
I talked with him.

769
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,200
I think the kid is more mature

770
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,360
than I gave him credit.

771
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,360
I asked him

772
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,400
why he came here and waited

773
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,410
outside our front gate so early?

774
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,880
He said he was just passing by

775
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,560
and wanted to have a look.

776
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,480
Isn't it obvious?

777
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,520
He still has feelings for Tong Nian.

778
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,280
You listen to me.

779
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,940
You can't tell Tong Nian

780
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
that you ran into him.

781
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,280
Do you hear me?

782
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,080
Yes. I know. I know.

783
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,160
But I'm thinking...

784
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,240
Honey,

785
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,000
why don't you ask her about it?

786
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,660
On our trip back home,

787
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,760
I had strong feelings that

788
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,320
they were getting quite close.

789
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,920
I guess it's possible they still...

790
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,560
Stop! What are you talking about?

791
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,640
You think Zheng Hui is not good enough,

792
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,440
don't you?

793
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,920
Zheng Hui is a good kid, too.

794
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,960
But he...

795
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,850
That's enough. No more talking.  -I...

796
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,100
Go buy some breakfast.

797
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,320
Hurry up. Go. Go. Go.

798
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,160
Don't you think that kid is kinda boring?

799
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:55,720
Enough.

800
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,640
Okay, okay. I'm going. I'm going.

801
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,600
You talk too much.

802
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,600
You're so good at jumping.

803
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,200
It's a pity you're not a high jumper.

804
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,300
You stayed here all night?

805
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,320
Focus on your breakfast.

806
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,960
Why are you laughing?

807
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,100
You see?

808
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,360
I think she's got something on her mind.

809
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,160
What could it be?

810
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,920
I'll go ask her.

811
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,120
Tong Nian.

812
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,920
Why aren't you eating?

813
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,600
Is there anything wrong?

814
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,200
No,

815
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,640
nothing's wrong.

816
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,620
Then are you concerned about something?

817
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,640
I'm fine, Summer.

818
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,720
I'm strong.

819
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,080
It's okay.

820
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,440
Are you thinking of the past?

821
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,600
Don't ask, dad.

822
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,080
It's okay, honey. Good girl.

823
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,120
You'll get over it.

824
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,560
It's no big deal, right?

825
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,120
It's okay.

826
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,560
Come here.

827
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,040
Be good.

828
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,570
Enough. Don't ask her.

829
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,360
She's still hurting because of the breakup.

830
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,000
What kind of mother are you?

831
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,960
Why are you blaming me?

832
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,000
She told you everything before,

833
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,120
but wouldn't tell me anything.

834
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,360
Geez. She'll be fine soon.

835
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,960
I know her well.

836
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,560
It's okay. Don't worry.

837
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
Have some fruit.

838
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,000
Eat the fruit.

839
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,200
You've got your ticket?

840
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
We're all leaving for home.

841
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,000
Don't be sad.

842
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,200
We'll meet again someday.

843
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,320
-Hi, Buff.  -Buff.

844
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,520
You're all here.

845
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,120
What's the rush?

846
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,840
We haven't had time

847
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,720
to get together for a drink yet.

848
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,880
My son called me,

849
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,840
saying he missed me.

850
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,120
I need to go back home.

851
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,200
Oh right.

852
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,000
If you guys come visit Jinan,

853
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,040
remember to contact me.

854
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,680
I'll treat you to the local cuisine.

855
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,480
We will.

856
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,040
We'll definitely call you if we go.

857
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,240
Take care.

858
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,640
Take care.

859
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,640
Take care.
