1
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,520
Just as I thought,

2
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,250
he's fine when he drives alone.

3
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,360
Lin Yu,

4
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,930
you're just in time.

5
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,400
I have some good news to share with you all.

6
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,560
What good news?

7
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,640
Chongxi and I received a performance invitation

8
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,970
from Shenyun District.

9
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,759
Lin Yu, practice hard,

10
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,560
we'll take you with us next time.

11
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,759
You two!

12
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,039
Let me see.

13
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,020
When are you going?

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,440
Tomorrow.

15
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,160
It's about 2-3 hours drive.

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,320
Chongxi, are you driving

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,120
or should I arrange a car?

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,960
I'll drive.

19
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,160
My car just got fixed.

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,640
Can you take me along?

21
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,400
I want to watch

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,460
and learn from you.

23
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
You practicing in the rehearsal room

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,400
is more important than anything else.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,320
I...

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,840
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

27
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,200
At 5 p.m.

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,090
Where shall we meet?

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,760
At...

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,160
At the school gate.

31
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,520
Okay.

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,360
Nana.

33
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,160
Where do you live?

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,240
Are we going the same way?

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,760
Can I share a ride with you?

36
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,290
I'm heading in the same direction as Chongxi.

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,160
Nana, I'm not feeling well.

38
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Can you go with me to the hospital?

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,600
Um...

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,530
I'll go with Lin Yu to the hospital.

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,800
Why don't you go ahead first?

42
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,920
Okay.

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,600
Nana, you're so nice.

44
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,800
Lin Yu.

45
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,600
You're acting a bit strange today.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,730
Do you have feelings for Ding Chongxi?

47
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,720
So...

48
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,720
Are you coming with us tomorrow?

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,399
How should I answer this?

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,800
If I say yes,

51
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,880
it seems like I'm deliberately coming between him and Ding Chongxi.

52
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,360
If I say no,

53
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,160
but I have to go with them anyway.

54
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,440
Lin Yu.

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,440
If you like Ding Chongxi,

56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,020
you need to try harder.

57
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,680
What if he becomes mine?

58
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
See you tomorrow.

59
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,680
I can't believe I have to compete with Nana

60
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,480
just to protect Ding Chongxi.

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,360
Is it me in reality

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,020
who doesn't know Ding Chongxi is being fake,

63
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,210
or is there something wrong with this stupid system?

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,720
You have successfully

65
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,640
helped Ding Chongxi avoid

66
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,960
a potential death.

67
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,240
Now unlocking a memory fragment for you.

68
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,570
This memory fragment is from high school.

69
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,280
What is this?

70
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,640
That's me.

71
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,200
Ding Chongxi has my QQ.

72
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,560
I'm not in a good mood lately.

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,770
Maybe another time.

74
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,930
Is it still about filling out your college application?

75
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,680
When I was little, I wanted to go east,

76
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,320
but my mom made me go west.

77
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,170
I wanted to learn high jump,

78
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,980
but she made me learn dancing.

79
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,680
I wanted to wear pants,

80
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,320
but she made me wear skirts.

81
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,320
Basically,

82
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,600
if I didn't do what she said,

83
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,370
I would be punished.

84
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,360
Didn't you say

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
your dad supports you?

86
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,480
My mom says

87
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,160
choosing my dad is betraying her.

88
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,730
The more my dad supports something, the more she opposes it.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,400
A life like this,

90
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,580
constantly held hostage,

91
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,200
will leave you with many regrets.

92
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,640
Little kid trying to talk like an adult.

93
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,450
How do you know I'm a kid?

94
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,120
Your profile says

95
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,920
you're 17.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,840
That's just online information,

97
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,100
some true, some false.

98
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,920
You'll find out later

99
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,800
what's real and what's not.

100
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,760
Memory fragments can help you.

101
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,620
Protect Ding Chongxi until the script is complete.

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,800
This memory fragment is trying to tell me

103
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,520
that I'm the one Ding Chongxi likes.
