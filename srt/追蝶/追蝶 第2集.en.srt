1
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,440
That dream again.

2
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,960
Who is he?

3
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,000
Ding Chongxi.

4
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,360
Ding Chongxi.

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,040
How could I possibly like that jerk?

6
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,290
What do I even see in him?

7
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,960
What if I can never complete this script?

8
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,560
Am I going to be trapped in this system forever?

9
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,650
Why am I back here again?

10
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,200
Number 7 reminds you:

11
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,280
Besides protecting Ding Chongxi to complete the script,

12
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,140
you cannot choose any other path.

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,040
Since I can't get out of here.

14
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,600
Fine,

15
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,280
then change my mission.

16
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,960
I don't want to revolve around men all day.

17
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,620
Please return to your script.

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,240
You

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,760
are driving me crazy.

20
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,880
Lin Yu.

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,160
Come here.

22
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,040
The teacher insisted I become a teaching assistant.

23
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,840
So I won't be going to rehearsal.

24
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,840
Have you been waiting long?

25
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,560
Let's go.

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,120
What's going on?

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,640
Why do you suddenly want to be a teaching assistant again?

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,800
She insists on checking my phone.

29
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,860
I need you as cover.

30
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,560
Using me as a shield?

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
I'll buy some drinks.

32
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,720
I give up.

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,800
How can I stop him from driving?

34
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Do you have a pen?

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
Or car keys or something?

36
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,040
Let me borrow them.

37
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,170
I want to check if it's evenly divided.

38
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,690
Don't leave yet.

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,920
Have something to drink.

40
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,840
About the teaching assistant position,

41
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,900
I'd like to discuss it with you again.

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,180
You want to be a TA to learn new technologies,

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,480
but don't want to waste time

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,010
or delay your own research.

45
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,880
But I'm not interested in these technologies.

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,760
My goal is to form a band

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,880
and perform in the Shenyun District.

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,010
So we can cooperate.

49
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,680
You go first this time,

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,339
and I'll take the next one.

51
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,600
How's that?

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,480
You like music,

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,520
and so do I.

54
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,000
Take me with you.

55
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,240
That way I can follow him through the script

56
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,840
and complete my assignment.

57
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,640
You need to give your teacher an explanation.

58
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,050
As for music, it depends on my mood.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,440
What?

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,920
Stop the car!

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,560
Stop!

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,680
Are you crazy?

63
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,880
Get out. Get out now!

64
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,810
What's going on?

65
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,120
Hurry up!

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,700
What are you doing?

67
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,120
I have an emergency at home.

68
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,320
Can you bike me home?

69
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,410
What kind of emergency?

70
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,080
Go back by yourself.

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,840
I need to tell you something.

72
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
What is it? Tell me now.

73
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
You like me.

74
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,320
I like you.

75
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,940
I'm not interested in you.

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,159
Wait, that's not right.

78
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,690
This is someone else's car.

79
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,000
It's not his car.

80
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,480
It should be fine, right?

81
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Ding Chongxi.

82
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,010
I was too stupid the last few times.

83
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,320
Why should I be nice about this?

84
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,340
What are you doing?

85
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,520
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,880
I'll pay you back next time.

87
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,840
You're crazy!

88
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Let's go, Ding.

89
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
I'll settle this with you tomorrow.

90
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,000
Please don't go.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,730
I don't want to see you blown up.

92
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,240
Blown up?

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,280
Number 7 alert: target will be exposed.

94
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,440
Unable to wake Ding Chongxi.

95
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,480
Mission restart.

96
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,520
This world was created by me.

97
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,000
You...

98
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,920
What are you doing?

99
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,280
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,920
Lin Yu.

101
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,780
I finally found you at school.

102
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Who are you?

103
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm your brother Wu Zhun's friend.

104
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,980
Liu Jun.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,880
I know you.

106
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,080
Hey, Jun.

107
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,920
The car is in such a state

108
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,180
and you're still grinning like an idiot.

109
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm sorry, Jun.

110
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,370
I didn't know this was your car.

111
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,280
Jun.

112
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,080
Why don't you come to my place

113
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,680
and I'll pay you for the damages.

114
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,960
We can bike back.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,060
I get carsick, so I can't ride in cars.

116
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,840
Ding, you drive the car back.

117
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,770
I'd rather take the subway.

118
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,640
Xiaoyu.

119
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,880
Jun, I need to go.

120
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,240
I'll pay you back later.

121
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,960
I'm leaving now.

122
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,740
How she's changed.

123
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,640
I wonder how Ding Chongxi is doing now.

124
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,000
Xiaoyu.

125
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,610
Brother.

126
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,200
Why are you here?

127
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,040
What do you mean why am I here?

128
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,540
Your aunt has entrusted you to me.

129
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,420
Let's see what we want for dinner.

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,400
Bro.

131
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,280
I want to ask you something.

132
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,600
Go ahead.

133
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,120
Generally,

134
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,200
under what circumstances would a car explode?

135
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,740
What part needs to fail for it to explode?

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,520
Well, you see,

137
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,200
things like engine overheating,

138
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,400
electrical leakage, short circuits,

139
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,040
all these could cause it.

140
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,240
Electrical leakage?

141
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,970
There's another possibility.

142
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,290
Someone plants explosives in the car.

143
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,760
