1
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,640
Of course I remember you.

2
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,520
You stole my brother's girlfriend.

3
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,320
Jerk.

4
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,360
I...

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,930
What's going on?

6
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,120
Wu Zhun.

7
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,479
Why did you lie to Nana?

8
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,520
Why did you cheat?

9
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,640
Listen to me.

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
First of all,

11
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Nana and I weren't officially in a relationship.

12
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
Second,

13
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,720
shouldn't I consider multiple options?

14
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,880
I need to thoroughly observe them

15
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,210
to see if we have potential for a sustainable relationship.

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,080
So what I'm doing

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,610
isn't cheating.

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,039
Your nonsense might fool others,

19
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:58,880
but not me.

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,600
Let me tell you,

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,320
Nana is my very best friend.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,860
You must apologize to her.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
And also,

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
drop that player talk.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,370
Otherwise, don't call me your sister.

26
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,400
I'll apologize, okay?

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,850
That's more like it.

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,280
It's all because of you.

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,680
Nana doesn't even want to perform anymore.

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,079
Then I'll personally escort her, okay?

31
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,040
I promise.

32
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,400
She won't miss this performance.

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,840
Then you two go ahead first.

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,079
I'll join you after I finish the assignment from my teacher.

35
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,480
I hope by then Nana will have forgiven you.

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,480
Okay.

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,600
Ding Chongxi.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,930
What are you doing here?

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,520
Let's talk.

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
About what?

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,200
Man to man.

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,640
When did I ever steal your girlfriend?

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,920
It's those who deceive Xiaoyu with lies.

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,480
I've warned you.

45
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,000
You need to learn to let go.

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,480
I genuinely like her.

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
You genuinely like her?

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Her dream is to enter the tech industry.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,530
Can you pave the way for her?

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,370
Or can you provide her any help?

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,800
Serve.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,730
Talking big without thinking.

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,500
You know me, don't you?

54
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,079
We're all men here.

55
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,960
Don't I know what you're thinking?

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,640
Here.

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,860
She can't stay at your place forever.

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,680
She doesn't have to leave home.

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,480
She doesn't have to get married either.

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,140
I can shoulder these responsibilities for her.

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,320
This junior

62
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,480
is so lame.

63
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,760
The road to Shenyun District

64
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,920
due to the recent continuous rainfall.

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,800
Look at Ding.

66
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,480
The road collapsed at 6 p.m. today.

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,000
Rescue operations are underway now.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,840
Several people have been injured so far.

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,370
Do you know how hard she worked for this debut?

70
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,320
Then I'll take her there myself.

71
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
I promise

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
she won't miss this performance.

73
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:37,960
Let's go

74
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,159
to Shenyun District.

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Where are you going?

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,120
Hurry up.

77
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,640
Are you okay?

78
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm fine.

79
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Why are you here?

80
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,570
We were taking the small path to Shenyun District

81
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,920
when we saw this crowd gathering here.

82
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,720
Someone was calling your name.

83
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,780
I thought something happened to you.

84
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,440
I was worried about you on your brother's behalf.

85
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,370
You're going to Shenyun District?

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Yes.

87
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,920
My brother and Nana are actually stranded on that path.

88
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,120
Can you take me there?

89
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,920
Sure.

90
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,800
By the way,

91
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,440
when are you planning to head back?

92
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,900
Could you take us with you?

93
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,120
Of course.

94
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,200
Great, thanks.

95
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Xiaoyu.

96
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,840
Did Ding give you this camera?

97
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,800
He did.

98
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
Have you looked at the photos inside?

99
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,920
Ding spent three years preparing it for you,

100
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,840
documenting your high school days.

101
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,720
What three years?

102
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,680
What photos?

103
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,240
I never stole your brother's girlfriend.

104
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,200
Your brother didn't want you to have a good impression of me.

105
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Why?

106
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,040
Because he's been in love with you for three years.

107
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,610
What's going on?

108
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,500
The car broke down.

109
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,280
The car seems to have broken down. Let me check.

110
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,240
It doesn't matter if it's broken.

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,640
It's okay.

112
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,920
We're not far from there anyway.

113
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,840
Let's walk.

114
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,360
Sure.

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,920
Ding,

116
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,200
don't forget to get the stuff from the car.

117
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
Hey,

118
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
he's got a lot of things prepared in his car.

119
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Is there any food?

120
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,760
Yes.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,820
I'll get it for you.

122
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,600
Wait.

123
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,640
I'll get it.

124
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,920
Why are you acting strange?

125
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,400
Lin Yu.

126
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,640
I like you.

127
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,200
Miao Qingluan Lin Weizheng.

128
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,720
Miao Qingdu Lin Weizheng.

129
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,560
Miao Qingluan Lin Weizheng.

130
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:28,960
Miao Qingluan Lin Wei.

131
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,560
Miao Qingluan Lin Weizheng.

132
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,160
Weicong.

133
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,080
Weiyou.

134
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,300
Jun Yuanyi.

135
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,180
Dong Shan Tong Yun.

136
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,640
Yi Han Si Ling Zhen Dong Shan Tong Yun Feng Xin.

137
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,360
Xin Ting Qi Cheng Rong Qi Xia Yi Han Si.

138
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,880
