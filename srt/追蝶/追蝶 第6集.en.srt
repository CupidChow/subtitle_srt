1
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,120
Let's go.

2
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Didn't you already beat my brother?

3
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,320
Are you concerned about your ex-girlfriend

4
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,520
or my brother?

5
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,840
I'm not going to roll call.

6
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,880
Can you go for me?

7
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,890
Where are you going?

8
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,380
To the rehearsal room.

9
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,880
Come find me after class.

10
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,900
We're rehearsing.

11
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,100
Do you want to join?

12
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,280
Am I interrupting something?

13
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,760
Interrupting what?

14
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,480
Come on in.

15
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
What do you mean?

16
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,920
It's raining outside.

17
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,120
I just remembered I left my laundry out.

18
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,579
Why did you pull me in here?

19
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,960
You can only protect Ding Chongxi

20
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,520
and follow his storyline. No other options available.

21
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,160
Why should I protect him?

22
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,500
He clearly said yesterday

23
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,320
that those three girls were band members he invited.

24
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,720
And yesterday, he and...

25
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,160
He walked me home yesterday.

26
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
What did I even see in him?

27
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,279
He's so fickle and keeps me at arm's length.

28
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,000
Player.

29
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,200
My brother was right.

30
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,320
And he already has a girlfriend.

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
What does that make me if I keep chasing him?

32
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
Sorry.

33
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,730
Number 7 cannot answer your question.

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,480
Please return to the script.

35
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,400
You.

36
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,800
I

37
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,080
just remembered that

38
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,960
my brother has already collected the clothes.

39
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,400
But I haven't parked my bicycle properly.

40
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,680
I need to go check it again.

41
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,340
I'll wait for you downstairs.

42
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,610
I'm not leaving.

43
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,810
I'll keep an eye on him downstairs.

44
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,040
That whole act just now

45
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,240
was just to annoy her on purpose.

46
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,480
You don't actually like her, do you?

47
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,020
You really have romance on the brain.

48
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,060
I shouldn't get too close to certain people,

49
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,080
otherwise I'll get the wrong idea about being in love.

50
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,159
Why aren't they here yet?

51
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,080
Are you done practicing?

52
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,240
Where's Nana?

53
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,320
Nana needs to practice a bit more.

54
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,520
Are you going to continue?

55
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,600
I'm done for now.

56
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,130
It's raining. I want to go home and change my clothes.

57
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,160
I'll meet up with you guys later.

58
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,530
I'm done with practice.

59
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,400
Let me take you home.

60
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,640
You have a girlfriend now and you're still holding me like this.

61
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,500
It's not right.

62
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
I really don't want to walk with you.

63
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,240
But I can't not walk with you either.

64
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,760
I'll walk home.

65
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,040
No taxi, no bus.

66
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,640
Yesterday he got home safely by bicycle, right?

67
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,680
Today...

68
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,080
How about...

69
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,120
I'll take you home first.

70
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,680
Then I'll ride your bike back to my place.

71
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,770
You have a fever.

72
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,520
You need to go home early.

73
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,520
I'll ride the bike back to school for you tomorrow.

74
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,800
How did you get to school this morning?

75
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,880
By bus.

76
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,880
That's not right.

77
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,770
Is it safe for him to take public transport alone?

78
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,780
He came by himself.

79
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,370
So you're planning to go back alone later?

80
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,480
No, no, no.

81
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,660
It's settled then.

82
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,540
You'll go home by yourself later.

83
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,520
Go home early.

84
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,880
We have a deal, right?

85
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,280
He has a fever again.

86
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,160
He's fine now.

87
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,120
I finally know why the car exploded.

88
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,960
System, system.

89
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,800
System.

90
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,400
Can I view the previous video records?

91
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,880
Sorry,

92
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,940
you don't have permission to view all past records.

93
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,840
Well,

94
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,400
what can I view then?

95
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,240
I just want to know

96
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,400
under what circumstances

97
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,240
Ding Chongxi's car exploded.

98
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
I want to find a pattern.

99
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,280
After all,

100
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
when he rode in the car this morning,

101
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,000
he was quite safe.

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,260
Number 7 is retrieving data within your permission level.

103
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,080
Good, hurry up.

104
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Ding Chongxi with his intimate female companion

105
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,280
at the school entrance.

106
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,810
An explosion occurred in Ding Chongxi's car.

107
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,480
Ding Chongxi and his friend Liu Jun

108
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
were in Liu Jun's car at the school entrance

109
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,280
when an explosion occurred.

110
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,200
Liu Jun.

111
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,240
Ding Chongxi and band member Nana

112
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,600
were in a taxi at the school entrance when an explosion occurred.

113
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,800
Ding Chongxi and his rival Wu Zhun

114
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,120
were outside Lin Yu's home

115
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,560
when an explosion occurred in Wu Zhun's car.

116
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,020
Search results complete.

117
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,400
Wait.

118
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,140
What else can I search for?

119
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,410
You don't have any other permissions.

120
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
What was I thinking

121
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,840
when I set up this system?

122
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,360
Why didn't I give myself access?

123
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Just as I thought.

124
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,760
As long as Ding Chongxi is alone in the car,

125
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,000
nothing happens.

126
