1
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,080
Don't cry.

2
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,080
We'll meet again.

3
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,440
Goodbye?

4
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,720
Ding Chongxi

5
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,200
This dream again.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,320
He's here. He's here.

7
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,160
It's him.

8
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,880
Bye.

9
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,320
Lin Yu.

10
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,410
Here you go. Here you go.

11
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,210
Here you go. Here you go.

12
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,520
Here you go. Here you go.

13
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Okay. Okay. Okay.

14
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,560
Can I add you?

15
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,079
contact number?

16
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,520
Okay.

17
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,600
I'll ask you out for dinner.

18
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,520
He and I are from the same school.

19
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,720
of the same school.

20
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
is the frontline technology of brain science.

21
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,920
It's also the key subject of your major.

22
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,600
The brain connection we're talking about

23
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,000
into electronic flush signal and transfer back to the brain.

24
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,760
interfering with neurons electric activities

25
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,680
so that the main body can get the corresponding feeling and experience.

26
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,940
Attention, everyone.

27
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Ding Chongxi.

28
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,600
Here.

29
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,880
I remember you were in high school.

30
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,159
His name is Ding Chongxi.

31
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:02,680
Is he the top science student of Yan Qing High School?

32
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,480
Okay, you'll be my assistant from now on.

33
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,560
You got it wrong.

34
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,520
I’m Ding Chongxi, No.35.

35
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,760
No.35 can’t sit in my classroom.

36
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,000
Sir.

37
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,120
If the Number One Scholar is fake,

38
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,060
you'll delay other students.

39
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,720
We still have Yan Qing High School's Science Science Science Science Science Science Science Science.

40
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,580
Where is Lin Yu?

41
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,800
Come up and have a battle.

42
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,159
I don't have time.

43
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,530
If you want to take it as I give it to you,

44
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,880
how about I give it to you?

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Let's start.

46
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,520
Why should I let him?

47
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,320
I want to be the assistant.

48
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,040
Not bad.

49
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,200
I won just now.

50
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,800
Why should I cooperate with him?

51
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,280
He let you win.

52
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
Let's compete again.

53
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,760
I don't think it's necessary.

54
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Let's do that.

55
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,960
Come here.

56
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,000
Take it.

57
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,520
These

58
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,120
you two revise them and give them to me tonight.

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,640
Sir.

60
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,060
We'll split it.

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,920
I'm in charge of you now.

62
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,720
About the assistant...

63
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,200
Yes.

64
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,080
Well,

65
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,610
Since you like being an assistant so much,

66
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,980
I'll give it all to you.

67
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
I have my own business.

68
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
The teacher just asked me to cooperate with you.

69
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,440
Do your own thing.

70
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,760
Where am I?

71
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Hello.

72
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm No. 7 AI developed by you.

73
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,880
You're in the script right now.

74
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,960
AI.

75
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
A script?

76
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,480
Yes.

77
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,640
You and your target

78
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,120
with your target.

79
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,850
You must complete the rescue mission.

80
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,600
What rescue mission?

81
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,920
Am I dreaming again?

82
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,240
You're losing your memory.

83
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,960
No. 7 is looking back

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,600
the past data for you.

85
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,720
Do you know Ding Chongxi?

86
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,680
A first-year relationship.

87
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,960
Because of a car accident,

88
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,800
Ding Chongxi was in a deep coma.

89
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,039
After testing,

90
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,000
he only has three months of life.

91
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,200
You can only stop the accident

92
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,679
from the accident

93
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,840
will be erased.

94
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
By then,

95
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,120
he will wake up.

96
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,000
Turns out

97
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,720
these are not dreams.

98
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
From now on,

99
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,040
the system has fixed some of your memory functions.

100
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
You must try your best to protect Ding Chongxi.

101
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,860
and finish the script.

102
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,000
But I don't know him well.

103
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,280
How can I follow him?

104
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,800
Sorry.

105
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,840
This is your mission.

106
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Please return to your script.

107
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,120
What are you reading?

108
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,760
Nothing.

109
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,440
Ding Chongxi.

110
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,090
Politician.

111
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,400
Miao Qing became the regent of Lin.

112
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,080
Miao Qing became the regent of Lin.

113
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,920
Win, pass, pass.

114
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,480
Miao Qing, Lin Yinzheng.

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,440
Weicong.

116
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,760
Hello. Hello.

117
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Shantong Yunfeng

118
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,770
Yaoyao, Qiqi, look at Qixia and think.

119
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,240
Fleur.

120
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,120
Yi Jingjing is smart.

121
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,200
Gui Xinyi.

122
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,130
YI and Kai Cheng Hao.

123
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,360
Ziyuan Jun. Prince Jing.
