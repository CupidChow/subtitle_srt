1
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,480
It's here. It's here.

2
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,920
Ding Chongxi’s car exploded.

3
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,980
It must be because the car broke down.

4
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,480
Then why did Yoo Jun's car explode?

5
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,080
Is it not about the car?

6
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,780
Someone really put a bomb bag.

7
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Impossible.

8
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,280
If someone really put a bomb bag,

9
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,880
someone would have caught him in reality.

10
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,960
No way.

11
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,160
I'm such a fool. I wrote it in the script.

12
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,100
Is there something wrong with my skills?

13
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,120
There's a bug in this system.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,640
So annoying.

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,560
If you can't find the pattern of the explosion,

16
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,320
it’s the only way

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,800
is the only way.

18
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,160
Lin Yu.

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,480
I'm going to the rehearsal room to form a band.

20
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,040
That person was detained by the teacher.

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,920
Please cooperate with me.

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,880
Get her out.

23
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,100
Let's go. Let's go.

24
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,720
Okay.

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm looking for you.

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,040
Let's go.

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
Are the drums ready?

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,760
Is the bass tune ready?

29
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,560
Yes.

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,680
And

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,240
Speaking of grades,

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,440
I'll see who

33
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,920
to make trouble in my class.

34
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,880
What's wrong with you?

35
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,520
Which department are you from?

36
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
I was wrong.

37
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,920
I only have a little hobby.

38
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,120
How dare you deny it?

39
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,040
If you make trouble again,

40
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,680
the school will punish you.

41
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,760
What trouble?

42
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,320
I was sold out by those bastards.

43
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,130
What are you talking about?

44
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,560
You jerk!

45
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Why did the taxi explode too?

46
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,400
Wait.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Don't go in.

48
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,200
I'll bring him out for you.

49
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,360
That teacher is very pretentious.

50
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
He'll punish you.

51
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,720
I...

52
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
I'm willing to pay the price for you.

53
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,720
Your band

54
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,770
Take me with you.

55
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,880
What can you do?

56
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,120
I...

57
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,960
I know nothing.

58
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,000
But I like you.

59
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,170
I want to follow you.

60
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,810
I can't tell from your face that I like you.

61
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,040
In my heart.

62
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,300
Let's bring him out first.

63
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

64
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Just wait.

65
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
Let's make a deal.

66
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll arrange your schedule today.

67
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,520
Deal.

68
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,920
The drum is ready.

69
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,280
Is the bass tune ready?

70
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
Come with me now.

71
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,800
Who are you?

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,520
Shut up!

73
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,560
Stop!

74
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,440
Wait.

75
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,050
Where are you taking me?

76
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,560
Don't worry. You'll know when you get there.

77
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,159
This...

78
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,920
Na Na!

79
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,400
Na Na, come back!

80
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,440
Na Na, no.

81
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,240
Stop!

82
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Lower your voice.

83
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,840
I'll be punished by the teacher.

84
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,680
He came out blatantly.

85
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,600
It's okay. He's just a tool.

86
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,360
Once again, he'll forget everything.

87
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,600
Just like how you betrayed me last time.

88
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
What?

89
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,560
Nothing.

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
I brought him out for you.

91
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,570
It's time to keep your promise.

92
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,920
Nana.

93
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,640
Send the application form to Shenyun District.

94
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,240
or it'll be too late.

95
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,200
Okay.

96
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm leaving.

97
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,920
Bye.

98
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,760
Bye.

99
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,280
Tell me. What's your plan?

100
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
What's your plan?

101
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,040
I can't get a taxi at night.

102
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,440
If he doesn't drive or take the bus,

103
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,780
I'll be able to make it through today.

104
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,400
But how can I let him live this day?

105
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,400
I want to put an automatic code

106
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,360
into the interactive game.

107
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,720
Then we can detect different players

108
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,980
of different players.

109
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,000
But I've never played a game.

110
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,440
So I want to ask you.

111
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,100
I've never played one before.

112
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,480
One.

113
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,400
It’s a game. It’s a game.

114
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,460
Sweeping thunder?

115
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,320
What kind of game is that?

116
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,440
Come with me.

117
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,920
Let me show you.

118
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,880
I've never played a game.

119
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,940
How can we design a matching program?

120
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,160
Not necessarily.

121
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,560
After all,

122
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
in the system I designed.

123
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,040
to see how good you are.

124
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
Follow me later.

125
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,080
I'll win.

126
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,680
Do you want to kill me?

127
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,520
Didn't you say you'd win?

128
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,760
I didn't expect you to be so weak.

129
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,840
Follow me.

130
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,200
Not bad.

131
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,800
I said I'd win.

132
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,360
Me too.

133
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,000
Did you drive today?

134
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
My car broke down.

135
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,120
Let's ride back.

136
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,000
Are you really going to date me?

137
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,320
Miao Qing, Lin Yinzheng.

138
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,560
Miao Qingnan, Lin Yinzheng.

139
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,080
Weicong.

140
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,400
Wai-woo.

141
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,760
Yan Yan.

142
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,400
Dongshan Tung Yun

143
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,610
Come on, let's go

144
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,290
She's smart and bright. She's bright and bright.

145
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
Yee-yi-yi-yi, Hammer-Rain, Yu, Kai Ching-yi and Ching-yi bribed Chin-yi from Qianqian Garden

146
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,450
Yiyun, Xiyuan, Hanxia Rain, Yu Kai Ching, Ching Yi and Ching Yi.

147
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,520
Let's go. Let's go.
