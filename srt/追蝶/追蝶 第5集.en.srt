1
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,200
What?

2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
Your sister is Lin Yu?

3
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,320
Get ready.

4
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,360
Three, two, one.

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,010
Let me see first.

6
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,780
What are you doing?

7
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,440
Why are you nervous?

8
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,360
Got secrets in there?

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,289
I'm not nervous.

10
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,120
Liu Jun, hold him back.

11
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,650
Wow, Ding, you're something else.

12
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
You've been keeping it well hidden.

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,039
We're all brothers here.

14
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,570
Let me be straight with you.

15
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm deleting these photos now.

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,039
Stay away from my sister from now on.

17
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,600
Wait.

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,530
What's going on?

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,920
I was taking pictures of the scenery.

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,250
Why did you delete them?

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,040
You were clearly taking pictures of Lin Yu.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,800
Lin Yu is the most beautiful scenery.

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,720
Ding is right.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,840
Well...

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,890
She was just in the scenery.

26
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,370
Who would believe that?

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,780
This is the high school we both attended.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,079
These contents mean that

29
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,140
Ding Chongxi has a secret crush on me.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
Number 7 only shares memory fragments,

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,900
ensures the authenticity of this information,

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,079
to help you protect Ding Chongxi

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,520
and complete the script.

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,320
So,

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,200
why has he been

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,720
acting like he doesn't know me these days?

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,640
Or maybe he simply doesn't remember at all.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,700
Please return to your script.

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,650
Why is he pretending not to know me?

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,360
I thought you left.

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,770
It's not safe

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,640
at this hour.

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,560
Get in.

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,960
Tell me the right way.

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,000
This way,

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,210
go straight.

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,400
Bro.

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,380
What happened?

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
She's hurt.

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,560
No matter what happens in the future,

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,240
call me first.

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,680
Don't trust

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,360
anyone else.

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,280
Since you two are old friends,

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,080
why don't you go inside and chat?

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,200
Sure,

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,530
let's go in for a bit.

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,380
We can have a good talk.

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,760
Just for a short visit.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,240
This atmosphere...

61
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,519
I finally have an excuse

62
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,850
to follow Ding Chongxi.

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,760
I hope I didn't mess things up.

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
Never mind.

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
It's too late today.

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,010
Some other time.

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
It has to be today.

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
Alright.

69
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,400
What would you like to drink?

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,659
I'm on a diet recently.

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
I don't eat in the evening.

72
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,080
You really should lose some weight with that tiny frame of yours.

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,360
Yet here you are eating and drinking at this hour.

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,480
You'll soon have a fat belly.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,600
You greasy old man.

76
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,840
What exactly happened between you two

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,900
after high school?

78
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,560
Xiaoyu.

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,200
When you find a boyfriend in the future,

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
you need someone who truly cares about you.

81
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,680
At the very least,

82
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,680
he should treat you better than your brother does.

83
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,960
You're badly hurt.

84
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,410
My sister has always been accident-prone since she was little.

85
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,320
So I specially prepared a first aid kit for her.

86
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,160
These are her favorite stuffed animals from elementary school.

87
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,890
These are her favorite comics since she was born.

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,120
These are concerts she loved attending in high school.

89
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,380
All these are tickets.

90
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,520
Look at that,

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,360
that room.

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
I decorated it for her with my own hands.

93
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,680
Everything I've done

94
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,880
was hoping that Xiaoyu

95
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,440
could have a happy and fulfilling childhood.

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,560
Brother.

97
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,640
Didn't I just buy all these recently?

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,180
It doesn't matter.

99
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,920
You're becoming more and more like her father.

100
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,760
Does she need another dad?

101
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,250
First period tomorrow is music class.

102
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,900
If you're interested,

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,080
you can come and see.

104
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,210
Hanging out with you

105
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,880
was fun.

106
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,420
It's getting late.

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,440
I should go.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Sis.

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Didn't you always want some funding

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
for your research and development?

111
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,960
Well,

112
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,300
I'll sell my car tomorrow to support you.

113
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,880
Thank you, brother.

114
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Take me back.

115
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,420
Let's talk in private.

116
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,760
Let's go.

117
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,570
Brother,

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
he can't ride in a car,

119
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,880
and you can't either.

120
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,040
This is between us men.

121
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,300
We need to find a place to settle this.

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,520
Brother, get down now.

123
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
I barely made it through today.

124
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,610
My brother's car will really explode.

125
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,560
Bro, tell me quickly

126
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,840
what exactly happened between you two?

127
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,240
How did your friendship fall apart?

128
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,040
What's the beef between you two?

129
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,410
He stole my girlfriend.

130
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,080
He

131
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,720
cheated on you.

132
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,610
First period tomorrow is music class.

133
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,420
If you're interested, you can come check it out.

134
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,240
I had fun hanging out with you.

135
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,080
It's getting late.

136
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,940
I should go now.

137
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,280
I'll come to you tomorrow for music lessons.

138
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,880
You go ahead.

139
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,340
There's a bicycle prepared for you outside.

140
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,940
What are you doing?

141
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,560
Brother, I'm hungry.

142
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,770
Could you make me something to eat?

143
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,080
Wait for me, okay?

144
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,680
We only have noodles left at home.

145
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
I want braised meatballs.

146
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,560
Brother.

147
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,320
Brother?

148
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,960
Alright.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,130
I'll make it for you.

150
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,160
What?

151
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,720
You want some too?

152
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,080
Well,

153
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
I'll go then.

154
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,720
Perfect.

155
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,900
Finally, I have a reason to follow Ding Chongxi.

156
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
Ding Chongxi.

157
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,320
Your outfit looks familiar.

158
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,760
Ding Chongxi wore it yesterday.

159
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
Doesn't everyone have clothes?

160
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,160
What matters is who's wearing them.

161
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,720
So,

162
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,900
don't I look better in it than he does?

163
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,810
Let's go.

164
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,560
I'll take you to school.

165
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,360
No need.

166
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,320
Let's go.

167
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,280
Brother.

168
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,240
Can we have chicken wings on Friday?

169
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,770
I'll make them for you when I get home tonight.

170
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,680
Don't tell me you two are

171
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,210
jealous of each other and copying each other?

172
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,200
Me? Jealous of him?

173
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,440
He's just a player.

174
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,940
Don't be fooled by him.

175
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,680
