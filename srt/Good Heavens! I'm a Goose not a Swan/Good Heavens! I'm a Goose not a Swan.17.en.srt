1
00:02:26,238 --> 00:02:28,160
Judging from the color of her sash and robe,

2
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:31,160
this woman was likely a courtesan called Nual.

3
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,680
There's no doubt, sir.

4
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:34,920
Nual's ghost!

5
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
Nual! You're alive?

6
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,299
He's after you because you saw his face, right?

7
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:44,264
I saw the face of the one who hired him.

8
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,361
Nual can't go back to Fang's just yet,

9
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:47,711
not until the case is over.

10
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:50,280
This is my father's old warehouse.

11
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,720
I promise you'll be fine here.

12
00:02:56,624 --> 00:02:57,960
Stay still!

13
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:04,560
They snuck in, and Boonta screamed hard like she was dying.

14
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,279
She was struggling that much?

15
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,920
There was a loud noise,

16
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,160
and the whole warehouse was shaking.

17
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,336
They let the slaves join in!

18
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:13,720
Really?

19
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:48,160
Where are you taking the food?

20
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,600
Are you

21
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,720
eating with your husband?

22
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,440
Husband, my butt! I'm taking it to Aunt Mian.

23
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,780
She's staying at her husband's.

24
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,960
She's still sick, so I think I should visit.

25
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:04,918
Bye.

26
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:10,687
I'm going.

27
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,960
Don't worry.

28
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,440
Hey! Where are you lot going?

29
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:25,560
- It's urgent! - Go.

30
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:26,800
What's so urgent?

31
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,320
We're about to open soon!

32
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,560
Ming, come with me. It's urgent.

33
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:36,240
You have something urgent too?

34
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,800
It's as the people say.

35
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,920
Luang?

36
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,160
There are too many numbers.

37
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,480
How do you read this?

38
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,040
It's not hard.

39
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:26,680
Above the vertical line is chang.

40
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:29,080
The upper left is tamleung.

41
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,375
The upper right is baht.

42
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:33,800
Lower right is saleung.

43
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:36,480
Lower left is feung.

44
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,840
Below the vertical line is phai.

45
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:40,880
When you read,

46
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:45,088
chang, tamleung, baht, saleung,

47
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,920
feung, phai.

48
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,040
You can shorten it to one of the quarters.

49
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,200
You think this is not hard?

50
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,680
I need some "aspirin" in my hands.

51
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:02,200
- "Aspirin?" - Yes, sir.

52
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:03,912
What does it mean?

53
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:07,336
I mean, it gives me a headache, sir.

54
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:10,064
Fang asked me to do her account,

55
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:12,145
but it wasn't this complicated.

56
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,040
Then you should learn this.

57
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,880
Soon, when you live in my house,

58
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,800
you can spare my headache.

59
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:24,080
The headache is not coming soon.

60
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
It's now. Dokgaew is coming here.

61
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:31,160
Crap! How did she find this place?

62
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,904
What are you doing here?

63
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,440
What about you? What are you doing here?

64
00:06:42,472 --> 00:06:43,760
What an odd question.

65
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:45,280
I'm here to see Chang.

66
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:46,880
Chang is working here.

67
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,800
But I saw Boonta going in earlier,

68
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,440
and Luang Vasuthep followed her inside.

69
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,760
They both looked suspicious.

70
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,120
I suspect that

71
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:59,520
Boonta is seeing Luang Vasuthep behind your back.

72
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,000
She's probably seducing Luang Vasuthep.

73
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,400
He's your close friend and cousin.

74
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,800
How could he betray you like this?

75
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:12,160
You just saw that and think that far?

76
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,160
I know you and Luang Vasuthep are close, and you trust each other.

77
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,840
But love is not something you can control.

78
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:21,160
If you don't want to regret this,

79
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,640
I think we should barge in.

80
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:25,600
Dokgaew!

81
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
She's here to catch Luang Thukkarat with her.

82
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,960
Why is she getting jealous of Luang Vasuthep instead?

83
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:39,000
Where is Boonta, sir?

84
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:41,223
I saw her come in with my own eyes.

85
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,320
Where did you hide her?

86
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,960
You were probably seeing things.

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,480
Chang and I are here alone.

88
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,400
I wasn't seeing things.

89
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,080
Dang saw it too, sir.

90
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:55,440
I did, sir.

91
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:59,200
Because I saw you,

92
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
your plan is ruined.

93
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
Is that why Chang is covering up for you?

94
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:06,320
Why would I do that?

95
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:08,440
To hide it from Chaai.

96
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,032
Why else would you and Boonta sneak in?

97
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,520
What am I in your eyes?

98
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:17,400
Do I look like someone who can steal my friend's girl?

99
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,960
Do I also look stupid enough to pick this place

100
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,167
to do something behind Chaai's back?

101
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,680
Dokgaew.

102
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,920
Your idea is nonsensical.

103
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,560
I'm right here working.

104
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,400
Puek and Boonta can't do anything weird.

105
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:43,560
So you two can prove to me

106
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,640
that what I said is false.

107
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:21,960
Is there anything else unclear?

108
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
If Boonta isn't here,

109
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,168
what are you doing here, sir?

110
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:30,360
I'm here to visit Chang.

111
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,840
It's what cousins do.

112
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,440
In an old warehouse, sir?

113
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:37,880
Oh? Chang uses this place to work occasionally.

114
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,271
Do you expect him to go to a temple?

115
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:43,840
So why are you here, Dokgaew?

116
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:49,400
Dang heard rumors from the market

117
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,200
that you and Boonta were making love here.

118
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,800
I felt uncomfortable.

119
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:56,757
I don't want your reputation ruined by the gossip.

120
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:58,480
So you're here to tell Boonta off.

121
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:01,120
But she saw me instead, so it's a misunderstanding.

122
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,760
So that's what happened?

123
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,080
I misunderstood you too, Dokgaew.

124
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:08,960
I thought you came here to catch Chaai in the act.

125
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
Or...

126
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Did you come here to catch Puek?

127
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,880
I didn't come here to catch anyone.

128
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm glad nothing's going on.

129
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:21,760
I'm going home.

130
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:24,160
- Let's go, Dang. - I'll walk with you.

131
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:27,080
I have all day to walk with you.

132
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:30,600
No need, sir.

133
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:33,040
We came here on our own. We can go home on our own.

134
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,520
I'll check on Boonta.

135
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,120
Don't go.

136
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,440
Come on down.

137
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:04,520
Dokgaew won't come back.

138
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:16,000
Go without me.

139
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,960
Boonta!

140
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:11,240
We're in the middle of a chaos!

141
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:14,000
Yet you snuck out to see your man?

142
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,960
Mother, why are you here?

143
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:21,440
I followed you!

144
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,080
And it's not just me.

145
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,880
You all can come out!

146
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,080
What are you all doing here?

147
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:37,295
We all were wondering the same thing, sir.

148
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,063
Just why does Boonta keep sneaking out?

149
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,360
So she snuck out here to see you.

150
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,560
He's not buying your freedom, and you're stupid enough to offer yourself.

151
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,800
Boonta, don't you know restraint?

152
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,440
No matter how good a man looks,

153
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,360
no matter how good he is in bed,

154
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,445
if you sleep with him without getting paid, you're stupid!

155
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,791
Please stop.

156
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:04,440
You all are misunderstanding.

157
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,720
That's right. The rumors are false.

158
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,440
Chaai and I didn't come here to "hook up."

159
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:20,200
I mean, we weren't making love, and we weren't

160
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:22,080
doing anything indecent.

161
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,280
And I intend to buy her freedom.

162
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,600
I'm just trying to convince my mother

163
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,160
so that Boonta can live happily in my house.

164
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:34,600
Can Mrs. Tubtim be convinced?

165
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:37,129
She seems to want Dokgaew desperately as her daughter-in-law.

166
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:40,600
Are you buying Boonta off as your second wife?

167
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
I intend to have only one wife.

168
00:15:20,363 --> 00:15:23,400
No! Mother, wait!

169
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:25,760
That's not it! That's

170
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
a woman, not a ghost!

171
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,520
She's alive.

172
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,680
Nual!

173
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,240
Help me down.

174
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:39,040
So, what happened to Nual?

175
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,920
Why is she here?

176
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:47,720
Mother, that body wasn't Nual. It was Oeb from Hom's.

177
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,680
Nual

178
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,600
found out something about the suspect.

179
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:54,760
Chaai is hiding her here for her safety.

180
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:57,520
He's trying to find the suspect.

181
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:02,200
Do any of you know anything about Oeb?

182
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:11,167
Oeb is of Vietnamese descent like me, sir.

183
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,920
Lamduan and I have known her since childhood.

184
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:15,720
We were neighbors.

185
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:18,800
Your home is Tha Tien, isn't it?

186
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:20,280
Yes, sir.

187
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,800
I heard the girls at Hom's say

188
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,240
before Oeb disappeared,

189
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:26,032
she snuck out of the brothel

190
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,575
and got caught and locked up.

191
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:29,200
That's just like Lamduan's case.

192
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:33,120
I once went into Hom's brothel.

193
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,000
The room she used to lock someone up was totally closed,

194
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,400
just like the room I locked Lamduan up in.

195
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:41,840
When Lamduan ran away, I found her at Tha Tien, sir.

196
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,094
Luang is asking about Oeb.

197
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:45,897
Yet you're telling him about Lamduan. Are you stupid?

198
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,320
I just remembered it.

199
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:49,720
They're connected, aren't they?

200
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,880
Do you know if Oeb or Lamduan

201
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,800
had a man courting them?

202
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,480
Oeb disappeared the same day Nual did.

203
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,360
We found no sign of struggle where the body was found.

204
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,800
The people nearby

205
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:12,520
never heard any cry for help, sir.

206
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,880
Oeb's body was found on the side of Khlong Lod.

207
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,200
That wasn't far from where Lamduan was found.

208
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,680
Their bodies were in similar conditions.

209
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,880
They both were also wearing purple sashes.

210
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,840
If the same killer killed them both,

211
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,155
it appears they target...

212
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:41,320
Target courtesans who wear purple sashes, right?

213
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:44,640
- That's right! - Yeah.

214
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:49,200
Those crime shows I did weren't a waste after all.

215
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:53,480
Well, if you weren't a courtesan,

216
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,560
I would push you to be a police officer.

217
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
That's a great idea.

218
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:03,160
We've never had a female police officer.

219
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:06,120
If you become the first, that'd be interesting.

220
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Is that right? I just want to help Chaai catch the killer soon

221
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,080
so we can live in peace, not in fear.

222
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:18,200
If you need our help,

223
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,800
please let us know.

224
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,120
We're willing to help.

225
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,120
Nobody else should die.

226
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:11,920
Spear and sword shows.

227
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:15,200
Spear and sword shows?

228
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,320
Lamduan and Oeb's backs

229
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:20,920
were slashed in lines.

230
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,048
They looked like cuts from a spear or a sword.

231
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:27,208
Their bellies were bruised like they were smashed in.

232
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,800
They were probably crushed with a pestle

233
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:31,200
until their guts and feces

234
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
spilled out all over their robes.

235
00:20:32,952 --> 00:20:34,680
Someone who can do this

236
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,040
is probably an acrobat, sir.

237
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:40,480
The people who perform such dangerous stunts

238
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:42,760
are the Vietnamese Troupe.

239
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,880
I'm going to investigate them.

240
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,520
Luang.

241
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,880
Are you sure you can go on your own?

242
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,480
Your disguise sucked when you visited my place.

243
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,600
Would you take Chor with you?

244
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,040
That's her hometown.

245
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,360
No!

246
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:07,160
You see? If I went with him, Boonta would kill me.

247
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,400
Also, I was born and raised there.

248
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,440
If I went in disguise, I would look familiar and arouse suspicion.

249
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
And If I went without a disguise,

250
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,880
they wouldn't welcome a courtesan like me either.

251
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,320
You won't do this. You won't do that. What will you do then?

252
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,440
I was in a lot of TV shows.

253
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:30,200
This is what we do.

254
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:41,200
(Episode 17: The Detective Couple)

255
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,080
Boonta used an excuse to hang out with her man.

256
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:54,840
But you allowed her to go.

257
00:21:57,488 --> 00:22:01,040
You want Boonta to spend time with Luang. Is that right?

258
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,720
What do you know?

259
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,400
I just said I was willing to help.

260
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,160
How could I have said no?

261
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,440
She went in with a great disguise.

262
00:22:11,576 --> 00:22:13,360
They won't blow their cover, Mother.

263
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:21,400
I forgot to ask Mian to give her some birth control soup.

264
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,040
Forget it.

265
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:26,924
If she gets pregnant,

266
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:28,920
Luang's mother won't lay a hand on her.

267
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:38,000
I don't want to talk too much about this.

268
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:40,200
- Is it true? - It is.

269
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,840
But I can't just keep quiet either!

270
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,337
- This one seems to know a lot of things. - The other day,

271
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:47,401
- I saw Pan. - She's like an old woman next door.

272
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,384
- Come on. - She's Yam's wife, right?

273
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,360
I saw her coming out of the house at night.

274
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:55,320
I don't even want to imagine what...

275
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,640
I got customers. I need to serve Khanom Jeen.

276
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,000
Gorgeous lady.

277
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,040
I would like two Khanom Jeens, please.

278
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:07,680
Of course, gorgeous.

279
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:09,840
She's a sweet talker.

280
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,560
- Here you are. - Thank you, gorgeous.

281
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:24,120
There's a lot of Vietnamese around here lately.

282
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,160
You're not from the capital, are you?

283
00:23:29,087 --> 00:23:34,280
These Vietnamese fled from the War of Hue during King Taksin's reign.

284
00:23:35,423 --> 00:23:37,784
Are you here to see their acrobat troupe?

285
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:44,040
I've only heard about them.

286
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,560
I've never seen their show.

287
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:47,920
I need to warn you to be careful.

288
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,120
Muen Haw doesn't like people sneaking around his house.

289
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,160
He's embarrassed

290
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
by his retarded son,

291
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
who's also ugly.

292
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:58,960
What? Really?

293
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,200
Oh no!

294
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:29,120
My husband!

295
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,240
Does your arm hurt?

296
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:36,360
This is bad! Who's going to provide for our family?

297
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,600
No!

298
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
What do we do now?

299
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,080
Does your arm hurt? Does it? Hey!

300
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,280
Your staff hurt my husband.

301
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:50,052
How would he provide for our family now? What if he loses his arm?

302
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,917
How would I live?

303
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,880
- Dear, no! - Hey.

304
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,440
- Just calm down. - How do we live now?

305
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:58,640
Just calm down!

306
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,800
What are your names?

307
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,400
My husband's name is Choed. My name is Boon...

308
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,240
Pa!

309
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,360
Boonpa, sir!

310
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:12,200
I'm a jewelry merchant. My husband

311
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,760
is a painter.

312
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:15,736
Yeah.

313
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:17,520
Where are you from?

314
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,240
We're from...

315
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,480
From where?

316
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,360
From the North.

317
00:26:25,465 --> 00:26:26,520
Yes.

318
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,920
We came to this place

319
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,360
to take painting jobs around Wat Liab.

320
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,800
That's right, and you hurt your arm. How would you paint now?

321
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:39,800
I think we need a place to stay for a few nights.

322
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:44,560
- This is stressful! I'm too stressed. - Stop!

323
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:46,720
You can spend the night in my cabin.

324
00:26:46,824 --> 00:26:48,360
It's vacant.

325
00:26:51,063 --> 00:26:53,440
He got hurt because of my people.

326
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,920
I'll take responsibility.

327
00:26:55,784 --> 00:26:58,280
Once you get settled, I'll get some medicine for you.

328
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:00,760
That's too kind of you.

329
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:02,400
Thank you so much.

330
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,320
Come on.

331
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:07,840
Yes, sir. My luggage!

332
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:19,160
Walk slowly, my dear husband.

333
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:29,880
This is it.

334
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,040
Thank you.

335
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:40,960
Dum, give me a pot of medicine.

336
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Quick.

337
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:45,600
Boil this and drink it.

338
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,440
Later, Chuen

339
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,760
will get a doctor to see his arm.

340
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,240
It's fine, sir.

341
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:54,440
It doesn't hurt as much now.

342
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,760
I'll feel better after some rest.

343
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,160
You can get some rest. You've worked hard all day.

344
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,560
Is that how you talk to your wife?

345
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:17,472
She seems to love you so much.

346
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,760
Why are you so cold and distant as a husband?

347
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:29,440
Well...

348
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,680
My husband used to own slaves.

349
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,240
It's an old habit.

350
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,000
Thank you so much for your help.

351
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:45,000
Dear, you have to get some rest too.

352
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,880
Let's go.

353
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:00,800
Here.

354
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:19,280
Did you call me "dear" earlier?

355
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,040
Yes, sir.

356
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:26,080
If I hadn't said that, they would have been more suspicious.

357
00:29:32,352 --> 00:29:33,520
Then,

358
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,400
I'll change the way I talk to you too.

359
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:39,520
I'll call you wifey.

360
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,472
My beloved wifey.

361
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,680
Is that good?

362
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,560
Just call me

363
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:50,960
baby, sir.

364
00:29:52,113 --> 00:29:53,360
Wifey?

365
00:29:55,232 --> 00:29:56,498
Okay.

366
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,296
Then you call me

367
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,440
"my dear," alright?

368
00:30:05,273 --> 00:30:06,760
Of course.

369
00:30:07,448 --> 00:30:08,840
My dear.

370
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:13,560
My dear Chaai.

371
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,640
Is this all?

372
00:31:42,104 --> 00:31:45,000
You! You troublemaker!

373
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:49,720
- Father... - Father, don't hurt him. He didn't mean to.

374
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,640
Don't interfere, Chuen!

375
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,040
His mistake

376
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:54,640
caused trouble for everyone!

377
00:31:54,736 --> 00:31:56,960
And you think I shouldn't punish him?

378
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,480
I'm sorry, Father.

379
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,360
If you can't do a simple job,

380
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,080
just leave my house!

381
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:05,360
You're a waste of my food and water!

382
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,640
I promise! I won't make a mistake again!

383
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,840
You shouldn't have been born as my son!

384
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,160
What are you looking at?

385
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:19,304
Go and rehearse your show!

386
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:20,920
Go! I said go!

387
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,280
Go!

388
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,080
He's too cruel.

389
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,720
Could Muen Haw be the killer?

390
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,920
He can be a suspect.

391
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,080
But don't be convinced yet.

392
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,160
Father shouldn't have hurt you this badly.

393
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,920
It's alright.

394
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,920
I made a mistake.

395
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:12,200
I deserve punishment.

396
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:15,800
He did it because he loves me.

397
00:33:16,554 --> 00:33:17,920
Don't worry.

398
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:20,400
I'm fine.

399
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,640
All I want is

400
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,440
to be with Father and you.

401
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,320
Let me see your arm.

402
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,840
What are you doing here?

403
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,362
Well, we came

404
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:55,920
- to take a bath. - For a walk.

405
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah, we'll take a bath and go for a walk.

406
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:06,880
Choed, let's go.

407
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Come on.

408
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,780
Let's take a bath and go for a walk.

409
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,200
Come on, dear.

410
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:24,960
Luang, sir.

411
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:26,416
We should leave.

412
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:28,480
Don't make them more suspicious.

413
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,720
Since you told them we're taking a bath,

414
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,400
let's take a bath.

415
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,960
You mean together?

416
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:48,040
We're husband and wife. Why would we not?

417
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:50,800
If we don't, they will get suspicious.

418
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:52,360
- Huh? - Come on.

419
00:35:19,122 --> 00:35:22,000
My dear, I don't think I'm comfortable with this.

420
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,520
Shouldn't you turn your back?

421
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,160
I'll rub your back if you do.

422
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:02,800
What did you moan for?

423
00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:07,440
My back is red all over, right?

424
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
It's probably

425
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:14,120
not as red as my face.

426
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:17,480
Let me see, then.

427
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,080
My dear, have I ever told you this?

428
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,640
You smell so good.

429
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,960
Even when you're in the water.

430
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,680
It's probably the scent of potpourri.

431
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,320
My mother smoked my clothes with it.

432
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,200
If you like it,

433
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:51,360
I'll hold you like this more often.

434
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,120
I don't want to end our disguise as a couple.

435
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,720
I don't want to either.

436
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:19,240
I wish it were real.

437
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:27,800
I'll wait for the day it becomes real.

438
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:33,848
It won't be long.

439
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,720
I promise.

440
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,280
Over there.

441
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,240
Dum likes to play with carcasses!

442
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,640
Carcasses?

443
00:40:21,863 --> 00:40:26,127
The animals. Cats and dogs in the village disappeared. They found him.

444
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:30,760
They saw Dum smash and hold dead animals.

445
00:40:32,155 --> 00:40:34,527
It's a nasty sight.

446
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,240
Dum is half-witted.

447
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,440
He always embarrasses his father.

448
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Unlike his younger brother, Chuen.

449
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:46,760
He's handsome and smart.

450
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,160
He's also a great acrobat!

451
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:54,920
The elites are coming.

452
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:58,144
I'm not talking about bad things anymore. It's going to bring bad luck.

453
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,160
- I have to go. - Okay.

454
00:41:02,704 --> 00:41:04,680
Khanom Jeen right here!

455
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:06,240
Khanom Jeen!

456
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:08,291
- Walla's Khanom Jeen! - Use the clothes.

457
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:11,760
Pra Aphai's Curry with beansprouts

458
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:14,480
- and Sahatsachai's chili powder! - We're here anyway.

459
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:18,320
Let's stop by the market. Maybe we would find a good gem.

460
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:21,920
I'm going to make a ring for my daughter-in-law.

461
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,000
Who do you mean?

462
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,000
Who else could it be

463
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:28,880
if not Dokgaew?

464
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,120
Did Chaai agree to that?

465
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,160
He will agree.

466
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,800
If he wants that vile woman as a wife,

467
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:40,881
I'll only allow her to be a slave wife.

468
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:43,880
The main wife, legally wedded and respected,

469
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:45,920
can only be Dokgaew.

470
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,171
If he obeys you,

471
00:41:48,296 --> 00:41:52,131
soon we will have the big day!

472
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,080
Of course. Come on. Let's get a good gem.

473
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,560
Right.

474
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:58,960
Let's go.

475
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,040
Wow.

476
00:42:04,128 --> 00:42:07,600
- This one is really good. - That's right.

477
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:09,800
How much is this?

478
00:42:15,252 --> 00:42:16,600
Are you mute?

479
00:42:18,154 --> 00:42:19,720
Well...

480
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:23,680
How much have you bought one for?

481
00:42:27,174 --> 00:42:29,400
We're new in the business.

482
00:42:29,544 --> 00:42:31,840
We don't really know the price, ma'am.

483
00:42:33,729 --> 00:42:37,320
You became a merchant without knowing the trade at all?

484
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:42,855
This gem looks familiar.

485
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:47,968
Where did you get that piece of gem?

486
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,320
- I borrowed it from her. - Oh crap!

487
00:42:55,984 --> 00:42:57,360
Where are you from?

488
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,080
You sound weird.

489
00:42:59,231 --> 00:43:03,640
We're from the North, ma'am.

490
00:43:03,824 --> 00:43:05,200
And...

491
00:43:05,607 --> 00:43:08,640
These gems do look great, ma'am.

492
00:43:08,744 --> 00:43:12,760
But they got some great ones over there. At the other booths, ma'am.

493
00:43:12,848 --> 00:43:15,840
Merchants usually don't tell customers to go to others.

494
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,720
I'm just an honest merchant.

495
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:24,480
Over there! See?

496
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,200
They have great gems too. Dozens of them, ma'am.

497
00:43:33,192 --> 00:43:34,360
- Look. - What?

498
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:36,160
Let's go to other booths.

499
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:39,600
You're buying a gem for your soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

500
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:42,359
Let's buy from a merchant who knows their stuff

501
00:43:42,464 --> 00:43:44,480
and looks more trustworthy.

502
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:47,360
Wait, ma'am.

503
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,400
You're buying one for

504
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:51,720
your daughter-in-law?

505
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,000
Your daughter-in-law should be

506
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:57,000
around my age, right, ma'am?

507
00:43:57,304 --> 00:44:01,160
I think you should do something simple, ma'am.

508
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:06,360
There's a trend for "quiet luxury," ma'am.

509
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:09,000
Kwai? (Stupid)

510
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,799
- Are you calling me stupid? - Whoa!

511
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,840
No, ma'am.

512
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:18,960
"Quiet luxury" is a European word, ma'am.

513
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,160
It means "low key rich" and "not obviously expensive," ma'am.

514
00:44:26,023 --> 00:44:29,320
Mrs. Tubtim and Mrs. Pikul, I think we should go to other booths.

515
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,480
These merchants are weird.

516
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:33,184
I don't think you can trust them, ma'am.

517
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,080
- Hey, come on! - I agree.

518
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:37,542
Let's go. I can't take them anymore.

519
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:40,120
They got a dozen booths over there.

520
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,280
You let a customer name the price? I'd like to buy it.

521
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,240
Oh, are you not selling?

522
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:49,680
It's fake.

523
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:52,160
Wait. Are you packing up?

524
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:56,880
What's wrong with you?

525
00:45:08,135 --> 00:45:09,440
Chuen!

526
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,400
Why are you here?

527
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,680
I'm here to see you.

528
00:45:13,904 --> 00:45:15,800
I haven't seen you for a few days.

529
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:17,360
I miss you.

530
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,480
I miss you too.

531
00:45:23,256 --> 00:45:25,760
Tonight, I'm all yours.

532
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,840
Let's go back to the earlier booth.

533
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The merchant didn't make too much sense,

534
00:45:48,087 --> 00:45:49,640
but the gem is better.

535
00:45:49,776 --> 00:45:51,520
I don't think it will be too expensive.

536
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,040
But...

537
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,960
Where are they?

538
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,920
That couple packed up and left just now, ma'am.

539
00:46:06,071 --> 00:46:08,200
Why did they leave? It's still early.

540
00:46:08,313 --> 00:46:09,592
I don't know, ma'am.

541
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,840
They looked like they were running from a debt collector. There they are!

542
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,694
Tubtim, where are you going?

543
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:18,199
Wait for me!

544
00:46:18,311 --> 00:46:19,631
Where are they all going?

545
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,000
Sorry.

546
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,040
Excuse me.

547
00:46:28,738 --> 00:46:30,800
Tubtim, slow down.

548
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,440
Slow down, ma'am.

549
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,880
Stop. I'm tired.

550
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:38,576
I can't keep up anymore.

551
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:41,440
- Slow down, ma'am. - My robe is coming undone.

552
00:46:51,304 --> 00:46:53,440
I can't run anymore.

553
00:46:54,032 --> 00:46:56,640
My robe is coming undone.

554
00:46:57,926 --> 00:46:59,040
Tubtim.

555
00:46:59,144 --> 00:47:01,640
Do you like their gem so much

556
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,440
that you have to run after them?

557
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,240
That's not it.

558
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:07,760
Something about the couple bothers me.

559
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,360
I think they look familiar.

560
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:15,240
There you go again! Tubtim!

561
00:47:18,977 --> 00:47:21,080
Thank you for your help, Dum.

562
00:47:21,176 --> 00:47:23,176
Without you, we would have been in trouble.

563
00:47:24,055 --> 00:47:25,840
Why do you have to hide?

564
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:29,760
Well...

565
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,800
Those aunts are "bullies."

566
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,480
They insulted us, saying we sell fake gold

567
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,400
and fake gems.

568
00:47:44,032 --> 00:47:46,440
So I don't want to sell to them.

569
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,920
My dear.

570
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,920
You share the same suspicion I have, right?

571
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,960
Who are you running from?

572
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,560
Should I help you?

573
00:48:25,775 --> 00:48:27,000
How would you help us?

574
00:48:29,837 --> 00:48:30,920
Come on.

575
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,000
If you remember,

576
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,680
when I investigated Lamduan's death,

577
00:48:47,096 --> 00:48:50,040
The killer might have taken Lamduan through the roof.

578
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:53,120
- The roof? - The roof, sir?

579
00:48:53,608 --> 00:48:56,080
There are no holes in the roof.

580
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:59,240
It's too tall to climb, isn't it?

581
00:49:01,544 --> 00:49:03,080
If Dum could carry a woman

582
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:04,639
while climbing a roof

583
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,520
using a single rope,

584
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:12,480
he could have taken Lamduan from Fang's.

585
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,400
He doesn't need a ladder.

586
00:49:21,656 --> 00:49:23,320
He came and went in a flash.

587
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,560
He didn't even need to get rid of the evidence.

588
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:30,040
If we can identify him this much,

589
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:33,040
we don't need to be undercover anymore. Let's just arrest him.

590
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,560
If I arrest him,

591
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,680
I have to arrest him in the act.

592
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:29,760
Dum.

593
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,240
What are you doing here?

594
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,280
I saw this cat running around.

595
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,080
Boonpa gave me some snacks, so I fed it.

596
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:44,520
She gave you a snack?

597
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,600
I helped her and Choed up the roof to hide from market visitors.

598
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,703
So she gave me some snacks.

599
00:50:53,863 --> 00:50:55,200
They're nice to you

600
00:50:55,703 --> 00:50:57,400
to manipulate you!

601
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,320
That couple

602
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,120
is suspicious. They look like they're investigating something.

603
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:03,840
I don't trust them.

604
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:17,360
There he goes.

605
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,280
Father!

606
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:38,720
Where's that couple?

607
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,920
They just packed up and left.

608
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:42,655
The man said his arm is fine now.

609
00:51:42,823 --> 00:51:45,568
He's not hurt as badly as his wife claimed.

610
00:51:58,639 --> 00:51:59,840
Dum is the killer?

611
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:02,840
Dum performs spear and sword shows well.

612
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,720
He can carry people up high.

613
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,160
He likes to steal animals and kill them brutally.

614
00:52:08,936 --> 00:52:11,600
It's possible that he does the same with humans.

615
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,400
You mean the killer uses acrobatic skills

616
00:52:16,496 --> 00:52:17,920
to climb the roof

617
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:21,520
and take a locked-up woman out to kill?

618
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,040
When Lamduan disappeared,

619
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,120
their troupe was fixing our roof.

620
00:52:26,591 --> 00:52:28,800
And when Oeb disappeared,

621
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,200
Hom's brothel hired them to fix their roof too.

622
00:52:32,591 --> 00:52:34,320
He's worse than an animal.

623
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:37,000
His face is ugly, yet his mind is uglier.

624
00:52:37,103 --> 00:52:39,560
That's why he treats humans like animals.

625
00:52:40,016 --> 00:52:42,640
It's because he was abused like an animal.

626
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:52,560
I won't do it again...

627
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,640
You shouldn't have been born as my son!

628
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,760
But that cannot justify

629
00:53:00,024 --> 00:53:01,480
him killing someone.

630
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,320
It could have been someone else who's a great acrobat like

631
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,720
Chuen.

632
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:10,239
When he fought off the thugs at the market,

633
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,840
he proved a capable fighter.

634
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:13,921
He loves his brother more than anyone.

635
00:53:14,063 --> 00:53:17,120
He could be doing this to protect his brother.

636
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,040
That's right. The day Lamduan disappeared,

637
00:53:20,136 --> 00:53:23,440
both Dum and Chuen were here to fix the roof.

638
00:53:23,616 --> 00:53:26,844
They both were also fixing the roof at Hom's

639
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:28,960
the day Oeb disappeared, sir.

640
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,840
So, the killer

641
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:33,920
could have been either of them.

642
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,103
We cannot identify the killer for certain

643
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:39,200
until we catch him in the act.

644
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:43,040
If we want to catch him in the act,

645
00:53:43,407 --> 00:53:45,240
we need to lure him out.

646
00:53:58,203 --> 00:54:01,120
Ming, get the Vietnamese to fix the roof.

647
00:54:01,647 --> 00:54:02,840
Yes, Mother.

648
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,160
Wrap it well.

649
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,280
It's hot.

650
00:54:24,948 --> 00:54:26,948
This is for Nual, right? I'll bring it to her.

651
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,320
Again?

652
00:54:30,503 --> 00:54:31,800
What again, Aunt?

653
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,080
While you were away,

654
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,800
Lamjeak volunteered to deliver Nual's every meal in your place.

655
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,342
And she always comes back with a smile.

656
00:54:39,472 --> 00:54:42,152
I wonder what's so good about that place that keeps you going back.

657
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,200
Whoa. What could it be?

658
00:54:44,527 --> 00:54:46,400
I just want you all to get some rest.

659
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,440
Boonta, you just got back. Go take some rest.

660
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,480
- I'll deliver it to her. - Okay.

661
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:53,280
- Bye, Aunt. - Thank you.

662
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,720
Look at her go.

663
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,240
She dresses well too.

664
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:01,047
She's giving a seductive look.

665
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,600
Be careful.

666
00:55:22,088 --> 00:55:25,160
(The moon)

667
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:28,280
(is floating in the sky.)

668
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:34,040
(The sky is clear and brightly lit.)

669
00:55:34,144 --> 00:55:38,560
(In the air)

670
00:55:38,664 --> 00:55:44,400
(is the light of fireflies, flashing.)

671
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,400
(It's a glittering night of cold dew.)

672
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:55,920
(The wind blows...)

673
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,640
Sorry.

674
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,400
I didn't mean to spy on you.

675
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,520
Chaai asked me to come and see if it's safe.

676
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,360
I didn't think

677
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,880
I would get to listen to a beautiful song.

678
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,040
Well...

679
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:21,800
I saw fireflies, and they reminded me of home, sir.

680
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:28,535
Are there many fireflies back in your hometown?

681
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,320
Yes, sir.

682
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:36,896
They're just small bugs

683
00:56:37,953 --> 00:56:39,640
that nobody cares about.

684
00:56:41,455 --> 00:56:43,640
Their lives are so short.

685
00:56:51,816 --> 00:56:53,120
I should go.

686
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,040
Fang's open by now.

687
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,606
Wait.

688
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,520
In case it rains on your way back.

689
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,000
Only your kindness

690
00:57:11,256 --> 00:57:13,440
is enough for someone like me, sir.

691
00:57:19,913 --> 00:57:21,320
Please accept this.

692
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,200
I want you to live a long

693
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,920
and healthy life

694
00:57:26,248 --> 00:57:28,600
so you can keep singing beautiful songs.

695
00:57:37,696 --> 00:57:38,800
Yes, sir.

696
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,080
Did you bring Nual's meal?

697
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,360
Chang?

698
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,200
You can leave it with me.

699
00:57:56,823 --> 00:57:59,640
I can't. If I leave it with you, I won't see...

700
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:04,280
I won't get to return your umbrella.

701
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:06,040
Here, sir.

702
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:17,080
Let me take Nual's meal inside.

703
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,800
There will be a feast at Wat Suwannaram.

704
00:58:44,881 --> 00:58:45,920
My mother is attending.

705
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:48,001
I would like to introduce you.

706
00:58:48,145 --> 00:58:50,240
Are you "going public," sir?

707
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,320
- A singing contest? - Come with me.

708
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,800
I've always dreamt of a singing contest such as this.

709
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,600
I'm not worthy of that big an event, sir.

710
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:00,040
But I, for one,

711
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,320
would like to hear you sing.

712
00:59:02,607 --> 00:59:03,760
You can do it, Lamjeak.

713
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:07,440
You nailed the acting, Mother.

714
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,920
Was that slap real?

715
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:11,480
- Take her away! - Go!

716
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,400
Ugly and mean.

717
00:59:14,671 --> 00:59:16,120
What a pity.

718
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:19,080
Boonta's plan to lure out the killer is immaculate.

719
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:30,905
Where did he take Boonta?
