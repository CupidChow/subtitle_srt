1
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:28,166
So I don't have enough work to do?

2
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:30,040
Is that why she's making me babysit?

3
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:32,160
Under every crate in my ship,

4
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,949
there is a double lion symbol.

5
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:38,400
That means someone snuck it in to frame the ship's owner.

6
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:40,760
If you don't want to disgrace yourself,

7
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,760
don't steal my property.

8
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:44,320
If you want to own her,

9
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,040
you can buy her for ten chang.

10
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,840
Your status and his are too different.

11
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,320
Your love is not meant to be.

12
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,080
Luang may love you,

13
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,240
but do you think his mother would approve?

14
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm leaving the child with you.

15
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:01,560
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

16
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,880
Someone save my daughter!

17
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:09,320
Boonta's inside? Boonta...

18
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:11,680
- Chaai, watch out. - Boonta...

19
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:16,440
Your arm.

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,320
(Episode 10: Whether You're a Goose Or a Swan, I Still Like You)

21
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,200
I'm sorry, sir.

22
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,920
You got hurt because of me.

23
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,360
Thank you for saving me though.

24
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,640
Please promise me

25
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:43,800
you'll never risk yourself like that again.

26
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:47,240
Yes, sir.

27
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,000
Your face is all dirty.

28
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,640
You're as hot as a nuclear reactor right now.

29
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,160
What did you say?

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,120
I said keep a distance, sir.

31
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,680
I don't want to.

32
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:22,680
And I don't want to be just friends.

33
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,622
Please don't keep your distance because of Dokgaew.

34
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,000
Even though my mother wants to match me with her,

35
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:38,200
I only love her like a sister.

36
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:45,080
Until now,

37
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:46,880
I was afraid to lose face

38
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,440
or lose my pride,

39
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,920
but now I'm afraid to lose you more.

40
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
You said I should "move on"

41
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:04,640
and start over.

42
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:08,700
Are you ready to start over with me?

43
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,680
(Luang may love you, )

44
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,200
(but do you think his mother would approve?)

45
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:32,160
So you admit it now

46
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,080
that you love a courtesan like me?

47
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,400
What about your mother?

48
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,120
Would she approve of me

49
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
like you do, Chaai?

50
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,200
The fire spread to almost ten households.

51
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,880
Hob's brothel was damaged too.

52
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,160
Could it be an arson?

53
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,280
Nobody would dare.

54
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:53,920
If they get caught,

55
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,600
it's punishable by death.

56
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,880
Then where did the fire start?

57
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,880
From my apartment, sirs.

58
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,280
The fire

59
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,320
started in my apartment.

60
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:19,600
We were lucky we could put out the fire quickly.

61
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,240
Otherwise, it would have been like in the first reign

62
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:25,360
when the fire spread from Wat Sampleum all the way to Sampheng.

63
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:28,240
There were serious damages nonetheless.

64
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,120
The Police Force is taking donations for help.

65
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,400
That could help with the relief efforts.

66
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,960
Even if the authorities are helping,

67
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:41,760
the culprit should pay too, shouldn't they?

68
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,160
I didn't want it to happen, Hob.

69
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,200
My daughter was responsible for the fire.

70
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,624
I'll help as much as I can.

71
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,640
Everyone.

72
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,600
Come and take some money.

73
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:02,280
I'll do what I can.

74
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,000
I really

75
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,407
feel sorry for Mother.

76
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,192
The fire spread to the house. We have to close down and repair.

77
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:29,480
We're lucky our kitchen is still intact.

78
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,600
Aunt, we're out of work temporarily,

79
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:36,120
and we have to donate a lot of money to repair houses and other brothels.

80
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,680
At least, Mother is kind enough to let Ming off.

81
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:44,080
She also gives his family the hut in the banana bush.

82
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:46,480
Our Mother is so generous.

83
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,160
So...

84
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:53,080
Why are we cooking these foods?

85
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,360
Well,

86
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:56,496
Mother is going to deliver food to your Luang.

87
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:00,800
Every time they meet,

88
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,680
they usually fight, don't they?

89
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,312
Not exactly fight.

90
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,600
They just don't get along.

91
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:08,880
Why is she cooking for him all of a sudden?

92
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:11,760
- Could it be... - What?

93
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:15,040
Is Mother falling for him too?

94
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,600
Nonsense!

95
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,055
You don't have to worry about Mother stealing your husband.

96
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,400
I was just kidding.

97
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,280
I wanted to repay him for saving my daughter.

98
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:27,600
You girls hurry up.

99
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:30,200
- The people are hungry. - Yes, Mother.

100
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,560
Come on. Hurry up. Quick.

101
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,640
You're all looking miserable.

102
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,440
Here.

103
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,480
Don't just sit there.

104
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:47,120
If you have children, tell us. We'll give you more. Come on.

105
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:50,000
Take some of this, kid. Eat a lot.

106
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,920
Let me help.

107
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,400
Here.

108
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:01,840
Heaven always finds a way to test me.

109
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:03,120
Whoa.

110
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,680
Boonta.

111
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:08,831
Give this to Luang Thukkarat.

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
Take Kleeb with you.

113
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:11,960
Go, sweetie.

114
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:16,720
If you want to repay him, why don't you give him yourself?

115
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,880
Just do as I say.

116
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:22,440
If you hesitate, I'm going to punish you. Go!

117
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,960
Come on, Young Miss.

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,360
Here, sir.

119
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:35,640
Mother told me to give you this, as a thank you for saving Kleeb, sir.

120
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,640
Thank you.

121
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,520
We're starting to get hungry.

122
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,160
I'm starting to get hungry.

123
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,600
I'll let you take care of me for this meal.

124
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:55,040
Eat with us here.

125
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:57,783
Chaai's meal would taste ten times better.

126
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,920
It's fine, sirs. I've already eaten.

127
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:04,384
And I need to help them out.

128
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,440
Young Miss, give Luang the food, please.

129
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,600
Yod, take one.

130
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:17,040
Let's go, Young Miss.

131
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,680
Here, Uncle.

132
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,480
They asked for a donation again?

133
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,640
Is my house an almshouse or what?

134
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,080
The patrol said there was a fire last night, sir.

135
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,840
Where was the fire this time?

136
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,647
In an apartment near the Courtesan Houses.

137
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,880
I heard it was close to Fang's, sir.

138
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:12,840
Move, hey.

139
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:19,128
Move over there. Get closer. It'd be easier.

140
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,840
Thank you for your donation of sugar and rice.

141
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:32,440
I really didn't want to ask anyone.

142
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,120
Every time there is a fire or a disaster,

143
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:40,640
the authority asks for donations from us traders

144
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,920
and wealthy people to help the locals.

145
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,280
But that doesn't mean I donate willingly.

146
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,719
So you're making this donation

147
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:54,160
just for your image. Is that right?

148
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:58,840
That's not the case, sir.

149
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:01,200
The people are in trouble.

150
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,079
Magnate Thong is not a petty person.

151
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,400
He's happy and willing to help.

152
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,994
Those who are more fortunate can help.

153
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,240
That's true.

154
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:15,960
If you do good deeds with a negative mind,

155
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,840
how would it be a merit?

156
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:19,720
What's she bragging about?

157
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,960
Dokgaew and I

158
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,207
are willing to make this merit, sir.

159
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:29,840
I brought some clothes for the people to change.

160
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,415
There are volunteers during this age?

161
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,280
They give out supply bags too?

162
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,000
Chaai.

163
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:42,481
Please help me give out clothes to the people.

164
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,120
Here.

165
00:14:08,703 --> 00:14:09,720
They look cute.

166
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,120
They look so good together. As if the gods match them.

167
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:14,720
Is that right, Fang?

168
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:20,680
She sure smiles a lot.

169
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:26,800
Are you jealous?

170
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,200
How am I jealous?

171
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,640
She can smile all she wants. I couldn't care less.

172
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,720
Everyone!

173
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,240
If you haven't received food or need more, please come here.

174
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,801
- I hope that's true. - You can't eat clothes, can you?

175
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:41,160
Come on.

176
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,640
- Here. - Nobody's coming.

177
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,880
We have cups of rice. Over here!

178
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,720
Who are you looking for?

179
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,800
These people are waiting for clothes.

180
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:26,917
Please smile.

181
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,880
They're going to think you're a demon.

182
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:32,960
Smile.

183
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:47,920
Boonta.

184
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,640
Let me go, sir.

185
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,800
Let go!

186
00:15:58,462 --> 00:15:59,808
You ignored me

187
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:01,240
because you're still mad

188
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,719
that I let Gaysorn sell you out

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
when I knew you were framed, right?

190
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,192
I didn't want to let her.

191
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:12,640
I really couldn't say no.

192
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:17,080
So that means

193
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,960
Boonta didn't poison your wife?

194
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,240
Sir?

195
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,840
So you forgot everything.

196
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,560
You really forgot the love I have for you?

197
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,360
What happened, sir?

198
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:13,320
Poor thing.

199
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:16,280
Now that Bua's gone,

200
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,720
you have nothing left.

201
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
I'm not a cruel man.

202
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,960
However,

203
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,040
I have to hold up my end of the deal.

204
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,760
You will live here as a slave.

205
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:44,480
Gaysorn will be taking care of you.

206
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,240
Don't worry, dear.

207
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,143
I'll teach her to work.

208
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,480
I trust you.

209
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,320
But please

210
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,640
show her a little mercy.

211
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
A former elite like her

212
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:14,871
probably needs time to adapt.

213
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:02,760
Please let me go.

214
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:04,480
You shouldn't do this.

215
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,000
Calm down.

216
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
I just want to comfort you.

217
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,320
I want to let you know

218
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,200
I've always had eyes on you.

219
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:19,120
I've loved

220
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,047
and adored you all this time.

221
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,040
But I...

222
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:27,200
It breaks my heart to see you suffer so much.

223
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:30,280
I want to help you.

224
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,040
Help...

225
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:35,000
How, sir?

226
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:40,720
If you

227
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:44,120
agree to be one of my wives,

228
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:47,640
you won't be a slave anymore.

229
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,200
I respect you as my savior.

230
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,440
Gaysorn, too, has been

231
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,240
good to me.

232
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:06,440
I don't want to cause any resentment.

233
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,760
Please let me be just a slave.

234
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:17,920
I don't intend to force anyone.

235
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:22,200
If you don't agree, then so be it!

236
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,880
Even if you don't have feelings for me,

237
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
I still intend to buy you back home.

238
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:36,320
At least, it's better than working as a courtesan.

239
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:39,560
Fang told me

240
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:42,360
even if she agreed to sell you to Captain Jon,

241
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,632
if I pay her ten chang,

242
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,600
she'd sell you to me.

243
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,136
Ten chang?

244
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,720
Mother sure is stingy.

245
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,400
Boonta, don't worry

246
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,520
that Gaysorn won't approve of you.

247
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,920
This time, I'll make her understand.

248
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,680
Well, you said you knew

249
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,200
I was framed and I didn't poison your wife.

250
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:20,760
Do you also know

251
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,200
who did it and why they put the blame on me?

252
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,120
Dear.

253
00:21:27,991 --> 00:21:29,600
So there you are.

254
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,600
Did you finish giving out everything?

255
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,960
Yes, dear. I did.

256
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,200
I'm here to ask you to go home.

257
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,400
If you want to,

258
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,160
let's go home together.

259
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:01,280
Today is a really long day.

260
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,600
You won't start over with me,

261
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:08,440
but you would start over with Magnate Thong?

262
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,840
I haven't started over with anyone. Hey...

263
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:17,080
Don't get the wrong idea, sir.

264
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:20,360
Then why were you holding his hands like that?

265
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:23,840
I wasn't holding him. He was holding me!

266
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,200
If you didn't consent,

267
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:29,800
why didn't you resist?

268
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,080
I wanted to find out who tried to kill Boonta,

269
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,880
so I just played along.

270
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:37,480
You played along

271
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,600
because you wanted that information?

272
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:43,480
Such dedication.

273
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,394
It's just a hand. It's nothing.

274
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,920
I've done worse.

275
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:52,720
I'm an actress!

276
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,640
You see, sir.

277
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,480
I didn't consent,

278
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:05,400
but at least, I found out more about Boon...

279
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,920
About myself, sir.

280
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,920
What did you find out?

281
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,400
The fact that

282
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,640
Magnate Thong wants me as a wife,

283
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
but I said no.

284
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:24,480
What if Gaysorn

285
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,160
found out?

286
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,640
Is it possible that she was upset

287
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:31,200
and framed me for her poisoning?

288
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:34,080
She's probably the one who ordered a hit on me.

289
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:42,440
It is possible.

290
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,400
But you still need evidence.

291
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:49,831
I'll find that evidence, sir.

292
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:54,440
By involving yourself with Magnate Thong again?

293
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,640
So this time you consent.

294
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,840
Luang, you're still mad about that?

295
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,560
Chaai, sir.

296
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:14,320
You asked me about my mother.

297
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,200
I spent all night thinking about it.

298
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,120
I believe that, even if she's now biased against you,

299
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:21,920
if she gets to know you,

300
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,000
and be close to you like I do,

301
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,659
she would certainly approve of you.

302
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:34,800
I will prove to her that even if you're just a courtesan,

303
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,840
you're the woman I decided to love

304
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:41,720
and spend the rest of my life with.

305
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,240
Wait a minute, Chaai.

306
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:57,680
I think you shouldn't go that far yet.

307
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,400
You said that to me

308
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:02,440
but if I start over with you,

309
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:05,240
I would probably hurt you again.

310
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:11,040
Let's not be anything more yet.

311
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,840
If we can't stay friends,

312
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:18,200
we can just be acquaintances that come and go.

313
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:23,400
One day, you will marry someone worthy.

314
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:26,000
For me,

315
00:25:29,343 --> 00:25:31,040
I will go back to where I belong.

316
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,600
That settled it, sir.

317
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,360
I have to go.

318
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
Chaai!

319
00:26:20,424 --> 00:26:21,880
You did the right thing, Jeed.

320
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,560
Don't let it get too far.

321
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:27,200
Chaai!

322
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,040
Why are you here?

323
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:32,480
You left me to hand things out alone.

324
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:34,200
Before I knew it,

325
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:36,040
you disappeared.

326
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:42,280
I don't think he has to tell you where he goes.

327
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:44,120
You're not his Siamese twin.

328
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,000
You're not his Siamese twin either.

329
00:26:47,112 --> 00:26:48,840
You don't have to be with him all the time.

330
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,240
Puek came looking for me.

331
00:26:55,392 --> 00:26:56,880
We have urgent work, is that it?

332
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:00,720
Let's go.

333
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:07,760
Chaai!

334
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:16,960
I'm going home soon.

335
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:18,960
If Boonta returns,

336
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:21,740
this will have nothing to do with me anymore.

337
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:24,360
He and Boonta can continue their relationship.

338
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,400
Boonta!

339
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:30,008
What did you do to Chaai?

340
00:27:30,224 --> 00:27:33,000
Why did he walk away looking so upset?

341
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,520
What about Magnate Thong

342
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,040
and Aunt Gaysorn?

343
00:27:36,351 --> 00:27:38,160
They looked upset too.

344
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:39,560
Was that because of you?

345
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:43,680
Magnate Thong is upset, and Chaai too.

346
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,680
Does everything have to be Boonta's fault?

347
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,080
Look, miss. I'm just a courtesan.

348
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:51,680
What can I possibly do?

349
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,160
I'm glad you realized you're just a courtesan.

350
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:57,400
Don't even try to match our class.

351
00:27:58,437 --> 00:27:59,720
That's harsh.

352
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,000
Wait. What did you call Chaai just now?

353
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:05,400
I call him Chaai.

354
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:10,960
He told me to call him that. If you want to complain, complain to him.

355
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,960
But now,

356
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:15,440
he and I are nothing.

357
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,920
I'll call him Luang again, ma'am.

358
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,920
Boonta! You...

359
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:26,600
So heroic.

360
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:30,400
You came at just the right time, sir.

361
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,120
Otherwise, it would have been fun.

362
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:43,463
You're a high-ranking official's daughter,

363
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:45,040
yet you behave in such a way.

364
00:28:45,272 --> 00:28:48,360
Can you still say you outclass a courtesan?

365
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,160
Why do you have to protect her every time, sir?

366
00:28:53,856 --> 00:28:56,240
Or you kept following Chaai

367
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,560
not only to keep me away from him

368
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,920
but to see Boonta yourself.

369
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,120
You have feelings for her.

370
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,400
Dokgaew!

371
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,177
If that's the case,

372
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,720
should we join forces?

373
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,320
Dear.

374
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,200
So there you are.

375
00:30:41,112 --> 00:30:42,320
Muean.

376
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:43,920
Yes, ma'am.

377
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,960
I want to get my nails done.

378
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:49,840
Get the manicurist here.

379
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:01,160
A lot happened in just a couple of days.

380
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:03,120
It would be good to get some rest.

381
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,280
Mother is generous. She lost income, but she allows us to take days off.

382
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:10,280
I'm going back home.

383
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,080
And I'll make merit for Lamduan.

384
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:13,880
I'm visiting my mother too.

385
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,880
But I don't have a home or a family.

386
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,440
I'll just sleep all day.

387
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:21,760
Me too.

388
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:23,448
Not having a husband

389
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:25,120
is kind of nice.

390
00:31:26,003 --> 00:31:28,800
- And I will... - My master wants her nails done.

391
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:34,000
They say you do house calls.

392
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:36,320
Do you accept this job?

393
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,320
Or are you afraid?

394
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,200
Come in!

395
00:32:08,377 --> 00:32:09,560
Okay.

396
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,680
She's so mean.

397
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,480
Madam Gaysorn.

398
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,960
You didn't have to come out.

399
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm bringing her to you.

400
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:43,480
If she dares to come,

401
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:46,960
I should dare to welcome her myself.

402
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:57,720
You let her go alone?

403
00:32:57,848 --> 00:32:59,408
We tried to stop her,

404
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,320
but Boonta insisted on going.

405
00:33:01,535 --> 00:33:03,240
We didn't know what to do.

406
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:09,600
Aunt Mian, don't worry too much. I think she can survive.

407
00:33:14,455 --> 00:33:15,800
Easy, ma'am.

408
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,480
I heard you're skilled,

409
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:37,600
so I wanted to support you.

410
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,160
What colors do you have?

411
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:47,000
Most do bright red.

412
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,960
If you want another color,

413
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:50,331
I can mix some yellow in.

414
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
You can have different shades of orange.

415
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,600
What color would you like?

416
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:57,480
Ma'am.

417
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:02,800
I'll have the color that's on you.

418
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:08,360
What a good choice, ma'am.

419
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,040
Show me your hands, please.

420
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,840
Let me put this here to rest your hand.

421
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,320
My master's hands are soft and delicate.

422
00:34:47,704 --> 00:34:50,400
If you scratch her even a little,

423
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:52,440
you're getting it.

424
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:58,440
No clipping then.

425
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
Can I have some hot water, please?

426
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,280
I need to dissolve

427
00:35:03,943 --> 00:35:05,240
this acacia sap.

428
00:35:06,056 --> 00:35:07,760
I'm not your servant.

429
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:10,760
If you want something, go get it yourself in the kitchen.

430
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,840
Okay.

431
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:36,760
Excuse me. Can I have some hot water, please?

432
00:35:50,307 --> 00:35:51,440
Thank you.

433
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:01,320
If this weren't King Rama III's era,

434
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:04,360
I would have thought they all got the same surgery in Korea.

435
00:36:05,752 --> 00:36:07,520
He's good at finding these girls.

436
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:10,680
I understand now why the wife hates Boonta so much.

437
00:36:11,288 --> 00:36:12,640
No matter where you look,

438
00:36:12,783 --> 00:36:15,520
you'll find a girl who looks similar to your husband's crush.

439
00:36:21,464 --> 00:36:22,560
Thanks.

440
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,040
This gives me the creep.

441
00:36:37,022 --> 00:36:38,360
It's like I'm seeing myself.

442
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:46,000
Are you pretending to be nice to me

443
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,120
because you think I'd let you back in as his mistress?

444
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:52,560
Don't think I don't know

445
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,960
that he keeps visiting you often.

446
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,880
So you know, right?

447
00:38:02,168 --> 00:38:04,600
I fell in the water and lost my memory.

448
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:13,880
I don't remember what happened between you and me.

449
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:15,757
And I'm not being nice to you

450
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,120
because I want to be his mistress.

451
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,640
I just want money.

452
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:23,096
I want money more than I want a husband, ma'am.

453
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:28,936
But if you hate me, I understand.

454
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:32,048
I just want you to hate the right person.

455
00:38:32,464 --> 00:38:34,464
I'm just here doing my thing.

456
00:38:34,616 --> 00:38:37,040
It's your Magnate that keeps chasing me.

457
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:40,520
Are you saying I can't keep my husband with me?

458
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:42,800
No, ma'am.

459
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:46,440
I'm saying that Magnate

460
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:48,128
is not my "type."

461
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,280
I mean

462
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,000
I don't like men who look like that.

463
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:02,920
No matter how much he tries, I would always reject him, ma'am.

464
00:39:03,194 --> 00:39:04,680
Such arrogance.

465
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:07,000
How dare you act like you're above my master?

466
00:39:07,232 --> 00:39:08,600
Hey, you.

467
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,800
I'm just trying to comfort your master.

468
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:13,320
I understand that

469
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,840
men in this age

470
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:17,802
usually have multiple wives.

471
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:20,720
And women still depend on men.

472
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,480
But from what I've seen of you.

473
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:26,847
You're beautiful,

474
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:28,152
rich,

475
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:29,760
and powerful.

476
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,400
More importantly,

477
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,560
your husband seems quite fearful of you.

478
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:40,040
If you're a bit more decisive, you can get him under control.

479
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,640
But if I were you, I wouldn't tolerate someone who doesn't appreciate me.

480
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:45,720
I'd rather stay single and rich.

481
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:50,360
You think I'm stupid,

482
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:52,160
and you're so smart?

483
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:55,160
Is that why you dare lecture me?

484
00:39:56,224 --> 00:39:58,040
You can have your opinion, ma'am.

485
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,360
I'm just trying my best.

486
00:40:08,678 --> 00:40:10,015
It's almost done, ma'am.

487
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:24,280
All done, ma'am. Wait a bit until it dries.

488
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:39,296
What about my toenails?

489
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:47,720
My master told you to do her toenails.

490
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:56,160
Well.

491
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,520
As soon as she said she'd pay extra,

492
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,640
you said yes without a second thought.

493
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,382
You can't survive on pride, right?

494
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,800
Only money can "knock everything."

495
00:41:09,952 --> 00:41:11,440
What did you say?

496
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,920
I'm not insulting your master. Don't worry.

497
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:23,880
But I actually want to.

498
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,199
I actually cared about her,

499
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,520
yet she's making me do her toenails.

500
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,040
I even have to come and get a towel to wipe her feet. Such a bully.

501
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:34,360
Darn it.

502
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:37,551
Come in already.

503
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,280
Okay.

504
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:56,040
We have to go to the bedroom to get a towel?

505
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:59,760
You can't just use any towel on my master's feet.

506
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:03,136
There are high-quality towels in that chest.

507
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,960
Pick one you want to use.

508
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:12,480
You said I can't just pick any towel?

509
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:14,511
Why won't you pick one?

510
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,103
Hey, you.

511
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:18,910
You get paid to work but you want me to do everything for you?

512
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:20,934
Am I getting my cut of money or what?

513
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,520
I'm going to get some hot water.

514
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:28,200
Pick a towel and follow me.

515
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:29,760
Okay.

516
00:42:45,434 --> 00:42:46,672
She's so rich.

517
00:43:21,505 --> 00:43:24,520
I should find some clues about Boonta.

518
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,560
What are you doing?

519
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:18,039
You're wasting our time.

520
00:44:18,391 --> 00:44:20,120
You keep my master waiting.

521
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,720
I'm just going in.

522
00:44:27,155 --> 00:44:28,840
She didn't

523
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:30,600
scold me or

524
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:32,600
curse me at all?

525
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:36,760
Was that too easy?

526
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:44,520
Let's do your toenails, ma'am.

527
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,520
Darn you!

528
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:05,960
Did you hurt my master?

529
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,360
What's wrong? I'm sure I haven't even picked anything.

530
00:45:09,527 --> 00:45:11,400
Don't pretend to blame me!

531
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:12,920
You!

532
00:45:14,384 --> 00:45:17,040
- How dare you, Boonta? - Let go.

533
00:45:20,736 --> 00:45:22,560
Let me go! Let go!

534
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:25,680
- Let go! - How dare you?

535
00:45:26,312 --> 00:45:28,000
You dare...

536
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,600
You got a fight in you, huh?

537
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:37,760
That hurts! Ah...

538
00:45:42,705 --> 00:45:44,240
Boon...

539
00:45:48,552 --> 00:45:49,840
Take that!

540
00:45:50,696 --> 00:45:52,160
Let me go!

541
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:54,056
- You're going to bring it, huh? - Let go.

542
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,240
That's your pay.

543
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:07,280
The money my master paid you

544
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,440
is equal to what a courtesan earns in one night.

545
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:13,223
You can spare yourself from serving a guest tonight!

546
00:46:59,543 --> 00:47:00,800
What happened?

547
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,640
Who did this to you?

548
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,760
Gaysorn's servants did this to you?

549
00:47:37,664 --> 00:47:38,920
It's because of Gaysorn.

550
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:41,600
She pretended to be hurt when I clipped her nails.

551
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,720
The servants got upset and jumped on me.

552
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,920
Luang, sir.

553
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,960
If I report them for assault,

554
00:47:51,928 --> 00:47:54,120
I wouldn't get any justice, right?

555
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:03,600
Once upon a time,

556
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:06,400
I used to be a swan.

557
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,160
Why did my life change so much?

558
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:20,760
Those in front of you are geese.

559
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,800
You can't tell a goose from a swan?

560
00:48:29,357 --> 00:48:30,357
Well...

561
00:48:30,936 --> 00:48:33,880
They walked here right "on cue."

562
00:48:34,823 --> 00:48:36,800
I'm a goose then.

563
00:48:39,478 --> 00:48:43,360
Here, all I get is insult and indiscrimination.

564
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,160
I can never rise as a swan again.

565
00:48:58,151 --> 00:48:59,720
Even if you're a goose,

566
00:49:01,247 --> 00:49:03,120
you still have your qualities.

567
00:49:09,087 --> 00:49:10,383
It's like you're

568
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,600
telling me to be proud to be a goose.

569
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,280
Whether you're a goose or a swan,

570
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,320
I like you just the way you are.

571
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:28,224
I want you to be happy with your life.

572
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:31,280
Don't compare yourself to others.

573
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:20,311
I can't accompany you to Fang's.

574
00:50:20,671 --> 00:50:22,440
I have urgent work in Pak Nam.

575
00:50:23,464 --> 00:50:25,440
You're going out of the "province" this time.

576
00:50:29,124 --> 00:50:31,520
I mean outside of the capital, sir.

577
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,960
That's right.

578
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:36,240
Rumor has it that the children's wrist slasher is there.

579
00:50:40,032 --> 00:50:41,280
So...

580
00:50:41,615 --> 00:50:43,320
Be careful, sir.

581
00:50:45,632 --> 00:50:47,280
Even if we're just acquaintances

582
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,680
and not friends,

583
00:50:50,584 --> 00:50:52,080
do you still care about me?

584
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,520
Well, we can care about each other anyway.

585
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:07,080
Then I care about you too.

586
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:13,840
Here, sir.

587
00:51:14,456 --> 00:51:16,456
I told Yod to get you some Chinese medicine.

588
00:51:16,903 --> 00:51:18,760
Boil this and drink it. It will heal you.

589
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,360
I'll be back as soon as I'm done.

590
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,320
Thank you, sir.

591
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:50,120
You're Boonta, are you not?

592
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,400
Yes, sir.

593
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:56,200
We're from the Police Force.

594
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,000
Magnate Thong's staff reported

595
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:00,760
that you stole Gaysorn's gold bracelet.

596
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:08,880
Kleeb, try combing her hair.

597
00:52:10,943 --> 00:52:12,280
Mother!

598
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:14,000
Boonta is in trouble, Mother.

599
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:20,247
I think this is a misunderstanding.

600
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:22,080
I didn't steal anything.

601
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:28,160
You're not just a courtesan,

602
00:52:28,272 --> 00:52:29,600
you're a thief too!

603
00:52:29,903 --> 00:52:31,200
I'm not.

604
00:52:31,432 --> 00:52:32,880
That's not mine.

605
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:35,000
How did it get in your basket then?

606
00:52:35,191 --> 00:52:36,480
I don't know!

607
00:52:37,463 --> 00:52:39,463
Did you steal it from her?

608
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,960
Mother, why would I look for trouble?

609
00:52:43,495 --> 00:52:45,638
I've never seen this bracelet before.

610
00:52:46,326 --> 00:52:48,158
So why were you at their house?

611
00:52:48,263 --> 00:52:51,600
You know they hate you so much there.

612
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,640
- I went to do her nails, Mother. - Whoa!

613
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,920
I didn't think they'd frame me. Mother...

614
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:03,360
It's not your job to question her.

615
00:53:03,623 --> 00:53:05,223
Arrest this vile woman.

616
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,453
Hey!

617
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:09,560
- Mother, help me! - Boonta!

618
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:13,480
- Boonta! - Mother, help me!

619
00:53:13,655 --> 00:53:17,920
- Boonta! No! - Mother!

620
00:53:18,087 --> 00:53:20,280
- Boonta! - Boonta!

621
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:22,145
No, I'm not going in.

622
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,120
I didn't do anything.

623
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,960
Hey, sir!

624
00:53:29,449 --> 00:53:32,360
Why did you put me in jail? I didn't do anything.

625
00:53:32,464 --> 00:53:34,464
You haven't even charged me yet!

626
00:53:34,703 --> 00:53:36,230
The evidence incriminates you.

627
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:37,840
You're in temporary custody.

628
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:39,520
There will be an investigation later.

629
00:53:43,965 --> 00:53:48,320
What the heck? I didn't do anything! Let me go!

630
00:53:48,744 --> 00:53:51,120
What should I do now?

631
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,120
What's that?

632
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:15,640
Darn it.

633
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,800
What the heck?

634
00:54:24,287 --> 00:54:27,520
Boonta has been arrested, ma'am.

635
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,880
A slave like you would be punished hard in jail.

636
00:54:33,736 --> 00:54:37,351
A courtesan without honor like her would have it harder.

637
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,200
Nobody would have mercy on her.

638
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,440
That's true, ma'am.

639
00:54:43,856 --> 00:54:45,856
As time passes,

640
00:54:46,526 --> 00:54:48,480
she will be forgotten there.

641
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,040
At some point,

642
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,240
I'll have Tis take care of her.

643
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:57,280
What if Luang Thukkarat saves her?

644
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:03,543
Luang Thukkarat can't save her that easily.

645
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,375
I'll ask my uncle to be strict too.

646
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,960
What are you smiling about?

647
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:17,600
Help me!

648
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,680
Officers!

649
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,680
I didn't do anything! Why did they frame me?

650
00:55:25,096 --> 00:55:28,280
I didn't steal anything. If I did, I would have stolen more!

651
00:55:31,448 --> 00:55:35,240
I don't want to be in jail.

652
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,160
Get me out!

653
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,960
Stop smiling!

654
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,440
A ghost!

655
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:01,893
You darn police!

656
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,280
Why did you lock me in with a dead body?

657
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,600
If I die in here,

658
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:11,160
I'd join forces with this corpse

659
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:13,241
and snap your necks as ghosts!

660
00:56:13,322 --> 00:56:14,560
You stop smiling?

661
00:56:19,735 --> 00:56:21,735
If you call me a dead body again,

662
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,240
I'll snap your neck myself!

663
00:56:26,331 --> 00:56:27,760
So you're not dead?

664
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,600
Of course not.

665
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,840
If you cry so hard like that,

666
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:35,551
I can't die in peace.

667
00:56:47,932 --> 00:56:49,040
So

668
00:56:49,495 --> 00:56:51,160
What happened to you, Aunt?

669
00:56:51,632 --> 00:56:55,080
If you call me Aunt again, I'll slap the taste out of your mouth!

670
00:56:55,472 --> 00:56:57,472
I'm not even 30 years old.

671
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:01,096
Then we can be friends.

672
00:57:01,311 --> 00:57:03,240
What did you do?

673
00:57:06,368 --> 00:57:07,888
I don't know.

674
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,280
I got framed for stealing.

675
00:57:11,368 --> 00:57:14,240
It doesn't matter how serious, or guilty or not.

676
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,680
When you get tortured, you will confess.

677
00:57:21,032 --> 00:57:23,032
Don't tell me you turned out this way

678
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,320
because Aunt, I mean you...

679
00:57:25,631 --> 00:57:28,280
You refused to confess?

680
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,219
(If he gets put in jail today, he will be tortured into confession.)

681
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:42,360
(For us, jail is Hell.)

682
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:45,440
Screw me.

683
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:47,320
No, I won't take this.

684
00:57:47,454 --> 00:57:49,160
I won't stay in jail.

685
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,928
Mother! Chaai!

686
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:53,695
Help me!

687
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,680
Whoa! Why do you keep smiling?

688
00:58:14,664 --> 00:58:17,720
(Guest Starring - Deejai Deedeedee)

689
00:58:21,694 --> 00:58:24,895
Could the solar eclipse happen today?

690
00:58:25,008 --> 00:58:28,160
Last time, you framed her for poisoning you.

691
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,200
If you would do anything to kill her,

692
00:58:31,344 --> 00:58:33,880
I'll do anything to save her myself!

693
00:58:34,868 --> 00:58:37,703
Slaves like us, without a master,

694
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,480
we don't have the right to defend ourselves or any protection.

695
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:43,600
If I have a master,

696
00:58:44,045 --> 00:58:46,356
I can get out of here, right?

697
00:58:46,479 --> 00:58:47,920
Who is your master?

698
00:58:53,759 --> 00:58:57,760
Nobody tells her Chaai is away.

699
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,420
What's so urgent, ma'am?

700
00:58:59,695 --> 00:59:01,680
Kill Boonta in jail.
