1
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,920
I just wanted to ask you to let go of your bias

2
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:31,280
and look at Boonta with your kindness for once.

3
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:33,361
You will find her lovable as much as I do.

4
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:35,511
Mother, aren't you going?

5
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,520
Today is Chaai's big day.

6
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Boonta is Luang's wife now.

7
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,719
She belongs in your household now.

8
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,000
You should accept her

9
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,440
for the sake of your own son.

10
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:54,880
At last,

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,440
we got married.

12
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,800
I'm sorry I can't get you into the main house yet.

13
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:01,320
It's fine, dear.

14
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,447
I can be anywhere as long as you're there.

15
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,280
I think we should have a child.

16
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,480
A son or a daughter?

17
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,960
- I'll be back soon. - I'll be waiting.

18
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:15,840
Madam Tubtim sent for Boonta, sir.

19
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,245
(Episode 22: The Confronting Mother-In-Law vs. the Actress Wife)

20
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,120
If you want to be his wife,

21
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,520
you have to be an expert at household chores.

22
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:30,040
I expect nothing short. Can you do that?

23
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:32,200
Of course, I can.

24
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:36,600
There.

25
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:38,312
Sweep it all off.

26
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,400
Wipe the floor.

27
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,120
I just take a nap, and you threaten me with a knife?

28
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,520
Madam Tubtim is not such a cruel person.

29
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,960
She asked you to cut the grass.

30
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,680
Cut the grass?

31
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,960
In Thailand's heat this season?

32
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:52,360
Wow! That's freaking cruel.

33
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:54,360
- Can you do that, though? - I can.

34
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,440
Don't die yet, Jeed.

35
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,240
Keep fighting.

36
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
What do we do now?

37
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,680
She shows no sign of giving in.

38
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:08,920
How long can she last, though?

39
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:10,600
Just make her work more.

40
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:13,800
She'll show Chaai her old habits soon.

41
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,760
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,480
Never say no, right?

43
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,760
Do I have to go through fire or water this time?

44
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,960
Don't you get tired?

45
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:44,800
Take a break and have some water.

46
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:47,520
Thank you.

47
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,040
Boonta, you're tougher than a buffalo.

48
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,880
They're working you to death.

49
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:54,992
Yet you don't complain at all.

50
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,600
Well, I complained as I was doing it.

51
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,240
How can you keep smiling, though?

52
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:07,040
A smile beats everything.

53
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,080
If I want to win over his mother, I need a "trick."

54
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,880
If I get angry, she'd only be satisfied.

55
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:15,400
I can't just give her a silent treatment, either.

56
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:17,920
If I can compromise, I'll just do it.

57
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,360
If it's something I can't do, then I'll figure it out.

58
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:24,200
I'm relieved to see you in such a fighting spirit.

59
00:06:25,464 --> 00:06:27,464
I can't go against her,

60
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,400
but I have a way to help you tire yourself less.

61
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,480
Are you sure it's not tiring?

62
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:01,143
I told you to cut the grass.

63
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,431
Why are you up here?

64
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,960
I already did what you told me to do, Mother.

65
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:12,120
So Pad told me to help out up here.

66
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,880
Don't use Pad as an excuse.

67
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:16,360
I bet you're getting lazy.

68
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,680
I brought her up here myself.

69
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,128
You saw Boonta did cleaning work

70
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,239
perfectly without flaws.

71
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,040
Scenting clothes is important too.

72
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:29,080
If she doesn't learn this,

73
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,640
people might say Chaai

74
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
has a wife who can't do household chores.

75
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:52,880
(I just wanted to ask you to let go of your bias)

76
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:55,720
(and look at Boonta with your kindness for once.)

77
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:59,360
(You will find her lovable as much as I do.)

78
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,640
Mrs. Tubtim.

79
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,776
What a big smile.

80
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,280
It's pretty, right?

81
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,040
I made it heart-shaped.

82
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,160
It might look a bit odd,

83
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,920
but her handiwork is quite delicate.

84
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:30,320
It's just alright.

85
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
Hey, what are you sitting here smiling for?

86
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:36,720
Take it.

87
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,640
- Yes, ma'am. - Chaai is coming home soon.

88
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,160
You should start preparing his dinner.

89
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,960
Food is important. You have to learn it.

90
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,560
Pad, you won't steal her this time, right?

91
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,359
Roasted sour chili paste with wild boar meat and zalacca for Chaai,

92
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,480
assorted salad for Mrs. Tubtim,

93
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:06,800
pork curry with morning glory for Chim.

94
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,680
Roasted pounded pork for Chang and bird nest for Pad.

95
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,320
Why does their meal have to be so extravagant?

96
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,440
Stop talking nonsense. Here.

97
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,160
Get started already.

98
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,440
If tonight's dinner is late,

99
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,840
you're getting punished.

100
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,720
Pad can't help me now.

101
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,904
Who's going to help me then?

102
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:32,751
Hey, we should hurry.

103
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:36,269
I heard that for tonight's performance at Wat Sampleum,

104
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,999
Khun Nattayavijit's troupe

105
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,680
- is doing "Khun Chang Khun Phaen!" - Really?

106
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:45,920
This act is when Khun Phaen takes Wanthong and runs away, right?

107
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:49,800
I want to see my handsome Khun Phaen again.

108
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,520
Handsome? But he's a womanizer.

109
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:56,560
My faithful Khun Chang is way better.

110
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:58,320
- I agree. - Yeah.

111
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,660
I like Khun Phaen.

112
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:02,640
They're like housewives addicted to TV series.

113
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:05,904
They see it over and over. They remember the dialogue.

114
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,200
And they're seeing it again?

115
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:10,160
- Girls, hurry up, so we can go soon. - Right!

116
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:11,720
Come on!

117
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:13,760
Look, excuse me.

118
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:16,240
I'm addicted to shows too.

119
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm just wondering.

120
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:20,128
Having seen it so many times that you remember the dialogue,

121
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:21,640
don't you get tired of it?

122
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,383
Oh no! We don't.

123
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:26,120
We only get to see plays at festivals and feasts.

124
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,000
It's not like we see it every day.

125
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:30,255
You're right.

126
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,520
You don't have electricity yet.

127
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,960
So you don't have phones, TVs, or tablets.

128
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,367
"Blet?" What's a blet?

129
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:40,000
What do you do with it?

130
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:45,120
It's something you watch plays on.

131
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:49,640
It's like a theater but made smaller so you can watch at home.

132
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:52,480
I wish we had that thing.

133
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,120
We're going to see it every night.

134
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:58,800
It doesn't exist. It will be a long time before they import one.

135
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,120
It's the European thing.

136
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,840
Oh, the Europeans.

137
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:06,800
Yeah, and I would like to know

138
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,760
how many titles are there in the theater.

139
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:10,000
There's a lot.

140
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,400
"Khun Chang Khun Phaen,"

141
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:14,760
"Krai Thong," "Sang Thong," "Suvannahongsa,"

142
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:17,000
and "Phra Aphaimanee" too.

143
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,480
Five titles?

144
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,600
- That's all? - Yes.

145
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,040
We have been following Madam Tubtim and saw it all.

146
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,120
These are the newest titles.

147
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:35,960
I know of newer ones.

148
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:38,440
They're definitely better!

149
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,120
Once Yen was sold as a slave at the Master's house,

150
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:47,840
she was bullied by other slaves in the house.

151
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,520
Fortunately, she had Fak,

152
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,691
a senior slave who helped her.

153
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,064
She also had Thiang,

154
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:56,320
a handsome slave who had a crush on her.

155
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:57,800
He protected her.

156
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:00,600
After that, Yen started to adapt and get used to it.

157
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:03,120
She decided to save up money

158
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,000
to buy her own freedom and go back to her parents.

159
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:09,400
Then, it won't take long for Yen to buy her own freedom.

160
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:12,800
No, I bet Yen ends up with Thiang.

161
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:14,960
You're both wrong.

162
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,880
Although the bullying among slaves stopped,

163
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:24,280
in the main house, things were heating up like a "party on fire."

164
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,160
What "something-titi?"

165
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,960
I mean, it's getting heated.

166
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:36,000
You see, the Master's wives,

167
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,600
Lady Yam, Mrs. Salee,

168
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:39,879
and Mrs. Boonmee,

169
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,280
all had no child.

170
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:42,900
They were in a race to have his first child.

171
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,760
More importantly, they were in a huge power struggle!

172
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:48,600
Then Yen joined the fray.

173
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:50,856
Poor Yen.

174
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:54,166
She got sold and got in the middle of this fight.

175
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:56,089
Is that right? And then,

176
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,840
Yen happened to help Lady Yam catch some thieves.

177
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,320
The Master found out.

178
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,640
He rewarded Yen.

179
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:08,800
The first time Yen and the Master laid eyes on one another,

180
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,400
she was filled with joy, and it overflowed out of her mouth.

181
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,200
She couldn't lie on her sides

182
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,080
because it would leak out of her ears.

183
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,560
What's leaking, her earwax?

184
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:20,520
I mean,

185
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,080
she liked him so much, unlike she had ever liked anyone before.

186
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,760
Then Yen must have become one of the Master's wives.

187
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,600
Is she going to get killed by one of his wives, then?

188
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,640
No, she didn't get killed, Aunt.

189
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:33,752
Yen

190
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:36,720
became the Master's fourth wife.

191
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,800
- Wow! - She gave birth at the same time as Lady Yam did!

192
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,400
Wow! Yen sure is lucky.

193
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,400
What happens after that?

194
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:48,560
After that...

195
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,680
What?

196
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,120
It's the end of the episode. To be continued.

197
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:57,160
Why are you doing this?

198
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,240
It was entertaining. Please tell us more, Boonta.

199
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,040
If you don't, we won't be able to sleep tonight.

200
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:04,320
That's right.

201
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,000
There has never been a play

202
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,840
where the female lead is a slave like us.

203
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,640
Once in a while, I get to be a lady.

204
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,600
Boonta's play is really good, isn't it?

205
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:17,853
- Please continue! I'm curious. - Is it okay?

206
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:22,280
- Please continue. - Yeah.

207
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:26,889
Well, if you want the next "episode,"

208
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:29,392
we need to make a deal.

209
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:32,200
Yes! What's the deal?

210
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,080
These dishes look good.

211
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,000
Did you do these all by yourself?

212
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:48,760
I did.

213
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,400
These are good.

214
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:10,040
It's good. This is as good as your cooking, Mother.

215
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,320
How is this possible?

216
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:23,800
I don't know either, ma'am.

217
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,960
In this house,

218
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:27,480
if you don't know,

219
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,000
then who could possibly know?

220
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:33,600
Please enjoy.

221
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:40,080
Mother, please try this.

222
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,776
I'll get you a big shrimp.

223
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,040
Please try it and see

224
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,240
if I can be Chaai's good wife.

225
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:20,440
I'll talk to my mother.

226
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:22,880
I won't let you do too much work again.

227
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:25,480
Not yet, please.

228
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:29,200
You have to review our agreement and terms with the European.

229
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,000
That's hard enough as it is.

230
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,520
Don't get worked up for nothing.

231
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:36,640
No matter how tired I am,

232
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:38,880
I feel refreshed when I come home to you.

233
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:44,080
But when I found out you've been working so hard, I felt uncomfortable.

234
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:47,240
I can protect the people,

235
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,720
but if I can't protect my wife from my own mother,

236
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:52,400
how can I protect anyone else again?

237
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,608
You're making me blush.

238
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:04,680
You're so cute I can't help myself.

239
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:10,760
Actually, your mother

240
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
is not that cruel.

241
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,780
She even taught me to make flower scents for you.

242
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,320
I made this with my heart.

243
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,151
Thank you for caring about me

244
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:42,800
and understanding my mother.

245
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,960
Well,

246
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,280
I love her son, right?

247
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,640
Her son is just too cute.

248
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,200
Your mother probably has a lovely side to her.

249
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,336
It might take me a bit longer to get to that side

250
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,800
because her wall is thick.

251
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,480
Then tonight,

252
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,120
we have to get someone to take that wall down.

253
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:15,640
What do you mean?

254
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:22,200
Oh dear, you...

255
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,120
Boonta!

256
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,320
We're ready to listen to your play...

257
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,440
Screw us.

258
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,360
Do you have a death wish or something?

259
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,440
I'm sorry, Luang, sir.

260
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:43,880
We won't bother Boonta anymore.

261
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:46,640
We can listen to the play later.

262
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Right.

263
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:49,400
- Let's go. - Come on.

264
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,520
Do you have something to tell me?

265
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, my dear.

266
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,120
I got some help

267
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,600
for

268
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:16,935
tonight's dinner

269
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,200
in exchange for telling them a play.

270
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:30,800
So you mean those dishes...

271
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:32,760
You're right.

272
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:35,520
Please don't tell your mother.

273
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,600
I'm afraid

274
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,400
she'd punish those servants.

275
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:41,440
They agreed to help you

276
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:44,200
because they got hooked on your play?

277
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,431
That's right.

278
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:54,200
If you can win them over that way,

279
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,120
why don't you try that on my mother?

280
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,920
You're a "genius."

281
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:07,440
After Boonta left,

282
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:09,608
Pudsorn complained that she missed the verbal fight.

283
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,560
Pudsorn barely works anymore.

284
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,960
All she does is follow Captain Jon.

285
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,200
She's hanging out with him as we speak.

286
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,720
Boonta is probably living a happy life with Luang.

287
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:23,800
I hope you're right.

288
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:25,759
I just wish her mother-in-law

289
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,960
adored her like our mother did.

290
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:42,120
Is Fang here?

291
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:45,490
There are plenty of other jobs.

292
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:46,775
Have you thought this through?

293
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,400
I have been thinking about it in my sleep for so many nights.

294
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,440
If I can feed the one I must provide for,

295
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:54,520
I'll do anything.

296
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,520
How desperate does one have to be

297
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,360
to sell oneself as a prostitute willingly?

298
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:08,040
She's probably at her wit's end.

299
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,840
They were lucky they got out of jail,

300
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,160
but their lives after that

301
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:17,760
haven't been easy.

302
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:22,240
Would you like some snacks? They're freshly made this morning.

303
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:44,765
- Hey! - Give it back!

304
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:47,319
You're selling it at my place.

305
00:23:47,936 --> 00:23:49,520
This is for rent.

306
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,400
I'm just taking a break here. Don't be a leech. Give me my money...

307
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,240
You were cruel. You did evil things

308
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,200
and got both you and your master into jail.

309
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:00,440
How can anyone eat those?

310
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,680
Now that you can't sell them,

311
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,520
why don't you sell sex at my place?

312
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:06,920
You jerk!

313
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,880
Jerk...

314
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:14,175
You scum!

315
00:24:14,256 --> 00:24:16,400
You leech! You piece of trash!

316
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,800
Give me my money back!

317
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,280
Hey!

318
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,040
What happened to you?

319
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:49,600
Just lie here.

320
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:52,160
I'll get you some food and medicine.

321
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,862
For someone like Muean, it's fine to go hungry alone,

322
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:24,040
but she can't stand seeing her master and the kid go hungry.

323
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,040
I respect her for that.

324
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,240
Loyalty is her life and death.

325
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,640
So what did Mother say?

326
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,840
I told you I can't allow you to work. You have a master.

327
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:39,308
If you want to work, your master has to bring you here.

328
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:41,760
You know I can't tell my master!

329
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,360
Fang, please have sympathy. I beg you!

330
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,680
This job requires a lot of sacrifice.

331
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:50,720
It's not as easy as you think.

332
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:53,480
If I get money, I'm willing to sacrifice.

333
00:25:53,561 --> 00:25:55,040
But I won't let you!

334
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:56,800
Ming, take her out of here.

335
00:25:56,912 --> 00:25:58,912
We're opening soon. Don't let her wander around.

336
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,568
- Yes, Mother. You two, drag her out! - Get her out.

337
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,160
No, Fang!

338
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,400
- Go! - Fang! No!

339
00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:08,200
- Go! - Fang! I can...

340
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
Leave!

341
00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:14,200
Muean!

342
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Don't show your face around here again.

343
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:18,664
If I didn't respect the law,

344
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:21,200
she would have started working here three days ago.

345
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:28,160
So you really came here to work

346
00:26:28,743 --> 00:26:30,632
as those people say?

347
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:42,920
It's my karma, Master.

348
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,600
My life

349
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:48,320
is probably destined this way.

350
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,480
I'm fine being a prostitute,

351
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:58,000
but I can't lose anyone I love again.

352
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,480
You're making me lose the will to live.

353
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:08,760
If I see the one most loyal to me

354
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:15,520
live a life of living hell over and over...

355
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,080
Your feelings for me...

356
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:24,240
I'm grateful for that.

357
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,320
But don't do this for me.

358
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,680
Don't put yourself in danger for me again.

359
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:34,840
Madam Gaysorn.

360
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:54,040
Look.

361
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,880
Today,

362
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,040
just cry your heart out

363
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:04,191
so you can regain the strength to work tomorrow.

364
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
If you want to work here,

365
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:11,760
if you want money,

366
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,040
I know how to help.

367
00:28:23,928 --> 00:28:25,640
Where have you been?

368
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,560
You left us to do your hard work.

369
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:32,840
You're an old courtesan.

370
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,960
You were probably doing shameless things.

371
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,200
If Luang catches you,

372
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:38,680
you're dead!

373
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,960
Who is dead?

374
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:45,320
Boonta was visiting her friends at Fang's.

375
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,880
She didn't do any shameless thing.

376
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,440
That's right, and I didn't let them do my work for free.

377
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,560
I came home to tell them a play.

378
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:56,040
What play?

379
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,600
A love story about a human and a naga?

380
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:03,520
Whoa! This sounds like a joke already.

381
00:29:03,656 --> 00:29:04,840
A human and a naga?

382
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,520
How can they fall in love?

383
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:11,200
Crap! My mother finds out, and now everyone will know.

384
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,920
Of course! And today, Madam Tubtim will know too

385
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:19,240
that you believe Boonta's deceitful play.

386
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:21,080
You disobey her orders

387
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,840
and do her work for her!

388
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,120
At the start of the story,

389
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,320
Ken, the sorcerer,

390
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,120
caught a snake, which turned out to be the sacred Mother Nakee.

391
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:42,840
Khampong was Sorcerer Ken's wife.

392
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:45,301
She was pregnant. When she found out,

393
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:46,840
she was shocked!

394
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:50,280
She herself believed in Mother Nakee too.

395
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,920
The people believed that

396
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:55,480
anyone who disrespected Mother Nakee

397
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:58,680
would be met with destruction!

398
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,200
Khampong begged her husband to let the snake go.

399
00:30:05,343 --> 00:30:08,920
Ken wasn't convinced. He sold the snake to a European Captain.

400
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,000
And that's the beginning of Don Mai Pa village's destruction.

401
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:16,200
Mother.

402
00:30:19,455 --> 00:30:21,320
Aren't you telling Madam Tubtim?

403
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,280
I have to tell her the correct story.

404
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,560
That's not all, everyone.

405
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:32,200
A huge army of snakes invaded the village.

406
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,600
Sorcerer Ken and the Europeans

407
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:37,360
were bitten to death by Mother Nakee's army of snakes.

408
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:41,000
Khampong was worried. She followed her husband.

409
00:30:41,294 --> 00:30:44,240
She went into labor and gave birth on that very day.

410
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:46,440
Khampong and her child

411
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,680
survived the army of snakes miraculously.

412
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:51,440
She named her child Khamkaew.

413
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:53,080
She offered Khamkaew

414
00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:55,400
as a child of Mother Nakee.

415
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:58,741
After that, the mother and daughter always paid their respect

416
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,221
to Mother Nakee's shrine.

417
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,240
Khamkaew grew up

418
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:06,160
as the beauty of Don Mai Pa Village.

419
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:07,600
Could Khamkaew really be

420
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:09,200
Mother Nakee's daughter?

421
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:11,296
Don't interrupt, Mother!

422
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:13,320
Listen to Boonta first.

423
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,720
You always interrupt!

424
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,160
After that,

425
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:20,240
Mr. Thosapol,

426
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,360
a handsome young man from the capital,

427
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:25,120
came and visited the village.

428
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,880
He met Khamkaew.

429
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,600
At the very first sight,

430
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:31,600
he fell in love with Khamkaew!

431
00:31:31,775 --> 00:31:35,560
He also saw Khamkaew perform a ritual dance for Mother Nakee.

432
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:37,040
On that day,

433
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
there was a solar eclipse.

434
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,560
Khamkaew, who was dancing, started to

435
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:46,520
form scales on her body as if she was turning into a snake!

436
00:31:48,544 --> 00:31:50,720
Khamkaew turned into a snake?

437
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Whether she turned or not

438
00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:57,560
is to be continued.

439
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:05,440
Why don't you keep going? This irritates me!

440
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,240
You want to hear more?

441
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:18,520
It seems Boonta's plays

442
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:20,480
are really entertaining.

443
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:39,809
You! You dare lie to me!

444
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
You all dare lie to me!

445
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:44,240
Kerd! You too!

446
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,680
You were supposed to watch her.

447
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,680
Yet you play along with them!

448
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Boonta is really good at telling these plays.

449
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
I've never heard of them before.

450
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:54,280
They're really entertaining, ma'am.

451
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,680
That's right!

452
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,200
We asked Boonta to tell us those plays, ma'am.

453
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,351
We agreed to help out with her work.

454
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:02,418
If you would punish Boonta,

455
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,200
please punish us too.

456
00:33:04,328 --> 00:33:05,720
Yes, ma'am.

457
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,480
It's nothing. Please don't be upset with Boonta and the staff.

458
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,440
Boonta didn't disobey and didn't take advantage of anyone.

459
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,080
It's alright to let the staff enjoy themselves.

460
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:19,720
They're happy. We get great food.

461
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:21,320
Is that not good?

462
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:23,840
How can it be good?

463
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:25,880
Chang and Chim,

464
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,640
you were supposed to warn her.

465
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:30,560
Yet you helped her fool me!

466
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,960
Boonta didn't mean to fool you, Mother.

467
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,080
She is just trying to find a way to live happily with everyone.

468
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,760
If you want to hear more of those plays,

469
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,680
you can ask Boonta to tell you.

470
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:52,440
Why would I hear more? They're mediocre.

471
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,720
They're not mediocre, right?

472
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,280
No!

473
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:58,960
They got double-digit ratings.

474
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,960
These are popular all over the country.

475
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:05,680
That story's title is "Nakee."

476
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:07,000
That's right.

477
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,640
I have seen a lot of plays.

478
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,880
Tales and legends of naga and garuda,

479
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:14,520
I've also heard countless of them.

480
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:16,720
Yet this love story

481
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,560
between a naga and a human

482
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,320
is entirely new to me.

483
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:22,080
What is the story?

484
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:25,560
I really don't want to "spoil" it.

485
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,560
"Poi?"

486
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:31,920
I mean, reveal the important part of the story.

487
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,880
- I see! - But if

488
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,920
Mrs. Tubtim would like to hear,

489
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:40,102
I'll spoil it for you!

490
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:43,240
Come on. Tell us!

491
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:47,040
What's a "Sompoi?" I don't care if Khamkaew turned into a snake or not!

492
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,440
Whoa!

493
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:49,960
Go!

494
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,040
Move!

495
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,440
Mother.

496
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:56,816
You couldn't sleep last night?

497
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:00,600
You couldn't sleep

498
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:02,918
because you kept wondering about something, right?

499
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:06,400
Could it be that

500
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
someone performed sorcery on you?

501
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,800
What sorcery?

502
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,240
It's Kerd!

503
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,400
She kept snoring all night.

504
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:15,760
It's her fault!

505
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:21,600
If so,

506
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:24,520
please eat this neem with fish sauce,

507
00:36:24,872 --> 00:36:26,560
it can help you sleep better tonight.

508
00:36:51,888 --> 00:36:53,320
Mother.

509
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:55,480
Are you ill or something?

510
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,240
You keep standing up and sitting down.

511
00:36:58,367 --> 00:36:59,880
I can't bear it anymore.

512
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:01,640
If I have to wait until this evening,

513
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,360
my chest will surely burst.

514
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,200
Kerd!

515
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,280
Get Boonta here right now.

516
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,000
Why would you need her, ma'am?

517
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,440
Madam Tubtim might pick a fight with her again.

518
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:15,680
Shut up!

519
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,519
If I don't find out whether Khamkaew turned into a snake,

520
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,000
I will stay up all night again tonight!

521
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,120
It's too late, ma'am.

522
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,040
She left in the morning.

523
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:36,677
Don't tell me Luang kicked you out.

524
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:38,640
Is that why you brought your stuff back here?

525
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,760
Your wedding wasn't even a month ago.

526
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:43,956
Why are you breaking up so early?

527
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:45,560
Hey, Aunt!

528
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,520
I didn't get kicked out.

529
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:49,320
Thanks for the well wishes, though.

530
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm here to start a "course."

531
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:55,560
Boonta will teach you two to work.

532
00:37:55,712 --> 00:37:58,200
So I asked her to teach all of us too.

533
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,280
One day, when you're done with prostitution,

534
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:02,480
done with being a courtesan house guard,

535
00:38:02,561 --> 00:38:04,960
you will have some skills to make a living.

536
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,520
So...

537
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,720
You want my master to do people's hands and feet like you did?

538
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:13,560
Hey, you!

539
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Do you want your master to go hungry

540
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,240
and prostitute herself like you did?

541
00:38:19,724 --> 00:38:22,071
- You scum! - Hey!

542
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:23,152
Wait!

543
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:26,600
What's going on? We live in the same house. Don't fight.

544
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:34,040
A manicurist, a merchant, or a courtesan, we all

545
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:36,320
make money to provide for ourselves!

546
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,880
Whatever your job may be,

547
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,640
if you don't shy away from it,

548
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:42,880
you have value in yourself.

549
00:38:43,496 --> 00:38:45,280
It's about the will to work.

550
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,480
My will has been strong!

551
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,120
People like us

552
00:38:52,183 --> 00:38:54,177
would only get salt rubbed in the wound when we're down.

553
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:56,200
We can never rise again!

554
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:58,440
You've never been in my situation.

555
00:38:58,521 --> 00:38:59,720
What can you understand?

556
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,400
Why can't I understand?

557
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,520
I went through hell as you did.

558
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,680
I was once a Magnate's secondary wife.

559
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:13,200
His main wife didn't give birth.

560
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:15,760
So he hoped to have a son with me.

561
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,400
I was good at trading.

562
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,920
I did accounting and helped the business flourish.

563
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:22,760
Magnate loved me more and paid me more attention.

564
00:39:23,343 --> 00:39:24,640
Unlike his mother,

565
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:25,960
who didn't like me

566
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:28,240
and bullied me every day.

567
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,560
When I got pregnant,

568
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,240
my husband was very happy.

569
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:34,720
He thought he would have a son,

570
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:36,903
but I gave birth to a daughter.

571
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,400
He was disappointed and upset.

572
00:39:39,575 --> 00:39:42,680
He abandoned me and treated me like I was worthless.

573
00:39:43,855 --> 00:39:45,855
And I found out the truth that

574
00:39:46,048 --> 00:39:47,880
I had the wrong idea the whole time.

575
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,560
All that time,

576
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:52,600
my love for him was only one-sided.

577
00:39:53,855 --> 00:39:56,360
So you left that place?

578
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,040
No, I got kicked out.

579
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:01,120
A lone woman

580
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:02,240
with a child

581
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,800
and a mother-in-law to take care of would have nowhere to go.

582
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:09,600
I had to tolerate their bullying.

583
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:14,360
Until my mother-in-law got my husband a new wife.

584
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,680
(Magnate had a son with the new wife.)

585
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:21,640
(His mother framed me for poisoning her.)

586
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,080
(They kicked me and my child out.)

587
00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:26,471
(All I could do was wander.)

588
00:40:26,784 --> 00:40:30,440
(I took my child and left without a home and a job.)

589
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:32,200
(Until)

590
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:34,280
(I got here.)

591
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:35,920
I'm here to sell my wife.

592
00:40:36,104 --> 00:40:37,760
How much would you pay for her?

593
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:41,240
- Hey! - I'm not selling myself!

594
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,080
You will!

595
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:44,680
If you won't,

596
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:46,777
I won't have any money for booze!

597
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,400
You didn't even have a child with me!

598
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:50,840
A wife like you

599
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:52,600
will never make me happy!

600
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:56,400
Stop! You're ruining her price!

601
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,304
Let me see your face! Sit up!

602
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:04,320
Goodness!

603
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,920
Your wife is too old. Who's going to hire her?

604
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,880
If you're drunk, go somewhere else!

605
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,040
If she can't be a courtesan,

606
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:15,040
she can still be a slave, right?

607
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:19,120
I'll buy your wife for two tamleung. Is that enough?

608
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Yeah.

609
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:27,487
There's no refund, though!

610
00:41:34,301 --> 00:41:36,301
You buy her for two tamleung?

611
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,080
What a waste!

612
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,480
Easy.

613
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,600
Come with me.

614
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:57,703
Help me take care of my child.

615
00:42:25,352 --> 00:42:29,120
Aunt, you were brought here to be sold?

616
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:33,560
I was lucky Mother saved me.

617
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,560
After that,

618
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,681
Mother used the little fortune she took with her

619
00:42:39,776 --> 00:42:41,640
to build Fang's Courtesan House.

620
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,200
Mother.

621
00:42:47,408 --> 00:42:50,880
If you can't stand seeing a woman getting sold,

622
00:42:51,112 --> 00:42:53,040
why have you chosen this job?

623
00:42:53,144 --> 00:42:54,320
Had I not chosen this,

624
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:56,032
do you think you can stop other brothels?

625
00:42:56,056 --> 00:42:58,856
Do you think you can stop parents or husbands from selling their girls?

626
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,846
Do you think you can stop poverty?

627
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,240
Do you think you can stop men's lust?

628
00:43:05,927 --> 00:43:08,480
I can't afford to buy every one of these girls' freedom.

629
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,560
What I can do is

630
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,760
prevent them from getting hurt worse.

631
00:43:15,856 --> 00:43:17,120
And our mother

632
00:43:17,224 --> 00:43:21,160
didn't build this place just to provide for her and our family.

633
00:43:27,087 --> 00:43:30,640
(She also saved women who became courtesans)

634
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,360
(from getting assaulted by men, )

635
00:43:32,512 --> 00:43:34,040
(unlike other brothels.)

636
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,080
(She gave them shelter.)

637
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:39,880
(She took in those in trouble, )

638
00:43:40,023 --> 00:43:41,720
(those who can work, )

639
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,640
(even if they're not pretty, )

640
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,721
(and too old like myself.)

641
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,680
(She took everyone in)

642
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:49,640
(and gave us work.)

643
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,360
(Anyone who saved up and wished to buy their own freedom, )

644
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:03,200
(she would let them go.)

645
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,000
Good luck.

646
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,200
(And she)

647
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:20,320
(never lets anyone know that those free girls were once courtesans.)

648
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,080
(That's because she)

649
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,760
(wanted them to start a new life.)

650
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,560
But before I came here,

651
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,440
you were pretty cruel, weren't you?

652
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,960
I forgot my original purpose

653
00:44:35,231 --> 00:44:37,800
and hurt my children without knowing.

654
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:41,920
Thank you for reminding me.

655
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:48,240
No woman deserves to go through this.

656
00:44:48,503 --> 00:44:50,840
If you're down, you have to get back on your feet.

657
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,720
Don't care about those who insult us.

658
00:44:53,912 --> 00:44:56,640
Just don't forget your own worth.

659
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:06,680
Big sis.

660
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:10,480
Are you ready to become a new manicurist?

661
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:38,040
You disappeared all day.

662
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,400
You never stay home!

663
00:45:42,511 --> 00:45:44,440
I'm sorry, Mother.

664
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,280
I had to do something at Fang's.

665
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,120
Can I help you with something?

666
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,120
Perhaps

667
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:55,080
it's about what made you lose sleep last night?

668
00:45:56,424 --> 00:45:58,840
Let me prepare dinner first.

669
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,680
Wait!

670
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:04,560
Let the staff prepare dinner.

671
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:07,880
You can continue to "sompoi" Nakee for me.

672
00:46:10,288 --> 00:46:11,560
Yes, Mother.

673
00:46:14,448 --> 00:46:17,960
So, Thosapol and Khamkaew

674
00:46:18,215 --> 00:46:20,000
didn't end up together?

675
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:22,160
They didn't.

676
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,360
A love that defies the law of the heavens would only end in tears.

677
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,800
It's like Aunt Kerd says

678
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:33,920
a human and a naga can't defy destiny and fall in love.

679
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:37,200
Through so many incarnations,

680
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:38,767
they die and are reborn.

681
00:46:38,848 --> 00:46:40,760
It took so long for them to meet!

682
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,480
What a shame!

683
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:44,000
That's right.

684
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,840
There are encounters and farewells.

685
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,160
We depart to meet again.

686
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,553
At least they get to meet and fall in love

687
00:46:50,655 --> 00:46:53,640
and enjoy their love as much as fate would allow them to.

688
00:46:53,831 --> 00:46:55,440
Don't feel sorry for them, please.

689
00:46:56,457 --> 00:46:58,709
All your plays are tearjerkers.

690
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,648
They're not fun to listen to.

691
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,560
I have something fun and hilarious too.

692
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,600
Would you like a little joke or something totally hilarious?

693
00:47:08,736 --> 00:47:10,278
Or would you like a ghost story,

694
00:47:10,393 --> 00:47:11,962
crime, or fantasy?

695
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:13,640
I have a lot more.

696
00:47:13,736 --> 00:47:15,179
If you want to listen,

697
00:47:15,281 --> 00:47:17,560
I'll tell you every day.

698
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:22,480
But I need my wife back for today, Mother.

699
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,800
You've had my Boonta

700
00:47:26,904 --> 00:47:28,680
telling you plays for a while now.

701
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,512
You didn't let her spend time with me.

702
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,600
I miss my wife so much.

703
00:47:33,307 --> 00:47:35,806
Chaai, you're exaggerating.

704
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:38,879
I didn't let your wife work too hard.

705
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Mother!

706
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,080
Did you just approve her as my wife?

707
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:59,840
You were playing so hard to get that a good woman gave up on you.

708
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,240
Who is going to tolerate that as your wife

709
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:03,760
other than this girl?

710
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,800
You've made me so happy, Mother.

711
00:48:12,087 --> 00:48:14,000
If you want your wife back, you can have her.

712
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:15,208
Go.

713
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,800
Yes, Mother.

714
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:20,345
Wait.

715
00:48:21,407 --> 00:48:23,880
Don't forget the food you told me about.

716
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,480
Yes, Mother.

717
00:48:48,263 --> 00:48:50,680
Tonight's play is called "Repercussion."

718
00:48:51,196 --> 00:48:54,408
What is it about? Karma's repercussion?

719
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:55,600
That's right.

720
00:48:55,856 --> 00:48:57,560
Here's the story, Mother.

721
00:48:57,831 --> 00:49:02,200
It's about a mother who is bossy to

722
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,240
everyone in the house.

723
00:49:05,264 --> 00:49:07,160
Here's the kicker.

724
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,880
One of her daughter-in-laws

725
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:10,920
is a courtesan!

726
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,920
Why does it sound familiar?

727
00:49:17,512 --> 00:49:18,800
Yoi

728
00:49:19,135 --> 00:49:21,135
doesn't want Renu to live in her house,

729
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,200
so she makes her live in the small house.

730
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,193
Is that Renu's life or Boonta's?

731
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,400
I wonder.

732
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,360
You can tell me the story if you want.

733
00:49:34,453 --> 00:49:36,453
After that...

734
00:49:47,182 --> 00:49:49,240
Renu is pregnant!

735
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,120
What's the matter?

736
00:49:52,944 --> 00:49:55,400
You look pale. Are you sick?

737
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,314
I thought that was an act for the play.

738
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,640
If you're unwell, go get some rest with Chaai.

739
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,560
Go on, Chaai.

740
00:50:07,488 --> 00:50:08,680
Come on.

741
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:25,680
It's been a month now.

742
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,160
You and Boonta seem to be getting along.

743
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:33,400
When will you accept her, Mother?

744
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,920
She is actually not an evil woman.

745
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,440
It's just that if I change my mind so easily,

746
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,720
I would look like someone who turns back on her word.

747
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,640
You're overthinking it, Mother.

748
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,840
Nobody would feel that way.

749
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,160
If the male and female lead get together too easily,

750
00:50:53,272 --> 00:50:55,240
the play won't be exciting.

751
00:50:56,256 --> 00:50:58,680
But if there are too many obstacles,

752
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:01,040
the play can get a bad reception.

753
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,240
The male and female lead

754
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:04,960
don't always end up together.

755
00:51:05,344 --> 00:51:09,520
Khamkaew and Thosapol in "Nakee" are examples.

756
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,480
How are you feeling?

757
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:21,440
Are you feeling better?

758
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:23,440
I am.

759
00:51:24,575 --> 00:51:26,448
Why did you suddenly get sick?

760
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:29,680
Did my mother make you work too hard?

761
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:31,960
No, dear.

762
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,520
My wife has been a good girl.

763
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:39,800
I don't know why she won't open up.

764
00:51:42,992 --> 00:51:45,960
I'm afraid you would give up and get a new husband.

765
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:49,840
A "catch" and "premium" husband like you

766
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:51,720
is not easy to find.

767
00:51:58,506 --> 00:51:59,831
My dear.

768
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,560
Do you know how lucky I am?

769
00:52:02,951 --> 00:52:04,600
Think about it. If I

770
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:07,520
hadn't met you,

771
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,680
I wouldn't have survived and lived here.

772
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,760
My dear.

773
00:52:19,158 --> 00:52:20,480
If

774
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,840
I'm not really your Boonta,

775
00:52:26,736 --> 00:52:28,736
would you still love me?

776
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,840
How can you not be Boonta?

777
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,120
I just

778
00:52:38,744 --> 00:52:41,160
look like Boonta.

779
00:52:42,006 --> 00:52:45,240
I actually came from 200 years into the future.

780
00:52:48,072 --> 00:52:49,640
(Ever since you fell into the water, )

781
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,880
you haven't seemed like the Boonta I know.

782
00:52:52,056 --> 00:52:55,280
What if I say I'm not the Boonta you know?

783
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,560
Would you believe me?

784
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,560
Where is this solar eclipse taking you?

785
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:01,520
My home.

786
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,480
Where exactly is your home?

787
00:53:03,632 --> 00:53:06,000
You won't understand if I tell you.

788
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,720
Boonta.

789
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:12,080
Are you a new actor?

790
00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:14,840
You're hot.

791
00:53:16,535 --> 00:53:17,880
So that's why.

792
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,040
After you drowned that day,

793
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,720
you've changed.

794
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:24,640
What's your name?

795
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:29,400
My name is Jeed, or Nittra.

796
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,720
Did you really believe that?

797
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:36,640
You wouldn't lie about something that important.

798
00:53:38,184 --> 00:53:40,920
No matter who you are, what your name is,

799
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:42,760
or where you came from,

800
00:53:43,536 --> 00:53:45,536
I'm already in love with you,

801
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,240
and I'll love you forever.

802
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:51,840
I love you too.

803
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:55,360
I wish that every time I open my eyes,

804
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:58,680
I'll always see you by my side.

805
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:18,360
Where I came from,

806
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,360
I'm a female lead in plays.

807
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:21,720
No wonder

808
00:54:22,112 --> 00:54:23,920
you're good at telling plays.

809
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,120
You got my mother and our entire staff hooked.

810
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,880
I'm not just any female lead.

811
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,040
I'm a rising star,

812
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,600
but I drowned and woke up in the past.

813
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:44,960
Back there,

814
00:54:45,678 --> 00:54:47,320
do you have a husband?

815
00:54:48,728 --> 00:54:50,280
Don't worry about that.

816
00:54:50,408 --> 00:54:52,365
You're my first husband.

817
00:54:52,479 --> 00:54:55,240
Because this incarnation comes before the future.

818
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:57,600
So you have many husbands?

819
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,160
If you mean in plays, I got married many times.

820
00:55:01,255 --> 00:55:03,000
But outside of plays,

821
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,080
I only have "ships."

822
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,280
"Ships?"

823
00:55:09,743 --> 00:55:10,840
Relationships?

824
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:12,544
No, dear!

825
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:15,505
It's just work. We're just giving the fans what they want.

826
00:55:16,426 --> 00:55:20,360
In my life, you're my only husband, my dear.

827
00:55:26,037 --> 00:55:27,280
Here.

828
00:55:28,184 --> 00:55:29,880
I'm wondering one thing.

829
00:55:33,928 --> 00:55:35,600
You came from the time ahead.

830
00:55:36,455 --> 00:55:39,040
Why don't you know important events in history?

831
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,729
I'm sorry, dear.

832
00:55:43,832 --> 00:55:47,160
Your wife is just not good at history.

833
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:51,000
I'm just kidding.

834
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,680
But I'm mad for real.

835
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,680
Then I'll try to make it up to you.

836
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,960
The men where you came from,

837
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:01,720
how do they make up to their wives?

838
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,720
Now I have the power to take on his diva mother!

839
00:56:07,216 --> 00:56:08,520
Let's go, Yam!

840
00:56:09,918 --> 00:56:12,560
Shop to your heart's content, girl!

841
00:56:15,695 --> 00:56:16,840
This one...

842
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:18,120
Boonta!

843
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,840
Is that Mrs. Gaysorn?

844
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,040
It's done.

845
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,200
Thank you.

846
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,760
What color would you like?

847
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,360
Give me any color.

848
00:56:37,448 --> 00:56:39,024
I want to support the new place.

849
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,960
Had you not taught me,

850
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:48,400
I wouldn't have realized how good I am at this.

851
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:52,000
Madam Gaysorn and I

852
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:54,720
intend to start over somewhere else.

853
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,360
We have troubled you all more than enough,

854
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,920
so we want to start a new life in a new place.

855
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,560
Where are you going?

856
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,440
I don't know yet.

857
00:57:10,016 --> 00:57:11,440
Wherever it is,

858
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,640
all I need is Muean and my child.

859
00:57:33,527 --> 00:57:35,920
Think of this as your starting fund.

860
00:57:50,544 --> 00:57:52,800
You won't be home for days?

861
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,360
Captain Henry asked for an audience with the King to say farewell.

862
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,280
He will hold a parade deserving of receiving the Royal Decree.

863
00:58:03,711 --> 00:58:06,840
To ensure the Europeans left with goodwill,

864
00:58:07,505 --> 00:58:10,840
I will lead our troops to escort the delegates in Pak Nam.

865
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:13,280
I hope this negotiation

866
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,280
ends well, my dear.

867
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,880
This Captain is greatly capable.

868
00:58:22,071 --> 00:58:23,760
He did not get everything he asked for,

869
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:25,680
but his gestures are of friendliness

870
00:58:26,335 --> 00:58:27,680
and compromise.

871
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,880
He took great care in learning our language and tradition.

872
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,160
He became more knowledgeable than previous captains.

873
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,600
That's why his negotiation went well.

874
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,000
This Captain Henry passes the "vibe check."

875
00:58:45,327 --> 00:58:46,647
"Vibe check?"

876
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,200
He's like me.

877
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,920
We're good at adapting.

878
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,800
So, would someone who's good at adapting

879
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,240
miss me?

880
00:59:00,976 --> 00:59:03,920
Close your eyes, and I'll tell you.

881
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:20,920
Pad taught me how to make this.

882
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,560
It's to remind you of me when you miss me.

883
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,760
Are you still unwell?

884
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,120
I told you to see a doctor last night,

885
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,640
but you refused.

886
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:53,160
I'm feeling better.

887
00:59:53,288 --> 00:59:56,160
I took cordial last night, and I got better.

888
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,120
I think it's

889
00:59:59,687 --> 01:00:02,800
because I lost sleep making this stuffed goose.

890
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,200
Don't worry about me, dear.

891
01:00:07,664 --> 01:00:09,960
I think we should go upstairs.

892
01:00:10,465 --> 01:00:11,688
Okay.

893
01:00:20,343 --> 01:00:22,200
I'll leave Boonta in your care.

894
01:00:22,751 --> 01:00:24,840
She has been unwell for a few days.

895
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,440
If something happens, please get her a doctor.

896
01:00:30,128 --> 01:00:31,800
You can go on your mission.

897
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:34,981
No one in this house would be so cruel

898
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:37,024
as to let something happen to Boonta.

899
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,280
Chaai, don't worry about us.

900
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:44,120
Everyone and I will take good care of Boonta.

901
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,720
If Boonta successfully pulls this off,

902
01:01:03,983 --> 01:01:06,360
I'll accept her as my daughter-in-law.

903
01:01:06,952 --> 01:01:09,760
Are chicken and duck eggs not enough?

904
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:12,520
Why are we getting lizard eggs?

905
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,040
Be careful.

906
01:01:20,296 --> 01:01:21,680
Boonta!

907
01:01:29,776 --> 01:01:31,000
Chaai.

908
01:01:33,871 --> 01:01:35,760
The strong and resolute Boonta

909
01:01:37,607 --> 01:01:39,800
will never come back to this place.
