1
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,929
Go to Nual's husband's house.

2
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,920
If she snuck out again, I'm going to flog her back off!

3
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:33,800
Buy chips first.

4
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:35,200
I'll buy some for you.

5
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:37,424
This is enough. I don't want to be in debt.

6
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,040
Find out

7
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,720
if this hairpin belongs to Boonta or not.

8
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:47,040
- Mother! Please don't! - Mother!

9
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:48,701
If you flog her, she'd die for nothing.

10
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm going to flog her, so you have an example!

11
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,680
If she dies, you will be staying in Cham's room.

12
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
What's wrong with Boonta?

13
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,058
A potion from a centipede's carcass?

14
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,640
Who could possibly drink that?

15
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,000
If I drink it and you get healed,

16
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,000
I would have.

17
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:07,976
A patient can't drink Chinese medicine.

18
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,560
She would like European medicine.

19
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:11,560
- He got her medicine. - Of course.

20
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:15,800
Thank you, sir.

21
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,600
What are you doing outside this late? If you're done working, go to bed.

22
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,360
Cham?

23
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,200
- Mother! - Ah!

24
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,800
What's wrong, Mother? It's us.

25
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:44,000
I had a nightmare.

26
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:46,672
I saw Cham and her baby.

27
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,800
(Aren't you too cruel?)

28
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,720
(You never sympathize with us as women.)

29
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,328
(Yet you claim to be our "Mother" who protects her children.)

30
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:56,672
(What kind of mother would hurt her child like an animal?)

31
00:03:56,807 --> 00:03:58,720
(Are you still calling yourself a human?)

32
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,800
Tell Mian to prepare some stuff.

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,400
I want to make merit.

34
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
Aunt Mian.

35
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:18,149
Here we are!

36
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,960
Wait, Aunt.

37
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:23,320
I wonder who Cham was? I've heard her name so many times.

38
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:26,800
- Aunt, where are you going? Hey... - Wait. Stop walking.

39
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,800
- Aunt! Sorry. - Move it.

40
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:32,200
Hey, Aunt! Whoa!

41
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:34,578
What was that?

42
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:40,960
You again?

43
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:43,754
Isn't this too much of a coincidence?

44
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,520
Sorry. I found it first.

45
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
But I picked it up first.

46
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:50,312
You found it first, but do you have money?

47
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,112
For such an expensive thing, how many guests does she have to serve, Dang?

48
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:54,640
To make enough money.

49
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,480
Give me!

50
00:04:58,535 --> 00:04:59,920
Young Miss?

51
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,055
You're right about me.

52
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
I can't afford it.

53
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:07,800
I'll pick something else.

54
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,200
I don't want it anymore.

55
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,145
I don't want something tainted by a courtesan.

56
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm a courtesan, not "COVID."

57
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
How can I infect you so easily?

58
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,400
Nonsense.

59
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:26,720
What are you doing?

60
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,360
Let me see.

61
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,520
Let go of my hand.

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,120
I'm just taking a look.

63
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,520
I'm just trying to see her nails, sir.

64
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:51,240
Then you shouldn't be upset, Dokgaew.

65
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,800
She probably has never seen how a noble polishes her nails.

66
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,520
Who said I've never seen it?

67
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,600
I've seen better and more "luxurious."

68
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:03,040
I asked to see because the color looked unusual.

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
I think it's too faded.

70
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
I used to have better colors.

71
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:09,160
Are you looking down on me?

72
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,120
So you don't know the beauty standard of this capital.

73
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm number one. Nobody comes close.

74
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,680
If you call that "high fashion,"

75
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,360
I think I wasn't wrong.

76
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,680
I don't want to brag,

77
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:25,760
but these ten fingers used to have different colors each.

78
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:28,040
I'll show you when I have some time.

79
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,800
It's going to be more of a "hit" than my sash combo.

80
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,400
What was she saying, Young Miss?

81
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,360
She says her nail coloring should probably sell well,

82
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,880
just like her sashes and robes last time. Is that right?

83
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,760
Exactly, sir.

84
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:50,640
If that's the case, you can stay with her and see her nails.

85
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:01,000
Thank you, sir.

86
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,320
Tell me if you need help.

87
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,352
You're a close acquaintance of my friend's.

88
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:08,080
I consider you a close acquaintance too.

89
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,200
Are you sure

90
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,320
if I get too close to you,

91
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:16,560
that young lady won't rip my chest open to kill me?

92
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,872
Why would Dokgaew do that?

93
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,557
From my over ten years of experience in the business,

94
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:29,320
I'll say this about that kind of relationship.

95
00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:33,160
You keep fighting, but you'll end up together!

96
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,102
You're so going to end up together, sir.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,160
Together?

98
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,800
Mother is making merit today.

99
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,080
She seems uneasy.

100
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,400
She woke up from seeing a dead person in her dream.

101
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:00,160
If I were her, I'd be uneasy too.

102
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,200
Chan's incident was that messed up?

103
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,160
Is that why Mother is this upset?

104
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:11,280
Mother locked Cham in her room,

105
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,367
but she hung herself in there.

106
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,680
She hung herself?

107
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:20,440
So that means

108
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,280
Mother must have tortured Cham.

109
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,440
No. Look.

110
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,640
It's because Cham

111
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,560
was in love with the son of a rich man.

112
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,160
They were so in love.

113
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:33,120
They slept together,

114
00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:36,000
but she refused to drink my soup.

115
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:39,040
Mother warned her, but she didn't listen, so she got pregnant.

116
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
That's right.

117
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,480
When she got pregnant,

118
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,320
the man said it was not his.

119
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,240
Then she got abandoned.

120
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
That's how she went crazy.

121
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,743
That's why Mother locked her in.

122
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:54,480
The next time Mother opened the door, Cham already hung herself.

123
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:56,200
She died with a stillborn?

124
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:57,440
That's scary.

125
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,560
You and Luang too.

126
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,120
If you don't want to end up like Cham,

127
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,399
try to expect the worst.

(Buddhist Prayers)

134
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,320
Aunt.

135
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:49,960
The mural paintings here are so detailed.

136
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,000
It's beautiful.

137
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:58,760
Listen. My husband is a painter.

138
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,520
He used to be a drunkard.

139
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:02,720
If he doesn't beat up dogs or his wife,

140
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:04,760
he would be hanging out with his master.

141
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,760
He helps his master paint murals in temples.

142
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:15,440
Aunt, so you know what they used to paint this?

143
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:18,080
Right? What's the pigment they use?

144
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:19,480
- Pigment? - Yeah.

145
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:20,920
It's powder color.

146
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:23,800
They mix powder color with the sap of acacia and wood apple.

147
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:26,960
The mixture is used to paint. It sticks so well.

148
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,200
Oh? Why did you ask?

149
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:33,040
Do you want to be a painter too?

150
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:37,640
I don't want to be a mural painter.

151
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,840
I want to be a manicurist.

152
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:50,800
(Episode 7: Make a Living... The Only Way a Goose Knows How)

153
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:55,840
I'll take one of these.

154
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:57,943
- Is this sap of acacia? - Yeah.

155
00:10:58,247 --> 00:11:01,880
I'll have one of these and some red.

156
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,360
This too.

157
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:17,240
It's really pretty, Boonta! I've never seen anyone do this before.

158
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,120
It's such a bright red.

159
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,720
It looks better than I did with henna leaves.

160
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,760
I did as you said, Aunt.

161
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,858
I mixed red powder in water at first.

162
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,640
But it didn't stick to my nails.

163
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,160
So I switched to acacia sap. And then boom!

164
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,320
Look. I want my nails done too.

165
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,200
Paint my nails for me.

166
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,600
Your nails are all white.

167
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,720
- Yeah. - Why would you want your nails done?

168
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,640
Who's going to look at your nails?

169
00:13:47,204 --> 00:13:50,000
All you do in a day is work in the kitchen.

170
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:51,880
It's going to just fade.

171
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,800
Why? If it fades, you can't paint again?

172
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,080
- Yeah. - Nobody sees them, but you do.

173
00:13:57,223 --> 00:14:02,504
- When you touch things and look at pretty nails, you're happy. - Yeah!

174
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:05,640
If I want a different color, can you do it?

175
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,800
I'll have some red, sir.

176
00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:13,040
Some orange, sir.

177
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:14,526
- Yellow, sir. - Okay.

178
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,240
And green too, sir.

179
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:18,680
Uncle, how much is it?

180
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,760
What are you doing with so many herbal powders?

181
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:23,440
Are you doing a painting for sale?

182
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:26,760
No, sir. I'm going to paint nails with them.

183
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:30,679
You're using these herbal powders

184
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:32,640
to make nail polish?

185
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,680
- Is it possible? - Of course.

186
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,040
It's better than what Dokgaew does.

187
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:41,000
You see, sir. Where I came from...

188
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:43,400
Where I used to live,

189
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:46,320
they can do all kinds of patterns and colors.

190
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,639
They can make nails longer. They can paint pictures.

191
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,360
They can put glowing glitters on them.

192
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:51,600
Or

193
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:54,560
They can also put figurines on nails.

194
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:57,200
So can you do those things?

195
00:14:58,223 --> 00:14:59,640
I have to try, sir.

196
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:01,400
I don't have many tools here.

197
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:05,040
But these things are adaptable, sir.

198
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:06,360
Let me tell you.

199
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:10,000
We're going to be more trendy than anyone in the capital, sir.

200
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,160
Then let me pay for these things.

201
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:16,520
All I'd ask in return is to show me your work, will you?

202
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:17,960
I want to see it.

203
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:20,200
Thank you, sir.

204
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,359
- We have a deal? - Thank you.

205
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:26,114
- Thanks. - Here.

206
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,440
- Is it enough? - Yes, sir.

207
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,440
Thank you, sir.

208
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:55,200
You're not on patrol at this market today.

209
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:56,960
So why are you here?

210
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,720
What about you?

211
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,960
I was just visiting the market

212
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:05,240
and happened to see Boonta shopping.

213
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,720
Thank you so much for these, sir.

214
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,040
I saved a lot on these.

215
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:14,640
I bought you medicine

216
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
and supplement food.

217
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm glad we ran into you.

218
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,880
Otherwise, I'd have to deliver these at the banana bush again.

219
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,760
You snuck out to the banana bush behind Fang's?

220
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,040
It's not just that.

221
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:34,160
He even climbed into my room to see me. We almost got in trouble.

222
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,720
Anyway, thank you for sending me the medicine, sir.

223
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:44,760
Although I couldn't bring Doctor Bradley to you as promised,

224
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,920
seeing you all healthy like this

225
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,320
delights me.

226
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,040
Can you carry all these?

227
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,120
If you can't,

228
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
I'll help carry them to Fang's myself.

229
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:03,800
It's fine, sir.

230
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:05,440
If Fang finds out,

231
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,160
she's going to target me.

232
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,720
Thank you anyway, sir.

233
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:12,720
Don't do this so often. It'd be too much.

234
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,000
It's not too much at all.

235
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,400
I'm happy to help you.

236
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:22,520
If you have any problem, you can always let me know.

237
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,280
It's our job as police officers

238
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:29,280
to address the people's grievances.

239
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,839
You're always welcome.

240
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,519
I have to go back to Fang's now, sirs.

241
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:40,760
I've been out for too long. She's going to get mad.

242
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,120
Thank you, sir.

243
00:18:01,072 --> 00:18:03,280
Brother Chaai, what upset you?

244
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,800
Why are you worshiping Buddha to calm yourself down?

245
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,400
Chaai is probably making merit

246
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
before committing a sin.

247
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:18,768
With that being said,

248
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:22,320
do you know what you did to upset me?

249
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,016
What did I do?

250
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:31,920
You've been acting strange since we were at the market.

251
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:34,672
You followed me here to bother me.

252
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,200
So you're upset about me seeing Boonta at the market

253
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,800
and buying things for her?

254
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,600
So that's the cloth seller.

255
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:45,600
Her name is Boonta?

256
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:49,720
Who's a cloth seller?

257
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,320
Well, the woman my Brother Chaai has feelings for

258
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,960
and bought her clothes for my Sister Pad.

259
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,600
You asked me to stall Captain Jam.

260
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,280
You climbed into Fang's.

261
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,960
You bought the clothes she sold.

262
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,760
He bought her a sash too.

263
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:12,320
It seems you're more serious about Boonta than I thought.

264
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,960
Wait, Brother Chaai and Puek.

265
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,800
Why does the cloth seller stay at Fang's?

266
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,280
She's a courtesan who has a side job selling clothes.

267
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:30,280
I know you don't mind her background

268
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,640
but if you just keep watching over her

269
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:36,320
without being honest with your feelings,

270
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,080
you could regret it again, Chaai.

271
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:00,776
Do you have another hairpin just like this one?

272
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
I would like to have one more.

273
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,160
No. It was just sold out.

274
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,360
Who did you sell to?

275
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,320
Women from the palace,

276
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,720
and courtesans from Fang's brothel.

277
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,080
This belongs to Boonta indeed, ma'am.

278
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:26,280
That's why she gave this to the Magnate as a keepsake.

279
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:35,480
Bring Tis to me.

280
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,095
But you just told him to lay low for now, ma'am.

281
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:40,089
I don't care what Luang Thukkarat does anymore.

282
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,280
If I let this go, the uneasiness would kill me.

283
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,200
(The perpetrator wore a blue turban.)

284
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:29,040
(He has dark brows.)

285
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,560
(He has sharp eyes.)

286
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:34,120
(He has a mole under his right eye.)

287
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,680
Someone followed me.

288
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,440
Where did he go, sir?

289
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:40,280
Magnate Thong's house is not far away.

290
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:44,840
You must have been mistaken.

291
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,360
My family would never sink Boonta's boat.

292
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,520
She used to be our servant.

293
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,680
It's only natural if there's some resentment,

294
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,600
but nobody would kill her, sir.

295
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
Even if you insist so,

296
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:03,160
the investigation

297
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:05,640
requires questioning witnesses,

298
00:23:06,072 --> 00:23:08,600
and evidence to incriminate a suspect.

299
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,520
I haven't caught anyone red-handed.

300
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:18,480
If you see something of notice,

301
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:20,040
please let me know.

302
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:22,400
I'll investigate this further.

303
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:24,287
Of course.

304
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,800
I'm willing to cooperate with the police.

305
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:32,160
If we're done here, I would like to be excused, dear.

306
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:34,840
I'll oversee the servants in the kitchen.

307
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:38,480
Muean.

308
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,000
Be careful, ma'am.

310
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:57,600
Luang.

311
00:23:58,463 --> 00:24:00,560
I have one more thing to discuss with you.

312
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:02,560
Do you have a minute?

313
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,880
It's the bidding for bird nest tax.

314
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,560
Didn't Dokgaew tell you?

315
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,400
Although my brother would be placing a bid,

316
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,656
I am in no way involved.

317
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,840
Everything will proceed officially.

318
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,920
But if you

319
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
get involved a little bit,

320
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:34,800
just convince your brother

321
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,480
to let me win this,

322
00:24:37,216 --> 00:24:39,080
I'll be forever in your debt.

323
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:41,640
And you'll be rewarded handsomely.

324
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,160
Come.

325
00:24:56,383 --> 00:24:58,383
If you're not satisfied with this amount,

326
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,960
I'm willing to pay more.

327
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,400
Just name the price.

328
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,440
Do I look like someone who you can bribe?

329
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:13,393
I perform my duty with integrity.

330
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:15,480
I have always been honest.

331
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,800
I will not trade my pride and honor for money!

332
00:25:18,944 --> 00:25:20,160
Luang.

333
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,767
Don't judge me in a negative way.

334
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:25,360
I do not mean to insult you.

335
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,600
I just want to do whatever it takes

336
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:36,681
to be put in charge of bird nest tax.

337
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:39,880
Even if it's illegal?

338
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:45,040
I understand now.

339
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:49,120
You will always get what you want.

340
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,480
You will do whatever it takes to get it.

341
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:55,360
Whether it's your business

342
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,440
or everything else.

343
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:02,960
As expected

344
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,175
of a police officer.

345
00:26:06,143 --> 00:26:08,143
You sure are so observant

346
00:26:08,824 --> 00:26:10,480
and so wise.

347
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:14,440
Your description of me is probably true.

348
00:26:15,903 --> 00:26:17,520
For what I want,

349
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,840
I will spare no expense to get it.

350
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,040
But you should realize this.

351
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,415
Nobody ever gets everything they want.

352
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:29,960
And if you intend to break the law

353
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,880
to achieve it,

354
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,440
I will handle the matter myself.

355
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:51,960
This is my new business!

356
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,640
Won't you "react" or something?

357
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,360
I don't understand. What are you doing?

358
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,480
I'm opening a manicure and massage place. It's written here,

359
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,880
"Boonta 'Nails and Massage'."

360
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:21,135
I'm just starting a business. Is it so shocking?

361
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,840
Look at you all.

362
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:26,360
We're shocked that you can read and write.

363
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:33,880
I know some noble women in the palace. Only they are educated.

364
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:35,800
You probably wrote random letters.

365
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,320
Hey! You're illiterate and you insult me? I'm going to...

366
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:43,520
So what did you write on there?

367
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:47,200
I'm going to start a manicure and massaging business.

368
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:48,920
See? This is the price.

369
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:52,560
Regular color for two phai. Special color for one feung.

370
00:27:54,814 --> 00:27:57,640
A manicure costs as much as a night with one of us?

371
00:27:57,783 --> 00:28:02,720
Hey, even a manicure requires skills and creativity.

372
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,920
It's the same as any service. More importantly,

373
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,760
in this day and age, the cost of living is high.

374
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,640
I don't work like you girls do.

375
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,240
Please have some sympathy.

376
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:14,880
It's still too expensive!

377
00:28:15,431 --> 00:28:16,680
- Really? - Yeah!

378
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:21,640
Aunt, since this is your idea,

379
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,679
today is my grand opening day.

380
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,999
I'm going to give you a "promotion."

381
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:28,200
It's 50 "percent" off.

382
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
I'm giving you a discount of half.

383
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:32,400
Regular color costs one phai.

384
00:28:32,992 --> 00:28:35,760
A special color costs two phai.

385
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:37,960
If you would like a continuous service,

386
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:40,000
I'll give you a "membership" price.

387
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:41,920
Let's just say it's worth it!

388
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:50,120
Wait, don't go. Wait, wait a minute.

389
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:54,000
I'll give you a free massage on top.

390
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,880
No place offers you a manicure and massage.

391
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:02,600
Girls, you get exhausted from working.

392
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:04,535
You must be feeling stiff.

393
00:29:04,631 --> 00:29:08,480
Your waist, your back, or your neck.

394
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,520
If you get a massage, you will feel as light as a feather.

395
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,040
If you're interested, make a reservation.

396
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:20,840
In one day, I can only do a few sessions.

397
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:28,744
You! You're likely to have back pain.

398
00:29:31,256 --> 00:29:32,840
I'll book a session then.

399
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,880
And you!

400
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:37,000
I know. I see it.

401
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:39,791
You're likely to have neck pain.

402
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:45,800
Me too.

403
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:50,360
Let me be your first guest.

404
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:52,920
Okay.

405
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:57,440
What else do you want?

406
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,560
Nothing, Aunt. I'm just here to see Dokgaew.

407
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,880
I want to show off my nails.

408
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,280
Let's decide who the new "fashion icon"

409
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:09,760
of this capital is.

410
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,640
Did you say acorn? For chicken?

411
00:30:17,052 --> 00:30:18,440
It's still here?

412
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:23,360
Could you give me a discount?

413
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:27,400
It's good stuff. I can't go cheaper.

414
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,760
Then...

415
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,720
Could you please don't sell it yet?

416
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,240
This will be my order.

417
00:30:34,743 --> 00:30:37,120
I'll bring the money later.

418
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:39,320
You're overdressing.

419
00:30:40,344 --> 00:30:42,040
See you, baby.

420
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:45,600
That's mine.

421
00:30:45,697 --> 00:30:48,336
Where would you get the money, Boonta?

422
00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:59,600
Oh, they're selling already?

423
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,050
Sorry.

424
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,800
Could you stay still for a moment?

425
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,920
I'll help you tie your hair.

426
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,400
It's fine, sir.

427
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,400
Stay still.

428
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:57,920
Wait.

429
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,800
I told the seller not to sell it, sir.

430
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,600
How did you get it?

431
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,063
I see you've been eyeing this for a while.

432
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:09,560
So I bought it.

433
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,600
Thank you, sir.

434
00:32:33,032 --> 00:32:36,040
Luang, you bought me too many things, sir.

435
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,520
For this hairpin,

436
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,000
I'll pay you later.

437
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,520
Fine. I'll be waiting.

438
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:50,160
I have something to tell you.

439
00:32:55,992 --> 00:32:58,200
You said you're a spirit possessing Boonta's body.

440
00:33:00,494 --> 00:33:02,240
You said you didn't believe me.

441
00:33:02,591 --> 00:33:04,160
I still don't.

442
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,360
I just want to tell you

443
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,760
even if you're a spirit,

444
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:11,760
or a

445
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,240
- "nyu..." - "New" Boonta.

446
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:18,800
"New" Boonta or something,

447
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,560
- I... - Chaai!

448
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:27,960
What are you doing here?

449
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,880
Dokgaew? See?

450
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,920
Bright color that lasts. With these colors,

451
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,960
it's fab and...

452
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:39,920
Are you trying to make fun of me?

453
00:33:40,471 --> 00:33:42,911
If you're showing off the hairpin he put on you, just say it.

454
00:33:49,223 --> 00:33:50,440
Chaai!

455
00:34:02,363 --> 00:34:03,680
Luang, sir.

456
00:34:03,873 --> 00:34:05,080
So...

457
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,560
I need to go find Aunt Mian.

458
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:09,720
Goodbye, sir.

459
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,520
Yes, Mother.

460
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:12,560
Magnate Son.

461
00:35:13,423 --> 00:35:15,423
I haven't seen you in a while.

462
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:17,640
I thought you've forgotten me.

463
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,640
I visit this place often.

464
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,200
It's you

465
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:23,920
who hasn't been here for me.

466
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,880
I have a lot of guests, sir.

467
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:29,440
Please don't be mad at me.

468
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:32,800
Tonight, I'll take great care of you

469
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,800
to make up for lost time.

470
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,160
I'm not here to see you tonight.

471
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:42,000
There she is. I came to see Chor.

472
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,720
Last time,

473
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:45,520
she really satisfied me.

474
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:48,880
I'll spend my time with Chor tonight.

475
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:53,400
Chor.

476
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:58,600
Get me a table.

477
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,160
Sit with me.

478
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:18,531
You got extra money from last night's guest?

479
00:36:20,655 --> 00:36:22,120
Chor, you got a "tip?"

480
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,400
"Tip?"

481
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:30,400
"Tip" means extra money they give you because they like you.

482
00:36:30,528 --> 00:36:32,840
This means he really liked you.

483
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,200
That's just how men are.

484
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:37,800
Sometimes they just want to try new things.

485
00:36:38,216 --> 00:36:39,960
That's just a one-time luck for you.

486
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,280
A bland-looking woman like you

487
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,072
will never get to be his regular.

488
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,400
Chor is just happy to have a nice guest once in a while.

489
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,480
Could it be

490
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,080
she's bitter about not getting paid?

491
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,920
Is she actually bitter or embarrassed?

492
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,839
Chor outdrew the top girl in the place, and she can't stand it,

493
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,680
so she had to devalue you for revenge.

494
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,520
Nonsense!

495
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,880
Can someone like her ever outdraw me?

496
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:16,480
Even if she's reborn ten times, she would never compare to me.

497
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:18,611
That's too far, Pudsorn.

498
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:20,052
What's wrong with someone like me?

499
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,880
I know I'm not pretty as you are.

500
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,992
But I have my qualities too.

501
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:26,240
Why else would a guest pick me over you?

502
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:28,440
It's just one guest. Don't get carried away.

503
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,240
It's one for now, but there could be next!

504
00:37:31,392 --> 00:37:33,240
- Chor! - Stop!

505
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,800
A beauty without a brain?

506
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,920
All you do is violence. That's not cool, girl.

507
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:40,920
Boonta! Did you insult me?

508
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:42,600
Fine. No insult.

509
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:45,400
Then let's find out once and for all.

510
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:49,040
I'm going to make an "event" where you compete for guests.

511
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:52,245
I'll make you see that every woman

512
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:54,046
has her place in the world.

513
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,360
"Even?"

514
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,142
"Event," ma'am.

515
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:09,800
It's a competition for guests between fellow courtesans.

516
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,760
I just want to help you make more money.

517
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:18,534
Of course. I know your place is the best,

518
00:38:18,656 --> 00:38:21,320
but having a fun little challenge once in a while,

519
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,400
a change of pace would be nice, right?

520
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,680
So what is the competition?

521
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,120
It's a competition between the two of them, Mother.

522
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,080
On one side, it's Pudsorn. On the other side, it's Chor.

523
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:36,360
Whoever gets "paid" more,

524
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:37,840
No...

525
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:40,600
Whoever makes the most money out of guests,

526
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:42,120
will be the winner.

527
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,160
How can Chor possibly compete with Pudsorn?

528
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:47,960
That's what's interesting, Mother.

529
00:38:48,182 --> 00:38:49,519
An underdog

530
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:51,600
is worth rooting for.

531
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,960
Mother.

532
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,800
You barely have to pay anything.

533
00:38:57,944 --> 00:38:59,560
You only stand to gain.

534
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:01,560
We'll do everything as usual.

535
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:04,191
The only difference is we will make it known.

536
00:39:04,295 --> 00:39:06,880
I promise this place will be crowded.

537
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,800
Do whatever you want.

538
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,000
Just don't cause any trouble.

539
00:39:18,112 --> 00:39:21,520
Otherwise, I'll smack you for coming up with this idea.

540
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Okay.

541
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,800
Why did you bring these things?

542
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:36,400
Rehearse your pouring.

543
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,080
Do I need to rehearse? I know how to pour drinks.

544
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,680
You can't do it normally.

545
00:39:42,824 --> 00:39:45,560
You need to pour like an "escort girl."

546
00:39:45,736 --> 00:39:47,760
- "Escort?" - "Girl?"

547
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:51,800
You can't just pour and feed.

548
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,840
You need to pour with an "inner."

549
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,600
"Enoe?"

550
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:01,720
Who's that?

551
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:26,080
Ready?

552
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:29,280
- Watch the legs. Shake your body. - Yeah.

553
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,880
Pop that! Yeah! Pull that out.

554
00:41:44,888 --> 00:41:47,640
I heard Chor is training hard.

555
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,960
You seem so relaxed.

556
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:53,360
I have my regular guests. Why would I be worried?

557
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,440
Don't underestimate her, Pudsorn.

558
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,615
Boonta is on Chor's side.

559
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:02,000
You know how smart Boonta is.

560
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,000
She might have some unusual tricks to draw guests.

561
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,760
Boonta is all talk.

562
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:11,560
She doesn't know how to handle a guest,

563
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,200
yet she dare challenged me in Chor's stead.

564
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,920
I'm sure I'll definitely win.

565
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,640
I'm not taking a side here.

566
00:42:23,783 --> 00:42:25,880
No matter who wins,

567
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,360
I just don't want you to hate each other.

568
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,360
Chor has always been nice to you.

569
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,520
Boonta has never hurt you either, right?

570
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,000
We're bound together anyway.

571
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,680
We need each other.

572
00:42:40,232 --> 00:42:41,760
Let's just be nice to each other.

573
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,360
That's all I ask.

574
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:56,099
This is going to kill me. Ouch.

575
00:43:01,027 --> 00:43:02,480
Are you nervous, Chor?

576
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,200
Even if I act like an "es..."

577
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,080
- "Es..." - "Cort."

578
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:10,520
Like an "escort" as you taught.

579
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,360
I still don't have the confidence.

580
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,680
You know how many regular guests Pudsorn has.

581
00:43:16,024 --> 00:43:17,640
I barely have any.

582
00:43:18,176 --> 00:43:20,176
If you don't have a regular guest,

583
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:21,688
then draw from one-time guests.

584
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:25,560
That's easy for you to say. Where would we get some?

585
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,760
Please come to Fang's brothel, sirs.

586
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,360
Girls, let's seduce.

587
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:53,840
Sirs, please make sure you come to Fang's brothel.

588
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:56,400
This is Lamjeak, and this is Chor.

589
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:58,040
Let's seduce.

590
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:00,840
Please come to Fang's brothel, sirs.

591
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
This is Lamjeak, and this is Chor.

592
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,280
Let's seduce.

593
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,360
Oh?

594
00:44:08,032 --> 00:44:10,647
- Please come to Fang's brothel. - I'm Chor. What's your name, Dear?

595
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:13,520
- Please come and visit me. - Girls, come here.

596
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:15,600
This is Chor and Lamjeak.

597
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:17,987
Luang.

598
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:19,871
What are you doing here?

599
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:23,120
I'm here to invite people to Fang's brothel for an event.

600
00:44:24,136 --> 00:44:25,360
What event?

601
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:29,598
If I tell you, it won't be a "surprise," sir.

602
00:44:29,704 --> 00:44:31,916
I promise it's going to be fun.

603
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,880
Because no brothel has done this before.

604
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:39,680
Please make sure you come to Fang's brothel.

605
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:43,480
If you're interested in what we're doing,

606
00:44:43,703 --> 00:44:45,400
please come and find out, sirs.

607
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,760
Please come, sir.

608
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:52,160
You shouldn't behave in such a way at this place.

609
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,680
"Okay," sir. I'll do it elsewhere then.

610
00:44:57,064 --> 00:44:58,640
Where else are you going?

611
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:01,600
The market, sir.

612
00:45:02,087 --> 00:45:03,480
It's crowded there.

613
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,564
Don't forget, sirs.

614
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:11,120
Please come to Fang's brothel.

615
00:45:13,703 --> 00:45:15,703
See you at Fang's brothel.

616
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,400
Please come, sir.

617
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,016
Girls, come on!

618
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,600
Are you going, sir?

619
00:45:49,879 --> 00:45:50,920
- I will. - I won't.

620
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:54,360
How can you visit such a place, Puek?

621
00:45:54,808 --> 00:45:56,400
Why can't I?

622
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,520
That's right, sir. We've been there.

623
00:45:58,983 --> 00:46:01,240
It's different, Yod. I went there to work.

624
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,320
I'll go there to hang out. Is it wrong?

625
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:05,583
Men hang out at places like that.

626
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,240
I still think it's inappropriate.

627
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:14,320
So you're not going, sir?

628
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,920
I'm not!

629
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,360
As a peacekeeper in this town,

630
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,240
I have concluded

631
00:46:49,464 --> 00:46:50,944
that this event shall not be ignored.

632
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,840
Let's get inside.

633
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,160
We're going to look suspicious if we linger here.

634
00:47:04,264 --> 00:47:07,520
Chaai always complicates simple matters.

635
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,400
I agree, sir. I don't know why he would disguise himself.

636
00:47:10,504 --> 00:47:12,680
They always recognize him every time.

637
00:47:24,992 --> 00:47:26,600
Do we have to do this?

638
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:29,240
If you want to win against Boonta,

639
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:31,040
you have to come and see for yourself...

640
00:47:31,263 --> 00:47:33,222
just what Boonta does

641
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,680
to make Luang Thukkarat so obsessed with her.

642
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:38,129
You expect me to do what she does?

643
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,840
No good woman would behave like a courtesan.

644
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:43,360
Then, good women won't get married, Young Miss.

645
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:46,640
All you do is stitching, cooking, and handicraft.

646
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,040
Boonta has already earned a hairpin from him.

647
00:47:50,895 --> 00:47:52,280
People at the market said

648
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:54,800
there's an event at Fang's brothel tonight.

649
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,471
It's going to be crowded. No one will notice

650
00:47:57,552 --> 00:47:59,000
that we're there in disguise.

651
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:11,760
Welcome, Luang Thukkarat.

652
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,200
You're still in disguise?

653
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:20,680
Okay, sir.

654
00:48:20,784 --> 00:48:24,120
I'll take this as your personal preference.

655
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:28,200
Anyway, please enjoy tonight's event.

656
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,480
This way, sir.

657
00:48:31,911 --> 00:48:33,200
Please, Luang...

658
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,880
I mean, sir.

659
00:49:03,806 --> 00:49:05,367
That's Luang Thukkarat, Young Miss.

660
00:49:12,688 --> 00:49:14,320
Where would you like to sit, sirs?

661
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:20,000
There.

662
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,600
In the room, sirs?

663
00:49:23,864 --> 00:49:25,120
Please, sirs.

664
00:49:37,152 --> 00:49:39,320
Welcome, sirs.

665
00:49:41,472 --> 00:49:43,080
Is this your first time here?

666
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:50,280
If that's the case, my girls would give you a welcome.

667
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,480
Would you like some drinks or snacks then?

668
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:11,560
So do you want anything or not?

669
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:18,520
I do.

670
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:20,760
Okay, sir.

671
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,640
One of my girls will be serving you.

672
00:50:39,392 --> 00:50:40,432
Ming.

673
00:50:41,727 --> 00:50:44,480
Watch the two guests in that room.

674
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,240
I think they seem strange.

675
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,880
Yes, Mother.

676
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,800
If you would like anything more, let me know, sirs.

677
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:00,600
Here, sirs.

678
00:51:22,423 --> 00:51:25,200
I think we should just see her and go.

679
00:51:25,384 --> 00:51:27,680
I have a bad feeling about this.

680
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,120
Young Miss.

681
00:51:29,424 --> 00:51:31,520
The event hasn't started yet.

682
00:51:33,432 --> 00:51:35,432
So where is Boonta?

683
00:54:58,359 --> 00:54:59,760
Luang.

684
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:07,320
Luang Thukkarat. Luang Vasuthep.

685
00:55:09,632 --> 00:55:12,100
Are you drinking without a companion?

686
00:55:12,216 --> 00:55:15,200
My friends are so ready to take care of you.

687
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,640
If you will take care of me,

688
00:55:20,455 --> 00:55:21,800
I'll consider the offer.

689
00:55:23,303 --> 00:55:25,303
Chaai's really here to see Boonta.

690
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,840
Even if he's in disguise, I recognize him.

691
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,639
You have to watch them, Young Miss.

692
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,920
You'll see what trick she uses.

693
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:36,520
I can serve you for my friends, sirs.

694
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,400
But I can't spend a night with you.

695
00:55:40,696 --> 00:55:43,160
Can you flirt with Chaai like they do?

696
00:55:47,256 --> 00:55:49,256
Of course, sirs.

697
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:57,000
This shot will be a bit sweet.

698
00:55:57,607 --> 00:55:59,294
Can you drink it, sir?

699
00:56:03,143 --> 00:56:04,480
Won't you feed him?

700
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,960
Let's drink together then.

701
00:56:14,392 --> 00:56:15,520
"Cheers."

702
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:20,400
Let me go...

703
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:24,600
- Boonta is seducing him! I'll slap her! - Your cover will be blown!

704
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,000
Please be patient, Young Miss.

705
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:32,440
How is it?

706
00:56:38,105 --> 00:56:39,280
This is for you.

707
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:40,920
Thank you, sir.

708
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,280
Let me see...

709
00:56:46,117 --> 00:56:48,117
So I'm good at flirting, sir?

710
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:50,760
If you come and flirt with me,

711
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,840
I'll pay you more than this.

712
00:56:58,538 --> 00:57:00,320
That's Magnate Thong!

713
00:57:00,696 --> 00:57:03,120
What if Gaysorn finds out?

714
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,320
Will you drink with me now?

715
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:33,800
- No! - Luang.

716
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,360
Are you bullying me on purpose?

717
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:36,560
I don't like

718
00:57:36,711 --> 00:57:38,880
how you're being inappropriate with Boonta.

719
00:57:41,352 --> 00:57:42,920
You're winning, Chor.

720
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,120
Am I not too late to join the fun?

721
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,640
While being a courtesan is not illegal,

722
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:53,760
you're under no protection by the law.

723
00:57:56,352 --> 00:57:57,720
It's a job you do willingly.

724
00:57:57,865 --> 00:58:00,040
You accept violation for money.

725
00:58:00,246 --> 00:58:01,320
Hey, Luang.

726
00:58:01,463 --> 00:58:03,440
Are you saying that we

727
00:58:03,536 --> 00:58:06,400
have to accept the risks just because we do prostitution?

728
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:09,320
I know you were just doing your job,

729
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,240
but I don't want to see you ever again.
