1
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:28,640
Maybe today is your day.

2
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:31,680
Please help me. I beg you.

3
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:37,280
In the past, I've always kept one eye closed.

4
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,040
But this time, it's too much.

5
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:41,255
If you still keep doing this,

6
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:42,783
don't step foot at my place again.

7
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:44,320
Just convince your brother

8
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:46,000
to let me win this.

9
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:47,720
I'll forever be in your debt.

10
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,760
Do I look like someone who you can bribe?

11
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:52,240
Someone reported

12
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,544
that you sold sugar to the Europeans without permission.

13
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:57,040
I'm sorry I made your family turn out this way.

14
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,440
I am the new Boonta who has no memory of the past.

15
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:03,280
Whatever happened, just let it go.

16
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:04,760
Let's "move on," sir.

17
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,320
(I'm sorry I took her place, )

18
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,927
(and I can't accept your feelings now, )

19
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,240
(when you've always been there for me since I woke up in this era.)

20
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:21,396
(Episode 9: Mystery... of A Cat Thief)

21
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:28,040
I'll pay you four phai.

22
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:35,360
Hey, you're supporting her business.

23
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,800
Does that mean she's winning you over?

24
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:40,071
That's not the case, Aunt.

25
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,720
I just can't let these girls get more beautiful.

26
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:47,024
It's not just these girls. Look.

27
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,202
Hey, you stopped working for days to take care of Lamjeak.

28
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,600
I hope you haven't got rusty yet.

29
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:03,440
Just be honest and say you want to pay her back for helping Lamjeak.

30
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,840
Stop being tight-lipped.

31
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:07,760
You're talking too much, Chor. Should I teach you your place?

32
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:10,040
Boonta.

33
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,840
Cover these bruises up for me tonight.

34
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,519
I'll get back to work. Please, these...

35
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:21,257
You got beat up half to death.

36
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,480
Wait until you're healed, and you can work for the rest of your life.

37
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,520
My debt doesn't wait.

38
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,560
Listen to Pudsorn please, Lamjeak.

39
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,960
A few more days off won't make you any more in debt.

40
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:37,000
Apart from Boonta, Pudsorn is the one who cares about you the most.

41
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:40,091
She doesn't want to waste the money she paid for your med.

42
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:41,800
Hey, Chor! You...

43
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:50,000
Boonta! What have you done? Why are my nails so dark in green?

44
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:54,320
Boonta! Can she draw a guest with this random color?

45
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,960
It's not random.

46
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:58,176
This is not a regular green.

47
00:04:58,351 --> 00:05:00,680
She's got gardenia flowers.

48
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,160
See these little white things?

49
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,653
Let me tell you.

50
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:09,120
These patterns are going to be a "hit" 100 years from now.

51
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:13,440
Ming, nails are trending among men. Do you want to try it?

52
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,760
No.

53
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,935
I don't want an itch. I'm not doing it.

54
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:19,680
What "itch?" I said "hit."

55
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,570
- It's a "hit!" - What is she saying?

56
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,040
I don't understand a word at all.

57
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:28,120
Hey, what are you doing at my place again, Boonta?

58
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,640
You dare make money in my house?

59
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,400
Mother, you told me not to work at the market.

60
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:42,552
I'm not going now.

61
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:47,385
I'm just doing nails for these girls. Is it so wrong?

62
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,340
You didn't tell me I can't start a business here.

63
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:56,960
So what's this?

64
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,080
You're literate?

65
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,392
And you know the European language too?

66
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:04,760
I studied enough to hold an event.

67
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,670
Mother.

68
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:11,160
I need money to spend too.

69
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,320
If you wish to punish her,

70
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:18,280
punish me too, Mother.

71
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,800
Me too, Mother.

72
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:22,920
If you wish to fine her, fine me too.

73
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,040
It's my fault, Mother.

74
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,040
I neglected her. Please punish me.

75
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,840
Since you're so desperate for money,

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,640
I can't fault you for that.

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,440
If that's the case,

78
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,680
can I do "delivery," too?

79
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,120
I mean I'll take outside jobs, Mother.

80
00:06:55,383 --> 00:07:00,040
Boonta, she gave you an inch, you ask for a mile. Why would she allow it?

81
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:02,592
- Yeah. - Do it if you want to.

82
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:05,276
But if you bring trouble to me,

83
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,560
don't even think of stepping foot outside again.

84
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,047
I promise, Mother. That day will never come.

85
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,160
- I decided to start this business... - Mother!

86
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,343
We've just heard that

87
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,960
your mother has an emergency!

88
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,160
- It's done. - So pretty.

89
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:33,920
Please wait until it dries.

90
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:38,720
- Okay. Open your hands. - Thank you.

91
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,280
Oh, did you "tip" me?

92
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,920
I love your work so much.

93
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:37,360
Boonta is working as a manicurist?

94
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:41,840
It's strange.

95
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,800
But it's as pretty as she claims.

96
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:50,640
She must be doing this as an insult to you, like when she sold clothes.

97
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:54,720
Then we have to teach her a lesson.

98
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,440
Don't, Dokgaew.

99
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,407
It's not worth it.

100
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:06,040
I think we should go home.

101
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:17,520
Is it pretty? You like it?

102
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:20,460
I came up with this formula myself, with Aunt Mian's help.

103
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:36,223
A Luang accompanies you.

104
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:40,640
The rumor that you have the government's backing

105
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:42,960
is probably true.

106
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:46,088
If your accusation is true,

107
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:50,320
it means those officers and taxpayers chose to back the right man.

108
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:54,720
They don't back someone who wants titles to abuse others like you do.

109
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,480
Me?

110
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:58,240
I wish to abuse others?

111
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:02,120
A Chinese like me appreciates the country.

112
00:10:02,655 --> 00:10:05,480
I only wish to serve the country to give back.

113
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,080
I wish for nothing else.

114
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,000
If you wished for nothing else,

115
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,760
you wouldn't have tried to bribe me.

116
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,144
Your connection to Phra Thanasit

117
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,200
seems to be weakened.

118
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:20,680
Such words

119
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,480
are too much of an accusation, Luang.

120
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:25,640
It's not too much.

121
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:28,000
For one woman,

122
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
you tried to abuse and have your way with her in front of me.

123
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:33,560
If you win this bidding,

124
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,016
- wouldn't you use your title to abuse... - Luang!

125
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Stop!

126
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,840
Chaai, picking a fight would only cause damage.

127
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:43,160
If we're confident we can collect more tax,

128
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:44,880
we don't have to be afraid.

129
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,241
Sorry, sirs. The police have received a report

130
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:51,400
that opium was smuggled onto Chim's ship, sir.

131
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,880
You haven't been appointed yet,

132
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:03,760
but the title

133
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,247
seems to be getting out of your reach now.

134
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:46,760
It's such a shame.

135
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,200
Magnate Thuam was always honest in his business.

136
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,280
It's a shame his sons do this.

137
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:56,800
Watch your words, Magnate.

138
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:59,040
We haven't investigated this matter.

139
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,040
If it turns out to be a framing, you'll be in trouble.

140
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,862
The evidence is incriminating.

141
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,400
What else do you have to investigate? It's a waste of time.

142
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:09,920
Unless

143
00:12:11,015 --> 00:12:14,160
you're willing to show leniency to your own brother.

144
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,360
Anyone who breaks the law

145
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,760
shall be punished accordingly with no exception.

146
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:21,311
Opium crimes carry severe punishment.

147
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:23,600
We have to find out the truth first.

148
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:28,240
Okay. Please be quick with your investigation.

149
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,040
Luang, sir.

150
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,280
Under every crate in my ship,

151
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,760
there is a double lion symbol.

152
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:14,240
There's no symbol on this one.

153
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:18,480
That means someone snuck it in to frame the ship's owner.

154
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:22,120
And they specifically chose to do it today.

155
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,720
What?

156
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,640
With that look of yours,

157
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:29,520
do you think I did it?

158
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,800
You're highly respected

159
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:36,360
as a fair and just officer.

160
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:41,040
I hope you don't accuse anyone randomly.

161
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:44,520
We don't accuse anyone without a witness.

162
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,880
- Take him here. - Yes, sir.

163
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:07,040
A witness saw this man

164
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,360
snuck this crate into the ship.

165
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,160
Did you do it?

166
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,880
Who told you to do such a thing?

167
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:29,000
If you don't want a punishment of three rounds of flogging,

168
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,840
three days of public display on land and three days on a boat,

169
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,760
confiscation of your wife and children and wealth,

170
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:37,063
and working as an elephant feeder,

171
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:38,760
confess now!

172
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,880
Magnate Thong hired you to do this, did he not?

173
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:29,920
In the end,

174
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,960
Chim will win it anyway!

175
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,467
But aren't we lucky?

176
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:39,520
At least we didn't get caught trying to frame him.

177
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:43,400
We failed because I have a useless servant like you!

178
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,560
I trusted you to work for me!

179
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:48,240
You made a mistake and we lost to Luang Thukkarat!

180
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,000
- It's my fault. I deserve to die, sir. - Go now!

181
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,360
Go and make sure the mute's family

182
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:55,400
doesn't put this one on me!

183
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:59,400
If I get in trouble, you'll be the first one I kill!

184
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,160
- Go! - Yes, sir!

185
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:20,807
We know Magnate Thong is pulling tricks to win this bidding.

186
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,440
It's a shame we can't incriminate him.

187
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,320
I feel sorry for those people taking the punishment for him.

188
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
At least we're still lucky

189
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,480
that Chim has won this bidding.

190
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,040
If Magnate Thong had won,

191
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:38,600
he would surely extort the people.

192
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,080
The problem is

193
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:45,480
you're going to be drowning in your work.

194
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,960
Monk Chang is about to leave monkhood.

195
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,800
I'll have someone to help me.

196
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,520
Speaking of Monk Chang,

197
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,560
we haven't seen him in a while.

198
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,320
If so,

199
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,376
let's visit him and tell him Master Chim's good news.

200
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,177
Don't worry. I'm fine.

201
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:37,160
I'm all stiff though.

202
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,760
- Watch your hands. - Come on.

203
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,360
Hey, why aren't you docking?

204
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,720
It's them, Master. They're blocking us.

205
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,640
Then you tell them.

206
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,040
Hurry up.

207
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:54,920
I need to make merit!

208
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,160
Hey, hurry up! My master is in a hurry.

209
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,840
Hey, you need to queue up.

210
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,080
Master or slave, we all have to wait.

211
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:04,880
Let's go, girls.

212
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:06,560
Come on, Mother.

213
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:08,000
Sucks to be them.

214
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:11,400
Come on.

215
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,080
Push them off.

216
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:29,720
Did you just try to sink our boat?

217
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:33,080
Can't you wait a little? Does it hurt your pride that much?

218
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:35,920
You think you own the dock, huh?

219
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:37,680
If you want to take your time,

220
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:41,120
spend the money from your prostitution to build your own dock.

221
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:46,360
If you can't be nice and think positively at a temple,

222
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,040
you won't go to heaven with any amount of merit you make.

223
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,560
Did you just curse my master?

224
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:52,920
Curse you too, you boot-licking slave!

225
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,160
Dang, slap their mouths!

226
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:56,400
Yes, ma'am!

227
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,960
Slap them, Dang! Do it!

228
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:00,415
- Dang! - Yeah!

229
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:02,720
- That's it. - Ouch!

230
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,280
That's the Luangs.

231
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,920
Change of plans. Let's get slapped into the water.

232
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,040
That's it, Dang! Slap them!

233
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:18,040
- Ah! - Hey!

234
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,655
Dokgaew!

235
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:31,160
Dokgaew, Dang! Help my daughter!

236
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:34,720
Why did you slap my daughter? Dokgaew!

237
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:37,440
Dokgaew! Please help her!

238
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:39,000
She's gone!

239
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,760
Dokgaew!

240
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,279
You have to take care of this, Chaai.

241
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,920
She almost killed Dokgaew.

242
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:48,400
You almost lost your fiancée.

243
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,440
We didn't start it, sir.

244
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,960
Besides, my friend was the one who almost died.

245
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:55,127
This madam and young miss

246
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:57,040
ordered their boat to crash into ours.

247
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,720
Is that true?

248
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:06,088
I just wanted them to move.

249
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:07,600
I waited too long.

250
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,160
They didn't take it well. When we got up, they called us out.

251
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,960
You saw her push me into the water.

252
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:16,662
I was so scared.

253
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,920
You were going to slap me, weren't you? I was defending myself.

254
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:22,440
Besides, I didn't push you that hard.

255
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,440
That's true. I'm a witness.

256
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,503
Dokgaew is acting, sir.

257
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:33,120
It's up to you if you believe me or not.

258
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:36,080
As for you, I know you don't like me.

259
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,480
But your fiancé and I are just friends.

260
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,880
Don't do something stupid like this again.

261
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,560
It's not worth it to risk your life for a man.

262
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,590
Let's go.

263
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:54,271
You insulted my master and just left?

264
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:58,360
Dang!

265
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:02,720
So what happened

266
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,680
was an accident. Is that right?

267
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:11,800
Then let's not drag it out any further. People are going to talk.

268
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,328
Just go on your ways, ma'am.

269
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:24,800
I understand now why Brother Chaai

270
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:26,400
likes this woman.

271
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:29,160
Boonta is a courtesan,

272
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:32,080
yet she possesses such a broad mindset.

273
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:36,600
You don't mind the fact that she's a courtesan?

274
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:40,720
A king, a merchant,

275
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,920
a villager, a laborer, a thief,

276
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:45,920
or even a prostitute,

277
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:47,640
Buddha

278
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:50,247
treated people of all occupations the same.

279
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:54,240
Why would I mind her?

280
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,960
What about you, Brother Chim?

281
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,680
What do you think?

282
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,840
I don't mind her.

283
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm just worried that

284
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:10,160
if Mother doesn't approve,

285
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,760
Chaai's love life won't go well.

286
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,360
So far,

287
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,568
no matter how stubborn Chaai is,

288
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,000
Mother still loves him and lets him have his way.

289
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:23,880
But this is a serious matter.

290
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:26,400
Mother won't allow it so easily.

291
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:37,560
- We're here. - What took you two so long?

292
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,560
Something happened.

293
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,878
So how is Mother doing?

294
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:46,800
She's staying strong. She was probably expecting it.

295
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,080
Her mother had been sick for a long time.

296
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,320
Mother went home often to visit her.

297
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:58,480
So she was away so often

298
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:01,744
to spend time with her mother in her final moments?

299
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,680
Doesn't she have nobody else in her family?

300
00:23:06,103 --> 00:23:09,320
She has her mother and daughter.

301
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:11,200
Her husband is dead.

302
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,632
In the past, she didn't want her daughter in the house.

303
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,640
So she left her with her mother.

304
00:23:17,494 --> 00:23:19,000
Mother is probably shocked.

305
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,680
She won't get to visit her mother anymore.

306
00:23:22,537 --> 00:23:24,200
I know how that feels.

307
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:26,800
When Lamduan died, I was shocked too.

308
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:28,960
When my father died, I was shocked too.

309
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:32,823
It's just how humans are.

310
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,200
We meet to get attached.

311
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,400
One day, we have to say goodbye.

312
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:41,240
That's what I think. My husband died and I never found a new one.

313
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,320
It's the attachment.

314
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:45,781
When one departs, it makes you sad.

315
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,440
If you get attached again, you'll only get sad again.

316
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,000
You're lucky, Pudsorn. A courtesan doesn't do attachment.

317
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,960
Is that true?

318
00:24:07,943 --> 00:24:09,744
Why did you follow me, sir?

319
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,560
Are you going to arrest me?

320
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:14,560
Are you mad at me?

321
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:18,360
Why would I be mad at you,

322
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,560
Luang, sir?

323
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,480
I know you were doing your job.

324
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:26,200
Are you jealous then?

325
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,184
I just wasn't sure if

326
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:34,680
you would take your fiancee's side over your friend's.

327
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,200
Apparently, your fiancée gave an "Oscar" worthy performance.

328
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,960
Odd? What odd?

329
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:51,880
Forget it, sir. Let's just say I understand you, Luang, sir.

330
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:53,941
I don't want trouble with your fiancée.

331
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,960
And you don't have to give me attention.

332
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:58,960
Let's leave each other alone.

333
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:02,191
I have to go.

334
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,960
We're friends, aren't we?

335
00:25:08,535 --> 00:25:10,080
Why would we leave each other alone?

336
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:13,240
You said friends can care about each other.

337
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,400
I care about you. Is that so wrong?

338
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:22,080
You can care about me from a distance, sir.

339
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,920
Keep your distance.

340
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:30,520
Distance. Keep a distance, sir.

341
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:33,680
Keep a distance.

342
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:40,840
Distance! Okay, Chaai? No...

343
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:42,360
Luang.

344
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,240
What's wrong with me?

345
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:01,480
Are you still angry that Chaai visited Monk Chang and didn't take you home?

346
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:06,560
It's not just that, Mother.

347
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,000
Chaai asked me to take you home.

348
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:18,080
Again, sir?

349
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,960
You sure love your friend.

350
00:26:23,423 --> 00:26:25,360
You sure love my friend.

351
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,320
You even jumped into the water.

352
00:26:30,376 --> 00:26:32,120
I agree with Boonta though.

353
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,360
Don't do this again.

354
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
Otherwise,

355
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,160
I'll tell Chaai

356
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,760
about you sneaking into Fang's.

357
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:47,920
You said you would keep it a secret.

358
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:49,640
Are you angry

359
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,360
that I got you wet?

360
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,800
I serve in the Police Force.

361
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:58,360
Of course I help those in trouble.

362
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:01,080
But when you do such foolish things,

363
00:27:01,751 --> 00:27:03,600
not only did I not want to help,

364
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:05,640
but I also realized

365
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:07,904
why Chaai doesn't love you

366
00:27:08,215 --> 00:27:10,100
but falls for Boonta so hard.

367
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:17,880
Dokgaew! Leave now!

368
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,999
Are you still angry at Boonta?

369
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,840
Boonta got off easy again

370
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,760
because Luang refused to punish her.

371
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't know why he's so obsessed with her.

372
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:47,080
Please do something, Mother.

373
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:50,440
Otherwise, I'm going to lose Chaai to Boonta.

374
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:02,240
From now on, Kleeb will be living here.

375
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,720
Please take care of my daughter.

376
00:28:04,904 --> 00:28:08,760
And don't let her hear a bad word.

377
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:11,080
Yes, Mother.

378
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,600
Mother.

379
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,200
I just brought Plang and my child here.

380
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,040
I'm here to introduce them.

381
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:21,720
So where are you living?

382
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:24,488
I'm renting an apartment nearby,

383
00:28:24,815 --> 00:28:26,640
so I can help her out sometimes.

384
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:29,840
Good. Your child can be playmates with my Kleeb.

385
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:32,160
Kleeb, say hello to the kid.

386
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:36,800
Your child is so cute.

387
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:40,200
What's your child's name?

388
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:42,200
His father's name is Ming,

389
00:28:42,576 --> 00:28:43,920
so I named him Mak.

390
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,200
Mak and Aunt Mian. That sounds similar!

391
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,720
You're Grandma Mian to him, not Aunt now.

392
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,600
Boonta!

393
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:56,080
Mother.

394
00:28:56,335 --> 00:29:00,280
For me, you can call me Sister Pudsorn. I don't mind.

395
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,320
You all are speaking nonsense.

396
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,511
Ming, take your family to get settled.

397
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,840
Yes, Mother.

398
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:11,440
Girls, if you have work, go and do it.

399
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:14,120
- Yes, Mother. - Let's go.

400
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:16,720
Boonta.

401
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:21,720
If you have no guests, please watch my daughter, Kleeb.

402
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:24,260
- Me? -Yeah.

403
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:34,503
Oh? I love you. How are you? Good girl.

404
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:41,720
So Mother thinks I don't have enough work to do?

405
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:43,888
Is that why she's making me babysit?

406
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:47,640
Think of it as a distraction.

407
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,000
So you can keep your mind off Luang Thukkarat and give up on him.

408
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,040
Okay. I'll do it.

409
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:57,351
Let's all help.

410
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,040
Pudsorn.

411
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:09,071
Bi... No! Chor, I want to buy a new sash.

412
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,520
Help me choose one. Come on.

413
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:13,760
There's a cloth seller over there.

414
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:17,000
- Lamjeak - Yes?

415
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:23,760
Laundry. I need to do laundry with Nual! Help me do laundry.

416
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,400
- We need to do laundry. - We have to go.

417
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,598
Hey, I haven't asked you anything!

418
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:36,400
Where are you going?

419
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,662
- Ming. - Yeah.

420
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:45,840
I used to babysit, but not a child this old.

421
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,000
- Hey, we're friends. - Used to.

422
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,560
- Aunt! - Oh, Boonta.

423
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:57,520
You don't need to shout! What the f...

424
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,359
What the foot, ma'am?

425
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,960
Aunt, please help me.

426
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,792
I beg you.

427
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:11,480
Boonta.

428
00:31:12,463 --> 00:31:13,880
You need to help us.

429
00:31:14,103 --> 00:31:15,480
I beg you.

430
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,160
Take Young Miss Kleeb

431
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,560
and go somewhere far from us for a while.

432
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,792
Where do I go, Aunt?

433
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:25,160
Anywhere.

434
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:28,440
Let us take a breather.

435
00:31:28,646 --> 00:31:29,967
Darn it!

436
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,400
Okay.

437
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,800
You're cute.

438
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,760
Young Miss Kleeb.

439
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,440
Shall we go out for a "job?"

440
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:49,287
What is a "job?"

441
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,680
It's done. Wait until it dries.

442
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,080
It's nice and bright. I love it.

443
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:09,880
Thank you, ma'am.

444
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,280
Here.

445
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,040
Thank you.

446
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,280
We earned some money!

447
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:26,200
For you, this is free.

448
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,360
Really? Thank you.

449
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,240
Young Miss, we got free Lod Chong!

450
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:38,080
It's not Lod Chong. That's Nok Ploi.

451
00:32:39,593 --> 00:32:42,240
They call Lod Chong in this era Nok Ploi?

452
00:32:43,472 --> 00:32:44,720
That means a bird's outlet.

453
00:32:44,975 --> 00:32:46,975
Like Letting a bird out to make merit?

454
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:49,080
It's the shit a bird lets out.

455
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,400
Bird shit?

456
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:02,680
Young Miss?

457
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,600
Ma'am, thank you.

458
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:07,200
Young Miss, where are you going?

459
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:10,480
Young Miss?

460
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:13,800
Young Miss?

461
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:15,600
"Stop!"

462
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:17,680
Stop right there, ma'am.

463
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,680
You can't go in there. That's not a place for children.

464
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:25,480
I can get in my mother's house. Let me visit this place for a bit.

465
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:27,880
Young Miss!

466
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,880
Hey! Whose kid is that?

467
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,360
Stop right there. Ouch!

468
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,080
Young Miss!

469
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:44,400
Young Miss!

470
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:47,280
- Who's there? - What the heck?

471
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:49,840
- Whoa! - What are you doing?

472
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,000
- What's that? - Hey!

473
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:55,840
Young Miss Kleeb!

474
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:57,945
Young Miss Kleeb! Where are you going?

475
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,520
Young Miss!

476
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:02,280
Sorry. Young Miss Kleeb!

477
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,629
Young Miss!

478
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,360
Are you hurt?

479
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,240
You're not hurt, right?

480
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:10,560
Okay.

481
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:12,600
So...

482
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,920
The king of the first reign ordered

483
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:31,840
the establishment of a new capital on the bank of the Chao Phraya River.

484
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:36,120
He gave land to the Chinese who would relocate to Sampheng.

485
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,920
The Chinese are knowledgeable in trading,

486
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,600
shipwrighting, and navigation.

487
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:46,280
That's why this place is the largest center of trade.

488
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:51,040
Many Chinese workers migrate here to settle down.

489
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:54,240
At first, most were males

490
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,040
who didn't bring their families.

491
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,880
That's why Fang's business is thriving.

492
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:05,000
Of course, there was a demand.

493
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,800
So there was a supply.

494
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:16,360
I mean if some want to buy, others will sell.

495
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,920
Oh, Luang, sir.

496
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,765
It's so crowded here.

497
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,120
It would be bad if there's a fire.

498
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,680
There was a huge fire during the first reign.

499
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,424
These wooden apartments are close together.

500
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,240
There was barely any free space.

501
00:35:32,456 --> 00:35:34,760
That's why the fire spread fast.

502
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:37,439
The Chinese were in a panic.

503
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:40,400
The police back then had a hard time containing the fire.

504
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:43,160
Oh! So they say,

505
00:35:43,504 --> 00:35:46,960
"Like a Chink in a fire?" That came from the Sampheng fire.

506
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:51,920
I knew it.

507
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,560
Are you alright?

508
00:36:08,183 --> 00:36:09,520
I'm fine, sir.

509
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:16,503
Distance. Keep a distance.

510
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,200
I showed you around.

511
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,200
Next time, tell an adult before you go somewhere.

512
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:34,660
- Don't make them worried. - Yes, sir.

513
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,960
You're good with children, sir.

514
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,583
He used to babysit his brother.

515
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,920
A child is like an adult.

516
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,160
If you listen to what they think,

517
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:48,320
it's not hard to understand them.

518
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:51,680
So if she understands now,

519
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:53,800
let's go home, shall we?

520
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,560
Why are you in such a rush?

521
00:36:56,296 --> 00:36:57,960
Kleeb is an obedient girl.

522
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,200
Should I show you one more place?

523
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:01,680
That's great, sir!

524
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:07,656
Why didn't you ask me?

525
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:09,880
My legs hurt! I can't walk anymore!

526
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,520
In every Chinese settlement,

527
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:22,080
they establish a shrine for the gods in their community.

528
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,480
Their gods protect the people in their community

529
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,560
and lead them away from obstacles.

530
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,940
So they become successful.

531
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,960
If they do trading, their business will thrive and flourish.

532
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:40,160
If so, can I wish for my mother and Sister Boonta

533
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:42,560
to sell well, sir?

534
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,480
Again?

535
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,600
Boonta.

536
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,720
Sorry, sir.

537
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,840
It was nice and cool.

538
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,880
Although you don't remember,

539
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:15,160
you haven't changed at all.

540
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:22,240
What do you mean?

541
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:28,600
When we first met,

542
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:30,560
you were just like this.

543
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:51,376
Boonta!

544
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,600
It's rude. Why would you sit beside the police?

545
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,520
Sorry, sir.

546
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,359
You were probably bored of the preaching.

547
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,000
That's exactly what happens in a soap opera.

548
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:12,440
Boonta liked to take a nap, huh?

549
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,390
I thought you were seducing me like women would do.

550
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,080
You think you have that much "rizz?"

551
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,040
"Rizz?"

552
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:28,360
What does that mean?

553
00:39:29,295 --> 00:39:32,640
So handsome, or something.

554
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:36,240
So what happened next?

555
00:39:39,655 --> 00:39:41,120
We never saw each other again.

556
00:39:42,872 --> 00:39:45,360
I wanted to find out what you thought of me,

557
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:47,600
so I snuck.

558
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:52,960
Here, sir.

559
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,520
Thank you.

560
00:39:56,653 --> 00:39:59,160
- It's so refreshing. - Yes, sir.

561
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,880
Luang?

562
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,200
Help him up.

563
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,200
Come on.

564
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:51,120
Here, sir.

565
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,135
You have a wound, sir?

566
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,600
So Boonta must have been so lovely, right?

567
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:38,360
Is that why someone who keeps his "form" like you smile so much?

568
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:41,800
"Form?"

569
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,440
It means you keep your look.

570
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:46,720
Act cool, no expression, with a mean look.

571
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,520
You can skip that.

572
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,672
Are you jealous of yourself?

573
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:57,800
No, I'm not jealous.

574
00:41:58,063 --> 00:42:01,840
I just don't understand why you would tell me. I told you

575
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:04,560
I'm New Boonta.

576
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,256
I'm not the same old Boonta you know.

577
00:42:07,912 --> 00:42:10,200
Even if you're not, it's fine.

578
00:42:12,775 --> 00:42:15,160
I like the new Boonta too.

579
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,760
With the old Boonta,

580
00:42:23,736 --> 00:42:25,736
we might not have spent much time together.

581
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:29,760
That's why we departed with a misunderstanding.

582
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:34,720
But with this new Boonta,

583
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:37,720
I feel different.

584
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:42,520
Different how?

585
00:42:45,168 --> 00:42:47,480
The more I see you, the more I want to get to know you.

586
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,480
I want to explore.

587
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:53,800
I want to spend more time with you.

588
00:42:56,352 --> 00:42:59,360
The new Boonta impresses me more than the old one.

589
00:43:05,288 --> 00:43:06,600
Young Miss Kleeb.

590
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,087
Let's get a fortune stick.

591
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:10,728
Let's go.

592
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:33,520
I'm unlucky. I'm not making money. And I'm about to have a major disaster?

593
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,680
How does one have such a bad luck?

594
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,880
Or that Chinese uncle misread it?

595
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,120
Oh no!

596
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:46,640
That thieving cat! It's on the roof again!

597
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:48,088
A thieving cat?

598
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,240
You didn't listen. Where did you go? Why did you come back together?

599
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:26,560
I ran into him, and he wanted to investigate the case.

600
00:44:27,136 --> 00:44:28,480
Here.

601
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,600
You inspected this room once. What else do you suspect?

602
00:44:34,663 --> 00:44:37,520
The killer might have taken Lamduan through the roof.

603
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,560
The roof?

604
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,080
The roof, sir?

605
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,720
There are no holes in the roof.

606
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,360
It's too tall to climb, isn't it?

607
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,480
Don't scratch it.

608
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:00,343
Is this okay, sir?

609
00:45:01,223 --> 00:45:02,880
I just want to make sure.

610
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,112
We're lucky Mother is running an errand.

611
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:09,939
If she finds out you let police climb her roof, she's taking your head.

612
00:45:10,086 --> 00:45:13,400
- Don't argue! - What are you doing here, Luang?

613
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,160
Mother?

614
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,904
I'm here to investigate Lamduan's case.

615
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:27,880
Investigate? How does that involve climbing my roof?

616
00:45:28,512 --> 00:45:29,800
He suspects that

617
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:32,000
the killer climbed in through the roof, ma'am.

618
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,480
What kind of crazy man would climb my roof?

619
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:37,320
Unless he has a thin skin

620
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:39,720
and is too embarrassed to be seen at a courtesan house.

621
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,840
Or it could be a thief

622
00:45:41,968 --> 00:45:43,840
who steals someone's property.

623
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,224
- Are you accusing me? - Is that not true, sir?

624
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,800
If you don't cooperate,

625
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,600
that's up to you.

626
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,520
Don't think I don't know, sir.

627
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,520
You keep visiting this place

628
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,120
for a reason.

629
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,560
If you don't want to disgrace yourself,

630
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,680
don't steal my property.

631
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,120
If you want to own her,

632
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:08,800
you can buy her for ten chang.

633
00:46:17,016 --> 00:46:18,720
Does that mean Mother

634
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:21,720
will let Luang buy you out?

635
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:24,680
How long are you going to listen?

636
00:46:25,936 --> 00:46:27,200
Mian.

637
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:31,880
- You can go. - Yes, Mother.

638
00:46:32,007 --> 00:46:34,815
And you, come with me upstairs.

639
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,280
You?

640
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:38,920
You!

641
00:47:24,823 --> 00:47:28,480
Kleeb, come and see my nails getting done.

642
00:47:33,127 --> 00:47:34,720
See? Is it pretty?

643
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,120
It's pretty, but what Sister Boonta did

644
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,520
for sellers in the market was even prettier.

645
00:47:43,423 --> 00:47:44,680
Hey, you!

646
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,280
You snuck my daughter out with your job?

647
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,080
I just showed her around town, Mother.

648
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,680
Young Miss Kleeb, you loved it, right?

649
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,680
I did. Sister Boonta gave me candied monkey apples

650
00:48:03,823 --> 00:48:05,760
and we visited a shrine.

651
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:10,400
I made a wish for you and the girls to thrive in your business.

652
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:14,872
You're the best. My good girl.

653
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,720
What are you smiling about?

654
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:26,696
It's nothing.

655
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:31,440
I just realized what it's like for someone who wears multiple hats.

656
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:33,560
One can have many roles.

657
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:36,000
That's why we behave differently to different people.

658
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,312
It's about what side we show to who.

659
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,960
I'm glad you realized that,

660
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:44,400
so you don't fall for an illusion.

661
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,640
You and Luang may have liked each other,

662
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:52,320
but this is your fate now.

663
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:57,239
Don't buy the sweet dreams he sells to you.

664
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,200
Your status and his are too different.

665
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,980
Your love is not meant to be.

666
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,720
So a courtesan has no right to love?

667
00:49:12,224 --> 00:49:16,480
You have. Everyone has the right to love or not love anyone.

668
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:18,360
Luang may love you,

669
00:49:18,511 --> 00:49:21,920
but do you think his mother would approve?

670
00:49:24,263 --> 00:49:25,560
And don't forget.

671
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:27,960
You're already spoken for.

672
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:31,711
From what I know, Captain Jon is a good man.

673
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,360
If you're with him, even if he's not the one you love,

674
00:49:35,874 --> 00:49:38,320
you'll probably be more happy.

675
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,600
Hoan, sir!

676
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:03,240
I'm so glad to see you. I have something to ask.

677
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:05,640
What is it this time?

678
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:10,320
Well, I want to know how much time I have left.

679
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,160
You said

680
00:50:12,406 --> 00:50:13,855
next month,

681
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:15,920
but what's the date?

682
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,680
Next month.

683
00:50:22,182 --> 00:50:23,680
Hey, Boss.

684
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,600
Let me borrow a paper and a brush.

685
00:50:27,481 --> 00:50:28,880
Next month.

686
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:46,680
Here.

687
00:50:50,023 --> 00:50:53,360
I need a date, not a lottery. What's this?

688
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:55,080
That's the date.

689
00:50:55,327 --> 00:50:56,760
Can't you read?

690
00:50:58,744 --> 00:50:59,840
Look.

691
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:03,520
On the left is the number of the day.

692
00:51:03,903 --> 00:51:06,080
One means Sunday.

693
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,280
On the right is the number of the month.

694
00:51:09,751 --> 00:51:13,320
If there is a number up here like this,

695
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:15,400
that means a waxing moon.

696
00:51:17,015 --> 00:51:20,200
That's a four. So Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed.

697
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:21,737
- Wednesday? - There. That's right.

698
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:23,293
- Third month. - There!

699
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:24,960
Waxing moon ninth?

700
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,295
The ninth day of the waxing moon.

701
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,319
- Ninth day of the waxing moon. - Correct!

702
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:32,440
But you have to remember,

703
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:34,960
this is just a prediction.

704
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,080
It probably will happen,

705
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,680
or it won't happen.

706
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,240
Everything

707
00:51:41,344 --> 00:51:43,960
depends on the heavens.

708
00:51:46,224 --> 00:51:48,960
At this point, I need hope, sir.

709
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,800
Thank you so much anyway.

710
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:56,960
If this happens,

711
00:51:57,527 --> 00:51:59,960
I'll say goodbye to you right now.

712
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,000
I can't love anyone right now, other than myself.

713
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:18,840
I need to go back to where I came from.

714
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,840
Boonta.

715
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,208
What?

716
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,360
Mother said you would take Young Miss Kleeb

717
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,040
to my wife's.

718
00:52:37,552 --> 00:52:39,800
I'm leaving the child with you.

719
00:52:41,423 --> 00:52:44,120
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

720
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,800
I'm going to work. I'll be back for you when I'm done.

721
00:52:49,246 --> 00:52:50,246
"Bye-bye."

722
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:54,824
Come on.

723
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:11,520
I'm cooking some rice. You can play with my child for now.

724
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,040
Yes, ma'am.

725
00:53:54,728 --> 00:53:55,832
No, Jeed.

726
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:59,000
You can't love anyone. You can't think of him.

727
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,640
Enjoy.

728
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:13,960
Thanks.

729
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:20,720
What's wrong?

730
00:54:27,776 --> 00:54:29,576
Enjoy your drink.

731
00:54:48,303 --> 00:54:50,680
Fire! There's a fire!

732
00:54:51,015 --> 00:54:53,575
What fire? Whoa!

733
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,440
What's on fire?

734
00:55:01,463 --> 00:55:02,880
Where's the fire?

735
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,080
Has anyone seen my family?

736
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:12,840
- Where is Kleeb? - She's with Plang and Mak inside.

737
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,400
Plang, Mak, Young Miss Kleeb.

738
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,600
Kleeb!

739
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,880
- Be careful! - Kleeb!

740
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:22,217
Someone save my daughter!

741
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,320
Mother!

742
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,560
Ming, I'm here!

743
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:29,000
Plang! Young Miss Kleeb!

744
00:55:29,612 --> 00:55:31,471
Give Mak to me.

745
00:55:31,624 --> 00:55:33,619
- Quick! - Save my daughter!

746
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,400
- Kleeb! - Stay here. I'm going in for Young Miss Kleeb.

747
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:38,840
- Stay here, Mother. - Boonta?

748
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:41,080
Kleeb!

749
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,008
Kleeb!

750
00:55:46,627 --> 00:55:49,240
Come on! Let's go!

751
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,960
Come on...

752
00:55:57,796 --> 00:55:59,480
Young Miss Kleeb!

753
00:56:00,101 --> 00:56:03,080
Boonta! I'm helping them!

754
00:56:03,722 --> 00:56:06,280
- Boonta! - It's hot!

755
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:10,832
Ming, take your family out.

756
00:56:11,137 --> 00:56:12,960
Leave Kleeb with me.

757
00:56:13,071 --> 00:56:15,760
- Let's go. - Cover your face with this.

758
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:19,080
Ready?

759
00:56:26,193 --> 00:56:28,400
Oh no!

760
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,760
Get down. Roll yourself up.

761
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,920
Kleeb!

762
00:56:37,955 --> 00:56:41,280
- Where's Kleeb? - She's with Boonta, Mother.

763
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,960
- Boonta's inside? - Yes, sir.

764
00:56:46,608 --> 00:56:48,360
- Mother! - Luang, sir?

765
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,860
Luang, sir?

766
00:56:51,263 --> 00:56:52,368
Kleeb.

767
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:57,840
- Boonta. - Chaai, we're inside!

768
00:56:57,976 --> 00:56:59,960
Boonta!

769
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,320
Boonta...

770
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,080
Take off your shirt and cover her.

771
00:57:14,184 --> 00:57:15,920
Cover her up.

772
00:57:17,432 --> 00:57:19,720
It's not hot anymore. We're going out.

773
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:22,120
Take her out. Be careful.

774
00:57:40,993 --> 00:57:43,080
- Calm down. - Luang went inside, ma'am.

775
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:46,960
- We're safe, Mother. - Young Miss Kleeb.

776
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,560
- Are you alright? - How are you, sweetie?

777
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:01,000
Don't cry, okay?

778
00:58:03,944 --> 00:58:06,600
Mother. I think you should take Young Miss Kleeb away.

779
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,680
- Let's go. - Come on, ma'am.

780
00:58:11,224 --> 00:58:12,760
Why did you go in through the fire?

781
00:58:13,712 --> 00:58:15,960
I couldn't just stand and watch.

782
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:20,160
If you want to help, think carefully. Otherwise, you can make things worse.

783
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,160
I'm worried about Young Miss Kleeb.

784
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,120
Besides, I did fire exit training.

785
00:58:24,232 --> 00:58:26,840
I know how to survive this. Let's go. It's hot!

786
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,058
Come on!

787
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:30,768
Your arm.

788
00:58:49,143 --> 00:58:50,440
Until now,

789
00:58:50,679 --> 00:58:52,280
I was afraid to lose face

790
00:58:52,575 --> 00:58:55,800
or lose my pride, but now I'm afraid to lose you more.

791
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,880
Are you ready to start over with me?

792
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:01,920
So you forgot everything.

793
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,600
You really forgot the love I have for you?

794
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,400
What happened, sir?

795
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:09,127
Get the manicurist here.

796
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,120
Magnate Thong's staff reported

797
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,880
that you stole Gaysorn's gold bracelet.

798
00:59:22,097 --> 00:59:23,840
You're not just a courtesan,

799
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,040
you're a thief too!

800
00:59:25,816 --> 00:59:27,320
Mother, help me!

801
00:59:27,511 --> 00:59:30,240
A slave like you would be punished hard in jail.

802
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,960
A courtesan without honor like her would have it harder.

803
00:59:34,359 --> 00:59:35,720
Help me!
