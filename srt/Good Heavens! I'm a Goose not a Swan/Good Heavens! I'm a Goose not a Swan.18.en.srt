1
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,760
Someone who can do this

2
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,757
is probably an acrobat, sir.

3
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
The people who perform such dangerous stunts are the Vietnamese Troupe.

4
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,793
I'm going to investigate them.

5
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,160
This is for Nual, right? I'll bring it to her.

6
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,480
Again?

7
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:39,241
I wonder what's so good about that place that keeps you going back.

8
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:45,080
(...the light of fireflies, flashing.)

9
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:48,358
Please accept this. I want you to live a long life

10
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,720
so you can keep singing beautiful songs.

11
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:52,249
Dum is the killer?

12
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,737
Dum performs spear and sword shows well.

13
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:55,262
He can carry people up high.

14
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:58,160
He likes to steal animals and kill them brutally.

15
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:00,529
It's possible that he does the same with humans.

16
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,880
I helped her and Choed up the roof to hide from market visitors.

17
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:06,000
So she gave me some snacks.

18
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,800
Father! Where's that couple?

19
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:12,120
They just packed up and left.

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,120
(Episode 18: Debut Time... For Geese Turned Swans)

21
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:36,320
Here's some water.

22
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:47,319
Thank you.

23
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,960
Tonight, I'll wait for you at the same place.

24
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,600
It's a birthmark. Don't be afraid.

25
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:03,480
I was shocked.

26
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,640
What kind of birthmark is that? It's so ugly and scary.

27
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,000
You should go inside.

28
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,320
It's hot and dangerous out here.

29
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,400
Are you worried about me?

30
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,680
I'll go then.

31
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't forget to come tonight, though.

32
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,360
Hurry up. We need to finish this before dark.

33
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,440
- Mother. - Boonta!

34
00:04:43,178 --> 00:04:46,040
Do you have a death wish? Is that why you dare do that?

35
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,160
I've always treated you well.

36
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,560
Yet you embarrassed me by sneaking out to make love with Luang Thukkarat.

37
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,137
You offered yourself to him for free,

38
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:56,988
and you have the audacity to say he loves you, he would marry you?

39
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,320
You fool!

40
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:01,778
Mother, please stop.

41
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,960
If you ruin her face, not only would Luang reject her,

42
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:07,100
but she would also lose her price!

43
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,740
- Darn it! - Whoa!

44
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:11,240
Ming.

45
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,960
Taker her away and lock her up.

46
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,480
Nobody feeds her food and water

47
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,000
until she comes to her senses!

48
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,280
Yes, Mother.

49
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,080
- Mother... - Go!

50
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:22,712
Mother!

51
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:26,920
You nailed the acting, Mother. But was that slap real?

52
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,200
Sorry. I wanted to make it look real.

53
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:33,600
- Take her away! - Go!

54
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,520
I don't want to be in the room where many have been!

55
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,200
I don't want to...

56
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,480
Ugly and mean. What a pity.

57
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
Boonta's plan to lure out the killer is immaculate.

58
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:07,880
If I hadn't known she used to be a seller,

59
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,080
I would have thought she used to be in a theater troupe.

60
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,960
The killer only kills courtesans who want to escape

61
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:17,000
and wear a purple sash.

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
If you want to lure him out,

63
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:21,200
we have to risk doing just that.

64
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,880
You know it's risky.

65
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,840
Yet you allow Boonta to be the bait?

66
00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:31,320
Who said she would be alone?

67
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:58,808
Do you have to do this, sir?

68
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,800
Boonta may be strong,

69
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:03,600
but Ming is a man.

70
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,400
He has a better chance at survival.

71
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,960
What are you doing here?

72
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,280
What about you? You look suspicious.

73
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:49,120
Aren't you locked up?

74
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:54,280
Well...

75
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:57,760
There are ghosts in there. Many died in that room.

76
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,560
I was scared, so I got out.

77
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,800
Are you scared of ghosts?

78
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,080
Would you like to hide in that room then?

79
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,560
Nobody died in there.

80
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,200
There won't be a ghost.

81
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:20,080
Come on.

82
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,840
Okay. This room, right? No ghost? Here?

83
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:29,527
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

84
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,880
Okay. I won't.

85
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:33,480
"Thank you," girl. Go.

86
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,240
Noknoi, I'm here.

87
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,480
He went somewhere else.

88
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,336
The noise came from the room next door, sir.

89
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,360
After them. The killer took a hostage. He can't go far.

90
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,880
What are you doing?

91
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm going to kill you once and for all.

92
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
I may not get to kill you the way I want,

93
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,080
but you die anyway.

94
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,560
Wait.

95
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,480
What do you mean by "not the way I want?"

96
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:18,520
Isn't this how you kill Oeb and Lamduan right here?

97
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:20,520
Why would you kill me?

98
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:22,440
Why did you kill Lamduan and Oeb?

99
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,600
Do you hate courtesans or something?

100
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,160
If I don't kill you,

101
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,360
how will you escape that hell?

102
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,400
Your lives are full of suffering. It's better to die!

103
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,640
You faked it to trick me?

104
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:45,280
Are you trying to catch me?

105
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,640
If you're that curious about me,

106
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:50,480
you're going to find out.

107
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,120
- Come with me! - No!

108
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,640
Where did he take Boonta?

109
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:07,520
Luang, sir!

110
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,520
Noknoi said Chuen probably took Boonta

111
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:14,001
to an abandoned cabin at the back of the Vietnamese Village.

112
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:16,200
An abandoned cabin?

113
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,440
How did she know?

114
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,920
I visited Chuen there, Mother.

115
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:29,800
So you sneak out every day to sleep with a criminal?

116
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:31,720
Noknoi! Are you stupid or what?

117
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:33,360
I really didn't know.

118
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,720
At first, I just went to see him outside.

119
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,320
Sometimes,

120
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,880
I tell him to come visit me here.

121
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:01,200
I can't stand your promiscuousness.

122
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:05,640
You let a criminal climb in here to visit you?

123
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,400
Had I not seen you sneak out

124
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:11,480
to the back of the kitchen and dragged you out to interrogate,

125
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:13,440
I would have never known that you

126
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
had this evil idea against Boonta.

127
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,000
I did not!

128
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:18,769
Boonta went in there on her own.

129
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
I can swear on anything.

130
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,320
I really didn't know Chuen was the courtesan killer

131
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,360
until I overheard them when they climbed down the roof.

132
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,560
I became paranoid.

133
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,840
Tonight, he said he would visit me here.

134
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,680
I was scared, so I needed a replacement.

135
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,040
Noknoi! Are you crazy?

136
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:40,920
Is that why you handed Boonta to him for the kill?

137
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,840
You foot face! You wench!

138
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,280
Pudsorn, calm down!

139
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:49,600
Even if you're jealous of Boonta, you have no right to send her to die.

140
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,560
What would you have me do then?

141
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,760
I was afraid he would kill me.

142
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:56,080
Come to think of it,

143
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:58,320
when I visited his house,

144
00:13:58,432 --> 00:14:00,320
I saw something odd.

145
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:01,840
What did you see?

146
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,960
In that room, something is hidden under a cloth.

147
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,463
So this is how you actually kill people.

148
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,960
Why are you doing this?

149
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,560
Those whose lives are a living hell, such as my brother,

150
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:42,280
would only suffer in life.

151
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,000
I just helped them escape the suffering sooner.

152
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm not happy at all.

153
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:34,640
I don't want to be here.

154
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,240
I get flogged.

155
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:41,040
I don't want to serve a guest anymore.

156
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:44,360
Please help me leave this place.

157
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,080
I don't want to be here anymore.

158
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:50,720
Would you run with me?

159
00:15:58,335 --> 00:15:59,600
Come with me.

160
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:32,303
You tricked Lamduan and Oeb here to kill them?

161
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,840
They were willing.

162
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
Death is better than a hopeless life.

163
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:40,440
They get hurt over and over.

164
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,560
They have wounds that will never heal.

165
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:48,440
The color of the blood and bruises

166
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,160
on their bodies

167
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:54,280
is the same shade of purple as their robe.

168
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:57,760
If your life is a living hell,

169
00:16:57,847 --> 00:16:59,360
why would you live?

170
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
You have no right to kill anyone,

171
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,880
even if they're courtesans.

172
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,920
They just sell their pride for money.

173
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:07,440
They don't sell their souls.

174
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:08,960
They want a new life.

175
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,552
They don't want to die!

176
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:11,920
A new life?

177
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,520
A new life where you're labeled a courtesan for the rest of your life?

178
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:17,640
Even if you start a new life,

179
00:17:17,743 --> 00:17:19,743
you will never escape that label.

180
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,160
Death is better!

181
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,080
Come on!

182
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,000
I won't die!

183
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:27,520
Come on!

184
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:31,720
No! Let me go!

185
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
Luang.

186
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,280
Hey, Luang!

187
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,560
Luang!

188
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,040
Luang!

189
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:55,480
No...

190
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:12,320
Luang!

191
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,280
What are you waiting for?

192
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,680
Just kill me now!

193
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:20,480
I want to kill you right here,

194
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:22,920
but you have to face justice!

195
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:25,400
Take him.

196
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:30,560
Go away!

197
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,160
I'm untied.

198
00:19:58,112 --> 00:19:59,280
Get out of here.

199
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:00,520
An evil woman

200
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,640
who tries to kill her fellow is not welcome here.

201
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:03,960
Go!

202
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,120
Please don't kick me out.

203
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:08,967
I know I was wrong.

204
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:11,240
I won't do it again, Mother.

205
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,920
The one you should apologize to

206
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:14,399
is Boonta!

207
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Go!

208
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:25,360
I'm sorry, Boonta.

209
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,800
I was wrong.

210
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,201
All I want is your forgiveness.

211
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:34,920
I'll be obedient. I'll do anything.

212
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,160
I'll never mean harm to you.

213
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,760
I'll never be jealous of you again.

214
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,840
Boonta.

215
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:47,560
Please don't let Mother kick me out.

216
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:52,160
I really have nowhere to go.

217
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
What are you doing?

218
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,960
You said you'd do anything, didn't you?

219
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:23,440
You want me to pay with my life?

220
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,600
That's right.

221
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:39,000
Do you see

222
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,720
just how close death is now?

223
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,480
Don't play with anyone's life again.

224
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,560
Not everyone gets a second chance!

225
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:58,760
- You're not angry at me, right? - I am.

226
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,360
I'm still very angry.

227
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,760
But Mother just kicked you out.

228
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:08,360
Besides,

229
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,880
you still at least know right from wrong.

230
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:21,400
You told everyone of Chuen's whereabouts and helped me survive.

231
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,120
I'll forgive you this once.

232
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,520
I'll give you another chance at life.

233
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:33,120
You have to leave this place.

234
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,480
You should hurry and get out of here

235
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:41,440
before Boonta changes her mind.

236
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,360
Go!

237
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,600
Just go!

238
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,440
- Get out! - Go!

239
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,080
Darn you.

240
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,400
You're still dragging on?

241
00:22:57,488 --> 00:22:58,600
Go!

242
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:29,480
Why does the thing you did just now feel familiar?

243
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,160
Why would it not? It's...

244
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:40,360
It's the orientation "scene" all those "divas" do. I "copied" them.

245
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,360
I'm glad I used to play the villain before I got lead roles.

246
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,040
Thank you too, Luang.

247
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:02,080
We can now live in peace.

248
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,800
I'll ask the patrols

249
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,080
to tighten security around here.

250
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:09,360
Nobody will meet that fate again.

251
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,200
What about Chuen?

252
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:13,488
What's his punishment?

253
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:17,880
He killed people. He deserves a death sentence.

254
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
I'm happy for you, Chor.

255
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,400
Lamduan can rest in peace now.

256
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,920
So Dum was just a dummy, after all.

257
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,760
However, we can't deny that

258
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,000
Dum was one of the reasons why Chuen committed these crimes.

259
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:36,440
He has seen his father and people

260
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,480
abusing his brother with disgust since a young age,

261
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,440
but he could never help it.

262
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,280
So, he takes his frustration out on those poor animals.

263
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,200
Because dogs and cats can't be put on spears and swords,

264
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:52,400
he starts doing it with humans.

265
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:55,680
That's what happened to Lamduan.

266
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,160
I feel sorry for Dum, sir.

267
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:05,472
His life really sucks.

268
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,160
If he keeps on living,

269
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,216
his life will be a living hell.

270
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,480
He has nobody else who's kind to him.

271
00:25:17,143 --> 00:25:19,440
Then let us be kind to Dum.

272
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:22,720
Nobody in this world deserves to be treated

273
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,200
as ugly, miserable, or different.

274
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:27,960
We should judge him by his heart, not appearances.

275
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,040
That's the way we can prevent any more of these tragedies.

276
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:57,769
Thank you, sir.

277
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:36,960
Have I made a mistake?

278
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,840
Do you want me to help Muean out again?

279
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,920
Please help me, Uncle.

280
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:16,920
How many times have you saved her?

281
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:18,680
How much have you paid?

282
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,960
Is she that important to you?

283
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:29,520
(Go! Get in there!)

284
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,160
Let me go!

285
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,760
Let go! Let me go!

286
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:48,200
Let go! Help!

287
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:51,640
- Who's there? - Bring it! You jerks!

288
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:53,640
Get out of here!

289
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,840
Hey, let go!

290
00:28:58,215 --> 00:29:00,280
- Hey! No! - You're a brave one, huh?

291
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:01,600
Let go!

292
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:04,400
Get her!

293
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,309
You got a fight in you, huh?

294
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:08,000
Hey, stay away!

295
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,960
Get off me!

296
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:15,560
Let go!

297
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:41,840
Don't cry.

298
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,720
Muean saved my life.

299
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:48,200
I can't just let her die, Uncle.

300
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:52,720
She's just a slave. What's wrong with you?

301
00:29:52,976 --> 00:29:55,240
You can't even save yourself.

302
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,360
Every time you're in trouble, you ask for my help.

303
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,800
I'm the one who has to ask His Highness.

304
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,480
I'm always grateful for your help, Uncle.

305
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,680
If you help me one more time,

306
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,880
I'll make it worth your while

307
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:17,520
as I always have.

308
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:27,800
This time,

309
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:31,320
I'm saving an important slave of yours.

310
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,360
You'd better make it worth it.

311
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,280
Muean.

312
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:57,991
Come on out.

313
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:22,440
Master Gaysorn.

314
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,920
Did you help me out by getting yourself in trouble, ma'am?

315
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,600
Don't worry about me.

316
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:59,240
Luang Thukkarat has caught the courtesan killer.

317
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:02,240
Nual's testimony is now useless.

318
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
They can't incriminate us anymore.

319
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,319
Tis promised me.

320
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:14,400
The fact I tried to kill Boonta will remain a secret forever.

321
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:34,360
Muean.

322
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:38,840
I'm sorry

323
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,640
for getting you in trouble over and over again.

324
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:05,735
My life

325
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:09,280
lasted this long

326
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:12,840
because of your kindness.

327
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,760
You gave me a new life.

328
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,160
If I can sacrifice my worthless life for you,

329
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,960
I won't regret it, ma'am.

330
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,600
How could you have done that?

331
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,760
You traded 180 kilos of sugar for Muean?

332
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,120
She's just a slave!

333
00:34:19,201 --> 00:34:20,760
Is she worth that much?

334
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,560
I've always facilitated your business.

335
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,680
It's just 180 kilos of sugar.

336
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,200
- You can't even make up for the loss? - Gaysorn!

337
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,000
Are you asking for my debt of gratitude?

338
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,560
At least you know you owe me.

339
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:37,160
Muean is just a slave,

340
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:39,760
but she has been nicer to me than you ever were.

341
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,880
She is innocent now.

342
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:47,120
Surely, you won't accuse your own wife

343
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,680
of doing an evil deed, such as ordering a kill on a courtesan!

344
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:03,480
Muean has been released?

345
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:05,160
Chuen has been caught.

346
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,710
Muean is acquitted.

347
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,000
I wish I could hold her in custody to find out who tried to kill you,

348
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,960
but we've received an order to release her.

349
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,600
So she's got connections.

350
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,000
What about Chuen? Has he been punished?

351
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:22,472
He's sentenced to death.

352
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,320
His head will be displayed on a spike at Wat Kok.

353
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,680
His body will be cut into pieces

354
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,280
and de-fleshed to the bone.

355
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:33,080
His internal organs are to be fed to vultures and crows.

356
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,200
The courtesan killer has been caught.

357
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:41,919
But the one who tried to kill you is still out there.

358
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,160
I will bring them to justice no matter what.

359
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,280
Yes, sir.

360
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,040
Good afternoon.

361
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:11,280
Chaai, Puek, you came at the right time.

362
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,680
It's good. Let's eat together, all of us.

363
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,920
I don't think I can stay.

364
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:21,160
Puek and I still have a lot of work to do.

365
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,800
If Chaai thinks work is more important,

366
00:36:27,912 --> 00:36:29,200
just let him go.

367
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:33,160
He probably doesn't want to congratulate Chim and Pad for their good news.

368
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,520
Good news?

369
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:42,800
You're pregnant, Pad?

370
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,080
That's great news.

371
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,536
It's because Chang left monkhood to help out with our business.

372
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,280
That's why I have time

373
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,440
to make babies for our mother.

374
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:58,600
So that's why Chim invited us for a meal.

375
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,696
He wants to celebrate the good news.

376
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,760
Mother made your favorite stir-fried lotus root, Chaai.

377
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:10,400
It's all of our favorites.

378
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,160
Enjoy.

379
00:37:16,513 --> 00:37:18,320
Chaai has just closed a case.

380
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,400
You should be able to make time.

381
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,000
We actually have the case...

382
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,160
We actually have a lot of other cases.

383
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,169
But they're not that urgent.

384
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,320
Then that's good.

385
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,720
I heard the upcoming Royal Funeral

386
00:37:38,863 --> 00:37:40,863
will feature stage performances.

387
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:44,440
Mother, would you like to take our servants to see them?

388
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:48,280
I heard Khun Nattayavijit's Troupe

389
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,600
is doing a play, ma'am.

390
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:56,960
We have to see if any of you can go with me.

391
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:03,400
I wish I could go with you, Mother.

392
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:05,127
But I can't promise

393
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:07,640
since Pad is pregnant.

394
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:10,120
Chaai, you go.

395
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:13,127
Please go with Mother in my stead.

396
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:21,080
Right.

397
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:26,320
Good. I'll invite Pikul and Dokgaew.

398
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,800
That's good.

399
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,080
I'll invite Boonta too.

400
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,720
If you invite her, what would the people say?

401
00:38:43,272 --> 00:38:46,560
You haven't even settled down with Dokgaew.

402
00:38:46,687 --> 00:38:49,120
And you're going to bring your mistress

403
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,840
to meet your soon-to-be legal wife?

404
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,120
I would lose my face, then!

405
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:58,040
Your face would still be on your head, Mother.

406
00:38:58,776 --> 00:38:59,960
Chaai!

407
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,720
Let people say what they want.

408
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:04,720
If anyone speaks about you,

409
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:07,960
I'll tell them it's my own decision.

410
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:11,080
You don't have to make an excuse for me.

411
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:15,560
Good. Then you can eat outside.

412
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,400
How about that?

413
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,360
Instead of lotus roots,

414
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,520
you're having sticky rice with pork instead.

415
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:39,120
I didn't like how my mother was forcing me.

416
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,600
And I'm here to invite you.

417
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:45,200
Invite me?

418
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:48,360
There will be a feast at Wat Suwannaram.

419
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,360
My mother is attending.

420
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:54,120
I would like to introduce you.

421
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Are you "going public," sir?

422
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:03,480
- "Going pub..." - I mean...

423
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,320
Are you going to introduce me to your mother?

424
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:12,280
You will have all the traditional ceremonies when the time comes.

425
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:15,064
But for now,

426
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:17,785
I would like my mother to acknowledge my genuine feelings for you.

427
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:20,560
Would you go with me?

428
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,360
I have to see if there's anything interesting.

429
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:33,120
The one who just invited you isn't interesting enough?

430
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,440
I need to think about whether

431
00:40:42,912 --> 00:40:46,760
it's going to be worth the risk when I ask Mother Fang to go.

432
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,880
It will be.

433
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,120
There will be a lot of performances at this feast.

434
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:54,040
We have Khon,

435
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,840
a puppet show, a non-palace play,

436
00:40:56,256 --> 00:40:58,560
and a play by Khun Nattayavijit's troupe.

437
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,200
We also have Chinese opera

438
00:41:00,615 --> 00:41:02,280
and a singing contest.

439
00:41:03,902 --> 00:41:05,287
A singing contest?

440
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:12,120
A singing contest?

441
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,040
Come with me.

442
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:18,440
I've always dreamt of a singing contest such as this.

443
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:23,560
I heard the winner will get the prize of two tamleungs!

444
00:41:24,383 --> 00:41:26,520
Goodness! Why is it so much?

445
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:27,640
Right?

446
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:31,200
If you win, you can skip work for months.

447
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:35,159
You might be known as the courtesan

448
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,400
with the best singing voice in the capital.

449
00:41:39,336 --> 00:41:44,040
Lamjeak, you're going to have more money for your mother's treatment.

450
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:48,840
No.

451
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,560
Hey, it's two tamleung.

452
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,360
I do want the money.

453
00:41:57,583 --> 00:42:00,000
But who would want to listen to a courtesan sing?

454
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:04,640
We'll either get booed off the stage or get things thrown at us.

455
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,440
I'm not going through that.

456
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,960
Everyone.

457
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,560
We have to convince Lamjeak to change her mind.

458
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,240
They said this singing contest

459
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,640
is a huge one.

460
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,160
Are there a lot of participants?

461
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,480
We don't know how many.

462
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:32,760
All we know is that Jaeng and Maa

463
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,277
are coming!

464
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:37,920
Gosh! They're the best singers in town!

465
00:42:38,024 --> 00:42:40,503
I need to see them perform!

466
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:43,000
Take me with you.

467
00:42:43,081 --> 00:42:44,760
Of course.

468
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:48,720
Chang!

469
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,800
When did you get here, sir?

470
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,839
Are you joining the singing contest?

471
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,000
I'll just be watching.

472
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,960
I don't dare to join, sir.

473
00:43:04,176 --> 00:43:07,400
I heard Jaeng, the singer of the village behind Wat Rakhang,

474
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:10,000
and Maa, his rival, are participating.

475
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,600
Those two are famous singers.

476
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:15,000
Isn't this a great opportunity

477
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:16,680
to join and compete against them?

478
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,359
Jaeng and Maa have such good ways with words.

479
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,080
I don't dare to compete.

480
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:25,680
All I need is Mother allowing me to sing in the brothel.

481
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:27,360
That's a big achievement.

482
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:30,840
I'm not worthy of that big an event, sir.

483
00:43:35,486 --> 00:43:36,840
But I, for one,

484
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:39,120
would like to hear you sing.

485
00:43:40,903 --> 00:43:43,720
I think you can do it, Lamjeak.

486
00:43:57,096 --> 00:43:59,520
You sure are something, Lamjeak.

487
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,440
We all tried to convince you to the point our mouths ripped

488
00:44:02,695 --> 00:44:07,720
into our ears! But all it takes is a man's word to convince you.

489
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,800
Don't make fun of her, Boonta.

490
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:12,160
You and Luang

491
00:44:12,241 --> 00:44:14,600
are nothing shy of her!

492
00:44:14,783 --> 00:44:18,400
- Come on. - I was wondering why you keep visiting me at the warehouse.

493
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:21,800
Look.

494
00:44:22,048 --> 00:44:23,480
You like him,

495
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,160
but does he like you too?

496
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:28,719
Why would he like me?

497
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,960
You all saw how much trouble Boonta is going through.

498
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:34,600
I know it's impossible for him and me to get together.

499
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,960
All I want is to love him, even if it's one-sided.

500
00:44:40,673 --> 00:44:45,440
The thing about love is it can take many forms and statuses.

501
00:44:45,736 --> 00:44:46,840
But...

502
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:48,640
Lamjeak.

503
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:51,760
Are you joining me in the singing contest?

504
00:44:57,847 --> 00:44:59,160
I'm still not confident.

505
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,440
Come on! You have the man's full support.

506
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,880
How are you still not confident?

507
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:10,560
Aunt! I've never been in a singing contest!

508
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:15,760
Is there no way for me to participate anonymously?

509
00:45:17,407 --> 00:45:19,360
- You think... - There is!

510
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,600
I know a way.

511
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,560
A goose feather?

512
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,320
This thing will turn you into someone else, Lamjeak.

513
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
Come on.

514
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,480
Let's get some more.

515
00:46:13,294 --> 00:46:14,440
Lamjeak.

516
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,480
There's a live one.

517
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:30,760
It's looking at us.

518
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:00,280
No!

519
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:01,800
Go away!

520
00:47:03,984 --> 00:47:06,000
No!

521
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,440
Captain Jon?

522
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,560
Hi...

523
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:24,320
You just arrived, and you want to buy Boonta's freedom right away?

524
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,640
What do you think Mother's decision will be?

525
00:47:29,238 --> 00:47:31,238
I'll bet one phai. She won't sell.

526
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,560
Mother admires Boonta so much.

527
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,640
I'll bet one phai too. She won't sell.

528
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,888
She knows Boonta and Luang are in love.

529
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,400
Luang said he would buy her freedom. Mother won't be that cruel.

530
00:47:41,847 --> 00:47:44,400
I think she sells. I'll raise two phai.

531
00:47:44,503 --> 00:47:46,800
She admires her, but there's a contract.

532
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,560
Mother promised Captain Jon.

533
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:51,760
He already paid the deposit. If Mother turns back on her word,

534
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,480
she's going to lose all credibility.

535
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:54,800
Yeah. I'll bet too.

536
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,560
Mother is cruel and stingy.

537
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,240
But she's the woman of her word. She won't turn back.

538
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:02,836
Look.

539
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:05,920
If you don't stop betting about me,

540
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:08,520
I'll raise all of you.

541
00:48:08,856 --> 00:48:10,400
Not raising the bet.

542
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,080
I'll raise a knife on you all!

543
00:48:14,114 --> 00:48:17,560
Do you hear everything your girls say?

544
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,560
The whole building can hear them.

545
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:22,600
I would have to be deaf if I didn't hear them.

546
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:28,800
The thing is, there will be a feast and performance soon.

547
00:48:28,951 --> 00:48:31,640
Boonta is entering a singing contest.

548
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:35,240
Please wait until after the contest to buy her off.

549
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,280
What trick are you playing on me?

550
00:48:37,712 --> 00:48:40,440
Are you trying to raise the price or something?

551
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:43,720
I'm a woman of my word, sir.

552
00:48:43,863 --> 00:48:45,400
We have a contract.

553
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,492
If you're sure you have the money, you can rest assured.

554
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,960
No matter what,

555
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:55,240
Boonta will end up with you.

556
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:00,320
If that's the case,

557
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:01,920
on the day of the feast,

558
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:03,840
after the singing contest,

559
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,640
Fang,

560
00:49:06,207 --> 00:49:08,400
please let me spend time with Boonta.

561
00:49:09,424 --> 00:49:12,000
I would like her to get to know me better.

562
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:17,680
If Boonta agrees to spend time with you,

563
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:20,280
I have no problem.

564
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
How could you do this, Mother?

565
00:49:28,775 --> 00:49:29,879
What did I do?

566
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,680
How could you let Captain Jon buy Boonta's freedom?

567
00:49:33,966 --> 00:49:36,800
Why can't I? I signed a contract.

568
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,280
You know Boonta is in love with Luang.

569
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,080
Pudsorn, why are you getting worked up for Boonta?

570
00:49:43,351 --> 00:49:46,431
Is it you or Boonta that's being sold off?

571
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:50,800
Well...

572
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:56,720
I can't stand seeing Boonta's love getting interfered with.

573
00:49:57,103 --> 00:49:58,463
She will be away from Luang

574
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,680
and be with the man she doesn't love!

575
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,640
Don't worry about her!

576
00:50:02,745 --> 00:50:05,240
Captain Jon is a good man.

577
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:07,880
A good man, but not the man she loves.

578
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,720
A woman doesn't just love any good man.

579
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:12,320
Pudsorn!

580
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,760
Boonta hasn't said a word!

581
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:16,872
Only you are complaining.

582
00:50:18,524 --> 00:50:21,520
Pudsorn said everything for me. I have nothing left to say.

583
00:50:23,472 --> 00:50:25,600
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

584
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,847
Boonta, come with me.

585
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:31,960
Is your name Boonta?

586
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,480
It's not.

587
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,880
Do you remember?

588
00:50:46,112 --> 00:50:47,800
I once told you

589
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,800
Luang may love you,

590
00:50:49,984 --> 00:50:52,520
but can his mother love you?

591
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,240
You've already seen it.

592
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,760
Until now,

593
00:50:58,928 --> 00:51:01,320
Luang hasn't come to buy your freedom.

594
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,800
Even though he promised you,

595
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,840
marriage is not just about love.

596
00:51:11,055 --> 00:51:12,280
So...

597
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:15,800
Are you really going to sell me to Captain Jon?

598
00:51:19,111 --> 00:51:21,239
Your heart may belong to Luang,

599
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:24,320
but Captain Jon will own your body.

600
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,480
I've let you enjoy yourself with Luang for a while.

601
00:51:28,663 --> 00:51:31,040
Now is Captain Jon's time.

602
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,000
Is it really time for me to be with him?

603
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:49,240
That time is after the feast.

604
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,360
I've helped you as much as I can.

605
00:51:54,847 --> 00:51:57,320
If you and Luang are meant to be together,

606
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,040
you will end up together.

607
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:02,520
If you're not,

608
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:04,400
until the time comes,

609
00:52:04,696 --> 00:52:07,280
you can do your best to make memories.

610
00:52:13,624 --> 00:52:15,104
I understand now.

611
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:18,400
You did your best for me.

612
00:52:20,168 --> 00:52:21,600
From now on,

613
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,880
- I will have to help myself. - What are you going to do?

614
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,000
Don't even think of doing something rash!

615
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,280
It's not rash, Mother.

616
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:30,880
I'll just be honest.

617
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,280
I'll make him see

618
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,960
what it's like

619
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,840
to have my body

620
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,080
without my heart.

621
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,200
Would he torture me and lock me up until I love him, like in TV shows?

622
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:10,040
I've been to a temple festival before,

623
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,320
but this is so crowded. It's too much!

624
00:53:14,448 --> 00:53:17,395
This is also a Royal Funeral. It's a seven-day, seven-night event.

625
00:53:17,554 --> 00:53:20,280
You can't compare this to your regular temple festival.

626
00:53:20,632 --> 00:53:22,680
- Seven-day, seven-night? - Yeah.

627
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,240
So where is the stage for our singing contest?

628
00:53:26,344 --> 00:53:27,720
- The stage? - Here?

629
00:53:27,848 --> 00:53:29,840
There! There it is.

630
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:32,520
- Wow! - It's great, see?

631
00:53:32,601 --> 00:53:34,760
Hey, you two, go and get ready.

632
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:37,480
We'll be cheering for you close by.

633
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,719
- Yes, Mother. - Do your best!

634
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,640
- Of course, Aunt. - Thanks, Aunt.

635
00:53:41,743 --> 00:53:43,960
Don't let them say Fang's girls suck.

636
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,480
Nobody will know who we are.

637
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,680
Isn't that right, Boonta?

638
00:53:48,784 --> 00:53:51,400
That's right. Tonight, there's no Boonta.

639
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:56,280
There's no Lamjeak. We are White Swan Masks.

640
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,000
- Let's go, girl! - Go!

641
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:03,960
Mother, I'm hungry.

642
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:05,400
Then let's get something to eat.

643
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,840
Everyone, come on.

644
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,000
There! They have some snacks.

645
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,480
- That's Young Miss Kleeb's favorite. - What would you like?

646
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Chang, please bring Mother to the play.

647
00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:17,840
Take care of Mother for me.

648
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:22,040
Chaai, where are you rushing off to?

649
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,320
Tubtim.

650
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,920
Pikul, Dokgaew, you're here.

651
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,160
We should go. Let's not be late.

652
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,440
Chaai, go with your girl.

653
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:39,855
I'll walk with you,

654
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:41,240
but I won't stay for the play.

655
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:42,520
Chaai!

656
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,880
Chaai wants to see the singing contest over there.

657
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:50,000
Dokgaew.

658
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,320
Would you like to see that?

659
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,680
Chang!

660
00:54:53,727 --> 00:54:56,360
Chaai only gets a break once in a while.

661
00:54:56,943 --> 00:54:59,960
Mother, please don't be too strict on him.

662
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:05,760
If you want to come with me,

663
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,240
I'll bring you along.

664
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,840
Then I'm coming too.

665
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,380
Let us all go there.

666
00:55:12,636 --> 00:55:13,720
Go.

667
00:55:23,936 --> 00:55:25,840
- This is going to be fun. - Right.

668
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:27,200
We'll stay to the end.

669
00:55:27,297 --> 00:55:28,520
We will.

670
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,280
Sit down, please.

671
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:47,920
As I thought, I ran into these people.

672
00:55:49,104 --> 00:55:50,600
These vile women

673
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,480
are too bold and daring.

674
00:55:52,775 --> 00:55:56,800
They're sitting here without shame at all.

675
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:03,680
This is nothing. We don't have to be bold to do this.

676
00:56:03,975 --> 00:56:05,240
The law doesn't forbid

677
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,480
courtesans from seeing a performance.

678
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,880
The bold one is probably you, Luang.

679
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,280
You bring your family and fiancée

680
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,800
to see Boonta's singing contest.

681
00:56:19,935 --> 00:56:23,520
Tonight is going to be fun.

682
00:56:25,473 --> 00:56:27,200
Puek, you're finally here.

683
00:56:27,975 --> 00:56:30,600
I took my parents to see Khon and came right after.

684
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,280
How is it going over here?

685
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,920
The singing contest is about to start soon.

686
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:37,720
But the confrontation

687
00:56:38,535 --> 00:56:40,080
has already begun.

688
00:56:48,926 --> 00:56:51,240
All I get is trouble every day.

689
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,920
It's not bad to take a walk and hang out for a change.

690
00:56:57,936 --> 00:57:01,880
You're in the mood to hang out and see performances.

691
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,560
Perhaps you haven't

692
00:57:04,063 --> 00:57:05,960
heard the news, have you?

693
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,400
What news?

694
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,880
The trade negotiation between Great Britain and Siam

695
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:16,320
seems to be going well.

696
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,040
If a deal is struck,

697
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,540
you would lose your place in the business, along with your face.

698
00:57:27,759 --> 00:57:30,160
Thank you, Captain Jam.

699
00:57:30,776 --> 00:57:32,160
- Come. - Yes, sir.

700
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,360
Pay the Captain some money.

701
00:57:34,441 --> 00:57:35,441
Yes, sir.

702
00:57:35,522 --> 00:57:39,480
As a thank-you gift for serving as a messenger.

703
00:57:48,224 --> 00:57:49,400
"Thank you."

704
00:57:56,162 --> 00:57:58,440
I'll never let you take my profit.

705
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,560
- What's that? - What's with her?

706
00:58:17,782 --> 00:58:19,496
Ever since I was born,

707
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,080
I've never seen such an entertaining singing contest before.

708
00:58:22,161 --> 00:58:23,470
The White Swan Masks?

709
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:25,840
Who are they? Do you know, Pikul?

710
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,640
It's Boonta, Mother.

711
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,680
I'm happy

712
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,040
you saw something of worth in someone like me.

713
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:38,160
Sarang

714
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,011
is still in the police jail, isn't he?

715
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:43,280
What if I want him dead?

716
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,120
Who's there? Hey!

717
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:49,360
Don't let her get away! Go!

718
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,680
You heard my secret.

719
00:58:56,295 --> 00:58:58,520
I can't let you breathe any longer!
