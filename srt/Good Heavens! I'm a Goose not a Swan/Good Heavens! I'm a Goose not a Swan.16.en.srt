1
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:28,815
I've heard Magnate Thong selling

2
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:31,440
low-quality sugar to ships from the West.

3
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:33,400
If you want to stay,

4
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:35,280
the only work you can do

5
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,367
is the very thing you used to do!

6
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:40,378
Do you really think he's going to buy your freedom?

7
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,366
You saw just how his mother despised you.

8
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,735
I'll allow her to be your wife.

9
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:49,315
But you have to marry Dokgaew first.

10
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,240
She will be your main wife.

11
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,440
I was chasing you in Pak Nam.

12
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,800
Who was the one that saved you?

13
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:57,920
I don't know him, sir.

14
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:03,998
You fought in a crowded market.

15
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,396
Don't you fear the law at all?

16
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:07,800
It's these thugs! They were causing trouble.

17
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Young Miss, if he comes in,

18
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:28,200
run out and get some help.

19
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,760
Okay?

20
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,135
What are you doing?

21
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,840
Where did he go?

22
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,552
What's going on?

23
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,360
- A thief? - That's right.

24
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,560
It's a shame I didn't see his face.

25
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:18,360
He was suspiciously trying to get into Mother's room.

26
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:21,200
We were lucky Ming found him.

27
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,800
- Danger is closer than you think. - Yeah, Aunt.

28
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:26,560
- It's dangerous. - Fortunately, he didn't get the chance.

29
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,840
You and Young Miss Kleeb could have been in trouble.

30
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,320
Mother has ordered Ming and the guys to tighten security.

31
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,520
- If you see someone suspicious, keep an eye on them. - Yeah. Be careful.

32
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:39,360
- Yeah. - Are you sure he's a thief,

33
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,600
not your enemy who came to kill you?

34
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:45,400
What are you talking about?

35
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,760
Boonta, didn't you say

36
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:52,440
the thief appeared to be following you?

37
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,720
He probably didn't come to steal things in Mother's room.

38
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,920
He could have been following you.

39
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:02,784
What enemy could Boonta have?

40
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:06,360
- Other than you, who wants to steal her Luang? - Yeah.

41
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:09,600
Women all over town have a crush on him.

42
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,720
I can't be the only one they want dead.

43
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:17,640
You should watch your back.

44
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:19,960
When danger strikes,

45
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,200
even ten Luangs can't save you.

46
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:29,360
Hey! How dare you say that?

47
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:33,280
See how arrogant she is?

48
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:37,040
Pudsorn, you should have taught her a lesson.

49
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:41,920
Boonta, don't listen to her.

50
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:44,360
She's just winding you up because she envies you.

51
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:45,720
That's right.

52
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:47,720
She's an envious girl.

53
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:50,120
Such jealousy.

54
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:03,300
(Episode 16: A Ghost... It Follows)

55
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:05,360
I know I'm asking for a lot,

56
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,600
but I really have nowhere to go.

57
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,000
What about your wife?

58
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:12,720
You said she's your cash cow.

59
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,520
She cut me off

60
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,960
because of Boonta.

61
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,960
Because of her, Nual stopped caring about me.

62
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,239
I tried to visit her at the brothel,

63
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
but the guards there won't let me see my wife.

64
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,960
I heard a thief snuck into Fang's last night,

65
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,720
and they have tightened security.

66
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,840
Please help me.

67
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,560
If I can't pay my debt,

68
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,520
I'm going to get killed this time.

69
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,879
I'll lend you some money this time,

70
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,160
seeing as you're my friend.

71
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,080
But I need something in exchange.

72
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,120
(Boonta, didn't you say)

73
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,560
(the thief appeared to be following you?)

74
00:07:09,672 --> 00:07:12,760
(He probably didn't come to steal things in Mother's room.)

75
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,200
(He could have been following you.)

76
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,520
Aunt Mian?

77
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,327
Aunt Mian told me to take you by this boat.

78
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,720
- Come with me. Quick! - Okay.

79
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:26,200
Where did Aunt Mian tell you to go?

80
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:32,360
Why aren't you answering?

81
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:47,920
Could it be

82
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:49,823
the same person?

83
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,600
Who?

84
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:56,680
Where are you going?

85
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,480
I'm going to see Chaai. I'll help catch the thief.

86
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,080
- Bye. - Nual!

87
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:04,640
What's wrong, Ming?

88
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:07,280
San sent for you. He said he's dying.

89
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:09,120
He wants to see you one last time.

90
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,200
He's dying?

91
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,800
What happened to him?

92
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:17,680
He got beaten up by the thugs at the casino, right?

93
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:19,640
That's right.

94
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,000
This time, he's hurt badly.

95
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,896
He keeps calling for you all day and night.

96
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,760
That's why he wanted you to spend his final moments with him.

97
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:31,440
San?

98
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,520
- Hey! - Nual.

99
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,000
He's just fooling you into coming back to him.

100
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,800
- Don't trust him, Nual. - Yeah.

101
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:44,040
You know who your husband has always been.

102
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,824
When life's good, he's nowhere to be found.

103
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:48,720
When he loses money and can't pay his debt,

104
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,800
he always troubles you endlessly.

105
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,920
Why would you go back to him just to get hurt?

106
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,647
What if he's really dying this time?

107
00:08:58,011 --> 00:09:01,000
Then you're free from him.

108
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,720
Nual, I think you can't help but care about him.

109
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:09,150
But you have stayed strong all this time. Don't turn back to him again.

110
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,760
Don't let him hurt you again, okay?

111
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,760
Nual.

112
00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:36,880
No matter what we say,

113
00:09:37,456 --> 00:09:39,360
you've already made up your mind, right?

114
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,480
Am I wrong?

115
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,800
You're not.

116
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,880
I know that you

117
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:55,040
know what you're doing.

118
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,120
Thanks for understanding.

119
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,080
Don't worry.

120
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:05,440
I always remember your words.

121
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
Right now, the person I love the most is myself.

122
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:17,120
I'll say my final goodbye.

123
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
If he's dying,

124
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:23,240
then I can have closure.

125
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:29,930
Then,

126
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,120
I'm going with you.

127
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,600
I thought I would never see you again in this life.

128
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:24,080
You still came back to me.

129
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:26,360
Do you still love me?

130
00:11:29,953 --> 00:11:31,480
I came here

131
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:33,960
not because I still love you.

132
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,760
I came here to forgive you.

133
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,600
Nual.

134
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,520
Let's sever our ties in this life

135
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,560
so that we won't meet again in the next.

136
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:51,840
Come on, Nual.

137
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:55,680
Can you really cut ties with me?

138
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:58,840
Even if I'm dying,

139
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,640
you won't ever come back to me?

140
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,440
If he can beg that much,

141
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,320
I don't think he'd die so easily, Nual.

142
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,480
Instead of seeing your wife,

143
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:12,120
I think you should see a doctor.

144
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,111
Are you done saying your goodbye, Nual?

145
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:16,416
Let's go.

146
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,600
Let's go home.

147
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:21,088
You finally came back to your husband.

148
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:22,301
Where are you going so soon?

149
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:23,640
Nual!

150
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:27,000
Boonta!

151
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,733
- Boonta! - Don't worry about her!

152
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:32,840
She's going to heaven!

153
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:36,440
Boonta!

154
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:22,840
Hey!

155
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,600
Who is that criminal? What is he going to do?

156
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,240
I don't know much.

157
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:30,400
All I know is that Boonta brought me money.

158
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,498
I knew if I called you,

159
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:35,800
Boonta wouldn't let you come alone.

160
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,760
Now that you're here anyway

161
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:40,520
let's have some nostalgia.

162
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:46,320
You can fight, huh?

163
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:54,680
Nual! Are you trying to kill your own husband?

164
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:56,560
That's less than what you deserve!

165
00:14:56,641 --> 00:15:00,360
If something happens to Boonta, you won't survive Luang Thukkarat's wrath!

166
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,800
Everything is done.

167
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:25,200
Other than the matter of your personal life, perhaps?

168
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,320
Want some stress relief, sir?

169
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,559
I brought this with me.

170
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,680
Luang, sir.

171
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:41,160
What's the matter?

172
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:44,920
This is serious. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

173
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Yesterday, I tried looking for Nual until dark.

174
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:51,000
I couldn't find her, so I came back.

175
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,960
I thought she had already come back too.

176
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,240
I waited until dawn.

177
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:58,960
And there was still no sign of her, Mother.

178
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,840
Did San kidnap Nual?

179
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:06,872
I don't think you should be speculating.

180
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,104
We should report this to the police.

181
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, let's go.

182
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:15,360
- You don't have to. - Why? Is Nual back?

183
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,360
It's not her, is it, Ming? Move!

184
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:35,600
- Come on. - No.

185
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:39,400
The victim's face is messed up with cuts.

186
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:40,720
She's unrecognizable.

187
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,680
Judging from the color of her sash and robe, according to Fang's staff,

188
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,584
this woman was likely

189
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,200
a courtesan called Nual. There's no doubt, sir.

190
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,240
Nual!

191
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,360
No...

192
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,520
Have you ever been in conflict

193
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,320
so serious someone wanted you dead?

194
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,640
I have never had a fight.

195
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,640
People in this neighborhood are business rivals,

196
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,033
but we're more like allies than enemies.

197
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:16,560
If you don't have enemies,

198
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:18,760
how come two of your courtesans

199
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,600
have been brutally murdered the same way?

200
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,240
The same way?

201
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:27,400
This victim was killed the same way Lamduan was.

202
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,960
This spot is not far from where Lamduan's body was found.

203
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,400
It's likely that the killer is the same person.

204
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,520
Mother...

205
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,280
Nual...

206
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,560
Mother, please save her soul.

207
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,272
What's wrong?

208
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
Nual was found dead.

209
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,920
Oeb is missing too.

210
00:21:13,016 --> 00:21:14,320
We're afraid

211
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:15,960
that if we can't find her,

212
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:18,440
and if they can't catch the killer,

213
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
there will be a third victim.

214
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:30,040
Chuen!

215
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:45,480
Are you here to wait for me?

216
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:50,640
I want to thank you for last time.

217
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:53,040
When you're done working,

218
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,360
do you have some time for me to give you a thank-you gift?

219
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:03,280
Of course.

220
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:12,640
About Nual,

221
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:15,360
I'll let Mian and Ming arrange things.

222
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:20,320
The dead can't come back to life.

223
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:24,040
It's the living that has to keep struggling until we die.

224
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:28,560
Don't just sit here.

225
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,080
Go get ready to do your job.

226
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:33,160
Yes, Mother.

227
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,736
It's alright, Chor.

228
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:43,200
Nual is resting in peace now.

229
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:50,640
They kill us like animals.

230
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:53,584
Who's going to be next?

231
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,600
The whole place is in chaos.

232
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:00,080
Where the heck have you been?

233
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,680
If I had been here, would the dead have come back?

234
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,520
- Noknoi! - Pudsorn, calm down! It's not worth it.

235
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:08,520
Just watch yourself.

236
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:11,200
If Mother catches you sneaking out to see a man

237
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:12,880
and catch a disease from outside,

238
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:15,120
you're going to get kicked out.

239
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,160
Fang's seems quiet tonight, sir.

240
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:55,480
Two of our courtesans got murdered recently.

241
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:57,560
Who would come then, sir?

242
00:23:58,295 --> 00:24:01,920
Now that you're here, let me take good care of you.

243
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,432
Noknoi.

244
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:06,800
You can take the guest at that table.

245
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,904
Luang is just here about the case.

246
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:14,320
Yes, Mother.

247
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:20,800
Boonta.

248
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:23,200
Serve him some booze.

249
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,120
You can ask Boonta anything, sir.

250
00:24:30,782 --> 00:24:31,880
Please.

251
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,360
You can wait here.

252
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,279
Yes, sir.

253
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:10,160
You don't have to serve me.

254
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:13,320
Take your time to mourn.

255
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:19,040
Nobody wanted this to happen.

256
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
I can't help but think

257
00:25:25,303 --> 00:25:27,080
I was the reason Nual got killed.

258
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:30,640
What do you mean?

259
00:25:42,056 --> 00:25:43,400
Well...

260
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:50,560
Nual was used as bait to bring me outside.

261
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,600
When the killer saw me,

262
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,360
he dragged me out, so I was separated from Nual.

263
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,560
I was lucky I survived him.

264
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:04,672
That's how Nual got killed.

265
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:11,920
You mean someone tried to kill you again?

266
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,640
Yes, sir.

267
00:26:16,112 --> 00:26:17,458
The other night,

268
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:19,409
someone tried to sneak into Mother Fang's room.

269
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:20,672
He got away.

270
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,280
I thought he was just a thief.

271
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:25,800
When I saw him again,

272
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:29,760
I was sure he was the one who tried to kill Boonta.

273
00:26:31,575 --> 00:26:35,080
Chaai, do you think it's possible that

274
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,600
the courtesan killer is the same person who's trying to kill Boonta?

275
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,280
We can't jump to that conclusion.

276
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:45,600
We have to catch the killer and find out the truth.

277
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,080
I'll catch that killer soon.

278
00:26:51,815 --> 00:26:54,440
No more courtesan will be his victim.

279
00:26:56,504 --> 00:26:59,040
You and your friends will be safe.

280
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:02,040
Thank you so much, Chaai,

281
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:04,280
for being there for me.

282
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:09,760
I won't let you go through this alone.

283
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:13,200
I won't let my friends die for nothing.

284
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:27,760
She was right there in his hands.

285
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:30,400
Yet he let Boonta slip again.

286
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,160
If she reports this to Luang Thukkarat, we're all screwed!

287
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:38,520
Tis didn't reveal his face.

288
00:27:38,814 --> 00:27:40,904
Nual is dead too.

289
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,880
Nobody can be a witness to incriminate us.

290
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:46,752
Boonta is still alive.

291
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:49,800
Wait until the news dies down.

292
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:52,920
We will have another chance to strike again, ma'am.

293
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,600
That darn Captain Jam.

294
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:09,560
He reported my mixed sugar to Chaai.

295
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,000
If he can't be bribed,

296
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
how can I make any profit now?

297
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:20,008
When I get my chance, I'll have my payback a hundredfold.

298
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:27,880
Tea, sir.

299
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,440
Master Gaysorn told us to serve this with a snack called Gaysorn Lamjeak.

300
00:29:18,872 --> 00:29:21,000
Muean, leave us.

301
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,960
Yes, sir.

302
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:03,040
Thank you

303
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,840
for taking care of me,

304
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,320
our child,

305
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:09,360
and our house.

306
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,640
So a Sampheng woman can't satisfy you?

307
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,560
Is that why you came here with your blind lust?

308
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:26,560
I'm not a vile woman like those girls.

309
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,400
What's wrong?

310
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:31,600
What gets you in a bad mood?

311
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,400
I'm not insatiable like you are.

312
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:36,200
All you do is womanizing.

313
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:40,040
- Lust is the only thing on your mind, not family! - Darn it!

314
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:45,360
What do you want from me?

315
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:48,520
I take very good care of you.

316
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:51,720
I honor you above anyone!

317
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:53,920
I've never left you without money.

318
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:57,360
Can't you just give me some peace of mind?

319
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:00,640
All you do is cause trouble.

320
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,520
You're making our household hell.

321
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,760
If you can't stand me, just divorce me!

322
00:31:05,608 --> 00:31:08,560
You want me to divorce so that you can live a happy life with her?

323
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:11,800
I'll never do that.

324
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:16,240
I'll never shame myself by becoming a divorced woman!

325
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,040
Darn it!

326
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:01,840
A ghost! Nual's ghost!

327
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:04,960
Go! Run!

328
00:33:05,144 --> 00:33:06,960
Run! Just go!

329
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:25,560
What ghost?

330
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,400
You're a guard of a courtesan house.

331
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:29,200
Don't be a coward.

332
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:32,920
If I were you, I'd ask her for a lottery number.

333
00:33:34,088 --> 00:33:35,200
Who's there?

334
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:37,960
I said who's there?

335
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,582
Nual?

336
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:04,680
Nual, this is just dawn.

337
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:08,826
Curse it! Nual!

338
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,735
Ghost! Nual's ghost is here! Help!

339
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:16,240
Guys! Mother!

340
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:18,240
- Mother! - Mian, what's wrong?

341
00:34:19,655 --> 00:34:21,600
Hey, watch where you're going.

342
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:23,320
What are you screaming for so early?

343
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,280
- Help! - What happened, Aunt?

344
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:29,400
It's a ghost.

345
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,720
Nual's ghost was eating food in the kitchen.

346
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:34,560
She's a ghost!

347
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:38,520
Hey, Nual is dead. Why would she eat some food?

348
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:41,360
Yeah, are you still dreaming? That's...

349
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:44,840
That's not Nual. It's probably a thief stealing food.

350
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,000
No.

351
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:49,000
It really was Nual, Mother.

352
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:58,680
Nual, please rest in peace. Leave me alone.

353
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:02,800
Mian must have been seeing things.

354
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,080
What ghost would be eating food in a pantry?

355
00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:07,960
Ming said he saw her too.

356
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:09,960
Could it really be her?

357
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:12,880
You're talking nonsense.

358
00:35:12,984 --> 00:35:16,200
It's the same with Lamduan. They said they saw Lamduan's ghost.

359
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,160
And was it true? It wasn't.

360
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,200
- Don't worry. Ghosts don't exist. - Yeah.

361
00:35:20,224 --> 00:35:23,440
- They don't! It's just on your mind. - Are you crazy?

362
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,440
That's the real thing.

363
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,840
It's even clearer than "Full HD."

364
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,280
- Whoa! - You...

365
00:35:54,663 --> 00:35:56,480
A ghost!

366
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,120
Run!

367
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,880
Wait for me!

368
00:36:10,153 --> 00:36:13,200
Nual, please spare your friend.

369
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,680
- Boonta. - Whoa!

370
00:36:16,703 --> 00:36:19,060
I know you're my friend, but don't call my name.

371
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:21,200
Just tell me a lottery number. Come on.

372
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:31,600
It's warm.

373
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:38,114
Nual!

374
00:36:39,248 --> 00:36:40,840
You're alive?

375
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:53,200
Look, Nual.

376
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:55,480
Why didn't you tell us you were back?

377
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:59,080
Why did you have to sneak in like a ghost?

378
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:03,080
It's not like I want to do this.

379
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,480
So what's going on?

380
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,527
Where have you been?

381
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:12,000
I tried looking for you at the cabin. No one was there.

382
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,040
San probably ran away.

383
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,480
I smashed his head in and followed you to help you.

384
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:33,000
But that criminal jerk came back my way.

385
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,640
I had to run away.

386
00:37:55,335 --> 00:37:57,920
I stayed hidden until I was sure he wouldn't come back.

387
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,000
Then I came back here.

388
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,440
When I got back,

389
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,680
it turned out I was dead.

390
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:18,560
I have to hide

391
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:22,640
because if he finds out I'm still alive,

392
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,480
he'll come back to finish the job.

393
00:38:28,863 --> 00:38:30,640
He's after you

394
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
because you saw his face, right?

395
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:37,880
I saw the face of the one who hired him.

396
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,640
Tis!

397
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,320
What are you stalling here for?

398
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,280
Why don't you take her to the boat?

399
00:39:11,144 --> 00:39:12,560
I remember it clearly.

400
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,000
That woman is Muean. There's no doubt.

401
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,400
She sure is cute, Master Gaysorn.

402
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,080
What's the matter, sir?

403
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:48,248
Are you here to see my Magnate?

404
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:50,200
I'm not here to see Magnate Thong.

405
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:53,760
I'm here to arrest the person who ordered a hit on Fang's courtesans.

406
00:39:56,808 --> 00:39:58,360
A witness saw Muean,

407
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,080
a staff of this house, at the scene of the crime.

408
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:04,320
Take her in.

409
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,280
- Master Gaysorn, please help me. - Luang.

410
00:40:12,471 --> 00:40:14,360
Muean is just a slave,

411
00:40:15,231 --> 00:40:18,040
but you have no right to accuse her baselessly!

412
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:20,247
The truth never lies.

413
00:40:20,536 --> 00:40:21,720
Don't worry.

414
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:24,800
Whether it's a slave, a high-ranking official,

415
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,560
or a courtesan who had no breath left in her body,

416
00:40:28,223 --> 00:40:30,840
I'll give justice to anyone.

417
00:40:33,272 --> 00:40:34,288
Let's go.

418
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:36,800
Master Gaysorn, please save me!

419
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:42,240
Master Gaysorn!

420
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,120
Did you order it?

421
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:53,760
You sent Muean to hire a killer for Boonta, but he killed the wrong girls.

422
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:55,960
Is that right?

423
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,360
Those courtesans got themselves killed.

424
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:00,775
How could you accuse me?

425
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:02,520
Last time,

426
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,840
Chaai tracked the man who sank Boonta's boat to this place!

427
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:10,200
This time, Muean was seen at the crime scene and got arrested!

428
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,679
Are you still denying it?

429
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,920
Just because I hate her

430
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:18,216
doesn't mean I'm a murderer, does it?

431
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:20,720
In your eyes,

432
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:23,696
am I that heartless of a person?

433
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:25,016
If you're not,

434
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:27,713
how else would you poison yourself into a miscarriage

435
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,680
just to kick Boonta out?

436
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:36,360
You survived poisoning.

437
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:38,720
But this crime carries a death sentence.

438
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,760
You know what kind of man Chaai is!

439
00:41:44,014 --> 00:41:45,760
Just pray that your uncle

440
00:41:46,151 --> 00:41:48,400
can save you again this time.

441
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,420
Were you at Khlong Rong Mai that night?

442
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:19,160
I said were you there?

443
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,200
I wasn't, sir.

444
00:42:22,112 --> 00:42:23,704
So, where were you that night?

445
00:42:25,055 --> 00:42:26,832
Do you have an alibi?

446
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,640
I was at home, sir.

447
00:42:30,352 --> 00:42:32,880
I was sick, so I was sleeping in the slaves' quarter.

448
00:42:33,528 --> 00:42:35,120
If you give a false statement,

449
00:42:36,535 --> 00:42:38,640
do you know what will happen?

450
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:44,960
I have no involvement in Lamduan and Nual's murders, sir.

451
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,160
What about hiring a hit on Boonta?

452
00:42:50,832 --> 00:42:52,440
Do you have an involvement in that?

453
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:54,960
How am I involved, sir?

454
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,160
Boonta was lured out to be killed.

455
00:42:57,816 --> 00:42:59,440
Nual was killed in her stead.

456
00:43:01,272 --> 00:43:04,000
You have taken Boonta to court before.

457
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:08,380
It is possible that you order a hit on her out of vengeance.

458
00:43:09,591 --> 00:43:12,000
I may despise Boonta,

459
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,600
but I never intend to kill her, sir.

460
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:17,800
If that's so,

461
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,840
the one who hates her so much that they want to kill her

462
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,080
is your master, isn't it?

463
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:32,680
If every wife has to kill a courtesan

464
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
out of jealousy for her husband,

465
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:39,760
there would be more dead courtesans than you can find bodies, sir.

466
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,520
You're facing a serious crime.

467
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,880
Yet you're still wisecracking?

468
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,920
Perhaps I have to find another way to make you speak.

469
00:44:57,335 --> 00:44:58,680
Water.

470
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:05,840
Stop.

471
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:10,680
Lock her up.

472
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,440
She will go on trial.

473
00:45:14,983 --> 00:45:16,160
Yes, sir.

474
00:45:30,576 --> 00:45:32,120
She's loyal and resolute.

475
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:34,800
She won't speak so easily, sir.

476
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,080
Thank you so much, Luang.

477
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,240
But Nual can't go back to Fang's just yet,

478
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:44,720
not until the case is over.

479
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:46,240
It's alright.

480
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:48,241
Chaai is busy with work, so he asked me to help.

481
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,360
I don't have a place you can hide.

482
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,600
I was thinking of Chaai's house,

483
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:54,681
but his mother would die of heartbreak.

484
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,560
So you bothered me instead.

485
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,080
You have a big house. Why

486
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:04,120
don't you take her to your house?

487
00:46:05,744 --> 00:46:07,000
A single man like me

488
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,280
can't be alone with a woman.

489
00:46:10,776 --> 00:46:13,760
You have your parents and servants.

490
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,880
Perhaps you're afraid

491
00:46:16,134 --> 00:46:17,960
that a woman would get the wrong idea.

492
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:22,135
I'm not in love with anyone.

493
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:23,960
Why would I be afraid of that?

494
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,560
Chang, we should get inside.

495
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:32,728
If someone sees us, it'll be bad.

496
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,560
Let's go.

497
00:46:38,235 --> 00:46:39,528
Come on.

498
00:46:45,441 --> 00:46:48,080
This is my father's old warehouse.

499
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:50,800
It was closed down after his death.

500
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:53,103
Chim built a new warehouse

501
00:46:53,264 --> 00:46:54,680
closer to the port.

502
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,040
This place is rarely used these days.

503
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,600
I promise you'll be fine here.

504
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,040
You can stay here, right?

505
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:20,560
I can clean it up and live in here, sir.

506
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,167
This is more than I can ask for.

507
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,800
That's right. It's better than sleeping outside.

508
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,440
I'll bring food to you often,

509
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,960
so you don't get lonely.

510
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,000
If you need anything, tell me. Don't be afraid.

511
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:40,000
We're not strangers, right?

512
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,160
Puek.

513
00:48:05,713 --> 00:48:07,400
Stay still!

514
00:48:11,114 --> 00:48:12,600
- Quiet... - Ming!

515
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,480
Why were you holding me?

516
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:16,560
Go check if Nual's ghost is there.

517
00:48:16,816 --> 00:48:18,440
If you're not afraid, you can go.

518
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,240
Nual is one of you.

519
00:48:20,368 --> 00:48:21,920
She won't snap your neck.

520
00:48:22,976 --> 00:48:24,520
Ming!

521
00:48:33,999 --> 00:48:35,400
Whoa!

522
00:48:36,105 --> 00:48:38,280
It's me! What's wrong?

523
00:48:39,144 --> 00:48:40,400
Mother.

524
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:43,200
Where's Boonta?

525
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,880
This morning, I saw her froze in here.

526
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,760
Hey, don't tell me she was shocked to death?

527
00:48:52,518 --> 00:48:54,746
I'm not dead, Mother.

528
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:57,160
I went out to the market.

529
00:48:57,297 --> 00:49:00,240
I was going to make merit for Nual.

530
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,840
Send her to the afterlife so she can stop feeding here.

531
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:08,200
Oh! I forgot! We were busy being scared.

532
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,880
We forgot to make merit for Nual!

533
00:49:09,984 --> 00:49:11,400
She came to warn us!

534
00:49:11,503 --> 00:49:14,120
- That's right! - I forgot!

535
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,520
Then,

536
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:17,360
go prepare some food.

537
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:19,480
We'll go and make merit for Nual.

538
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:21,000
Yes, Mother.

539
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,017
Nual, you must be hungry. We'll make merit for you.

540
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,560
Go and ask her.

541
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:31,560
Ming!

542
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,720
(I'm sorry.)

543
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:52,480
(I really can't tell you about Nual right now.)

544
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,280
Why are you staring at me?

545
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:20,160
I saw you making a wish.

546
00:50:20,241 --> 00:50:24,000
So I wonder what you wished for. You've been saying your wish for so long.

547
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,647
I wished for Nual to rest in peace

548
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,480
and not to be born as a courtesan again in the next life.

549
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:41,560
Mother.

550
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,320
- Mother. - Yes?

551
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,640
Do you believe in the next life?

552
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:47,920
I do.

553
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:50,542
I believe we all die and get reincarnated, and we meet

554
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:53,960
due to ties in previous lives.

555
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:58,200
So that's why I was born to meet you.

556
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,560
Perhaps I'll be an owner of a brothel in my next life,

557
00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:05,925
and you can be my courtesan.

558
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,320
Hey!

559
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,600
If you wish for a next life, wish for a good one!

560
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:14,000
If you want to be born into a life like this,

561
00:51:14,129 --> 00:51:15,960
then let's not meet.

562
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,160
Hey, Mother!

563
00:51:18,615 --> 00:51:20,880
Are you cutting ties right now?

564
00:51:21,855 --> 00:51:25,960
You used to tell me to be the top girl at your place.

565
00:51:29,642 --> 00:51:31,520
But in my next life,

566
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:34,840
I'll live a good life as a star actress.

567
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,967
Perhaps I haven't paid for my sins.

568
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:41,480
That's why I came back here as a courtesan.

569
00:51:58,471 --> 00:51:59,760
I've found out, sir.

570
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:02,631
A courtesan called Oeb from Hom's brothel

571
00:52:03,008 --> 00:52:04,920
disappeared the same day Nual did.

572
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,360
Hom didn't report it

573
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,560
because she was afraid people would panic,

574
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,880
and her place would be quiet like Fang's was.

575
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,080
If the body we thought was Nual

576
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,400
is Oeb, as Boonta suspected,

577
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,640
do you still think

578
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,760
he killed the wrong girl?

579
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:32,360
I'm not sure about that yet.

580
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,200
Seeing as his consecutive victims have been courtesans,

581
00:52:38,919 --> 00:52:41,480
there's no doubt that courtesans are his targets.

582
00:52:43,848 --> 00:52:45,000
If that's so,

583
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:48,120
the person in danger the most right now would be Boonta, sir.

584
00:52:49,776 --> 00:52:52,160
She had already seen the killer.

585
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:55,120
He won't let her go.

586
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:29,480
It's me.

587
00:53:30,224 --> 00:53:31,480
Luang.

588
00:53:32,264 --> 00:53:33,640
How did you get here?

589
00:53:39,432 --> 00:53:41,720
I don't want you to go anywhere alone.

590
00:53:42,488 --> 00:53:44,880
So you followed me quietly?

591
00:53:45,175 --> 00:53:46,600
How did it turn out?

592
00:53:46,785 --> 00:53:48,600
You're lucky I didn't smash your head in.

593
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:50,560
If you had to, do it.

594
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,640
If that's what it takes

595
00:53:54,176 --> 00:53:55,320
to see you safe.

596
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,440
You're crazy.

597
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,480
I can't stand watching you anymore.

598
00:54:03,104 --> 00:54:06,880
You and Boonta are too sweet that ants got on my food.

599
00:54:07,608 --> 00:54:10,320
Let me go and take these ants out.

600
00:54:12,455 --> 00:54:13,679
Nual.

601
00:54:24,744 --> 00:54:25,960
Chaai!

602
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:28,120
What are you doing?

603
00:54:28,368 --> 00:54:30,160
Let me stay like this for a while.

604
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,271
Let me rest easy seeing you safe.

605
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:36,200
It would help me sleep at night.

606
00:54:39,471 --> 00:54:40,680
Okay, sir.

607
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:43,480
Don't take too long.

608
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:45,760
My leg would go numb.

609
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
(I'll allow her to be your wife.)

610
00:54:56,472 --> 00:54:59,880
But you have to marry Dokgaew first.

611
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,720
She will be your main wife.

612
00:55:02,151 --> 00:55:05,440
Boonta can only be your slave wife.

613
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:12,760
What's the matter?

614
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,880
No matter what happens,

615
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:26,711
I'll never lose you.

616
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,360
I know, sir.

617
00:55:33,544 --> 00:55:36,920
My "boyfriend" is the capital's finest.

618
00:55:37,302 --> 00:55:38,920
No killer

619
00:55:39,064 --> 00:55:41,040
can escape your sight.

620
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:50,400
Besides, I'm pretty and tough. I made it through...

621
00:55:51,463 --> 00:55:54,160
Through the water and canal.

622
00:55:55,024 --> 00:55:57,320
I won't die before I get married.

623
00:56:00,407 --> 00:56:01,760
Do you promise?

624
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:03,296
To marry me?

625
00:56:04,496 --> 00:56:05,880
Yes, sir.

626
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:26,200
Chaai! Whoa!

627
00:56:27,146 --> 00:56:28,440
No!

628
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:31,680
Chaai, take it out! I'm scared!

629
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,120
Don't be.

630
00:56:33,335 --> 00:56:35,920
How can I not be scared? It's huge!

631
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,400
Could my Luang and Boonta

632
00:56:39,615 --> 00:56:40,920
give in to temptation?

633
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,760
- There! - They're...

634
00:56:42,841 --> 00:56:45,241
- It's got too much hair! - I saw them looking suspicious.

635
00:56:45,327 --> 00:56:48,575
So he snuck in here with Boonta after all.

636
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:51,120
- Hang on. - So he switched from the river

637
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:53,519
to a warehouse instead?

638
00:56:53,624 --> 00:56:56,000
Whoa! Hit the head!

639
00:56:57,511 --> 00:56:58,680
There!

640
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:08,000
No! Chaai!

641
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:10,320
Stay still.

642
00:57:10,943 --> 00:57:12,160
- Hey. - Chaai!

643
00:57:35,129 --> 00:57:37,040
Luang probably doesn't want anyone to know.

644
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,520
How can they not know?

645
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:40,511
They snuck in, and not long after that,

646
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:43,160
Boonta screamed hard like she was dying.

647
00:57:43,256 --> 00:57:44,920
Was she struggling that much?

648
00:57:45,047 --> 00:57:48,720
There was a loud noise, and the whole warehouse was shaking.

649
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:50,400
- Really? - Yeah.

650
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,040
Luang's lovemaking is intense indeed.

651
00:57:53,176 --> 00:57:56,080
Who told you that? They said Boonta went on top of him.

652
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,600
I can't believe she's a woman.

653
00:57:58,681 --> 00:58:00,160
She's too daring.

654
00:58:00,241 --> 00:58:02,960
- Gosh! - It's the talk of the town!

655
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:05,280
Oh my goodness! She went on top of him?

656
00:58:05,361 --> 00:58:08,480
She rode him all over the warehouse. No shame at all.

657
00:58:08,695 --> 00:58:10,240
That's not all.

658
00:58:10,335 --> 00:58:12,672
They let the slaves join in!

659
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,120
Really?

660
00:58:30,151 --> 00:58:31,640
Dokgaew is coming here.

661
00:58:32,975 --> 00:58:34,520
What are you doing here?

662
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,160
I saw Boonta going in,

663
00:58:37,344 --> 00:58:39,760
and Luang Vasuthep followed her inside.

664
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:41,400
Lamduan and Oeb's backs

665
00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:43,080
were slashed in lines.

666
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:44,617
They looked like cuts from a spear or a sword.

667
00:58:44,641 --> 00:58:46,240
Someone who can do this

668
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,320
is probably an acrobat, sir.

669
00:58:48,456 --> 00:58:50,520
The people who perform such dangerous stunts

670
00:58:50,704 --> 00:58:53,080
are the Vietnamese Troupe. I'm going to investigate them.

671
00:58:53,608 --> 00:58:55,640
My husband's name is Choed.

672
00:58:55,784 --> 00:58:57,280
My name is Boon...

673
00:58:57,966 --> 00:58:59,080
Pa!

674
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,520
Boonpa, sir!

675
00:59:02,447 --> 00:59:05,148
Please accept this. I want you to live a long life

676
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,400
so you can keep singing beautiful songs.
