1
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:28,520
There will be a feast at Wat Suwannaram.

2
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:29,737
My mother is attending.

3
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,719
I would like to introduce you.

4
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,880
I've always dreamt of a singing contest such as this.

5
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,640
I'm not worthy of that big an event, sir.

6
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:40,200
But I, for one, would like to hear you sing.

7
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,800
Is there no way for me to participate anonymously?

8
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,520
There is! This thing

9
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:48,120
will turn you into someone else, Lamjeak.

10
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,999
If you're sure you have the money to buy Boonta off,

11
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,200
Boonta will end up with you.

12
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,440
Are you really going to sell me to Captain Jon?

13
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,240
The time is after the feast.

14
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,921
I've helped you as much as I can.

15
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,519
If a deal is struck,

16
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,720
you would lose your place in the business, along with your face.

17
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:09,352
How is it going over here?

18
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:12,880
The singing contest is about to start soon, but the confrontation

19
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,480
has already begun.

20
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,380
(Episode 19: On Stage... The Masked Singer)

21
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:25,280
(Ten fingers together, above your head.)

22
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,999
(Pay your respect with incenses and candles, )

23
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,120
(and say your prayers.)

24
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,795
(Pay your respect with incenses)

25
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:40,959
(and candles. Pay your respect with incenses)

26
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,400
(and candles, and say your prayers.)

27
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,198
(Paid our respect to our masters.)

28
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:53,360
(Stand up and make your move.)

29
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:55,880
(Paid our respect to our masters.)

30
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,920
(Stand up and make your move.)

31
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:04,440
(If you want to play, dance on this way. Cha, cha, cha, cha.)

32
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:06,521
(Eh, cha hai!)

33
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,243
(Come on, young ones. Solos and duos.)

34
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:16,240
(Come on, young ones. Solos and duos.)

35
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:20,772
(We're asking you to join. Don't hesitate.)

36
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:23,254
(You look so fine. This looks like fate.)

37
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:28,078
(Oei, oeng, oei. You look so fine. This looks like fate.)

38
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:30,640
(Cha, cha, cha, cha.)

39
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,440
(Eh, cha hai!)

40
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,273
(I heard you loud and clear.)

41
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:41,959
(Don't just stand there. Tonight, the man is here.)

42
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,682
(Both feet straddle on. I join the fray quickly.)

43
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:49,359
(But you look at me, like my face is ghastly.)

44
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:51,440
(Oei, oeng, oei.)

45
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:56,679
(But you look at me, like my face is ghastly. Cha, cha, cha, cha.)

46
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,640
(Eh, cha hai!)

47
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:02,231
Alright, alright. You two should stop your battle.

48
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:04,414
- Why? - Give the young ones a chance.

49
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:09,117
Okay. The reward for the winner tonight is two tamleung!

50
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,440
- We won't lose! - Would you like to see?

51
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:14,200
- We would! - Then clap your hands!

52
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,047
Come on, then! Do your best!

53
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,360
Make your battle heard! Begin!

54
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:28,187
(I dress well tonight, with a charming color.)

55
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:32,640
(I dress well tonight, with a charming color.)

56
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,160
(If Jaeng sees me, he would eye no other.)

57
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,640
(Let him sit with his knees up. I'll kill him with my smoked scent.)

58
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:44,040
(Let him sit with his knees up. I'll kill him with my smoked scent.)

59
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:48,280
(Cha, cha, cha, cha. Eh, cha hai!)

60
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:52,626
(Is that smoked or nasty stink?)

61
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:57,019
(Is that smoked or nasty stink?)

62
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,560
(I'll pick a piece of wood and stick it in.)

63
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:04,000
(Let the dog face lie caved in.)

64
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:08,454
(Oei, oeng, oei. Let the dog face lie caved in.)

65
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,639
(Cha, cha, cha, cha. Eh, cha hai!)

66
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,757
(Your face looks like a rotten flesh-eating vulture.)

67
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:21,458
(Your face looks like a rotten flesh-eating vulture.)

68
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,676
(Your hairline looks like someone scratched it over.)

69
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,200
(You always live off of your parents' lucre.)

70
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:32,640
(Oei, oeng, oei. You always live off of your parents' lucre.)

71
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,960
(Cha, cha, cha, cha. Eh, cha hai!)

72
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:41,440
(All you do is insult me. You unburned corpse.)

73
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,919
(All you do is insult me. You unburned corpse.)

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,200
(Not just me, but my family and folks.)

75
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:52,600
(Say I'm perverted. I'm going to rape you.)

76
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:57,065
(Oei, oeng, oei. Say I'm perverted. I'm going to rape you.)

77
00:06:57,163 --> 00:07:01,400
(Cha, cha, cha, cha. Eh, cha hai!)

78
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:04,349
- How about that! - Yeah.

79
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,800
With that verse of Jaeng's, he's beaten you for sure!

80
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:10,920
All you do is trash talk.

81
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,600
Everyone can see.

82
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,006
- Maa's song was more creative. - Right.

83
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:16,680
Is that right?

84
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:20,280
- That's right! - So whose side are you on?

85
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,111
- What? - His performance and lyrics,

86
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:25,480
there's no way you beat him, Maa!

87
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,960
Is that right?

88
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,160
- That's right! - Hey, you!

89
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,120
This is intense, indeed.

90
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:34,120
Can Lamjeak and Boonta even compete?

91
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:37,300
- They could even win. - Don't worry about winning.

92
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:39,840
Look. They're about to start a fight on stage. There!

93
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:42,520
- We might see boxing instead. - Yeah, right.

94
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:45,920
- I won't lose, no matter what. - Me neither!

95
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Bring it!

96
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,944
- You road face! - Hey, is this

97
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:53,310
a singing contest or a "rap diss track?" Why is it so heated?

98
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:56,240
- Don't let him win! - We haven't even sung, Boonta!

99
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,760
Then we... I know.

100
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,320
- You old fermented fish! - Oh gosh!

101
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,200
- What a harsh insult! - What's that?

102
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:07,720
"Hi!"

103
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,840
What song is this?

104
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:14,200
- I don't know. - What's her "boom boom?"

105
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,760
Oh? What's that?

106
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,280
"Pop, pop, thud, thud." What song is this?

107
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,960
Is she singing? When I was a monk,

108
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,840
was there a new type of song?

109
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:34,030
You added an "ah?"

110
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:35,519
Music, come on!

111
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,537
- Oh, it's their song! - Okay.

112
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:45,000
(Easy with your insults. Don't be hard on their ears.)

113
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:49,400
(I feel sorry for the audience. You won't get their cheers.)

114
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:53,000
- (The Luangs back there wouldn't like it.) - (Yo, yo.)

115
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:56,680
(The Luangs back there wouldn't like it.)

116
00:08:56,772 --> 00:09:00,183
- (Yeah. You can hate who you want.) - (Hate on.)

117
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:02,520
- (Just don't hate me.) - (Hey.)

118
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:04,552
- (You can love me.) - (Love me.)

119
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,960
- (Come on if you want me.) - (Hey.)

120
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:10,495
(Don't just stand and think. Don't think.)

121
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:13,640
(Don't just stand and think. Don't even think.)

122
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:18,040
(It's not a crime to link. Oeng, oeng, oei.)

123
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:21,239
(Let's sing a love song. No more insult.)

124
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:25,200
(Insult is not welcome. It's not hard to love. No hard feelings.)

125
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:29,135
- (Make your life sweet, like the scent of flowers.) - (Oeng, oeng, oei.)

126
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:33,800
- (Give me the flower of love. Don't be distant.) - (Yeah.)

127
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:38,199
- (I love you. I won't be hesitant.) - (Yo.)

128
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,440
(My hand is here. Don't leave me hanging.)

129
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:44,871
(Oei, oeng, oei. My hand is here. Don't leave me hanging.)

130
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:48,760
(Cha, cha, cha, cha. Eh, cha hai!)

131
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,360
Uh-uh! Oh!

132
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:54,000
(Yo, yo!)

133
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:58,680
Quack, quack!

134
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,960
What kind of song is that? It's funny.

135
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:04,160
- I didn't recruit them. - They're quiet.

136
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,720
- Did you recruit them? - I didn't.

137
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:11,080
- They're a weird duo. I'm confused. - What do we do now?

138
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,759
I like that. They're great.

139
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,520
- Let's see. - Yeah.

140
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:21,960
Oh! Thank you. Thanks.

141
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,304
Their song is unusual.

142
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:25,720
It is.

143
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,720
Hey, you.

144
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:29,640
What kind of song was that?

145
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:32,040
Ever since I was born,

146
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:35,000
I've never seen such an entertaining singing contest before.

147
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:37,639
- Right. - The White Swan Masks?

148
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,360
Who are they? Do you know, Pikul?

149
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:45,160
It's Boonta, Mother.

150
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,680
This is why I wanted to see this contest.

151
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:58,904
What a weird song.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,640
Their costume is odd too.

153
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,360
They're probably too embarrassed to show their faces.

154
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:06,800
That's why they have to hide behind masks.

155
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,560
If you and the people

156
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,280
looked at them like everyone else,

157
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,360
Boonta wouldn't have done these weird things you say.

158
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:18,920
Let's go. I would rather see Khun Nattayavijit's show.

159
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:20,120
- Let's go. - Right.

160
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,560
Come on, Dokgaew.

161
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:35,160
Mother, those Aunts weren't entertained, were they?

162
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:39,600
No.

163
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,480
The result

164
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:45,520
of tonight's singing contest is unanimous.

165
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,920
The winner of tonight's contest

166
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,640
is...

167
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,407
Is...

168
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,040
The White Swan Masks!

169
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:07,400
Really?

170
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:09,360
Come on up.

171
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,400
- Here's your prize. Two tamleung. - Thank you!

172
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:18,999
By the way, won't you take off your masks and let us see your faces?

173
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:22,200
- That's right. - Yeah. Please show us.

174
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:28,987
Why not?

175
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,040
- I think you wouldn't want to know who we are. - Why not?

176
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:37,400
It's not that we're ugly or anything.

177
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:39,615
We would like you all

178
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:42,800
to focus on our singing more than our appearances

179
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:45,680
or who we are and what we do.

180
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,000
We wore masks to join this contest

181
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,960
because we were afraid that if we had not,

182
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,560
we wouldn't have been welcome,

183
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,080
and our song wouldn't have been as entertaining as it was.

184
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
That's right.

185
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:59,400
And if we have a chance to sing again,

186
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:01,481
we might get to know each other.

187
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,480
And I hope

188
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:06,920
we receive your applause and your laugh like we did tonight

189
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:10,000
without wearing these masks as we are.

190
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,240
Come on. Give a round of applause!

191
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,240
Lamjeak, please take this.

192
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:41,600
Hey. I'm fine. You can keep it.

193
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,000
Just take it.

194
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:45,400
We wouldn't have won without you.

195
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:50,760
We won because of your "pop, pop, chickadout, yo!"

196
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,440
You deserve it, after all.

197
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:55,763
Spend that money on new shoes and sashes, okay?

198
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,216
Those are material items.

199
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:02,520
Besides, the sandals you bought me are still as good as a new one.

200
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:06,560
As for sashes, Chaai has bought me some.

201
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
I think you should spend this

202
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,160
on food and medicine for your mother and sister.

203
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,720
Take it.

204
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:22,631
Come on. Just take it.

205
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:26,880
I actually intended to thank you for always being nice to me.

206
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:29,800
After I woke up at Fang's,

207
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:34,200
I don't know if I could have lasted this long without you.

208
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,800
Honestly, since I was born,

209
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:39,600
I have never truly called anyone a friend.

210
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:44,640
You're my first real friend.

211
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:54,080
Thank you, Boonta.

212
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,200
You and I will be friends til the day we die.

213
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,320
The day we die? Okay. Come here.

214
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:06,360
- I love you. - Okay. Don't cry.

215
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:10,880
So tell me what you want to eat.

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,240
- I'll treat you to anything. - Really?

217
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:15,320
I want to see the market first.

218
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,200
I want to see fireworks too.

219
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:18,840
- Lamjeak! - I'll...

220
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,240
It's really you!

221
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,832
I heard your voice, and I recognized it, so I snuck out to see you.

222
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:26,640
You really are the White Swan Mask.

223
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,600
Choi, how did you come here?

224
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,040
- Did something happen to Mother? - No.

225
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,080
I just wanted to help you make money, so I snuck out to sell things.

226
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:44,093
You don't have to work now.

227
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:46,880
Take this money and go home, okay? Go.

228
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,440
Lamjeak.

229
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,880
I think you should go home with her.

230
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:53,344
You can show your mother

231
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:57,240
you won a singing contest. Show her the prize.

232
00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:58,640
That's right.

233
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:02,440
If she knows you're the White Swan Mask, she'll be so happy.

234
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,760
It's fine. I won't be lonely.

235
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:21,120
I have someone to hang out with.

236
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,720
It's fine. See you later.

237
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:26,312
Go and see some fireworks. It's your family's business, right?

238
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:28,360
Let's go.

239
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:30,200
What's the matter, sir?

240
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,360
Come on.

241
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:50,456
Just as I thought. The White Swan Mask is you.

242
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,360
Why did you think so?

243
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,120
I saw your manners and heard the unusual song.

244
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,680
There were words from my language.

245
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,792
Not many can speak it.

246
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,760
You sure are observant, Captain.

247
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,440
Of course.

248
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,000
That's how I noticed that while on stage,

249
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:10,120
you just kept your eyes on your lover.

250
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,240
Did you know that?

251
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:21,280
I'm glad you know, sir.

252
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,544
So I don't have to tell you

253
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:27,920
that if you buy my freedom, only my body will be with you.

254
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:30,080
My heart won't be with you, sir.

255
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,480
Your heart

256
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,680
- is that focused? - Hey?

257
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,200
Is your heart so easy to sway, then?

258
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:43,360
You just thought I was pretty, and you wanted to marry me?

259
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,720
That's right.

260
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,160
I like you.

261
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:49,160
Not just because you're pretty.

262
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:52,640
I like your personality. You're brave. You never give up.

263
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:54,880
And you're sharp-witted.

264
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,480
Thank you, sir.

265
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,400
Perhaps I might have fallen for you

266
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,160
if he doesn't exist.

267
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't you want to get to know me?

268
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:14,760
You might change your mind.

269
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,760
You sure are confident in yourself.

270
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,840
If you don't want to get to know me,

271
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:26,680
then

272
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,400
let me get to know you. Where are you from?

273
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,783
If I tell you I came from 200 years into the future, would you believe me?

274
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,120
I would.

275
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:41,400
Really, sir?

276
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,200
If I had told him,

277
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:46,207
he not only wouldn't have believed me, but he would also have been angry.

278
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:48,080
So do you like that kind of a man?

279
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:54,360
Well, I don't know. I don't really have a type.

280
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,960
He's just so honest and practical that he

281
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:01,960
doesn't know how to be romantic.

282
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,800
So,

283
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:05,952
I would seem like a sweet talker

284
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,320
and a womanizer?

285
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:10,680
No matter how much money I have,

286
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,880
you would never look at me.

287
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,480
Well, I'm not that close to you, and I don't know what you're like.

288
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:24,400
At least, I'm glad that

289
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,480
you were the one who bought me off.

290
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,160
And not your friend.

291
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,080
There are good and bad people.

292
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:33,711
James may not be a very good man.

293
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,556
And I may not be a very good friend to him.

294
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,080
However,

295
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,120
we can still be friends.

296
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:42,360
You're right.

297
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,080
I don't really call someone a friend, though.

298
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:51,320
But now

299
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:54,280
my best friend is waiting for me.

300
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:56,040
I have to go, sir.

301
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,520
See you later.

302
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:00,680
Chaai.

303
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:14,040
Boonta just went with someone else.

304
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,720
- I know that. I'm going home. - Oh!

305
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,680
Wait, Captain Jon.

306
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:21,640
This is a big event.

307
00:20:21,823 --> 00:20:24,920
There are still more performances and great food.

308
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,040
If you're alone,

309
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:30,120
I volunteer to be your company, sir.

310
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:43,120
Chaai, I'm sorry.

311
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,120
Mother told me

312
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,640
to spend time with Captain Jon. I know you invited me first.

313
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,200
I couldn't find a chance to come to you.

314
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:52,920
I'm sorry, sir.

315
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,800
I know. You did nothing wrong.

316
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:59,120
You're doing what you're supposed to do.

317
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,680
It's me

318
00:21:01,815 --> 00:21:03,520
that has no right to be with you.

319
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
But when I saw you with another man,

320
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:08,360
I couldn't help but feel angry.

321
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:11,760
Well, Chaai...

322
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:14,640
My body might be with someone else,

323
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,200
but my heart

324
00:21:16,696 --> 00:21:18,400
is yours alone.

325
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:24,400
I won't have just your heart.

326
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:28,200
Your body will be mine too.

327
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,320
I may not have the right to be with you now,

328
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:34,080
but I will have it.

329
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,840
I will get us together

330
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,040
even if Captain Jon has paid a deposit on you.

331
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:51,360
After this event,

332
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:53,960
I'll negotiate with Fang.

333
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,360
I'm glad I didn't let you go home alone.

334
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:08,760
You keep wandering around. It's so late, and you're still not home.

335
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:11,400
It's not often I get to hang out with you.

336
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:12,880
I had so much fun tonight.

337
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,840
There will be next time. We should get in the boat. Come on.

338
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,640
Lamjeak.

339
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:21,320
- Chang. - Are you leaving?

340
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,480
No, sir. I'm just taking my sister home. I'll come back for the fireworks.

341
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,880
Is your home around here?

342
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,495
It's near Wat Saket, sir.

343
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:33,160
It won't take long by boat.

344
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:36,280
So are you not going home yet?

345
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:40,920
My mother was waiting to see Khun Nattayavijit's play,

346
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:42,407
so I came out for a walk.

347
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:49,080
You should

348
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:50,960
take her home soon.

349
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:56,160
Yes, sir.

350
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,240
I'm going, sir.

351
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,640
Come on, Choi.

352
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,800
Your song was beautiful.

353
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,200
Congratulations on your victory.

354
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,760
I decided to participate because of you, sir.

355
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,400
Earlier,

356
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,137
you gave me praise.

357
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:02,720
That gave me the confidence to do what I've never done.

358
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:07,560
I'm happy

359
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:11,600
you saw something of worth in someone like me.

360
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,520
I was just saying what I feel.

361
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,840
If it made you

362
00:24:23,224 --> 00:24:25,400
see your own value,

363
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,080
then I'm glad.

364
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:45,480
I have to go, sir.

365
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:48,537
Bye.

366
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:17,080
Hoan?

367
00:25:17,872 --> 00:25:19,360
Have you been well, sir?

368
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,720
Since I ran into you,

369
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,520
please tell my fortune whether

370
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:26,840
I'll get a husband without a hitch tomorrow.

371
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:29,080
I'll treat you to some dessert.

372
00:25:30,455 --> 00:25:31,600
Tomorrow?

373
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,300
Tomorrow...

374
00:25:39,696 --> 00:25:41,080
In life,

375
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,480
there's both happiness and sadness.

376
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:45,760
There are encounters,

377
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,480
and there are farewells.

378
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,695
It is like this piece of cracker.

379
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:53,080
It used to be completely whole.

380
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,680
But now,

381
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:58,160
it's missing parts.

382
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:01,480
It will soon be gone.

383
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,400
But

384
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:06,560
you can make a new one.

385
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:10,240
It won't be smooth.

386
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,600
But if you hold each other's hands

387
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,520
and fight through everything,

388
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
you will get through it.

389
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,920
Just pay for my crackers.

390
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:23,080
Yes, sir.

391
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,600
Luang, please...

392
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,160
Thank you.

393
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:44,720
There are farewells.

394
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,360
Some depart

395
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:48,640
just to meet again.

396
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:26,880
"And then..."

397
00:27:31,994 --> 00:27:33,839
That voice is beautiful.

398
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:46,480
Let's go over there.

399
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,640
"Gold Ruby, bright as the moon."

400
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,720
Weren't you hanging out with Chaai?

401
00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:33,680
What about you? Don't you have anyone to hang out with?

402
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:36,680
I don't.

403
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,720
Now that Chaai has gone with that woman,

404
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,120
I don't want to waste my time following him.

405
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:46,560
So you're wasting your time with me instead?

406
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,680
Do you like me or what?

407
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,040
I don't know, sir.

408
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,400
I'll tell you when I know.

409
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,960
Let's walk around.

410
00:29:15,497 --> 00:29:17,240
Well, it's a big crowd tonight.

411
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:21,488
It's yours truly. My name is Kaew.

412
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,080
It's Kaew.

413
00:29:23,232 --> 00:29:27,080
Oh gosh. I've been living in a jungle for so long with my grandparents.

414
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,040
Oh my! The wind tonight is chilling and blowing gently. Ouch!

415
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,160
Oh my! What is this?

416
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:34,560
Oh my...

417
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:37,679
What is this thing that almost hit my eye?

418
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
Whose kite is this?

419
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,952
It's cute.

420
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,640
Chaai, I'll be back.

421
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,680
Where are you going?

422
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:51,640
To the toilet, sir.

423
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,360
What kind of kite is this?

424
00:29:57,488 --> 00:30:00,400
I'll keep this for now. If the owner comes...

425
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,360
Attention please!

426
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:13,728
If anyone has seen His Highness Pra Pintong's kite

427
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:17,360
and collected it, you can claim a reward!

428
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:23,520
Sarang

429
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:26,720
is still in the police jail, isn't he?

430
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:28,080
Yes, sir.

431
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,120
But he's under the European's protection.

432
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,440
The police can't do anything.

433
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,680
Perhaps the police fear a huge conflict.

434
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:44,680
What if I want him dead?

435
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:47,600
Can you do that for me?

436
00:30:50,944 --> 00:30:53,800
The Europeans are about to strike a deal with Siam.

437
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:56,640
I don't know what their agreement is.

438
00:30:56,824 --> 00:30:59,440
I'm sure it won't be good for my business.

439
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:03,760
So you want to interfere

440
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:05,960
and stop the negotiation. Is that right?

441
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,480
You will kill two birds in one stone with this.

442
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:14,800
You serve way better than Come does.

443
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,400
Who's there?

444
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:31,160
Don't let her get away! Go!

445
00:32:48,151 --> 00:32:49,383
Who's there?

446
00:33:00,024 --> 00:33:01,160
What's going on?

447
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,600
I'll tell you later.

448
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,920
We should get out of here. Go.

449
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,400
Stay inside tonight. Don't go out.

450
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,720
I'll arrange protection.

451
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,280
Yes, sir.

452
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,480
Now I can't go to see the fireworks with Lamjeak.

453
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:35,295
There's still next time.

454
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:42,120
Please go inside.

455
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
I'll leave once you're in a safe place.

456
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:49,400
As for the suspects,

457
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:50,840
don't worry about them.

458
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,720
I'll catch them myself.

459
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:55,560
Yes, sir.

460
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,440
Oh, Chaai.

461
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,920
Please take care of yourself.

462
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,640
Why are you carrying so many things?

463
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,120
It's some fireworks.

464
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,040
My friend wanted to see them, so I'm going to show her.

465
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,600
I have to go.

466
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:05,040
Thank you so much.

467
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:13,320
You've been hiding so well.

468
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,520
I finally found you!

469
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,960
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

470
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,520
You heard my secret.

471
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,200
I can't let you breathe any longer!

472
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:51,520
Is Lamjeak back?

473
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,720
I think she spent the night at her mother's.

474
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,400
She'll be back. She's got to work today.

475
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,000
Why are you up so early, Pudsorn?

476
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,240
I'm going to the market with Aunt Mian and Boonta.

477
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:19,880
Last night, Captain Jon said he would be collecting his sales there.

478
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,920
I want to see him.

479
00:38:22,415 --> 00:38:25,760
Listen. Captain Jon is about to buy Boonta's freedom.

480
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:27,216
Yet you're offering yourself to him.

481
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,840
Do you think he'd buy you off too?

482
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,160
Chor!

483
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,480
Am I so wrong?

484
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,840
Boonta is already in love with Luang.

485
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,791
If Captain Jon changes his mind and chooses me,

486
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,800
I'll be doing you all a favor

487
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:41,360
and let Boonta be with Luang.

488
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,800
Yeah. What a great friend.

489
00:38:44,904 --> 00:38:46,200
What a saint.

490
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:48,456
What an altruist.

491
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,760
It's bad news, Boonta.

492
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,640
Move, please.

493
00:39:25,911 --> 00:39:27,520
No!

494
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:31,080
- Boonta! - Lamjeak! No...

495
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,400
- Boonta! - Aunt Mian...

496
00:39:38,236 --> 00:39:39,760
Mother...

497
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:44,080
- Let me go! No... - Boonta!

498
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:46,095
Boonta, don't!

499
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:01,720
No! It can't be!

500
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,920
Lamjeak...

501
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:37,080
Poor Lamjeak.

502
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,160
Rest in peace.

503
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:24,680
(After I woke up at Fang's, )

504
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:26,490
(I don't know if)

505
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:29,089
(I could have lasted this long without you.)

506
00:41:29,535 --> 00:41:30,960
I'll buy you a pair.

507
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,200
(You're my first real friend.)

508
00:41:37,352 --> 00:41:38,880
Thank you, Boonta.

509
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,760
You and I will be friends til the day we die.

510
00:42:18,048 --> 00:42:20,000
Do you believe in the next life?

511
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:26,280
Then don't be sad.

512
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,960
Someday, you will reunite with Lamjeak.

513
00:42:35,592 --> 00:42:37,120
Promise me

514
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:40,880
you won't let Lamjeak die for nothing.

515
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,640
Even if you don't ask,

516
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,760
I would do that anyway.

517
00:42:48,104 --> 00:42:50,680
I'll bring the killer to justice.

518
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,800
That Sampheng woman

519
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:23,000
died with our secret.

520
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,200
Now...

521
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,080
It's Sarang's turn to die.

522
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,520
Get rid of him once and for all.

523
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:33,271
Yes, sir.

524
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:19,000
This is bad! Sarang is poisoned!

525
00:44:19,081 --> 00:44:20,640
Come and open the door!

526
00:44:32,981 --> 00:44:35,480
Sarang is dead? How did he die?

527
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,640
Someone killed him in jail.

528
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,120
Siam's officials are covering it up.

529
00:44:43,535 --> 00:44:47,840
Sarang may have been a low-life jerk, but they can't do that.

530
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:50,200
I'll report this to Residence Singapore

531
00:44:50,344 --> 00:44:52,137
and convince them to reconsider their negotiation.

532
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:55,320
We should wage war on Siam like we did Inn-wa.

533
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,600
So you're admitting it.

534
00:44:59,336 --> 00:45:00,840
You Captains have, in fact,

535
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:03,160
always intended to wage war on Siam!

536
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:06,400
The one who started the war is Siam!

537
00:45:06,864 --> 00:45:08,440
If you dare disrespect us,

538
00:45:08,576 --> 00:45:11,640
you can prepare to deal with the army of Great Britain.

539
00:45:11,983 --> 00:45:13,983
Your victory over Inn-wa

540
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,880
doesn't mean you can invade anyone.

541
00:45:16,376 --> 00:45:17,640
You will see, Captain,

542
00:45:17,776 --> 00:45:19,640
that the might of the army of Siam

543
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,880
- is just as great as anyone! - Stop.

544
00:45:22,816 --> 00:45:24,680
Don't rush to a conclusion yet.

545
00:45:24,911 --> 00:45:29,640
We need to inform Captain Henry of this and investigate the facts.

546
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,880
I believe the sincerity we have shown Siam

547
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:36,640
will lead us to a good solution.

548
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,080
What if the authority of Siam

549
00:45:41,392 --> 00:45:43,240
doesn't see your sincerity?

550
00:45:46,156 --> 00:45:48,760
Months of your efforts spent on negotiating

551
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:50,760
are surely going down the drain.

552
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,040
Do you know what would be good?

553
00:45:58,191 --> 00:46:00,191
Both for me and for you, Captains.

554
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:03,560
That's me holding a high-ranking title.

555
00:46:03,912 --> 00:46:06,080
My power and influence

556
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:10,960
can be useful for your business.

557
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,600
Think about it.

558
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:27,160
You never disappoint me.

559
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,400
We're lucky Sarang didn't have family visiting him.

560
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:33,120
He had to ask other prisoners to share things.

561
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:35,160
That's why it was easy for me.

562
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,360
It's time they all face their destruction.

563
00:46:39,974 --> 00:46:41,720
The one who's facing destruction

564
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:43,320
is you.

565
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:51,640
Arrest all of them!

566
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:55,680
What is it this time, Luang?

567
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:57,760
What are you arresting us for?

568
00:46:58,143 --> 00:46:59,800
For the murder of a courtesan

569
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,640
and Sarang.

570
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,680
Your Highness,

571
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:12,320
I didn't do those wicked things.

572
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:13,920
Do you deny

573
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,880
ever ordering Khun Thantaborirak

574
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,480
to kill Sarang and that courtesan?

575
00:47:18,561 --> 00:47:21,040
How could I have killed Sarang?

576
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:24,800
He was in police custody.

577
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:26,880
And that courtesan?

578
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:29,440
I don't know anything.

579
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:33,680
You planned such evil deeds.

580
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:36,542
And yet you're still denying it?

581
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:40,160
Then, we need the witness' confirmation.

582
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,760
What trick are you pulling?

583
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,440
The law forbids

584
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,840
a Sampheng woman from serving as a witness.

585
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,200
Who said

586
00:48:33,392 --> 00:48:35,640
I'm here as a witness, sir?

587
00:48:36,855 --> 00:48:38,855
I'm one of the victims.

588
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,640
Tell me what happened that night.

589
00:48:43,727 --> 00:48:44,880
Yes, sir.

590
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:46,600
That night, I...

591
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,880
Your Highness?

592
00:48:54,624 --> 00:48:58,840
I heard Magnate Thong and the prison guard discussed

593
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:00,600
killing Sarang, Your Highness.

594
00:49:02,432 --> 00:49:07,200
They noticed that I was listening, so they went after me.

595
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,280
I outran him, Your Highness.

596
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:14,880
However, the one whom he mistakenly killed

597
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,040
was Lamjeak.

598
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,040
We both were wearing white swan masks

599
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,480
and the same costume, Your Highness.

600
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:28,560
Tis, you fool...

601
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,520
Are you admitting it now?

602
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,920
This is the word of a Sampheng woman.

603
00:49:37,472 --> 00:49:39,080
Do you believe that, Your Highness?

604
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,240
This woman

605
00:49:41,983 --> 00:49:43,983
hates and despises me.

606
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:45,920
She's falsely accusing me.

607
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,480
It's just as I thought.

608
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:49,520
Someone as cunning as you are

609
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,280
would lie with no shame.

610
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,200
If you deny this crime,

611
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:55,800
what about the other?

612
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,520
What is your defense?

613
00:50:24,545 --> 00:50:30,000
(Captain Henry Burney)

614
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:55,112
I'm still alive.

615
00:50:56,032 --> 00:50:57,360
How do you feel?

616
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:01,560
You used me as a tool

617
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,600
to spread rumors of European invasion.

618
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,560
You planned to kill me.

619
00:51:08,337 --> 00:51:09,520
It's time

620
00:51:10,288 --> 00:51:11,800
you get what you deserve!

621
00:51:16,495 --> 00:51:19,680
Your evil plan of killing Sarang to cause conflict and chaos

622
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,040
led you right into a trap.

623
00:52:19,582 --> 00:52:21,799
This is bad! Sarang is poisoned!

624
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:23,320
Come and open the door!

625
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,360
We found out about your evil scheme from Boonta.

626
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:36,440
So we saved Sarang in time

627
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:45,080
and sent him to Captain Henry.

628
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,560
Now that Sarang is alive,

629
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,120
the trade negotiation will proceed.

630
00:52:55,383 --> 00:52:58,040
There will be no war between us and the Europeans

631
00:52:58,192 --> 00:52:59,760
like you wanted.

632
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,920
The witness' statement

633
00:53:02,032 --> 00:53:03,600
has proven that you

634
00:53:04,032 --> 00:53:05,360
and your subordinate

635
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,440
are both guilty.

636
00:53:08,344 --> 00:53:10,520
You planned to kill Sarang

637
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,040
and cause chaos to the nation.

638
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,040
You also brutally murdered a courtesan.

639
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,640
This is punishable by the seizure of wealth

640
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:21,520
and death!

641
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:25,280
Lock them up until the day of execution!

642
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,440
There's a royal decree to seize our wealth

643
00:53:41,183 --> 00:53:43,520
and execute Magnate Thong, ma'am.

644
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:48,560
Execute?

645
00:53:49,249 --> 00:53:50,760
Yes, ma'am.

646
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,825
Master Gaysorn.

647
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,191
But...

648
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,040
But what else?

649
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,000
But Tis' trial

650
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,040
is not over, ma'am.

651
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:34,560
You conspired with him

652
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,440
to lure out Boonta for the kill.

653
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,000
Is that true?

654
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,960
I didn't know he was going to kill her.

655
00:54:42,736 --> 00:54:44,320
He used me as bait.

656
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,040
When I found out Nual was murdered,

657
00:54:46,152 --> 00:54:48,040
I feared I would be caught complicit.

658
00:54:48,296 --> 00:54:49,880
That's why I fled, Your Honor.

659
00:54:51,536 --> 00:54:53,880
Why did you plan to kill Boonta?

660
00:54:54,032 --> 00:54:55,520
I didn't know that the court

661
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,400
would take a drunken gambler's statement

662
00:54:59,014 --> 00:55:00,760
as testimony.

663
00:55:00,951 --> 00:55:02,280
Don't even try your wit.

664
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,360
I've investigated you.

665
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:06,840
You became a prison guard

666
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:09,000
because of Pra Thanasit's connections.

667
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:11,720
You used to work for Magnate Thong

668
00:55:11,966 --> 00:55:14,480
and Mrs. Gaysorn, his niece.

669
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:19,160
If you don't have a grudge against Boonta,

670
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,280
who ordered you to commit such a heinous crime?

671
00:55:25,688 --> 00:55:27,240
Just admit it.

672
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,360
San has admitted and confessed everything.

673
00:55:31,663 --> 00:55:33,000
Magnate Thong, your employer,

674
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:34,440
has been sentenced to death.

675
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,400
You will not escape justice.

676
00:55:47,863 --> 00:55:50,320
Are you so loyal that you would let yourself die

677
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,520
while the mastermind gets away?

678
00:56:07,784 --> 00:56:10,120
Master Gaysorn, Tis...

679
00:56:11,303 --> 00:56:12,760
Don't yell.

680
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:15,040
You're going to wake my daughter up.

681
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,440
If I had known this day would come,

682
00:56:42,351 --> 00:56:46,391
I wouldn't have let you marry Magnate Thong.

683
00:56:50,247 --> 00:56:52,160
All my life,

684
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:57,320
you have always been there for me.

685
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:01,800
I'm grateful for that, Muean.

686
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:46,080
If you arrest Master Gaysorn,

687
00:57:46,192 --> 00:57:48,080
arrest me too, sirs.

688
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,640
You're not involved.

689
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:52,576
I am, Master.

690
00:57:57,088 --> 00:57:59,200
I did everything.

691
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:02,160
I deliberately did everything for Master Gaysorn.

692
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:04,560
If she's guilty,

693
00:58:04,951 --> 00:58:06,720
I am guilty too, sirs.

694
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,520
Take them both in.

695
00:58:18,464 --> 00:58:20,600
I'm willing to be taken in custody, sir.

696
00:58:23,224 --> 00:58:25,640
There is but one request.

697
00:58:48,096 --> 00:58:51,480
My aunt was arrested as an accomplice in Boonta's attempted murder?

698
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:53,000
Chaai did such a thing.

699
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,480
How can our families remain friends?

700
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,160
You yourself

701
00:58:57,241 --> 00:59:01,360
have brought nothing but shame to our family too!

702
00:59:01,472 --> 00:59:04,560
Otherwise, we wouldn't have ended up together here!

703
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:07,000
With that mouth of yours, you deserve some punishment.

704
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:08,592
What's my punishment, huh?

705
00:59:12,535 --> 00:59:15,600
Twenty chang. Is this enough to change your mind?

706
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,000
No matter how much,

707
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:20,927
I can't break the promise I made to Captain Jon, sir.

708
00:59:21,104 --> 00:59:22,320
Unless

709
00:59:22,487 --> 00:59:23,800
Captain Jon himself

710
00:59:24,078 --> 00:59:27,920
willingly gives you the right to Boonta, sir.
