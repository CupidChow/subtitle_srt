1
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,063
Lamduan!

2
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:32,480
Are you suspecting Fang?

3
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,360
Fang had ordered Ming

4
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
to lock Lamduan inside for me.

5
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:39,560
After that, Mother went straight home, sir.

6
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,360
In the middle of the night?

7
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:43,800
- Yes, sir. - What happened to your face?

8
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,120
I'll find evidence

9
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,127
to prove that Fang had Lamduan killed.

10
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,560
She's just cruel, but she can't order a kill.

11
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,480
Otherwise, Ming would have killed you by now.

12
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,615
It's just a dead courtesan.

13
00:02:57,807 --> 00:02:59,400
Why would you care?

14
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:00,800
My duty

15
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:02,903
is to protect all the people.

16
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,680
Luang, sir!

17
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:31,320
I found out something, sir.

18
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
That night,

19
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,880
Ming didn't go to Khlong Ma Hon.

20
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:37,200
He took a boat to Phra Pradaeng, sir.

21
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:25,480
Ming!

22
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:26,912
Get him!

23
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:38,600
Move!

24
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,760
Hey! Get him! Quick!

25
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:21,440
You won't go down, huh?

26
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:29,560
Yeah!

27
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:31,929
- What was that? - Go, Ming!

28
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:35,304
Ming! I'm here to help you, but you left me?

29
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,840
Why were you so reckless?

30
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,095
I was just following Ming.

31
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:13,560
Who would have thought someone else was after him?

32
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:17,200
Ming!

33
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,240
Search the place!

34
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:49,543
Stop! Stop right now!

35
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:52,680
If you don't stop, I'm going to tell the police.

36
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:56,120
Good! I'll have your man arrested

37
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,600
for kidnapping my daughter!

38
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:05,440
Did you really do that?

39
00:08:05,904 --> 00:08:07,400
I didn't kidnap her, sir.

40
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,720
Liar!

41
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,200
I left no stone unturned.

42
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:13,280
That's why I found out you're working at Fang's.

43
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,912
Then I followed you here. Where did you take my daughter?

44
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,840
I don't know.

45
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,231
This is my daughter's ring.

46
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,920
Are you still denying it?

47
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
All he does is live off of women's money.

48
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:31,320
He's bound to steal and kidnap.

49
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,200
He took my daughter.

50
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:34,960
He stole her ring and sold it.

51
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,960
Please put him in jail, Luang.

52
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:38,600
What exactly did he do?

53
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,480
Did he kidnap her, or did she elope with him?

54
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:43,680
What difference does it make?

55
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,240
If he kidnapped her, it was against her will.

56
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:51,680
If she had eloped with him, it might not have been so.

57
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,831
He stole her ring and sold it.

58
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:57,200
If your daughter had eloped with him and was in love with him,

59
00:08:58,463 --> 00:09:01,720
she could have given him the ring herself, is that right?

60
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,280
Ming wasn't put in jail due to lack of evidence?

61
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,860
Ming insisted he didn't kidnap his daughter.

62
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:20,440
A golden ring being found didn't mean he stole it.

63
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:23,831
If his daughter had been in love with Ming

64
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,767
and had eloped with him on her own,

65
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,720
Ming would have been acquitted.

66
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:31,320
That Luang understands a person in love.

67
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,360
He's like a saint.

68
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:38,446
This is like Ming dying and being reborn.

69
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
- Is it really that great, Aunt? - Yeah!

70
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:45,400
Luang is good with this. Luang does well with that.

71
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:47,000
Are you his "FC?"

72
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,600
"FC?"

73
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,840
It means a fan club.

74
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,240
They owe the police just because he didn't make an arrest?

75
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,760
The police have to investigate the facts before making an arrest anyway.

76
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,240
It's only right.

77
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:03,783
If he gets put in jail today,

78
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:06,360
he will be tortured into confession.

79
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:09,560
Or he would need to borrow a lot of money from Mother

80
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,960
to defend himself.

81
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:12,640
You should know.

82
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:15,080
For us, jail is Hell.

83
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,720
Just like your mother's case.

84
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:18,560
All you're doing is talking about me!

85
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,520
Have you finished cooking?

86
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,688
Eat up and go to work!

87
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,335
Do you want to get flogged or what?

88
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:52,160
(Episode 4: Detective Nittra And a Troublemaker Pimp)

89
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:06,120
It's here, sir.

90
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:08,800
Here's a great booze.

91
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,000
And here's your snacks.

92
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:13,720
Where are you going?

93
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:17,120
Stay and pour me some drinks.

94
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:19,320
- I... Ah! - Where are you going?

95
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,880
Sir.

96
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,520
Let Boonta go, please.

97
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,280
Mother puts her on kitchen duty. I'll serve you myself.

98
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:29,320
Please sit down.

99
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
- Pour me some. - Yes, sir.

100
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:36,240
Yes, sir.

101
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,840
Why didn't Ming stop them?

102
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,440
Plang and I are in love.

103
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Her father didn't approve.

104
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:03,320
He can't accept my work.

105
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
When he found out that Plang

106
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,240
was pregnant with me,

107
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,000
he forced her

108
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:10,640
to marry someone else.

109
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
My child

110
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,879
will be given to someone else.

111
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,120
That night,

112
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,160
I had to take my family away.

113
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:32,200
Plang, go and wait in the boat. Go!

114
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:47,280
Catch him! Ming, you cur!

115
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,280
- Go! - Ming, you cur!

116
00:13:57,424 --> 00:13:58,960
Where are you taking my daughter?

117
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:06,335
Go!

118
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,560
After him!

119
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,080
Ming!

120
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:21,520
I lied about going home to Khlong Ma Hon

121
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:24,480
because if Luang found a witness in Phra Pradaeng,

122
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:25,960
and I got found out,

123
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,720
her father would take my family away.

124
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:33,440
But,

125
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:37,280
a prostitute and a pimp

126
00:14:37,768 --> 00:14:39,680
are stigmatized the same way.

127
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,000
If her father didn't approve, why didn't you just quit this job?

128
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,760
I survived this far because of Mother Fang.

129
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,160
My mother died of an illness.

130
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,841
My father is a drunk gambler.

131
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,000
I was working as a rice carrier,

132
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:59,360
but I got screwed and almost got in jail.

133
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:02,415
Mother Fang helped me out,

134
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:05,648
so my father sold me to her.

135
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:09,415
Mother Fang favors me.

136
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:11,960
She finds a job for me.

137
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,480
But you're actually her right-hand man,

138
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:18,240
you should be rich.

139
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:22,880
I had my debt too.

140
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,000
I tried to save up and pay her dowry, but it was too late.

141
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:30,040
When I took my wife with me,

142
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,400
I spent my savings to hire a boat.

143
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,887
She gave me that ring to sell

144
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,680
and buy food and medicine for my child.

145
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:41,840
But I got caught.

146
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:52,840
So you're confirming you have nothing to do with Lamduan's death.

147
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,120
Of course not!

148
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,920
I can swear I never killed anyone.

149
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,840
I have a wife and child to take care of.

150
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,440
I won't risk getting put in jail.

151
00:16:05,952 --> 00:16:09,400
You're all talk. You can't really kill anyone.

152
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:12,360
Was that an indirect insult?

153
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:14,615
Not indirect. It was direct.

154
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:19,080
- Hey! - So what would you do with your family?

155
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,640
What are you two doing here?

156
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:36,720
Yeah. I...

157
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:41,520
I told Boonta to get some banana leaves.

158
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:46,160
I'm making sweets for you to give to the monks tomorrow.

159
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,520
So, were you helping her cut off banana leaves?

160
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,560
Yes, Mother.

161
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,240
If I had to do it alone,

162
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,640
I wouldn't have gathered enough by tomorrow.

163
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,080
Yeah, that's true.

164
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:10,880
You were calling for me. How can I help you?

165
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,376
Bring me tea.

166
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:16,864
Yes.

167
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:36,760
Ming.

168
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,391
I'm helping you out.

169
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:40,216
You owe me a favor.

170
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
Mother.

171
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,640
I told Mun to prepare the boat.

172
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,360
Are you heading to the temple?

173
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:07,280
I'm not going to the temple today.

174
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,560
You're not making merit today?

175
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,400
Where are you going?

176
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,240
I've made enough merits. It should be fine to commit a sin.

177
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:18,120
Stay here and watch the place. Don't follow me.

178
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:20,200
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:47,472
No...

180
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:00,400
Oh? That's Mother.

181
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:35,080
Luang?

182
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:36,600
Yod.

183
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:39,280
Why are you here, sir?

184
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,840
We have been following you from Fang's brothel.

185
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,000
What about you?

186
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,120
You're being sneaky. Who are you following?

187
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,103
Luang.

188
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:02,240
Are you a police or a "CCTV" at Fang's brothel?

189
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,240
You keep watch 24/7.

190
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,160
"CC..."

191
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:12,200
- "T..." - "V," sir.

192
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:14,240
Yeah, that's right.

193
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,800
"CCTV."

194
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:17,600
It's a closed-circuit camera.

195
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,680
It's for security, sir.

196
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,280
I watch for security at every place all the same.

197
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:30,487
But this is too close, sir.

198
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,680
How is it close?

199
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:39,120
The people are looking at us, sir.

200
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:51,960
Yeah.

201
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,320
If you don't want me to do this,

202
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,960
you should stop being reckless.

203
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:00,720
Luang.

204
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:04,800
I have no one to rely on but myself.

205
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,080
So you followed Fang yourself?

206
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:10,280
Do you really suspect Fang did it?

207
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:13,880
Lamduan's body is proof.

208
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,400
Only someone cruel could have done that, sir.

209
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,080
That's Ming's wife's father.

210
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,655
Could it be

211
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:35,480
Fang is telling him about Plang?

212
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,360
Now her father knows!

213
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,160
Here's your medicine.

214
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:55,815
Ming!

215
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,200
This is bad!

216
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,000
Which way?

217
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:11,120
So you really took my daughter here.

218
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Get him!

219
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,120
Stop, sir! Please!

220
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,360
Stop! Don't take my family!

221
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,319
- Stop, sir! Please! - No...

222
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,376
No! Don't!

223
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,560
Stop, sir! Stop!

224
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:34,200
Stop! Please don't take my family!

225
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:38,400
Father, don't hurt Ming, please!

226
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
Please don't take my family.

227
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,840
I'll do anything.

228
00:22:55,296 --> 00:22:57,000
You can hand me to the police.

229
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,760
You can flog me for all I care.

230
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:02,951
Just don't marry my wife off to someone else.

231
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,040
Don't give my child away to someone else.

232
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:09,760
Everyone loves their family, sir!

233
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:11,880
You love your own daughter too!

234
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,920
You're taking her back? Have you asked her if she wanted to go?

235
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,120
Who said I'd marry Plang off?

236
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
And give her to someone else?

237
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,480
I'm just taking her back temporarily

238
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:27,520
until you have money to pay her dowry the right way!

239
00:23:30,362 --> 00:23:32,040
You're not

240
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,160
tearing a family apart,

241
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:36,920
sir?

242
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,840
I was just showing him

243
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:51,360
how much Ming and his wife were in love.

244
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,160
Yet you almost ruined it.

245
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:59,600
I'll pay you for the damage

246
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,040
if you allow your daughter to live with Ming.

247
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,520
So you really took my daughter to your place?

248
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,840
I won't allow my daughter to marry him.

249
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,600
He can't even take care of himself.

250
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,200
Yet he wants to start a family.

251
00:24:12,648 --> 00:24:14,216
If he has to sell his wife's ring to get by,

252
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,840
how can he take care of anyone?

253
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:17,760
He's trying to save up.

254
00:24:17,895 --> 00:24:20,032
He works a job with no honor.

255
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:23,120
He can't be the pride of your family.

256
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:25,520
But he loves his wife and child.

257
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:27,371
He doesn't have a mistress

258
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:31,135
and doesn't neglect his wife like other men who visit my place.

259
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,520
Can someone like him

260
00:24:35,662 --> 00:24:36,919
genuinely love a woman?

261
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:41,520
Then I'll let you see with your own eyes.

262
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,160
Your image of a generous woman doesn't exclude you from the suspect list.

263
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:51,560
Ming has an alibi that night, so he didn't kill Lamduan.

264
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:53,120
He's been excluded.

265
00:24:53,654 --> 00:24:55,000
But for everyone else,

266
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:56,600
we have to investigate further.

267
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Do you work for the police force

268
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:03,240
or my Courtesan House, sir?

269
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,146
Is that why you've been following Boonta?

270
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Fang, you dare insult me?

271
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:11,040
Alright. I understand you're doing your job.

272
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,480
But you! How dare you stalk me?

273
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,839
Oh? If you didn't do anything,

274
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:18,200
why would you be afraid?

275
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:21,860
Don't think I can't hurt you because I sold you.

276
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,816
You're only paid for with one chang of deposit.

277
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,480
I can change my mind and sell you to someone else.

278
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,000
How could you do that?

279
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,040
Are you breaching a contract?

280
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:31,432
If you don't want me to do that,

281
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:32,999
learn to behave.

282
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:34,800
You're still my property as of now.

283
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,360
Remember that!

284
00:25:54,896 --> 00:25:56,360
I thought Boom was mean.

285
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,280
Mother Fang is way meaner.

286
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:00,920
She can sell me one minute and change her mind the next.

287
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
Do I have a choice?

288
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,720
What do I have to do? Where can I complain?

289
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,600
I was just ranting, sir.

290
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:17,240
I know I'm one of Mother's properties.

291
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,920
You have no right to help me if it's not your duty.

292
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,360
And we're not related in any way.

293
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:29,360
- I'm just... - "A girlfriend?"

294
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:35,000
Someone who comes with you.

295
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
I'm with you at the moment, aren't I?

296
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,720
You're right, sir.

297
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,760
But it's not the meaning of that word.

298
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,960
So what is it?

299
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:50,840
It's...

300
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:54,280
I'll explain later.

301
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,720
Right now, I need to get myself out of this.

302
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,400
Ming fought for love.

303
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,320
I have to fight for myself.

304
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,000
If the contract can be altered,

305
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
I'll make money and buy my own freedom.

306
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,120
As for you,

307
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:14,080
you should spend your time following me

308
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,048
to work on the case instead, shouldn't you?

309
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,640
We haven't caught the killer.

310
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,880
Don't go anywhere alone for now.

311
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:31,000
You just don't want to deal with my corpse, right?

312
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,040
I care.

313
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:50,400
What was that?

314
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,295
Are you crazy?

315
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:57,320
How could you say that?

316
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,200
(Ming fought for love.)

317
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,320
(I have to fight for myself.)

318
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,240
(If the contract can be altered, )

319
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,280
(I'll make money and buy my own freedom.)

320
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:04,160
Even people who work at a courtesan house

321
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:08,560
can fight for their love.

322
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,120
I'm here to buy Boonta back.

323
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,360
You sold her.

324
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,463
Why would you want to buy her back?

325
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,760
The people are looking at us, sir.

326
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,360
I saw her living a hard life at the market.

327
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,880
I felt sorry for her.

328
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,080
I can take care of her better.

329
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:44,000
That's why I want to buy her back.

330
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,840
And your wife would sell her back here again?

331
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:51,895
This time, I'll find a new place for her.

332
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:54,080
I'll take good care of her.

333
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,440
It's a shame. Boonta would have made a fine mistress,

334
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:02,960
but I already sold her.

335
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:05,080
You sold her? To whom?

336
00:30:05,488 --> 00:30:07,280
To Captain Jon.

337
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,800
But he only paid a deposit.

338
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:13,080
If you're willing to outbid him,

339
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,960
I'll sell you to her.

340
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:17,480
How much?

341
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,920
Ten chang, sir.

342
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:35,680
Why is our profit

343
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,560
so little this month?

344
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:40,400
Two of our ships sank, so there was a lack of supply, sir.

345
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,760
If that's the case,

346
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
how would I find ten chang to pay?

347
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:48,440
What are you paying that amount for?

348
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,280
For a new batch of products.

349
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,520
What I invested has been sunk.

350
00:30:55,911 --> 00:30:57,680
I thought you were

351
00:30:57,999 --> 00:31:00,280
buying a slave woman off.

352
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,960
Our business is suffering loss. Do you think I'd spend money carelessly?

353
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,640
If you can't help, don't make it worse.

354
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,640
I'm stressed enough as it is.

355
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:25,360
Magnate visited Fang's and asked to buy Boonta, ma'am.

356
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:40,960
My assignment to you

357
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,133
is to be done as soon as possible.

358
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,520
Yes, ma'am.

359
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:53,000
It's alright, Chor.

360
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:55,600
Lamduan is at peace now.

361
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,600
That's right.

362
00:31:58,681 --> 00:32:01,120
It's the living like us that's still suffering.

363
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:03,120
We still have to work hard.

364
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,400
I worked hard every day for her.

365
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,280
I know

366
00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:16,440
that Lamduan was different from me.

367
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:21,840
She would only find trouble here.

368
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,280
But when she suddenly died,

369
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:33,480
my life was meaningless.

370
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,240
You loved your sister so much.

371
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,800
She's the only one I had.

372
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,400
Now that she's gone,

373
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,360
I don't know what to make money for.

374
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,680
For yourself.

375
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,600
I don't have a sister,

376
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,840
and I love myself so much.

377
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:02,880
So I don't really know how you feel.

378
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,800
The only thing I know is when you lose something,

379
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,695
you'll see what's important.

380
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,032
Lamduan used to be so important to you,

381
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,840
but now

382
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,840
Lamduan's gone.

383
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,000
You are important too.

384
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,400
Everyone!

385
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:32,200
The cloth seller is here!

386
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:39,336
Chor.

387
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:41,800
If you don't know what to spend your money on,

388
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,800
I know.

389
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,240
What we sell is our face and body, we have to stay beautiful.

390
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,920
You've worked hard and earned money. Buy yourself some happiness.

391
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,160
Money doesn't just buy happiness.

392
00:33:57,264 --> 00:33:59,080
It also buys beauty.

393
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,271
- Really? - Yeah.

394
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:03,760
Come on. I'll help you pick.

395
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,200
I don't know the color of the day they wear in the palace. All I know is

396
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,360
I like matching colors like these.

397
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:11,480
See? They're...

398
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:14,400
- So pick ones that match, right? - That's right.

399
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,754
This sash's color is called reddish orange.

400
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:19,560
The robe is in moonlight color.

401
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:25,052
If you want contrasting colors but not too bright, get this.

402
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:27,169
This is good too. Purple.

403
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:28,413
This color is good.

404
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:31,040
- It's cute. - This color is called lotus purple.

405
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:33,488
The robe's color is Prapassorn yellow.

406
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:35,120
What a nice name.

407
00:34:35,662 --> 00:34:37,120
You like it? I do.

408
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:41,080
Now that Lamjeak's here. If you like it bright, this!

409
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:43,080
These two colors.

410
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,840
- These are great! - The sash is ruby red.

411
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:48,599
The robe is corn husk green.

412
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:51,720
- It's so pretty. - This is beautiful, Boonta. I love it.

413
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,257
This would look good on you.

414
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:55,880
The last time you visited my store,

415
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,040
the clothes you paired

416
00:34:58,175 --> 00:35:00,000
sold out so fast.

417
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:01,840
I came here today

418
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
to talk to you too.

419
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:06,040
I have new arrivals in my store,

420
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:09,480
so I would like you to match colors for me.

421
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:13,200
The colors that you match are pretty.

422
00:35:13,336 --> 00:35:14,800
Everyone loves them.

423
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:17,760
If you agree,

424
00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:20,880
I will compensate you

425
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,600
- for your trouble. - Really, sir?

426
00:35:27,856 --> 00:35:32,400
Nual's buying clothes! This is highly unusual.

427
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,432
I bought these for the day my husband comes back.

428
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:43,200
She loves him so much.

429
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:50,176
My face...

430
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:54,440
Selling stuff at the market is the same as a booth in an "event."

431
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,070
Evan?

432
00:35:57,799 --> 00:35:59,520
- Evan? - "Event."

433
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:01,680
"Even."

434
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,800
"Event."

435
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,520
"Event."

436
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
You spit.

437
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,920
You're lucky, Boonta.

438
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:12,600
You don't serve a guest, but you get another job.

439
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:17,600
The cloth seller is a kind man. He doesn't mind a woman like us.

440
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:21,680
He sells clothes to courtesans from several houses. He also accepts credit.

441
00:36:23,255 --> 00:36:26,040
These days, Mother is busy with her family. She's not here often.

442
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:28,800
This is your chance. Be careful, though.

443
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:32,920
I'll work hard and save up a lot of money.

444
00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:36,120
I promise the clothing store

445
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:38,247
will be the store with

446
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,200
the most beautiful seller.

447
00:36:43,752 --> 00:36:45,000
By the way, Lamjeak.

448
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,680
If my face is this bad,

449
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:50,080
do you have a good skincare?

450
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:03,520
- Aunt! - Goodness!

451
00:37:04,803 --> 00:37:06,696
Why did you yell?

452
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:10,160
I would like the water after you wash the rice.

453
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:13,720
What would you do with it?

454
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,160
I would wash my face with it.

455
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,800
Lamjeak told me it's good for the skin.

456
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:22,400
It reduces wrinkles

457
00:37:22,512 --> 00:37:25,040
and makes the skin smooth.

458
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,320
When you're done, let me have the water.

459
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,960
Hey, what are you doing?

460
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,759
Making facial powder.

461
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,400
- Facial powder? - Yeah.

462
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,280
It's that Luang Took Rats.

463
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:48,840
He broke the powder Magnate bought me.

464
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:51,280
Fortunately, Lamjeak told me

465
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:56,120
I could use Marvel of Peru seeds from where we do laundry.

466
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:57,680
Just crush it into powder.

467
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,560
That's why I have to do this myself.

468
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:01,320
Oh my.

469
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:03,880
Why don't you just buy some Chinese powder?

470
00:38:05,135 --> 00:38:07,200
I have no money, Aunt!

471
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:11,000
Ugh!

472
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,680
What are you doing this time?

473
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:25,880
Answer me. What are you doing?

474
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,320
It's for my brows, Aunts.

475
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:34,560
See?

476
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:41,560
I didn't think makeup would be this hard.

477
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:45,406
Before this, I just visited a "clinic." In a flash,

478
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:47,463
my whole body looks good.

479
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:53,120
Kedsurang sits still, and people put on her makeup.

480
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,400
Why is Nittra having it so hard?

481
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,160
Could it be

482
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,440
my merit is less than Kedsurang's?

483
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:10,000
It's kind of cute.

484
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,040
Why are they cracking so much?

485
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:39,760
My face is good.

486
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:42,280
My feet have to be good too, right?

487
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:02,120
Sugar?

488
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:06,883
Salt too. It's salty.

489
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,440
Sugar.

490
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,640
Coconut oil.

491
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,840
Coconut oil and sugar.

492
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:40,520
I'm ready.

493
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:49,840
My face is good now.

494
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,967
My feet have to be good too.

495
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,400
I'm glad

496
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:56,000
Granny taught me this.

497
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:03,760
Boonta!

498
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:10,960
I know your family used to sell sugar,

499
00:42:11,056 --> 00:42:13,720
but did your mother teach you to use sugar to wash your feet?

500
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:17,640
What's the ruckus, Pudsorn?

501
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,840
It's Boonta! She's washing her feet with sugar!

502
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,280
Wait!

503
00:42:26,215 --> 00:42:27,400
Boonta.

504
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:36,760
Darn you! Do you know it's expensive?

505
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,840
Is it that expensive, Aunt?

506
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:42,640
It's fine. I'll work and buy it back.

507
00:42:42,744 --> 00:42:44,040
Oh?

508
00:42:44,512 --> 00:42:47,400
Sugar costs ten baht for 60 kilos.

509
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,240
Ten baht?

510
00:42:50,847 --> 00:42:52,120
It's nothing.

511
00:42:54,236 --> 00:42:55,320
Ten baht

512
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,280
is what a courtesan makes sleeping with a guest 80 times!

513
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:02,000
- Darn me! - You're screwed!

514
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,560
This is bad.

515
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,320
You're trying so hard to look pretty.

516
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,520
Are you selling clothes or looking for a man?

517
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,120
If I sell clothes and also get a man for myself,

518
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:19,920
won't you die of jealousy, Pudsorn?

519
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:24,280
Then again, you can compete with beauty,

520
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,080
but when it comes to merit and fortune,

521
00:43:26,328 --> 00:43:27,960
you just can't compete with me.

522
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,400
I'm sorry. I happen to have a good "taste" and got this job.

523
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,240
Don't tase me!

524
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:37,440
It's "taste!"

525
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:39,080
Not tase!

526
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,560
I'll tell Mother you sneak off to work somewhere else!

527
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:48,360
Wait, Pudsa! I mean Pudsorn!

528
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:53,880
- No! Boonta! - You can't let me have good things, huh? Jealous much?

529
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:56,753
Boonta, let me go right now! Let go!

530
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,280
Boonta, stop!

531
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:03,120
- Aunt! - Stop them!

532
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:07,755
Let go! She's going to bite my ear!

533
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:12,240
- No! Help! - This way!

534
00:44:12,376 --> 00:44:15,600
- Get her off! - Let me go!

535
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,880
You're going to get it!

536
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,080
Wait! Calm down.

537
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,160
- Let go! - Come on!

538
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,640
- Boonta! - Calm down!

539
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,560
What's going on with you two?

540
00:44:25,777 --> 00:44:26,920
What else could it be?

541
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:31,360
Pudsorn is going to tell Mother about Boonta selling clothes.

542
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:34,628
- That's right. - Just talk it out. We're stuck together anyway.

543
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:37,160
- That's right. - Have some sympathy, Pudsorn.

544
00:44:37,272 --> 00:44:39,960
Boonta doesn't serve a guest. She doesn't have money like us.

545
00:44:40,088 --> 00:44:42,920
If you want to beat me, let's have a challenge.

546
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,160
The loser must do anything the winner says.

547
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
Are you up for it?

548
00:44:50,406 --> 00:44:52,320
What's the challenge, Boonta?

549
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,600
Rock, paper, scissors!

550
00:45:02,706 --> 00:45:07,200
Jeez, Boonta! What the heck is your challenge? Why is it so painful?

551
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,566
Don't be a sore loser, Pudsa.

552
00:45:09,681 --> 00:45:10,840
It's Pudsorn!

553
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:13,088
The first to hit the other's head three times

554
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:14,800
is the winner, right?

555
00:45:14,944 --> 00:45:16,480
That's right.

556
00:45:16,856 --> 00:45:20,040
Rock, Paper, Scissors is too mediocre.

557
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,799
It's more fun to get physical.

558
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:27,200
If you want to win, move your hands as quick as your mouth, Pudsorn.

559
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,960
You witch! You won once and you're bragging already?

560
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,520
The next turn is mine.

561
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:37,240
I'll see if you're as good as your mouth.

562
00:45:37,774 --> 00:45:39,590
Rock, paper, scissors!

563
00:45:41,286 --> 00:45:43,720
- Whoa! Hey! - Boonta!

564
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,560
Easy. You're ruining my basket. I need it!

565
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,169
Rock, paper, scissors!

566
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,280
Gotcha.

567
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:01,760
- Fine! - Boonta's on two.

568
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:04,120
Oh, you're about to lose.

569
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:06,360
This is it!

570
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:09,160
Rock, paper, scissors!

571
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:13,360
- Ah! - Boonta's got three first. She wins.

572
00:46:16,882 --> 00:46:18,480
I won.

573
00:46:18,656 --> 00:46:21,280
You must not tell Mother about me selling clothes.

574
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,120
And about the sugar too.

575
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,840
Prostitutes keep their word!

576
00:46:30,435 --> 00:46:32,428
We all must not tell her too, right?

577
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:33,840
Of course, Aunt.

578
00:46:34,556 --> 00:46:36,400
Keep your mouths shut.

579
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,160
Ming. I'm selling clothes at the Indian store. Bye.

580
00:46:45,279 --> 00:46:46,480
Boonta!

581
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,759
How could you do that?

582
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,880
- If Mother finds out... - Don't let her know!

583
00:46:50,502 --> 00:46:53,320
Don't forget, Ming. You owe me a favor.

584
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,680
Come on. I'll be back before we open.

585
00:46:59,175 --> 00:47:01,760
You have to help me not to get caught.

586
00:47:02,615 --> 00:47:03,860
Bye.

587
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,360
Ming.

588
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:08,960
Who did you talk to?

589
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,200
Yes, ma'am.

590
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:12,960
It was

591
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:15,640
Lamjeak, ma'am.

592
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:18,680
She just finished her chores. What do you need?

593
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:21,320
I thought you were talking to Boonta.

594
00:47:21,762 --> 00:47:23,720
Do you know where she is?

595
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:26,800
I don't, ma'am.

596
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,280
I haven't seen her this morning.

597
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,920
Boonta. Boonta...

598
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:43,720
Have you seen Boonta?

599
00:47:44,024 --> 00:47:45,360
I haven't, ma'am.

600
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,863
Have you seen Boonta, Lamjeak?

601
00:48:01,788 --> 00:48:05,055
I haven't, ma'am. I've been here alone. I don't know where she went.

602
00:48:10,256 --> 00:48:12,600
Has anyone seen Boonta?

603
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:19,840
Have you seen her, Pudsorn?

604
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:29,039
I haven't, Mother.

605
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:43,600
Listen. Is Boonta here or not?

606
00:48:43,776 --> 00:48:46,080
Oh? She's not, ma'am.

607
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,800
What do you want from her?

608
00:48:48,936 --> 00:48:51,600
I'm going to visit my mother, but I'll stop by at the market.

609
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,200
Since she's doing nothing. I'll take her to carry my stuff.

610
00:48:54,655 --> 00:48:56,360
Where the heck is she?

611
00:49:04,872 --> 00:49:07,680
(Fellow women, let's get pretty.)

612
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:09,720
(All around the town.)

613
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,539
(Come on this way. The seller is kind.)

614
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,280
(And pretty.)

615
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,288
(Each take one of these clothes.)

616
00:49:17,408 --> 00:49:19,640
(Don't hesitate.)

617
00:49:19,962 --> 00:49:25,724
(Our clothes are quality. Ain't no itchy. I'll share some "information.")

618
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:30,359
(Monday is a gentle day.)

619
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,160
(Light blue sash.)

620
00:49:32,808 --> 00:49:35,840
(Tuesday is betel and light green or vice versa.)

621
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,943
(Beauty changes modes.)

622
00:49:38,024 --> 00:49:42,120
(Wednesday, earth-ish green and Champak yellow.)

623
00:49:42,668 --> 00:49:46,919
(Thursday, orange and light green is easy on the eyes.)

624
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:50,240
(Friday, light blue and moonlight.)

625
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,659
(People will see your delight.)

626
00:49:52,746 --> 00:49:57,895
(Saturday, mariam plum seed purple and light green. Be seductive!)

627
00:49:57,976 --> 00:50:00,200
(Sunday, let's get rid of bad luck.)

628
00:50:00,296 --> 00:50:02,440
(Dark green and earth-ish red are the colors.)

629
00:50:02,528 --> 00:50:06,148
(Come on, everyone. Don't go away. These will catch your eyes.)

630
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:08,233
(Like you're under a spell)

631
00:50:08,968 --> 00:50:10,880
(Yeah.)

632
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,640
(People in the palace don't dress randomly. Dress for divine protection.)

633
00:50:17,736 --> 00:50:20,752
(I'm just a commoner, not rich, not glamour.)

634
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:23,600
(I can wear whatever I want. Yo!)

635
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:26,048
(Yeah.)

636
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:32,487
(Oh, calm down. Don't fight over clothes. You can choose slowly.)

637
00:50:32,568 --> 00:50:34,800
(Don't you work at Fang's brothel?)

638
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:37,318
(How can you be here to sell clothes?)

639
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:39,825
(I'm here for a "part-time" job, "you know?")

640
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,480
(I'm working hard to free myself. What would you like?)

641
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:47,485
(Just tell me. I'll help out and get you some.)

642
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:54,800
(I'll have everything the models wear.)

643
00:50:57,079 --> 00:50:59,520
(So you want five pieces?)

644
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,000
("Let's go.")

645
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:11,527
Boonta is saving up to buy her freedom.

646
00:51:11,656 --> 00:51:14,000
She's working for the Indian owner's clothing store.

647
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,600
How much does she earn?

648
00:51:18,687 --> 00:51:19,800
I don't know, sir.

649
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:21,680
The Indian is a kind man.

650
00:51:21,887 --> 00:51:25,480
If they sell well, she would earn a fair share, sir.

651
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,254
This one. Can it be worn on both sides?

652
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:34,160
No, it's one-sided.

653
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,760
If they sell well,

654
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:39,520
she would earn a fair share, huh?

655
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,120
Thank you, and don't tell anyone.

656
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,880
- Yod. I think... - I think

657
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,600
this should be all for today.

658
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,920
You almost bought out the whole stock.

659
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,151
What are you going to do with these clothes?

660
00:52:25,136 --> 00:52:28,360
I have never seen anyone pair these colors, Chaai.

661
00:52:28,823 --> 00:52:30,440
It's unique.

662
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,680
If you like it,

663
00:52:34,032 --> 00:52:35,600
I'll buy more.

664
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,400
If you're not my brother, who I know well,

665
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:45,480
I would suspect you of having a crush on my wife.

666
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:47,640
I gave Pad some clothes

667
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,119
because they are nice

668
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,640
and I bought too many. That's all.

669
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:52,520
Don't suspect me, Chim.

670
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:57,360
Why did you buy so many clothes, Chaai?

671
00:52:58,111 --> 00:53:00,400
That's right. Could it be

672
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:03,400
you're trying to hit on a clothes seller?

673
00:53:32,936 --> 00:53:34,440
Why are you so late?

674
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,120
I ran out of excuses for you.

675
00:53:38,664 --> 00:53:40,400
You helped me out once,

676
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:42,480
but I helped you time and time again.

677
00:53:42,624 --> 00:53:43,840
It's not worth it.

678
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:50,400
Help me again tomorrow.

679
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:53,680
Boonta, you're going again?

680
00:54:00,535 --> 00:54:05,280
Come on.

681
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:07,058
Look. I have something to tell you.

682
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,040
Yesterday... I don't want to brag. You see?

683
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,495
We sold 20 yellow sashes!

684
00:54:13,576 --> 00:54:16,720
- Twenty? - Yes. It sold so well, but today,

685
00:54:16,832 --> 00:54:18,920
we're going blue.

686
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,600
Light blue. Let's start with the first one.

687
00:54:21,768 --> 00:54:24,040
This sash is in light blue.

688
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,799
It's called sky blue.

689
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,480
Sky blue. It makes your skin glow. You'll look like a noble or a royalty.

690
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,800
That's not all.

691
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,840
Today, we have a green robe too.

692
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:38,760
- Earth-ish green. - No. It's outdated.

693
00:54:38,872 --> 00:54:41,504
It's lucky green! This brings you luck.

694
00:54:41,638 --> 00:54:47,454
You'll look rich and noble. It would be a mistake not to "F" this one.

695
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:49,320
Those who want to "F,"

696
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,519
please raise your hand and say "F!"

697
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:55,680
- "Eh?" - Me! Me too!

698
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,303
- I "eh." - Me too!

699
00:54:58,401 --> 00:55:00,252
"Eh." Me too.

700
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,359
You "F?" Okay. We've got three.

701
00:55:02,447 --> 00:55:04,320
- Me too. - That's another "F."

702
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,080
What's your name? The one in pink.

703
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,679
- It's Pad. - Pad.

704
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,969
- The one in yellow. - Ploy.

705
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,319
Is she speaking some European words?

706
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,840
Does anybody else want this "set?"

707
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:17,240
One, two...

708
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,560
Three. Time's up. Next item. It's blue!

709
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,680
Ta-da! Hmm!

710
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:28,400
- Shall we go? - No more? Then next. You missed it.

711
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:32,040
Look. This blue one...

712
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,920
I just found out people are vying to buy clothes.

713
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,560
I'm glad you like them.

714
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:44,400
It's worth sneaking you out now.

715
00:55:51,672 --> 00:55:53,640
Who is that woman, by the way?

716
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:56,280
She matches clothes uniquely well.

717
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,120
She speaks some strange words,

718
00:55:58,264 --> 00:56:01,880
but she's good at selling. She brings joy to the place.

719
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:09,360
She's Bua's daughter. Her family sold sugar.

720
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,240
She was sold to work as a courtesan at Fang's brothel.

721
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,600
I heard our servants talking about

722
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:24,040
you bringing a woman home. Was that true?

723
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,000
So that was it.

724
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,520
That's why she looks outstanding.

725
00:56:33,744 --> 00:56:35,833
It's a pity.

726
00:56:36,423 --> 00:56:39,600
If that incident hadn't happened, she wouldn't have been working so hard.

727
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:56,591
She's selling clothes at the Indian owner's in the market, ma'am.

728
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,080
I don't know what trick she uses, but they sell so well.

729
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:04,840
When I left, if I wasn't seeing things, Master Chaai was there too.

730
00:57:05,176 --> 00:57:08,320
Chaai brought Pad to buy clothes from her?

731
00:57:08,496 --> 00:57:11,480
I can't let Chaai and that Sampheng woman

732
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,600
keep seeing each other like this.

733
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:16,551
I have to do something now.

734
00:57:32,256 --> 00:57:33,800
He looks handsome,

735
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:36,720
but his teeth are black with betel. I don't like it.

736
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,920
Please help me! I'm getting robbed!

737
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,440
They're robbing people at the market?

738
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,318
Young Miss, don't smile yet. You're going to blow your cover.

739
00:57:57,072 --> 00:57:58,696
Aunt Mian told me to take you in this boat.

740
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,000
- Come with me. Quick! - Okay.

741
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:03,960
Boonta? Boonta!
