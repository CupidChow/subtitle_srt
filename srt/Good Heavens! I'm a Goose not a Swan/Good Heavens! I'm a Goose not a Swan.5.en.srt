1
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:28,680
Ming fought for love.

2
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,640
I have to fight for myself.

3
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,960
If the contract can be altered,

4
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,080
I'll make money and buy my own freedom.

5
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
If you're willing to outbid him,

6
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,280
I'll sell you to her.

7
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,744
- How much? - Ten chang, sir.

8
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,190
(Come this way. The seller is kind.)

9
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:45,920
(And pretty.)

10
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,080
Boonta is saving up to buy her freedom.

11
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:49,938
She's working for the Indian owner's clothing store.

12
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,280
Have you seen Boonta?

13
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,480
I haven't, ma'am.

14
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:54,117
I haven't, Mother.

15
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,200
When I left, if I wasn't seeing things,

16
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,720
Master Chaai was there too.

17
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,920
I have to do something now.

18
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,160
Why is our profit

19
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:05,040
so little this month?

20
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,880
Two of our ships sank, so there was a lack of supply, sir.

21
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,280
If that's the case,

22
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:11,360
how would I find ten chang to pay?

23
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,700
Magnate visited Fang's and asked to buy Boonta, ma'am.

24
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:21,320
(Episode 5: Jeed and The Memory of Boonta)

25
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:35,080
Is everything alright?

26
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:40,240
Thank you, sir.

27
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,920
It seems you've paid a lot in bribes.

28
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,320
That's how your trade has been going so well.

29
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm merely following their traditions.

30
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,720
How can I help you today?

31
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:08,680
What's going on?

32
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,680
Why did you bring Sarung here?

33
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:12,829
Why was he beaten up?

34
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,960
Don't even pretend.

35
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,920
I hired him to work.

36
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,840
His job is to go out and collect money from our sales to the Siamese

37
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,240
even when he was just caught dealing opium!

38
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,199
Yet he slacks off.

39
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,760
He snuck out to work your cargo ships!

40
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:29,760
That's damaging to my business!

41
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:32,487
"Shut up!"

42
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:36,960
I refused to hire a Siamese because they're lazy,

43
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:39,480
corrupt, and cunning.

44
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:43,037
You're no different. "You stupid monkey!"

45
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:45,120
Hey, calm down!

46
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,480
I didn't know he was working for you.

47
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:49,880
I hired him

48
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:53,680
because he used to be a lead sailor and knows how to navigate.

49
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,280
Nobody is collecting the money from my sales.

50
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:59,320
And I'm off to Singapore in just a few days.

51
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:03,240
I have no money to buy goods from there, and my journey is delayed.

52
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:05,320
That's your responsibility.

53
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:06,800
How is that my responsibility?

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,640
That's Sarung's fault.

55
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,000
A Chinese like you

56
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:15,360
have an easier time conducting your business with the Siamese.

57
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,839
You're allowed to have your own warehouse

58
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,647
while I am not!

59
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,560
If you're willing to sell much of the goods in this warehouse to me

60
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:26,695
at a price lower than the market price,

61
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,960
I'm willing to let this go.

62
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:34,280
The Thais beg me, and now the Europeans too.

63
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:37,023
Do you think I'm your cash cow or something?

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
I say no!

65
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:43,720
If that's so,

66
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:45,520
I'll have my payback

67
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:49,280
to satisfy myself.

68
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,320
Hey, what are you standing there for? Go!

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Stop!

70
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,960
Let go!

71
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:58,440
Let go!

72
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,280
- Stop! - Calm down!

73
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:04,520
After your sales,

74
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:07,120
- my store's stock has almost run out. - Right.

75
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,200
I came to buy clothes at Hua Taphao. They have good stuff here.

76
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:14,800
What's going on?

77
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:21,284
You're always picking a fight!

78
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,360
- I'll get you out of here. - Stop!

79
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,400
I said stop!

80
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,720
Stop!

81
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,360
That's what happened, Luang.

82
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
I deserve justice.

83
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,280
You took your fellow Siamese's side once.

84
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,240
Now you're taking the Chinese's side too.

85
00:06:57,935 --> 00:07:00,240
So they favor China this early?

86
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,160
Don't accuse me of such a thing

87
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,920
when you're clearly in the wrong.

88
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:09,160
You used violence and damaged Magnate Thong's goods.

89
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:12,680
You have to pay him for damages, Captain.

90
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,760
Otherwise, I'll report this to the Resident of Singapore.

91
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,855
You've caused an incident twice.

92
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,687
You might think it's not a big deal.

93
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,800
But if a rumor of this spreads,

94
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,360
it could affect the trade deal

95
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,760
that Hantri Baraney's entourage is negotiating.

96
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,040
The side that would lose out is yours.

97
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Fine.

98
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,160
All right.

99
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:47,160
I'll pay.

100
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:50,480
What about Sarung, the one who caused it all?

101
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,680
If I find him,

102
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll deal with him.

103
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,880
Hantri Baraney?

104
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
Baraney?

105
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:16,776
Bur...

106
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,560
Burney?

107
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:24,800
Am I in the middle of the Burney Treaty negotiation?

108
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,760
Hello.

109
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:50,343
Your "bar" is slanted on one side.

110
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,440
My "bar?"

111
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,280
You're biased, sir.

112
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,209
You don't like the Europeans.

113
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,880
You don't treat the Chinese like you do them.

114
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:02,736
I don't pick a side.

115
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:05,360
No matter who it is, I have to do my duty.

116
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:08,840
The Europeans are waging war on Inn-Wa.

117
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:11,920
That's why I have to keep an eye on them particularly.

118
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,080
You're afraid they'd colonize us, right?

119
00:09:16,295 --> 00:09:17,720
You can rest easy, sir.

120
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,520
I don't know history as much as Kedsurang does.

121
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,040
But I can tell you this.

122
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,480
We're the only nation around here that's never been colonized.

123
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:29,520
Are you a cloth seller

124
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,120
or are you an oracle?

125
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:35,640
How did you know

126
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,560
that I was selling clothes?

127
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:42,551
Hey, don't tell me

128
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:44,920
you were stalking me again, weren't you?

129
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,080
You were with the Indian just now.

130
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:54,640
I heard the rumor of you helping him sell so well.

131
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,120
People were vying to "F" your clothes.

132
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,520
You know too much.

133
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:03,720
Did you really just hear a rumor?

134
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:06,400
Did you "F" some?

135
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:11,280
I'm a man.

136
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:13,320
Why would I buy those clothes?

137
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Could it be you sent someone there?

138
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,744
How many did she buy?

139
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:26,520
Don't you have to go back to Fang's?

140
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,880
Thank you anyway for supporting me.

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,920
Tomorrow, please come again and "F" some more.

142
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:50,080
We're not going tomorrow, sir.

143
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:52,480
We have too many clothes already.

144
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:15,240
Wait! You haven't paid.

145
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,760
Pay for your drink.

146
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,280
I don't have any!

147
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,240
Nobody lets me work!

148
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:23,040
How would I have money?

149
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:24,440
That's not my problem!

150
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,320
You drank at my place. You have to pay!

151
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,440
I don't have any!

152
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,880
What would you do?

153
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:33,400
Fine...

154
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,240
I would do this!

155
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:37,600
Boys!

156
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,360
That's enough!

157
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:52,440
You killed my mood.

158
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:13,240
Mother didn't come?

159
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:17,760
She went out in the morning.

160
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,640
Pad, that's not your usual look.

161
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:28,680
I think I saw some women at the temple

162
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:30,760
wearing similar colors.

163
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:33,160
Are these colors trending?

164
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:40,400
You should ask Chaai.

165
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,080
Lately,

166
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,480
Chaai often patrols around the clothing store.

167
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:48,160
It seems

168
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:51,280
he has taken a liking to a seller.

169
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
You said you can't force love.

170
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:00,080
So that meant

171
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:03,360
you already have someone you love, right?

172
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,560
I have to go to work.

173
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,240
I don't think so, sir.

174
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,929
This Little Market has a lot of goods.

175
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,240
This place is as good as Sampheng.

176
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,320
If you still have no idea what to gift His Majesty,

177
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,960
what about a silk fabric?

178
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:06,800
That's what you suggested last time.

179
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:09,960
I think His Majesty already has a lot of good silk.

180
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:12,360
I want to get something else.

181
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:20,920
I think we should check over there.

182
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:55,135
Please help me!

183
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:56,640
I'm getting robbed!

184
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,320
They're robbing people at the market?

185
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,840
Young Miss, don't smile yet.

186
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,400
You're going to blow your cover.

187
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:11,080
We should follow them. Luang is going to suspect us.

188
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:14,160
Chaai, wait for me.

189
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:17,400
Wad, the wife of the Library Chief,

190
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,400
wishes to see the clothes at her house.

191
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,096
- So that's why we had to close the place for now. - Yes.

192
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,600
- Is it far away? - We should...

193
00:15:35,492 --> 00:15:37,492
- Ouch! - Who's that?

194
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,120
Hey! Come back and fix this!

195
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:42,920
- I'll be back. - Yeah.

196
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:46,040
Won't you apologize at all?

197
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,280
Darn you! You dare hurt me?

198
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,720
You think I'm scared just because you're a man?

199
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,560
I did action scenes, you know!

200
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,200
You scoundrel!

201
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,640
This is not the time to get horny!

202
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,200
Don't struggle.

203
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,640
I recognize you.

204
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,251
You're a courtesan at Fang's.

205
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,687
I'm going to kiss you!

206
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,200
- No! - Stay still!

207
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:40,059
- Here goes! - Ah!

208
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,760
Take this!

209
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,640
Young Miss, that's...

210
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:02,255
You think you can put your hands on me just because I'm a courtesan?

211
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:12,520
You...

212
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,840
- That bag is... - Mother, Aunt!

213
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,640
Why are you here?

214
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:36,096
Mother!

215
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,868
When I'm away, you take your chance

216
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:41,475
and cause trouble at the market?

217
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,663
I don't know who you stole it from.

218
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:57,760
All I know is

219
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:01,640
he ran into me and the Indian and ruined our products.

220
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,560
He also tried to molest me.

221
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:06,800
I'm seeking maximum punishment, sir.

222
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,240
That was my fault

223
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:11,447
but she was in my way, sir.

224
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:15,040
I saw her dancing seductively when she was selling clothes.

225
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:17,320
A courtesan like her

226
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,240
just gets excited when she sees a man.

227
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,520
I should kick you again! Why?

228
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,840
Was I dancing on your grave or what?

229
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:27,760
What I do is none of your business.

230
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,640
Remember that in your empty skull!

231
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:32,080
Even if I walk around naked,

232
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:34,000
you have no right to do this to me.

233
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:35,840
That's called "sexual

234
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:37,639
haramed?"

235
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,520
"Har" something.

236
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:44,880
That's obviously sexual abuse!

237
00:18:45,111 --> 00:18:48,120
Whether it's a courtesan or a noble,

238
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:49,760
or any other woman,

239
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:51,680
or even if it's a man,

240
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,043
if they don't consent,

241
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:56,640
you have no right to touch, speak to, or even look at them with horny eyes!

242
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,680
How can you stop me? As if you were the only victim.

243
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,560
I'm hurt too.

244
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:05,200
The bruises on my body are proof!

245
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,280
What about this, huh?

246
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:11,071
If I hadn't defended myself, this torn sash wouldn't be the only damage!

247
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:12,400
It would have been ripped off!

248
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,120
All right, Boonta.

249
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,880
Stop arguing.

250
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,200
Dokgaew.

251
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,280
Do you have anything to say?

252
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:23,120
He's a thief.

253
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,983
He took your money.

254
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:51,840
Is this not too risky, Young Miss?

255
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,760
Why don't you just hire him to wreck the Indian's store?

256
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,560
So the courtesan won't come to the market anymore.

257
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:00,280
That would be suspicious.

258
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,159
Even if she doesn't come to the market,

259
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:04,480
Chaai would be visiting her anyway.

260
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,832
It's best to let something happen to me

261
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,928
right in front of Chaai.

262
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:10,960
Make Chaai work

263
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:12,880
so he doesn't have time to visit her.

264
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,680
What if Sarung gets caught?

265
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,840
I'll just forgive him out of pity.

266
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:23,600
Chaai would see that I'm a good woman,

267
00:20:24,362 --> 00:20:27,800
who is kind even to a thief.

268
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,240
I wish no punishment to him.

269
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,680
I can't help but feel sorry for the man.

270
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,760
He's probably hungry with no means.

271
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,120
That's why he decided to do something reckless.

272
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,087
Nobody is hurt anyway.

273
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
I don't want this to go any further.

274
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,760
I'll think of it as making a merit.

275
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,600
Hey, Miss!

276
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:50,189
Miss, ma'am.

277
00:20:50,271 --> 00:20:53,520
This is not the time to be generous.

278
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:56,680
I know you're kind, but please have some "limit."

279
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:59,720
This scoundrel took your money, ma'am.

280
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,160
He tried to molest me.

281
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,096
He caused trouble for all of us.

282
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:05,760
He needs to be jailed, ma'am.

283
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:09,080
Also, he needs to pay for the damage.

284
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:19,000
If Sarung does this on his own, the punishment is on him.

285
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:21,600
If he has an accomplice,

286
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,880
the accomplice would share half the punishment.

287
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,120
Sarung was fired from his job, sir.

288
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,240
He's alone with no friends.

289
00:21:30,408 --> 00:21:32,880
He can't have an accomplice, right?

290
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,000
It's up to you to decide, Officers.

291
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:40,520
I think you two can come to a fair decision.

292
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,880
You think I can't punish you

293
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,360
just because you're a European's underling?

294
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:52,912
I was wrong, sir.

295
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,520
Please don't punish me.

296
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:56,520
I can't jail you

297
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,400
but I can fine you.

298
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,169
You're lucky Dokgaew spared you.

299
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:07,918
But you still have to pay damages to the Indian.

300
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:10,200
And to me for compensation, sir.

301
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,080
What she said.

302
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:23,600
I'm really sorry.

303
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:27,600
Let me help you pay for the clothes damage.

304
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,800
Keep this for your own expenses.

305
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,200
I received enough from Sarung.

306
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:36,776
I still have to apologize.

307
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:40,320
Mother found out. I can't help you anymore.

308
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,040
I understand.

309
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:44,679
The next time you visit the market,

310
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,720
or the next time I visit Fang's to sell clothes,

311
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:49,840
I'll ask for your advice again.

312
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:51,176
Of course.

313
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,520
- I have to go now. - Right.

314
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:55,720
Goodbye.

315
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,560
During the interrogation,

316
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:09,800
Yod already accompanied Master Tubtim and Master Pikul home.

317
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:12,840
Master Tubtim told Yod to tell Luang Thukkarat

318
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,991
that he was to accompany you home.

319
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,360
But...

320
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:23,600
Chaai has work to do,

321
00:23:23,832 --> 00:23:25,832
so he asked me to come in his stead.

322
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:27,840
I would rather not impose, sir.

323
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,616
We can go home ourselves.

324
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,000
It's not an impose.

325
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,640
I have free time and I'm willing.

326
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:38,440
Or do you have other plans?

327
00:23:39,223 --> 00:23:41,120
Is that why you don't want me with you?

328
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,120
I'm going straight home as I'm worried about my mother.

329
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,200
You can see me off at Sampheng Dock.

330
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:50,400
Once I get on the boat,

331
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,200
you can rest assured.

332
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:15,960
Boonta.

333
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,080
What are you doing here, sir?

334
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,520
I saw your sash was torn.

335
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm here to give you a new one.

336
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:29,640
It's just a small tear. It's fine, sir.

337
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,280
Please take it.

338
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,360
I sent someone to

339
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,640
"F" too many of them.

340
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,840
Then that's fine.

341
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
But I'll pay for it.

342
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm rich today, from the fine.

343
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:51,040
Luang is richer.

344
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,720
Please take it.

345
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,064
I was going to buy you sandals last time.

346
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,840
And you're still rejecting me this time?

347
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:09,280
Okay, sir.

348
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,719
There will be no next time, though.

349
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:17,480
So,

350
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:19,760
I have to go.

351
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Mother is probably waiting to deal with me.

352
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,320
Excuse me.

353
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,880
If something happens,

354
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,160
you can tell me.

355
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:31,920
I'm willing to help.

356
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,240
Mother won't hurt me, sir.

357
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm her moneymaker.

358
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:39,000
Goodbye, sir.

359
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,680
Mother, I'm sorry

360
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:55,200
for doing this behind your back.

361
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:58,120
I had to. Otherwise, I'll have no money.

362
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,920
Or would you pay me a salary?

363
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,120
Why would I pay you? You're the one that owes me!

364
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:06,484
Then you have to let me work small jobs.

365
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,920
Let me make some money.

366
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:09,080
You...

367
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,110
If Captain Jon hadn't requested not to hurt you,

368
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:14,200
I would flog your back off.

369
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:17,599
And for the rest of you who covered up for her,

370
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:19,688
nobody requested your safety.

371
00:26:19,841 --> 00:26:22,079
How should I punish you, huh?

372
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:27,120
Mother, I told them to keep quiet.

373
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:29,280
I'll take all the punishment, ma'am.

374
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,439
Fine.

375
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,320
I'll factor this into your debt as you have wasted my time.

376
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:36,320
And I'll close your room upstairs.

377
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:39,400
If you love her so much, take her to your bedroom.

378
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:44,440
As for Mian and Ming,

379
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:47,256
if you're not honest and loyal to me,

380
00:26:47,384 --> 00:26:50,120
you can go work for Boonta instead.

381
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,720
Mother.

382
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:54,040
That's all.

383
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:55,520
Go back to work!

384
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,760
Go!

385
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,160
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:03,920
Boonta, darn you! You screwed me.

387
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,248
Go.

388
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:40,703
Ming.

389
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:46,800
I made this money selling clothes

390
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:49,520
and from compensation.

391
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,600
Take this money, apologize to your father-in-law, and pay her dowry.

392
00:27:56,783 --> 00:28:00,000
I was going to give Lamduan this money to buy her freedom.

393
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,520
But she's dead now.

394
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:05,680
I think you need it more.

395
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,520
Aren't you saving up to free yourself?

396
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:17,080
I am.

397
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,440
But I'm having an easier time here than everyone, including you.

398
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:24,680
Take it.

399
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:27,640
It's best to be with your family.

400
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:32,280
I'll ask you one thing though.

401
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,960
You love your family.

402
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,840
Other people love their families too.

403
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:42,080
They wouldn't have wanted their wives and daughters to work here.

404
00:28:44,111 --> 00:28:46,840
I know you're just following Mother's orders.

405
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,600
But your real job is

406
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:52,076
to protect the women here,

407
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,760
not hurt them, isn't it?

408
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,760
I have to.

409
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,040
If you have to, be as gentle as possible.

410
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,560
Even if you're a pimp,

411
00:29:08,735 --> 00:29:10,760
a guard at a courtesan house

412
00:29:11,135 --> 00:29:13,240
has his honor and pride too.

413
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,960
I'll try then.

414
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:22,959
Boonta.

415
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,800
Thanks a lot for your help.

416
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:07,080
She doesn't let me work. How can I buy my own freedom?

417
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,160
What are you mumbling about?

418
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,680
Why aren't you sleeping?

419
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,760
I can't sleep.

420
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:27,400
My back hurts.

421
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,560
Oh my...

422
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:46,920
Lamjeak.

423
00:30:48,184 --> 00:30:52,320
I saw you working hard. I think your body may be stiff.

424
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,063
Let me give you a massage.

425
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,680
Lie down.

426
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,280
Hey! Whoa!

427
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:03,880
Let's begin.

428
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,680
The other one.

429
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:15,800
Good?

430
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:18,108
Well, it's good.

431
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:19,560
This is about right?

432
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:24,040
Yeah, good.

433
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,400
So

434
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:37,920
Why do we have to sneak in here?

435
00:31:38,912 --> 00:31:40,720
I'm just worried

436
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:44,240
that Pudsorn would see this and tell Mother.

437
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,880
She irritates me.

438
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:50,120
Yeah, right.

439
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:55,695
- You like that? - Yeah.

440
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:03,974
Are you sure you know how to massage?

441
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,120
You can't just massage on your own. You need a teacher.

442
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:11,240
I've had a teacher.

443
00:32:14,608 --> 00:32:17,120
Pressuring with pull,

444
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:20,760
stretch, and stop

445
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:24,160
will help your blood flow

446
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:26,600
and get back to a natural state.

447
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:38,240
See? My massage is "free" and doesn't cost a dime.

448
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:40,320
Yeah, do it.

449
00:32:41,316 --> 00:32:43,800
You're good at this.

450
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,040
I'll make you feel even better.

451
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,120
Come on.

452
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,720
Put your hands on the back of your neck.

453
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:58,680
- Back of my neck? Yeah. - Back of your neck. Here.

454
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:00,800
Ouch.

455
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:03,400
- This will hurt a little. - Go on.

456
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,920
Breathe in.

457
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,280
Breathe out.

458
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:12,800
"Okay."

459
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:14,160
Is that good?

460
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,040
- Yeah, good. - Come here.

461
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:18,960
- The next one is even better. Stretch your legs. - You sure?

462
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,920
Okay. Stretch.

463
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:25,920
Reach backward with both hands.

464
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:27,480
Both? Yeah.

465
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:30,462
- Ready? Breathe in. - Breathe in.

466
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:31,880
Breathe out.

467
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:40,400
Chor.

468
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,360
Hurry up with your shallots. The water is boiling.

469
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,080
Yes, Aunt.

470
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,640
Oh, hey!

471
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,720
Lamjeak. Where have you been?

472
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,080
Did you have a rough night, Lamjeak?

473
00:34:03,232 --> 00:34:04,720
Is that why you're in this state?

474
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:07,800
No. Boonta gave me a massage.

475
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,200
Massage?

476
00:34:11,512 --> 00:34:12,640
Massage?

477
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,560
What massage? Why are you in this condition?

478
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:24,280
- Hey! - Oops!

479
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Hey!

480
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:29,080
Lamjeak said you had a teacher.

481
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:31,360
I did.

482
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,560
But not a massage teacher.

483
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:38,400
Oh, Chor. Please give me a chance.

484
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:40,920
No one is born capable.

485
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,800
Just tell me how you like it.

486
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:45,400
I'll improve.

487
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:47,880
Then you lie down.

488
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,320
Press for the duration of one breath.

489
00:35:12,784 --> 00:35:13,960
Boonta.

490
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,680
Hey!

491
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:22,240
Yeah. There. My shoulders. Yeah!

492
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,680
I'll get your neck and shoulders.

493
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,720
- Oh, you know? - This side too.

494
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:31,440
I carried your curry pots and it made my shoulders

495
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,800
- all stiff. - Let's get your neck now.

496
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:40,400
You're making me drool.

497
00:35:48,548 --> 00:35:50,160
I'm loving this so much.

498
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:52,208
Come on. Who's next?

499
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,040
Why can't I do this?

500
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:57,440
Was that too hard?

501
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,920
That's good.

502
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:06,440
This is relaxing.

503
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,520
The bowl sunk. My turn. Now!

504
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:11,649
- Get up. - Let me pay.

505
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:14,840
Here.

506
00:36:17,513 --> 00:36:19,673
- Come on. - Come here. What massage would you like?

507
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,000
I'll pay first. Here.

508
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:25,000
- Pay before service. Here. - Boonta!

509
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,000
Are you charging them money?

510
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,080
- I'll tell Mother. - Hey!

511
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:33,417
- Let me go! - Take her here.

512
00:36:33,512 --> 00:36:34,720
Let go!

513
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:36,047
- Come here. - Come on.

514
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,849
- What are you doing? - Come here! Push her down!

515
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,680
- What are you doing to me? - Hold her! That's right!

516
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,240
Oh...

517
00:36:48,928 --> 00:36:50,240
Is this good?

518
00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:51,575
It's good.

519
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:57,280
Boonta is helping us relax our bodies.

520
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,000
Yes.

521
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:07,760
Boonta.

522
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:12,320
You go and buy condiments as I say.

523
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,320
I need to do something.

524
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,977
I'll be back soon.

525
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,620
Wait for me here. Here.

526
00:37:23,478 --> 00:37:25,600
This is my time.

527
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:29,680
Aunt! You haven't told me what to buy!

528
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:32,280
Why is she in such a hurry?

529
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,520
One pinch.

530
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:53,039
Hello.

531
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,200
- This? - Take a look.

532
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:58,056
Come on. Don't keep us waiting.

533
00:39:00,984 --> 00:39:02,360
It's Tiansin!

534
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,400
Oh! I won!

535
00:39:04,498 --> 00:39:06,960
- I won! - There you are!

536
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,720
Oh! Boonta! You scared me.

537
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:14,319
- How much did you win? - I won the lottery!

538
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,520
First prize?

539
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:17,073
How much did you win? I want it too.

540
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,280
Are you lucky though?

541
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:20,640
Do you really want to buy some?

542
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:26,640
Boonta. Luang?

543
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:30,440
- Run! - Police's here!

544
00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:33,520
Let me go!

545
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:37,680
Run!

546
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,760
Aunt, wait!

547
00:39:40,423 --> 00:39:41,760
- Go! - Aunt!

548
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,240
- Quick! - Run!

549
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,200
Aunt, wait!

550
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:49,240
Aunt!

551
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:51,640
Hey, move!

552
00:39:52,268 --> 00:39:53,920
Oh, sorry!

553
00:39:54,063 --> 00:39:55,600
Aunt!

554
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,800
Move it! Move!

555
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,560
Sorry!

556
00:40:00,711 --> 00:40:02,120
Aunt!

557
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:03,760
Sorry, ma'am.

558
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,280
Oh?

559
00:40:06,928 --> 00:40:08,040
Aunt Mian?

560
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,767
Aunt Mian told me to take you by this boat.

561
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:12,080
Come with me. Quick!

562
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,680
Okay. Aunt!

563
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:15,775
I need to get out of here!

564
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:19,520
Boonta? Boonta!

565
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,080
Boonta...

566
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:25,640
No more... Oops!

567
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:33,240
Where's Boonta?

568
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:44,111
Where did Aunt Mian tell you to go?

569
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:50,840
Why didn't you answer?

570
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:04,600
Boonta.

571
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:06,160
Boonta.

572
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:07,400
Boonta.

573
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:21,619
You...

574
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,103
You... It's Boonta.

575
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:30,360
Boonta didn't attempt suicide.

576
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:32,120
Boonta was murdered.

577
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,200
What are you saying?

578
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:37,400
When I was in the water,

579
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:39,440
I saw a brief flashback.

580
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,480
I saw someone chasing Boonta

581
00:43:41,624 --> 00:43:44,960
and that was before I fell into the water.

582
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,480
So you think you didn't try to kill yourself?

583
00:43:47,896 --> 00:43:49,480
Someone tried to kill you.

584
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:07,960
Boonta.

585
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,120
Back then, something was strange.

586
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:16,320
But I didn't pay attention. I was worried about you.

587
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,440
After that, Fang's staff took you back.

588
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,800
Do you remember the one who chased you?

589
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,400
I don't.

590
00:44:29,424 --> 00:44:30,600
I can't recall.

591
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:32,600
Was that all you see?

592
00:44:34,551 --> 00:44:35,640
Yes, sir.

593
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:39,280
Didn't you see me in that flashback?

594
00:44:40,328 --> 00:44:41,880
I didn't.

595
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:47,264
I'll investigate this and find the culprit.

596
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,680
You need to be careful.

597
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,880
Yes, sir.

598
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:04,360
Aunt, was she taken in by the police?

599
00:45:05,015 --> 00:45:07,200
Why would they take her? She didn't do anything.

600
00:45:07,296 --> 00:45:08,520
Even me,

601
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,489
all I got was a warning.

602
00:45:10,593 --> 00:45:12,120
They won't arrest her.

603
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,360
Aunt Mian! Why did you leave me behind?

604
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:19,680
It was an emergency. I had to run.

605
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:23,327
Are you alright? Where have you been?

606
00:45:23,427 --> 00:45:26,600
Why are you soaking wet? You...

607
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:32,600
Did you and Luang make love in the water?

608
00:45:34,091 --> 00:45:36,920
I fell into the water. Luang saved me.

609
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,080
If you don't believe me,

610
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,360
you can ask Yod.

611
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:40,720
- That's true. - Yod.

612
00:45:41,198 --> 00:45:42,360
So...

613
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,200
Let me warn you. Even if you were husband and wife,

614
00:45:48,351 --> 00:45:50,480
if Mother finds out, you have to be careful...

615
00:45:50,568 --> 00:45:52,960
Aunt! I said we didn't do anything!

616
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,240
It's fine. I understand.

617
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:58,320
Some things are hard to quit.

618
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:01,000
What? I said we did nothing. You too!

619
00:46:01,414 --> 00:46:02,600
He looks handsome,

620
00:46:02,712 --> 00:46:05,680
but his teeth are black with betel. I don't like it.

621
00:47:36,816 --> 00:47:38,520
Are you still up?

622
00:47:38,853 --> 00:47:39,984
Yes, Mother.

623
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,880
What's wrong with you and Yod?

624
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,560
Suddenly, you're copying the Europeans.

625
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,640
Why have you brushed your teeth white?

626
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,720
Yod.

627
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,720
Put your head up. Let me see your teeth.

628
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:06,000
Yod!

629
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:11,160
Why have you brushed your teeth white?

630
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,440
Obsidian teeth

631
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,040
look way healthier and more beautiful.

632
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,520
Did you hear that, Yod?

633
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,280
Chew some betel to blacken your teeth now.

634
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,120
- Now! - Yes, sir.

635
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:36,000
Are you afraid I'd be more handsome?

636
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,120
I heard that.

637
00:48:38,272 --> 00:48:39,560
I'm going, sir!

638
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,720
Mong Chank, you have been a monk for three years, right?

639
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,040
Mother.

640
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,680
Your memory is too good.

641
00:48:56,944 --> 00:49:00,120
I'm counting the days and nights.

642
00:49:01,328 --> 00:49:03,720
Don't you think of leaving monkhood?

643
00:49:05,127 --> 00:49:07,400
I'm getting old.

644
00:49:07,984 --> 00:49:10,320
Chim and Chaai are busy with work.

645
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,400
When will we be all together?

646
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,920
If he wants to stay a monk to study Dharma

647
00:49:21,615 --> 00:49:23,600
and carry on Buddhism,

648
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,880
you shouldn't object, Mother.

649
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,760
Brother Chaai.

650
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,680
You don't chew betel much,

651
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:42,600
but why are your teeth suddenly so white?

652
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:53,080
Chang, please talk some sense into him.

653
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:55,040
He won't listen to me at all.

654
00:49:57,735 --> 00:49:58,960
All of a sudden,

655
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:01,680
Brother Chaai does things he's never done.

656
00:50:04,032 --> 00:50:05,800
It's probably for something special.

657
00:50:18,464 --> 00:50:19,840
I have to go to work.

658
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:22,560
If you're not going home yet,

659
00:50:23,264 --> 00:50:25,120
please stay and talk to Monk Chang.

660
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,400
Master Chaai seems strange, ma'am.

661
00:50:41,895 --> 00:50:43,480
Is it because of that woman?

662
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:47,280
Don't tell me he whitened his teeth for her?

663
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:55,920
What do you need to discuss with me, sir?

664
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:58,800
I need your further statement.

665
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,080
Don't tell me...

666
00:51:13,455 --> 00:51:17,680
Hey, sir! I was kidding. You brushed your teeth all white.

667
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,160
Here, sir.

668
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,286
Aunt.

669
00:51:47,993 --> 00:51:49,640
You can go back to work.

670
00:51:50,919 --> 00:51:52,240
It's all done.

671
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:56,320
I said

672
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,560
you can go back to work.

673
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:08,880
Then please be quick and leave.

674
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,400
If Mother sees you, I'll

675
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,240
be in trouble.

676
00:52:23,063 --> 00:52:26,800
You came to our kitchen and told Aunt Mian to go away.

677
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:29,600
Is there a secret or something?

678
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,000
I suspect

679
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,240
that the one who had your boat sunk

680
00:52:38,671 --> 00:52:39,960
is Dokgaew.

681
00:52:45,895 --> 00:52:48,520
Puek suspects that Dokgaew hired Sarung

682
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,920
to cause trouble at the market the other day.

683
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,680
I knew it.

684
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:55,551
If I bought a lottery, I would have won.

685
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:57,800
Did you buy a lottery?

686
00:53:00,072 --> 00:53:02,160
It's just an analogy.

687
00:53:04,112 --> 00:53:07,080
I think it might not have been Dokgaew.

688
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:09,760
It's Gaysorn.

689
00:53:10,216 --> 00:53:12,600
Gaysorn seems to dislike me too.

690
00:53:16,904 --> 00:53:19,280
So we have two suspects now.

691
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:22,440
If we catch the perpetrator,

692
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,760
we'll find out who hired him.

693
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,760
How do we find him, sir?

694
00:53:40,344 --> 00:53:42,920
The perpetrator wore a blue turban.

695
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:44,400
I saw half his face.

696
00:53:44,896 --> 00:53:46,200
And...

697
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,480
He had dark brows.

698
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,080
He had sharp eyes.

699
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,760
His nose didn't seem too big.

700
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,840
Oh, more importantly,

701
00:54:00,152 --> 00:54:03,720
he had a mole under his right eye.

702
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,960
Why is Boonta so lucky?

703
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,880
Why is it so hard to kill her?

704
00:54:43,487 --> 00:54:45,280
I'll find another way, ma'am.

705
00:54:46,311 --> 00:54:47,480
Stop for now.

706
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:50,480
Boonta's had too many incidents.

707
00:54:51,943 --> 00:54:54,183
Luang Thukkarat must have caught on to something by now.

708
00:54:54,303 --> 00:54:55,320
Yes, ma'am.

709
00:54:55,448 --> 00:54:56,680
Gaysorn.

710
00:54:57,431 --> 00:54:58,680
Gaysorn.

711
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:03,760
Gaysorn.

712
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:08,240
Yes, dear.

713
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:09,440
There you are.

714
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,120
Who were you talking to?

715
00:55:15,807 --> 00:55:18,600
I came to tell the servants to cut some branches.

716
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,640
What do you need, dear?

717
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,920
I heard that

718
00:55:27,464 --> 00:55:29,160
Chim, Luang Thukkarat's older brother,

719
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:31,223
is joining the bid for bird nest tax.

720
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,440
I would like you to negotiate with Luang Thukkarat.

721
00:55:35,768 --> 00:55:37,160
Tell them not to outbid me.

722
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:41,999
Gaysorn.

723
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,200
If I were put in charge of that tax,

724
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,800
I might become an official with my own land.

725
00:55:48,272 --> 00:55:50,360
We won't have to pay tax on our properties.

726
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,760
So the other officials

727
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,520
would stop looking down on me and picking on me.

728
00:56:02,143 --> 00:56:04,640
I'll try to talk to Dokgaew.

729
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:12,400
What? You would like me to invite Dokgaew over for lunch?

730
00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:14,000
Yes, Mother.

731
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,120
I have something I need to ask her.

732
00:56:27,456 --> 00:56:30,640
Chaai wants to see me. Walk faster, Dang.

733
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,840
Stop!

734
00:56:36,824 --> 00:56:38,920
Sarung, move it. You're drunk.

735
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:40,920
Don't get in our way.

736
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,160
Before you go,

737
00:56:44,536 --> 00:56:46,080
I need my money.

738
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,280
I already paid you. What else do you want?

739
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,400
What you paid me

740
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:54,480
didn't even cover the fine!

741
00:56:55,232 --> 00:56:56,960
If you don't pay me more,

742
00:56:57,344 --> 00:56:59,200
I'll tell Luang Thukkarat

743
00:56:59,536 --> 00:57:01,920
that you hired me

744
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,080
to play a thief.

745
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:07,080
What do you say?

746
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:08,440
I won't pay you.

747
00:57:08,568 --> 00:57:10,760
Who would believe a drunk sailor like you?

748
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,280
Let's go, Dang.

749
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:17,880
- Hey, let go! - I said pay me!

750
00:57:18,031 --> 00:57:20,088
Whoa! Pay me!

751
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:22,080
- Let me go! - Don't try to run!

752
00:57:22,615 --> 00:57:24,615
Sarung, let go!

753
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,940
Stop! I give up!

754
00:57:45,183 --> 00:57:47,183
Why didn't you arrest him, sir?

755
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,880
If I arrest the hired thief,

756
00:57:53,022 --> 00:57:55,262
I would have to arrest the one who hired him too, right?

757
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,880
If Chaai finds out,

758
00:57:58,961 --> 00:58:01,200
would he still want to see you?

759
00:58:02,288 --> 00:58:04,288
Please don't tell Chaai.

760
00:58:04,425 --> 00:58:05,800
I beg you.

761
00:58:08,495 --> 00:58:10,120
What do you want of me?

762
00:58:10,201 --> 00:58:11,840
I'll do anything.

763
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,600
You promised.

764
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,080
Do you know the person in this drawing?

765
00:58:42,096 --> 00:58:44,800
I won't wait until I get a husband, Aunt,

766
00:58:45,016 --> 00:58:48,080
because I'm going back to where I belong.

767
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,880
Please find the Hoan for me.

768
00:58:50,984 --> 00:58:52,160
Do you know, sir,

769
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:53,480
that I came from the future?

770
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,640
So why have I come here?

771
00:58:55,792 --> 00:58:56,809
When can I go back?

772
00:58:56,927 --> 00:58:59,000
Why would you want to know about a solar eclipse?

773
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:03,480
I'm not the same old Boonta you used to know.

774
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:05,160
Is Nual in the kitchen?

775
00:59:05,288 --> 00:59:07,960
Did she sneak out to see her husband again?

776
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,480
I keep shedding tears

777
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,200
sleeping with countless men.

778
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:16,151
Yet you're just enjoying yourself.

779
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:22,360
What's wrong with Boonta?
