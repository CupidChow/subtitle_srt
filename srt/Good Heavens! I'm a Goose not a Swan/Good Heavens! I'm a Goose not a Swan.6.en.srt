1
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,080
When I was in the water,

2
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,120
I saw a brief flashback.

3
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:35,120
I saw someone chasing Boonta.

4
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:37,280
So you think you didn't try to kill yourself?

5
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,928
Someone tried to kill you.

6
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:40,360
I suspect

7
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,152
that the one who had your boat sunk is Dokgaew.

8
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:46,040
I think it might not have been Dokgaew.

9
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:48,200
Why is Boonta so lucky?

10
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,960
Why is it so hard to kill her?

11
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:51,720
I'll find another way, ma'am.

12
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,140
He looks handsome,

13
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,400
but his teeth are black with betel. I don't like it.

14
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,832
- Pay me! - Let go!

15
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:06,431
Why didn't you arrest him, sir?

16
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:09,738
I would have to arrest the one who hired him too, right?

17
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,800
Please don't tell Chaai.

18
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:13,488
What do you want of me?

19
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:15,120
I'll do anything.

20
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,703
You promised.

21
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,160
Aunt said you wanted to talk to me.

22
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:24,960
What is it?

23
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,951
Do you know the person in this drawing?

24
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,520
I do not.

25
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,640
Even if I do,

26
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,520
who would recognize him?

27
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:49,136
He covers his face.

28
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:56,872
Who is he?

29
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,480
He's the one who sank Boonta's boat.

30
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,240
You seem so worried about that courtesan.

31
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,840
Yet she keeps picking fights all around town.

32
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm doing my job.

33
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:15,680
A matter this serious,

34
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:17,440
and you would have me stand down?

35
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:20,335
You asked me about that drawing.

36
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,800
Are you suspecting me?

37
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:25,920
I don't want anyone to become a suspect

38
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:28,200
unless they did it.

39
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,840
I really don't know that man.

40
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,520
- Aunt. - Yeah?

41
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,520
How do you know when a solar eclipse will happen?

42
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:53,480
Why would you want to know about the sun getting eaten?

43
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,600
You know it?

44
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,312
Aunt, do you know when it will happen?

45
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,200
What gave you that idea?

46
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:04,080
Look at me. I'm just a cook.

47
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:05,640
I'm not an oracle.

48
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:09,592
So where can I find one?

49
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:13,680
There's a Hoan at the market.

50
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
Go and visit him.

51
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:21,160
(Episode 6: Home Sweet Home)

52
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:32,840
It's payday.

53
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,880
Come on.

54
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,880
Well...

55
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,680
How much...

56
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:00,120
Where's mine?

57
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,760
Wait! Isn't it 70-30?

58
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,375
The master of the house gets 60.

59
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,040
You get 30.

60
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:14,000
The other ten percent is for tax.

61
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:18,280
I'll take my cut, ma'am.

62
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,760
Even if it's little, it's still money.

63
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm so rich I don't know what to spend on.

64
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,039
You're going to ask Jook to deliver the money to your husband again?

65
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,440
Being a man in this age is so good, Aunt.

66
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,880
He can sell his wife

67
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:48,840
- and get some money to spend. - I second that.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,560
We're born women. We're always inferior.

69
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:56,440
Are you saying I'm lucky I don't have a husband?

70
00:06:56,608 --> 00:07:00,320
I'm not saying those who have a husband are unlucky either.

71
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:03,400
So your husband is a good man, right?

72
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:05,640
I mean yours.

73
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:07,200
Come on.

74
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:09,771
Luang and Captain Jon

75
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:12,080
won't be like San, Nual's husband.

76
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:17,560
I won't wait until I get a husband, Aunt,

77
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,960
because I

78
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:21,096
am going back to where I belong.

79
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:26,240
Aunt, please find the Hoan for me.

80
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:28,280
Let me see.

81
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:32,320
I'm not exactly sure.

82
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:35,080
He's a wanderer.

83
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,600
And...

84
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
He's of average height.

85
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,127
He's of neutral skin color.

86
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:43,320
He has a mole on his chin.

87
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:49,640
Where can I find him?

88
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:52,240
Hey! Go find him wherever you want.

89
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:53,720
Don't stand in front of my booth.

90
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,560
Sorry.

91
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,032
Look, Aunt.

92
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,240
I'm looking for a fortuneteller.

93
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,120
They said

94
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,880
he's of average height and has a neutral skin color.

95
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
And he has a mole on his chin.

96
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:14,680
Do you know someone like that?

97
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,200
Are you looking for Master Mun?

98
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:21,391
Master Mun?

99
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,320
Yes, Master Mun.

100
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:29,040
It must be him. Yeah.

101
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,872
Master Mun?

102
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:36,471
He does charming spells, right?

103
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:37,640
That's right.

104
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,480
Dang heard Boonta was looking for him at the market.

105
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,720
Why would Boonta need a charmer?

106
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,520
I know

107
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:53,160
that you don't have feelings for me like our parents hoped.

108
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:55,640
You have feelings for Boonta.

109
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,960
But that could have been an effect of a charming spell.

110
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:02,720
My Luang looks glowing.

111
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,560
He eats and sleeps well.

112
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,680
He can't have been under a spell.

113
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:13,600
I heard those at Fang's say

114
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:16,120
Boonta has become a different person.

115
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,920
She could be using sorcery

116
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,160
and summon a spirit into herself

117
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,840
and seduce you into obsession.

118
00:09:57,456 --> 00:09:58,896
He sure looks like him.

119
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:25,400
That's Boonta, sir.

120
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:31,400
I remember the sash you bought her.

121
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:40,000
He even bought her a sash.

122
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:41,880
What did we miss, Young Miss?

123
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,640
Hey.

124
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:11,440
I must have been mistaken, sir.

125
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,560
A sash in this color

126
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,560
is commonly worn.

127
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,400
But I

128
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,840
couldn't have been mistaken too.

129
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
If you haven't, where is Boonta then?

130
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,191
Place your bets!

131
00:11:57,314 --> 00:11:59,040
San, today

132
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:00,880
you're lucky.

133
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:04,520
- All your bets are spot on. - I won!

134
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,440
It's three!

135
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,695
Place your bets. Come on.

136
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:13,480
I'll just follow San.

137
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,520
- That's fine. - Come on, come on!

138
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,751
I'll take all your bets.

139
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:20,720
I'm on a roll today!

140
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:28,120
Place your bets. Come on.

141
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,920
Bet!

142
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:34,120
San, pick your bet already.

143
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,120
Okay. I'm all in on three.

144
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Trust me. I won three straight rounds.

145
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:49,760
Place your bets.

146
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:52,880
All in on three?

147
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:56,480
Fine. Three...

148
00:12:57,808 --> 00:12:59,000
Bet on four, sir.

149
00:12:59,096 --> 00:13:00,760
Today is the day of four.

150
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,560
Are you sure?

151
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:11,280
Three. Four can't beat my luck.

152
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,480
You all saw me win three straight rounds.

153
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,720
Four, please, sir.

154
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,240
I'm betting

155
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,480
on four.

156
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,920
Come on. Roll it.

157
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:31,160
I'm going to roll now.

158
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:41,560
Yeah! It's really four, girl!

159
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:45,840
- I told you it's four. - All mine!

160
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,880
It's all mine.

161
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:51,531
I'm rich now. I quit!

162
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:54,975
I'm not staying!

163
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,960
You're unlucky today, sirs.

164
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:04,360
You cur!

165
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:12,360
I helped you but you left me hanging.

166
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,680
Can't you help me out?

167
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,160
Oh, man.

168
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,360
What help do you need?

169
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:23,440
Tell me the day a solar eclipse happens, Hoan.

170
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:42,040
Why would you want to know about a solar eclipse?

171
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,600
To go home, sir.

172
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,080
Go home?

173
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:57,760
Your home

174
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:00,480
is in the times ahead.

175
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:04,080
It's not easy to return.

176
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,000
Do you know, sir,

177
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,640
that I came from the future?

178
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:14,720
So why have I come here?

179
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,200
Will I get to go back? When can I go back?

180
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,240
I only know the stars.

181
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,840
I don't know about other things.

182
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,520
No, I think you can help me, sir.

183
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,320
When I fell off a boat and teleported here,

184
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:33,640
there was a solar eclipse that day.

185
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:37,520
I want to know when the next solar eclipse is happening,

186
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:39,760
so I can go back.

187
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:47,400
- Are you listening, sir? - I am.

188
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:56,440
Next month.

189
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:57,840
- Next month? - Yeah.

190
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:00,400
A solar eclipse is going to happen?

191
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:03,551
Why would you want to know about a solar eclipse?

192
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:06,488
Luang?

193
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
Where is Chaai?

194
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:14,200
He's so quick.

195
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:17,560
He's probably confronting Boonta at the house.

196
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:21,400
That's good. He's going to come to his senses.

197
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:24,240
From now on, he'll only have me.

198
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,739
He would be with you but his heart is still elsewhere.

199
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,720
It's not going to stay that way, Young Miss.

200
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:36,800
If she can charm him, you can too.

201
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,560
Have you lost your mind? Why would I do that?

202
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:57,520
Luang?

203
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:03,440
Dokgaew.

204
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,440
Dokgaew.

205
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,360
Didn't you hear my question?

206
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,423
Are you going to use a charming spell?

207
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,080
I'm just thinking. I haven't done it. Is that illegal?

208
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,920
You like Chaai so much that you have to do such a thing?

209
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:20,200
You've never liked anyone.

210
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:21,960
No one has ever liked you.

211
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,880
You won't understand, sir.

212
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,760
A charming spell

213
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:29,560
would only cause temporary obsession.

214
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:31,477
That courtesan did it.

215
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:33,360
Why don't you confront her?

216
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,160
You mean Boonta?

217
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:38,480
So you're doing what a courtesan is doing?

218
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:41,943
A high-ranking official's daughter would stoop to a courtesan's level now?

219
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:45,720
You think you can bind Chaai with you forever?

220
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:48,920
Do you wish to live with sorcery and black magic for the rest of your life?

221
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,920
Don't waste your effort on that.

222
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,440
Just be a good woman.

223
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:56,960
That would be the better option.

224
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,840
I know two of your secrets now.

225
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:08,960
I hope there'll not be a third.

226
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,160
Young Miss, wait for me.

227
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,400
So you followed me because you thought I was using a charmer?

228
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm not doing a charming spell.

229
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,840
I'm looking for a Hoan.

230
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:31,520
I believe you.

231
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,640
Someone like you won't be hiring a charmer

232
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,737
who scams people for a living.

233
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,480
So why

234
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:42,640
haven't you answered me?

235
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:47,160
Well...

236
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,280
Why would you want to know that?

237
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,160
Because I'm wondering what you're up to.

238
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:56,207
Ever since you fell into the water,

239
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,760
you haven't seemed like the Boonta I knew.

240
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:02,040
And now you seem to be interested in astrology.

241
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:08,200
What if I say I'm not the Boonta you know

242
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:11,320
and I'm someone else in her body?

243
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Would you believe me?

244
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,520
Do you mean

245
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,880
you are a ghost possessing this body?

246
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:20,480
It's not like that.

247
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,400
I'm just a spirit or something.

248
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,960
A spirit is a ghost!

249
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:26,280
Nonsense.

250
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,320
Ever since I was born, I've never seen a ghost.

251
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:32,720
Just because you haven't seen one doesn't mean they don't exist.

252
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,880
I think you're upset with what happened

253
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:44,360
and lose your mind sometimes.

254
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:46,080
You do strange things without knowing.

255
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:50,520
So you didn't believe me.

256
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:53,480
Let's just say

257
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,280
I'm not the same old Boonta you used to know.

258
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,600
Because I'm

259
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,320
a "new" Boonta.

260
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Come on! Help me out!

261
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:18,400
Luang, sir! The ruffians are fighting again.

262
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,440
- Stop! - Run!

263
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:29,600
San!

264
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,960
You went to a casino again, didn't you?

265
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,600
You know this guy?

266
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,760
I saw San in a casino.

267
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,560
And he was attacked by the guards.

268
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:46,640
Nual just sent him money.

269
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:48,640
Why would he waste it in the casino?

270
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:51,680
Is he in some kind of trouble?

271
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,280
Could it be

272
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,280
he wasn't saving up to free you like he said?

273
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,800
San is not that kind of man.

274
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,960
He loves me.

275
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,200
He promised to free me.

276
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:06,680
Come on, Nual!

277
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,440
How many years has he kept you waiting?

278
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:11,920
If he truly values you,

279
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,880
would he have sold you?

280
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:17,240
Nual.

281
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:19,480
All men are the same.

282
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:22,025
When he wants you, he can say sweet things.

283
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:25,640
Over time, when booze and gambling would possess him,

284
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,560
he becomes abusive.

285
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,840
Would you want your husband to beat you up like mine did me?

286
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,599
You can hate your own husband all you want.

287
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,040
How can I hate my husband too?

288
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:06,279
Nual's buying clothes!

289
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,960
This is highly unusual.

290
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
I bought these for the day my husband comes back.

291
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Nual. You should get dressed.

292
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,672
Mother would scold you if she saw you like this.

293
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:24,168
Ming, is Nual in the kitchen?

294
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:28,118
- I haven't seen her, ma'am. - I looked all over and couldn't find her.

295
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,680
Did she sneak out to see her husband again?

296
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:33,764
Go to her husband's house.

297
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,760
If she snuck out again, I'm going to flog her back off!

298
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,320
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:44,030
Why did you stop? Continue rehearsing!

300
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,088
Buy chips first.

301
00:24:18,455 --> 00:24:19,840
I'll buy some for you.

302
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,880
Tell me how much you need.

303
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,997
You can pay me back later.

304
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:34,240
I'm sorry, Lamjeak.

305
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,600
I have this.

306
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,681
This is enough. I don't want to be in debt.

307
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,560
I'm all in this round!

308
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,720
Take this...

309
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:09,480
San.

310
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,200
Nual?

311
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:25,040
Wait, Nual. Listen to me.

312
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,552
Should I listen to your excuse?

313
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,920
The money I gave you wasn't enough for your booze?

314
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,920
Is that why you came to the casino?

315
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,600
How many times have you lied to me about getting a job?

316
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:43,814
Is this your job?

317
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:47,880
Wait, Nual.

318
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:52,135
You know I'm sick.

319
00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:54,080
I can't work much.

320
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,560
So you chose the easy life

321
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,560
and lived off of my prostitution?

322
00:26:04,904 --> 00:26:06,160
Every night,

323
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,120
I waited,

324
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,880
hoping you would come,

325
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,720
yet you never came.

326
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
I keep shedding tears

327
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
sleeping with countless men.

328
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,080
Yet you're just enjoying yourself.

329
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,040
Nual.

330
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,920
- Let me go, San. - I'm doing this to keep my promise, Nual.

331
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:34,440
You broke that promise a long time ago.

332
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Nual.

333
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:39,120
San, let go.

334
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,960
Let her go.

335
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:45,040
The woman doesn't want you.

336
00:26:45,232 --> 00:26:46,680
Why would you persist?

337
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,240
You again?

338
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:50,023
What's this got to do with you?

339
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:53,480
I would want nothing to do with this if Nual wasn't my friend.

340
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:58,252
- Hey... - Let go!

341
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,015
Nual, Mother suspected you would be visiting San.

342
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:06,655
Ming went to his house to look for you.

343
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:10,040
I think you should go back before Ming finds you. Go.

344
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:11,941
Go.

345
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:13,480
Just go.

346
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:23,695
This is bad...

347
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,960
How many times have I told you not to visit your husband?

348
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:33,680
Yet you never listened!

349
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,640
Do you want me to kill you or what?

350
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:39,320
Ming.

351
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:41,080
Give her a round of flogging.

352
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,280
If she passes out, splash water on her and wake her up. Then flog her more.

353
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:46,960
Please don't.

354
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:51,000
(Your real job is)

355
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,520
(to protect the women here, not hurt them.)

356
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:56,280
What are you standing there for?

357
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,080
You want me to do it myself?

358
00:27:58,767 --> 00:27:59,880
Give me.

359
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,920
Mother! Please don't!

360
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,720
We can just talk.

361
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,640
If you flog her, she'd die for nothing.

362
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:09,880
Mother, I beg you, please.

363
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:11,600
Don't hurt her like you did Lamduan.

364
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,800
If she is wounded, you won't get a high price out of her.

365
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:15,960
Let me go!

366
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:19,167
I'm going to flog her, so you have an example!

367
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,800
Aren't you too cruel?

368
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:25,511
You never sympathize with us as women.

369
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,720
Yet you claim to be our "Mother" who protects her children.

370
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:31,248
What kind of mother would hurt her child like an animal?

371
00:28:31,272 --> 00:28:33,272
Are you still calling yourself a human?

372
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:40,568
- Don't... - Hey...

373
00:28:55,176 --> 00:28:56,920
Boonta!

374
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,520
Boonta survived drowning twice.

375
00:29:05,608 --> 00:29:09,040
Would she die of a flogging?

376
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:11,680
She's really brave for taking the flogging for Nual.

377
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:14,888
I didn't.

378
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,240
I tripped on Pudsorn's foot.

379
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:22,640
Pudsorn did it?

380
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
My foot just slipped.

381
00:29:25,688 --> 00:29:27,600
You deserve to be kicked in the face!

382
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:29,840
Next time, my foot will slip on you.

383
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,200
Hey!

384
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,800
She was in my way.

385
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:35,120
If she dies,

386
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:37,040
you will be staying in Cham's room.

387
00:29:37,463 --> 00:29:40,160
- Hey! - Come on! Bring it!

388
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:42,000
You can stop being jealous of her.

389
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,720
She doesn't serve a guest.

390
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:45,680
She can't take your spot anyway.

391
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
She doesn't seem to mean any harm either.

392
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:49,928
And she keeps helping out Ming and Nual.

393
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,120
Boil this medicine for her. It will relieve the fever.

394
00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes, sir.

395
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:00,680
Mother.

396
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:07,360
Mian.

397
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,000
Mother told me to untie you.

398
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,280
If you run away again,

399
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,280
your debt will be doubled.

400
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:05,600
Here.

401
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,360
Mother told the Chinese doctor to give you some medicine.

402
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:11,088
Drink this.

403
00:31:11,256 --> 00:31:12,880
So you have the strength to run.

404
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:28,592
Nual.

405
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,720
If you don't have a husband,

406
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:34,720
you won't die.

407
00:31:35,672 --> 00:31:37,040
But you will die

408
00:31:37,184 --> 00:31:39,400
if you let him hurt you like this.

409
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:08,760
Boonta.

410
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:12,680
Nual.

411
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,896
I'm sorry, Boonta.

412
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:21,840
You got hurt because of me.

413
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:24,400
It's fine.

414
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:27,560
At least my back saved a beating.

415
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:29,944
I'm glad you're all right.

416
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,120
Boonta.

417
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,880
- Drink some medicine. - Okay.

418
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:39,920
- Are you alright? - Boonta.

419
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:43,440
Come on.

420
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:49,960
It didn't hurt this much on set. Why does the real thing hurt so much?

421
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:52,988
- Your medicine. - Thank you.

422
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:55,504
Drink it hot.

423
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:05,694
Boonta!

424
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,279
It's so bitter!

425
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:11,400
It's Chinese medicine.

426
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:16,960
Mother bought this from a Chinese doctor. This is expensive.

427
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:18,240
Do you know?

428
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:19,520
In this medicine,

429
00:33:19,654 --> 00:33:21,320
there are skins and roots,

430
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,520
and flesh and dried leaves of many plants.

431
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,149
There are also bones and bugs

432
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:26,920
and a centipede's carcass.

433
00:33:27,475 --> 00:33:29,320
I think the medicine will more likely kill me.

434
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,280
I can't drink it. Drink it if you can.

435
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:32,960
I'd rather die.

436
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:36,480
- Yeah. - Hey, it's...

437
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,280
Will I survive until the solar eclipse next month?

438
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:45,837
Boonta can't drink the medicine you gave her.

439
00:33:45,935 --> 00:33:48,080
Do you have something easier to swallow?

440
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,800
- Of course. - Thanks.

441
00:33:50,216 --> 00:33:51,640
What's wrong with Boonta?

442
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,320
- Aunt! - You're looking for trouble!

443
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:07,000
Why would you tell Luang this?

444
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,600
I feel sorry for her.

445
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,480
If she sees the man she loves, she'll get better.

446
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:13,687
Captain Jon's coming to take her soon.

447
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,080
Let her spend the time she has left with Luang.

448
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,600
If Mother finds out, we're all screwed.

449
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,440
Don't let her know then.

450
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,607
Five.

451
00:34:34,568 --> 00:34:35,720
Me?

452
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,000
You lost. Do your job.

453
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:48,280
Wait, sir.

454
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,719
Won't this be a big deal?

455
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,600
If you hesitate, it's going to be.

456
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,000
You need to hurry, sir.

457
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:55,861
Ming can't stall Mother for long.

458
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:59,560
I won't be long. Wait here.

459
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:01,080
Yes, sir.

460
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:08,479
Luang?

461
00:36:08,943 --> 00:36:10,440
How did you get here, sir?

462
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:18,120
Someone told me you were sick and wanted to see me.

463
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:20,280
Maybe you'd feel better.

464
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:23,600
Aunt Mian.

465
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:27,600
You're a police, not a doctor. How would that help?

466
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,640
Does it hurt badly?

467
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:38,120
Why won't you drink the medicine?

468
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,120
A potion from a centipede's carcass?

469
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,040
Who could possibly drink that?

470
00:36:46,097 --> 00:36:47,600
Can you drink that?

471
00:36:54,944 --> 00:36:57,400
If I drink it and you get healed,

472
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,040
I would have.

473
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:03,240
I don't want to see you hurting.

474
00:37:12,512 --> 00:37:14,640
If during this age

475
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
we had great doctors, that would be nice.

476
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,080
We have doctors from the West now.

477
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,640
Doctor Bradley.

478
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,440
Could you ask Doctor Bradley to heal me?

479
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:37,520
Doctor Bradley?

480
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,280
Who is he?

481
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:42,560
He's a foreign doctor.

482
00:37:46,216 --> 00:37:47,760
A European doctor.

483
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:50,840
I saw "Royal Doctor."

484
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,920
He must be at Kudi Chin.

485
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:03,200
I'll look for him.

486
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,000
Thank you, sir.

487
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,000
Who's out there?

488
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,360
Who's there?

489
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:20,080
I said who's there?

490
00:38:23,395 --> 00:38:24,567
What the heck?

491
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,440
Pudsorn?

492
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,320
What are you doing with the ladder?

493
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:37,200
Well, it's Ming and his friends.

494
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,582
They used this to climb and get some betel.

495
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:41,920
They left it there. I went to the toilet.

496
00:38:42,016 --> 00:38:43,320
I tripped on it.

497
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,280
I'm putting it away.

498
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,080
Is that true, Ming?

499
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:52,014
Yes, Mother.

500
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:53,720
I'll put it away right now.

501
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,200
That's Boonta's window.

502
00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:05,200
Why is it open?

503
00:39:05,903 --> 00:39:07,520
Doesn't she have a fever?

504
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:46,920
Mother!

505
00:39:49,272 --> 00:39:50,840
What are you doing?

506
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,120
Why is Boonta covering herself like this?

507
00:40:01,444 --> 00:40:02,560
Well...

508
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,960
Boonta is shaking with a fever.

509
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:07,280
She just drank some medicine and fell asleep.

510
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:15,040
You left the window open.

511
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:17,000
Her fever is going to get worse.

512
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:25,726
Mother.

513
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:26,960
We should leave her.

514
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:28,535
Let Boonta rest.

515
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,160
Please.

516
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,040
Stay like this until you're sure.

517
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,960
If you move again,

518
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:28,120
my wound is going to open all the way to Mars.

519
00:41:55,408 --> 00:41:56,560
Boonta!

520
00:41:56,953 --> 00:41:59,200
It's rude. Why would you sit beside the police?

521
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,440
Sorry, sir.

522
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,080
Is it morning already?

523
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,280
Luang?

524
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:15,360
Screw me!

525
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:41,600
Go back to sleep.

526
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,480
I'll bring the doctor to you.

527
00:45:19,496 --> 00:45:20,520
Aunt...

528
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:24,040
Here's some Rangrai.

529
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:25,783
Thanks.

530
00:46:33,944 --> 00:46:35,920
You're in such a good mood.

531
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,040
You made a lot of money with this round of sales, right?

532
00:46:41,895 --> 00:46:44,640
Soon we will make profits like we used to.

533
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,200
Trading

534
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,040
will never be as certain

535
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,160
as being in charge of bird nest tax.

536
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,400
How did Dokgaew's negotiation with Luang Thukkarat go?

537
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,400
Dokgaew said

538
00:47:00,744 --> 00:47:05,320
Chim, Luang Thukkarat, is hopeful with his bid.

539
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,200
The senior officials seem to favor him.

540
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,960
If we want to win,

541
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,880
it's not going to be easy.

542
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:18,920
They put up a front as honest businessmen.

543
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,800
Behind the back, they're using nepotism all the same.

544
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,080
Never mind.

545
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,600
We have time before the day of bidding.

546
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,120
Winds can change direction.

547
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,304
This hairpin,

548
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,080
whose is it, dear?

549
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,600
It belonged to one of my debtors.

550
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,200
She paid the debt with this.

551
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:49,120
I felt pity so I accepted it.

552
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,440
If you want it,

553
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,200
it's yours.

554
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,720
Find out

555
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,480
if this hairpin belongs to Boonta or not.

556
00:48:28,192 --> 00:48:29,392
Yes, ma'am.

557
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,840
Doctor Bradley?

558
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,680
As far as I know,

559
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,920
we don't have a European doctor by the name of Bradley at Kudi Chin.

560
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:47,200
Is that so?

561
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,350
Why did Boonta say that then?

562
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,440
For what matter do you wish to see that doctor?

563
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,120
A patient can't drink Chinese medicine.

564
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,440
She would like a European medicine.

565
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,760
I have a medicine for fever.

566
00:49:03,936 --> 00:49:05,560
Please wait here.

567
00:49:16,712 --> 00:49:19,160
This is a European medicine for fever, sir.

568
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,320
How much is it?

569
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,160
It's free for you, sir.

570
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:31,600
Tubtim is our customer. She frequently buys jewelry from Mr. Hunter.

571
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,280
This medicine costs so little

572
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,400
compared to her patronage.

573
00:49:36,327 --> 00:49:37,480
For you, sir.

574
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,920
Thank you, Sup.

575
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,520
And Mr. Hunter.

576
00:50:03,728 --> 00:50:04,920
Chaai!

577
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:15,280
Where has work taken you?

578
00:50:15,383 --> 00:50:16,895
Why did you come home so late?

579
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,840
I was a little sick,

580
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,200
so I stayed at Chao Phraya Yommarat's house.

581
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,120
And I went to buy medicine from Mr. Hunter this morning.

582
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,960
Chaai, what's wrong with you?

583
00:50:30,671 --> 00:50:32,200
Are you seriously ill?

584
00:50:32,431 --> 00:50:34,431
Is that why you require European medicine?

585
00:50:35,528 --> 00:50:38,560
- Yod, how did you let your boss get sick? - Ouch, Mother!

586
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,480
It wasn't serious.

587
00:50:43,032 --> 00:50:44,320
It's just a small fever.

588
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,239
I took some medicine. I'll get better soon.

589
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,840
I'll go and get changed.

590
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:57,000
Even if it wasn't serious,

591
00:50:57,081 --> 00:50:58,800
you have to rest and recover.

592
00:50:58,904 --> 00:51:01,920
I'll ask Puek to cover your work for now.

593
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,240
I'm fine, Mother.

594
00:51:03,392 --> 00:51:04,640
I can still work.

595
00:51:08,807 --> 00:51:10,560
I don't think you can.

596
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:31,920
- Yod. - Yes, sir.

597
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:55,960
You can't climb up today.

598
00:51:57,415 --> 00:52:00,240
I'm just here to give Boonta her medicine.

599
00:52:11,456 --> 00:52:13,160
Why does this smell like your soup?

600
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:15,920
Well, it's my soup.

601
00:52:16,088 --> 00:52:18,520
You spend the whole night with Luang.

602
00:52:18,671 --> 00:52:20,800
Maybe you could get knocked up.

603
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:25,120
It's not just that, Aunt. Before he left, I saw him kiss her too.

604
00:52:25,263 --> 00:52:27,160
What about what I didn't see?

605
00:52:27,256 --> 00:52:28,920
Boonta...

606
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:30,280
A kiss?

607
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:35,320
Did that really happen?

608
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,320
Aunt, I'm still hurt. What could we have done?

609
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:42,880
Why would I know?

610
00:52:43,342 --> 00:52:44,920
The two of us just

611
00:52:45,056 --> 00:52:47,600
fell asleep together. That's all.

612
00:52:48,435 --> 00:52:50,680
Fine. Whatever you say. Just drink it.

613
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:52,480
And take the medicine Luang sent you.

614
00:52:53,138 --> 00:52:55,000
- He got her medicine. - Of course.

615
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,160
What's this med?

616
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,110
What is this?

617
00:53:08,672 --> 00:53:09,760
Aunt.

618
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,240
Is this a Dharma question?

619
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,920
It's like what I saw on a temple's mural.

620
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:18,880
Wait.

621
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:20,606
See, this picture.

622
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:22,400
Take the medicine.

623
00:53:22,848 --> 00:53:25,080
This picture means you die.

624
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,400
- And then go to heaven. - Is that so, Aunt?

625
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,240
Luang can't be poisoning Boonta. Let me see.

626
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,200
I think it's "take this medicine,"

627
00:53:33,383 --> 00:53:37,640
"sleep and get some rest," and "recover!"

628
00:53:37,783 --> 00:53:40,480
- You shocked me, Aunt. - Boonta.

629
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,160
You can sit up now?

630
00:53:42,793 --> 00:53:43,910
Yes.

631
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,360
I got a good medicine, Mother.

632
00:53:46,551 --> 00:53:49,351
Thank you for paying for my medicine.

633
00:53:53,232 --> 00:53:54,392
What's that smell?

634
00:53:54,624 --> 00:53:56,000
It smells like Mian's soup.

635
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:57,400
My soup?

636
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,480
I boiled some medicine.

637
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:03,240
And put it in a bowl of soup.

638
00:54:03,336 --> 00:54:07,320
So that's how it's got that smell.

639
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,640
If she's fine, you two can go back to work. Go.

640
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:17,120
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:54:20,146 --> 00:54:22,600
Take this with you, Aunt.

642
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,800
Oh? Won't you drink it?

643
00:54:24,896 --> 00:54:26,880
Hey, we didn't...

644
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:29,979
- Keep your medicine well. Aunt, come on. - What if she gets knocked up?

645
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,640
Hey, you.

646
00:54:31,744 --> 00:54:33,240
Don't drag me around.

647
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,200
Thank you, sir.

648
00:54:52,546 --> 00:54:53,820
Oh, wow! Aunt?

649
00:54:53,931 --> 00:54:56,120
Did you win a lottery or something?

650
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:59,651
We're celebrating your recovery. I'm going all out.

651
00:54:59,732 --> 00:55:02,320
- Thank you. - Yeah.

652
00:55:03,888 --> 00:55:05,080
You're fine now.

653
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:06,440
Eat a lot.

654
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:07,928
Thank you.

655
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,000
This curry, I helped Aunt Mian cook it.

656
00:55:12,128 --> 00:55:13,800
- Eat a lot. - It's good.

657
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:15,200
Thanks.

658
00:55:16,888 --> 00:55:19,385
Look. I picked these vegetables myself.

659
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:21,960
Thank you.

660
00:55:22,137 --> 00:55:24,600
- Sesbania flower. - Dip it in the chili stew.

661
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:26,400
Okay, Aunt.

662
00:55:26,898 --> 00:55:30,600
Yeah. I boiled this neem myself. It's sweet.

663
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:33,960
- Really? - You girls seem happy with her recovery.

664
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:37,798
I had to get well soon, Mother. We have to make money.

665
00:55:37,911 --> 00:55:41,280
Otherwise, we won't have money to pay our debt to you.

666
00:55:41,431 --> 00:55:43,120
I'm glad you realize that now.

667
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,632
Yeah.

668
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:47,878
Don't let me see

669
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:51,320
any of you sneak out to see your husband again.

670
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,640
Men love you when they do.

671
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,800
When they don't, they throw you away.

672
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:59,560
If he's a jerk, he'd even sell you to a brothel.

673
00:56:00,176 --> 00:56:03,600
Just work hard and free yourselves.

674
00:56:04,688 --> 00:56:05,880
Yeah.

675
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:09,929
Free myself? I'm staying here.

676
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,640
Mother is not angry anymore.

677
00:56:13,855 --> 00:56:15,855
Please don't upset her again.

678
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:18,400
Some things can be stopped.

679
00:56:18,591 --> 00:56:20,591
But Nual's love for her husband?

680
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,220
That's not one of them.

681
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,920
If you can't stop,

682
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,720
you can love who you want.

683
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,480
Just don't forget to love yourself too.

684
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,600
Your heart matters too.

685
00:56:32,879 --> 00:56:36,960
I don't know how you feel as a wife.

686
00:56:37,376 --> 00:56:39,200
But as a fellow woman,

687
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,800
I want you to really think of yourself.

688
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,480
If you love someone, make sure you love yourself too.

689
00:56:47,855 --> 00:56:48,960
She's right.

690
00:56:52,912 --> 00:56:55,240
Eat up. These are for young girls.

691
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,720
San is the only person in my life.

692
00:57:01,311 --> 00:57:03,760
Can I really let go of him?

693
00:57:04,847 --> 00:57:06,600
If you can't, it's fine.

694
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,520
Just don't forget

695
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:10,560
you will always have us right here.

696
00:57:26,135 --> 00:57:30,068
Boonta "Nail & Massage."

697
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:33,040
I'm going to start a manicure and massaging business.

698
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:40,920
If you just keep watching over her

699
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,320
without being honest with your feelings,

700
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,480
you could regret it again, Chaai.

701
00:57:45,592 --> 00:57:47,400
Could you stay still for a moment?

702
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:49,040
I'll help you tie your hair.

703
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,103
You got extra money from last night's guest?

704
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,560
A bland-looking woman like you

705
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,120
will never get to be his regular.

706
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,040
Then let's find out once and for all.

707
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,520
I'm going to make an "event" where you compete for guests.

708
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:09,140
Why did you bring these things?

709
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:12,160
You need to pour like an escort girl.
