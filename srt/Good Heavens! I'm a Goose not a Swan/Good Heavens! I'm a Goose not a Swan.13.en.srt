1
00:02:26,484 --> 00:02:29,320
The suspect is probably getting what he deserves, right?

2
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:30,520
He will.

3
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,949
You're punishable by up to 50 flogging with a leather whip

4
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,560
and up to four times fine.

5
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:36,160
You're doing all you're doing

6
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:37,880
because you wanted her!

7
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:40,240
You ended up in the jail she went to.

8
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:41,800
It's all because of you, Chaai.

9
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:43,880
I'll make your life a living hell!

10
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:46,160
Navigating is not the only thing I can do.

11
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm capable

12
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:48,720
of news hunting too.

13
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:52,080
I heard Sarang saying that with my own ears.

14
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:55,920
Didn't they say Captain Henry came to do business in trade?

15
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:58,160
Why would he bring a battleship?

16
00:02:58,397 --> 00:02:59,680
I have money!

17
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:01,280
I want to sleep with Boonta.

18
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:04,680
If you're here to pick a fight, go back to where you came from, Sarang.

19
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,520
Come on. I'll take care of you, sir.

20
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,520
Why did you hire Sarang and pay him a lot

21
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:12,043
to spread the rumor, master?

22
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:14,960
Let's give Chaai some work to do.

23
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,320
(Episode 13: Work Hard... Love Harder)

24
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:37,160
I pour this cup for you. Please have a drink.

25
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:42,040
I want you to drink with me.

26
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:46,476
I have had a lot of drinks, sir.

27
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,040
Let me feed you, sir.

28
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:50,282
Come on.

29
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:52,240
Hey!

30
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,589
I told you to drink. You must drink!

31
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,840
Drink it! Drink!

32
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,400
Drink it in... Ouch!

33
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:06,843
Who threw something at my head?

34
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:10,040
Sorry. My hand slipped. I didn't mean it.

35
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,680
Boonta.

36
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,520
You dare hurt me?

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
I'll teach you a lesson today.

38
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:19,320
Come on, then.

39
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:21,160
Oh, sorry again.

40
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:22,520
My foot slipped too.

41
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,800
Boonta!

42
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,520
If you don't stop, I'll behead you right here.

43
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,880
These people gang up on me!

44
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:33,800
Why don't you arrest them?

45
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:35,547
They say

46
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:38,160
you're so blindly obsessed with a courtesan.

47
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:40,800
- Perhaps that's true! - If you don't shut up,

48
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,600
I'll give you another charge!

49
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,640
What's going on, sir?

50
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:46,640
This jerk, Sarang,

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,640
spread rumors that the Europeans were invading Siam with battleships.

52
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:53,000
The Royal Heir has ordered us to take him in for questioning.

53
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:56,767
Your punishment is equivalent to treason.

54
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:00,640
You won't get away easily like you did with opium.

55
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,602
The whole market can be a witness.

56
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
What's your defense?

57
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,600
I heard this from Captain Sut with my own ears.

58
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:17,720
The European army in Singapore

59
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,400
is ready to march on us, Your Highness.

60
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,400
The Guardian, the ambassador's ship,

61
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:24,080
which has sailed to Penang,

62
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:25,680
will return

63
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,840
to launch an immediate attack on us.

64
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:31,320
Are you accusing the ambassadors who came in for trade deals

65
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,960
of starting a war against us?

66
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:35,560
Is that so?

67
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,920
Captain Henry

68
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:42,280
was the one who reported our movement

69
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,240
to Residence Singapore.

70
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:47,240
He's also secretly in contact with the Raya of Ligor.

71
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:49,680
If he wasn't sending intel to the European army

72
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,760
in order to march on Siam,

73
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:53,270
what else could he be doing, Your Highness?

74
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:54,480
You jerk!

75
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:56,840
You dare make such serious accusations against me!

76
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,760
Because I swore allegiance to my homeland!

77
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:00,240
I can't stand to see my home

78
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:02,640
get invaded by cunning Europeans like you!

79
00:06:02,854 --> 00:06:04,160
How dare you!

80
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:07,120
I spent efforts

81
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:10,760
to ensure Siam that Great Britain meant no harm.

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,320
Three months of my work

83
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:15,640
has gone down the drain

84
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,320
because of your foolish blabbering!

85
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:24,142
Do you believe his words?

86
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:26,520
The words out of his mouth!

87
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:30,520
Had the Guardian sailed to Penang

88
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,760
with intentions of being your enemy, as he said,

89
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:39,760
why would my family and I have stayed in Siam?

90
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,240
The Captain's reasoning does make sense.

91
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,800
However, he is under your supervision.

92
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,680
His defense cannot be ignored.

93
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:00,600
Lately, this Sarang man

94
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:02,936
has been bragging about the European's protection

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,360
and causing chaos.

96
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:08,320
His words do not carry enough weight to be believed as such.

97
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,040
I'm doing this

98
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,960
for the good of our nation!

99
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,520
I'd be happy to serve you.

100
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,800
If you appoint me as a port master,

101
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,880
I will be your spy.

102
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:26,400
Sarang!

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,960
I wanted to believe you at first,

104
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:31,320
had you not shown your true colors!

105
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:35,120
Why would we appoint an ambitious man like you

106
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:37,262
in that position to leech off of the nation?

107
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:39,040
If we wanted intel,

108
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:42,960
a port master would report the European movement to us!

109
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:45,280
You made serious false claims.

110
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:49,200
You stirred divide and distrust.

111
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,280
You've become a serious threat to the nation.

112
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,240
What you did

113
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
is no different from treason!

114
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:57,480
Lock him up!

115
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,840
What he did is equivalent to treason.

116
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:01,957
(Chao Praya Pra Klang)

117
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:03,600
However, this Sarang man

118
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840
is under the European's supervision.

119
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:08,960
We should allow Captain Henry

120
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,560
to take him in and lock him up.

121
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:12,217
That would be better, Your Highness.

122
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,280
What do you say,

123
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:17,600
Captain?

124
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:19,640
To show sincerity

125
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:23,360
and prove we do not intend to be your enemy,

126
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:25,240
as he has claimed,

127
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,800
I would allow Siam

128
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,800
to have his custody.

129
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,520
That's until the Guardian returns.

130
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,280
When that time comes,

131
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:37,680
I will take him for a trial

132
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:40,400
in Residence Singapore immediately.

133
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:43,560
That's settled.

134
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:47,240
Lock him up in the Police Jail.

135
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:51,600
Please have mercy!

136
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,240
I'm not a traitor.

137
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:55,720
I was following Magnate Thong's order!

138
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,160
Please have mercy!

139
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:58,680
Please have mercy!

140
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm not a traitor!

141
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,360
Me?

142
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:09,120
I hired Sarang?

143
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,680
Last time, he led me into a conflict with Captain Jam.

144
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:14,640
This Sarang man

145
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,720
has always been a liar.

146
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,720
How could you believe his words?

147
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,200
But witnesses saw Sarang

148
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,080
wandering around your warehouse.

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,040
He's unemployed.

150
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:27,920
He came to me to ask for work.

151
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,720
I refused. He got angry and accused me.

152
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:34,720
If you want a witness,

153
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,760
I have a witness to support my statement.

154
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,080
There have been plenty of paid witnesses.

155
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,360
How can I be sure

156
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,498
that the witness is not under your influence?

157
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,120
I can guarantee with my life.

158
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,840
I just went on trial.

159
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:51,560
I wouldn't dare look for trouble again.

160
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,596
Due to a lack of evidence and witnesses,

161
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,760
Magnate Thong got away again.

162
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,480
Sarang's words cannot be believed,

163
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,200
but we shouldn't ignore him.

164
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:19,429
We have to report to Chao Praya Yommarat.

165
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:21,000
He'll report to the King.

166
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,836
The fortress around the capital should be repaired immediately.

167
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:29,080
It's a shame Sarang is under European protection.

168
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:33,280
Otherwise, he would have been beheaded for such a serious crime.

169
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:34,960
Jail is not enough.

170
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:41,432
If something happens to him in jail,

171
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:44,320
that won't be good either.

172
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:05,320
Chaai is here. Let's eat together.

173
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,960
Mother was talking about you.

174
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:21,680
What's going on, Mother?

175
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:27,200
(You can hold a big event with a large crowd.)

176
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:31,640
(And use that opportunity to announce Chaai's wedding to Dokgaew.)

177
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,760
(He won't dare to embarrass you in an event.)

178
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:39,520
I would like to know when you can take time off from work.

179
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:43,200
I want to hold a merit-making event with all our family.

180
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:49,200
Perhaps this is a matchmaking event again.

181
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:52,388
Yod, what did you say?

182
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:55,200
Yod told me we have to go out of town this month.

183
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,760
It will be a while before I can take time off.

184
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,480
So how long will you be away?

185
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:04,243
For a month, Brother.

186
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,000
It looks like that event is not happening, Mother.

187
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,400
I can wait.

188
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:12,400
You can go out of town as long as you need.

189
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:17,160
At least you won't have time to spend with that vile woman.

190
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:24,320
Why are we thinking about a stranger?

191
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:25,800
We should be eating.

192
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,320
I'm full.

193
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,560
Kerd, Yam, get some desserts.

194
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:32,720
Yes, master.

195
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
What took you so long?

196
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,920
You're so late.

197
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,631
Puek.

198
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,400
Were you talking about me?

199
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,560
I mean my boat, Chaai.

200
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:13,560
If you're ready, we should get going.

201
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:17,680
Wait, Chaai.

202
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:19,600
Don't go yet.

203
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:21,435
Dokgaew.

204
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:22,858
What are you doing here so early?

205
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:29,200
I made a scented bag for you.

206
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,600
I found out from...

207
00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:35,560
From Mrs. Tubtim, you're going out of town, sir.

208
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
That's right.

209
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,640
I know you like this scent.

210
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,040
So I made it for you to carry with you.

211
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:50,560
It will remind you of home.

212
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,600
And it will

213
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:55,640
remind you of me.

214
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:05,440
Please accept it, Chaai.

215
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,680
Dokgaew just woke up...

216
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,760
I mean, she spent all night making it for you.

217
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:13,640
Please accept her courtesy.

218
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:24,760
What about mine?

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,080
Don't I get one?

220
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:29,080
You don't, sir.

221
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,320
You're so heartless.

222
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:38,000
You can say goodbye to Chaai however you want then.

223
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:45,400
I wish you a safe journey.

224
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,480
Be safe and take care...

225
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,680
Wait, Chaai!

226
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:53,040
You didn't even finish your sentence.

227
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,040
Where is he rushing off to?

228
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:58,840
There's only one place he would go.

229
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,160
To work, ma'am.

230
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:06,560
I have to go, ma'am.

231
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:29,578
Oh, Sis! Your nails look great!

232
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,480
Are you here to do nails, Boonta?

233
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,960
No. I'm here to buy stuff for Mother.

234
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,520
Do you want to change the color of your nails?

235
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:43,400
Not yet. Your nail polish from last time

236
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,160
still looks good!

237
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,280
Hey, this is for you.

238
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,040
And this too.

239
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:53,219
Thank you.

240
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,320
If you want to change colors, tell me anytime.

241
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:59,440
New colors and patterns are now available. They're all lit.

242
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:01,880
Okay.

243
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,713
- Thank you. - Yeah.

244
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,053
Boonta, you're on such a roll lately.

245
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:13,200
She did nails, and people loved it.

246
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,320
And the "boofay" that you did for Mother?

247
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,080
That made a lot of money!

248
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:22,880
Mother seems to be favoring you and your Luang lately too.

249
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:26,110
Maybe she would even allow him to marry you.

250
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:27,644
- Hey! - No...

251
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:33,760
When did you get here?

252
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:42,520
- Lamjeak! - Yes?

253
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:47,480
I forgot! Mother needs clothes to make monk robes.

254
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,694
- Help me pick some clothes. - Okay.

255
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,240
- We'll be at the clothes store. - Let's go, Aunt.

256
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Are you going out of town again?

257
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,000
The King summoned

258
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:17,880
Chao Anuwong's subordinates, who had helped prepare the royal funeral

259
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,280
for the previous King.

260
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:21,603
The mission is to collect palm wood from Suphan Buri.

261
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:25,200
Chao Anuwong assigned Chao Rachawong to lead this mission.

262
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:30,120
Puek and I were summoned to help oversee the force.

263
00:17:32,248 --> 00:17:33,414
So...

264
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:37,160
This does have something to do with Sarang's case.

265
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,920
Not just his case.

266
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,442
The Chinese also have intel

267
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:43,600
from Penang and Singapore.

268
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
We need fortresses around the rivers.

269
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:50,400
Puek and Yod are waiting at the port.

270
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:52,960
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

271
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:56,589
I'll miss you, Chaai.

272
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,178
You're too honest.

273
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:04,996
If I miss you, I'll say it.

274
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:07,320
If I care about you, I'll say it too.

275
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,160
What if I feel possessive?

276
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:21,480
It's up to you to feel that way.

277
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:29,825
You're allowing me to feel now.

278
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,320
So please wait for me.

279
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:35,520
When I come back, I'll buy your freedom as promised.

280
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,040
I hope you don't start a "chatting phase" with someone else.

281
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,440
I chat with one person at a time, sir.

282
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:46,160
I should say that about you.

283
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,560
Don't hit on someone else.

284
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,560
This is a sudden mission.

285
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,080
I don't have a goodbye gift,

286
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:02,480
except...

287
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:17,497
What about you?

288
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,240
Do you have something to remind me of you?

289
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,720
This, sir.

290
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,360
A Chan-ab?

291
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,160
I got it for "free." I didn't buy it.

292
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:51,440
Don't you know what they use this dessert for?

293
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:56,280
I don't.

294
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:00,200
What do they use it for?

295
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:18,040
From whose wedding did that snack come?

296
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:19,600
It looks yummy.

297
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:22,320
You've had breakfast, haven't you?

298
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,040
Don't eat too much.

299
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:27,640
You're possessive of a dessert.

300
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:30,480
Perhaps it's a reminder of someone.

301
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:49,840
If you see this,

302
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,174
can you still smile?

303
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,080
What did you say?

304
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:11,280
Why did I think about her feelings?

305
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,560
Pudsorn said you wanted to see me.

306
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:29,400
What is it, Mother?

307
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:30,574
Sit down.

308
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:35,920
Are you good with numbers?

309
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:40,200
Well, if it's something simple,

310
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,280
not solving an equation, then I can do that.

311
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:46,217
So...

312
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:48,320
I want you to help me out with accounting

313
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:50,880
so I don't have to hire a clerk.

314
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,960
Back at work and off with a bang, huh?

315
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:57,320
What did you say?

316
00:21:58,363 --> 00:21:59,480
Nothing, Mother.

317
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:03,480
Is that all you would like me to do?

318
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,960
No. There's more.

319
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,120
What? Mother asked you to teach Kleeb to read.

320
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:13,240
Yeah. That's right.

321
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,640
Now I have to work non-stop.

322
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:18,480
Accounting is stressful enough.

323
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:20,600
Now I have to be a teacher too.

324
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,040
Mother said you're literate.

325
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:31,280
I want to be able to read and write like you.

326
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:35,240
You can't resist that cuteness.

327
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:38,200
You're too sweet, Young Miss.

328
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,360
Fine.

329
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,280
Look. I failed my Thai exam, but I know the letters

330
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:46,400
to the T!

331
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:48,960
What did you write?

332
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:50,220
It looks strange.

333
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:52,640
- Yeah. - How are these strange?

334
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:57,400
They're regular Thai alphabets. Kor Kai, Khor Khai, Khor Khuad, Khor Khwai.

335
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:00,400
Is this not the alphabet of this era?

336
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,919
How do you write the alphabet?

337
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,280
We never went to school. How would we know?

338
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,030
None of you went to school?

339
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:14,068
Do you even have schools in this era?

340
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,120
We women are taught household chores in childhood.

341
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,840
All we do is firewood, water, rice, and planting.

342
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,600
Only the rich girls get to learn handicrafts

343
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
and become staff in the palace.

344
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:27,360
You may not be an expert,

345
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,960
but you're much luckier than us, Boonta.

346
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:39,080
Since I have to teach anyway,

347
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:41,680
let's learn together, shall we?

348
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,480
No!

349
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:45,520
Why not, Aunt?

350
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:47,440
I'm too old for that.

351
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,320
I would embarrass myself in front of Kleeb.

352
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,704
Are you sure Mother brought you to buy books here?

353
00:23:56,824 --> 00:23:59,640
I'm not sure, but this is all I remember.

354
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:06,101
Hey.

355
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:08,840
Don't even think about it.

356
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,211
Young Miss!

357
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:33,320
You have both black and white papers?

358
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,840
There are white books and black books.

359
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,640
Black books are written with white pencils.

360
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,731
White books are written with black pencils.

361
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:45,520
You can also use Chinese ink

362
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:48,640
or ashes mixed with tree sap.

363
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,440
What color would you like?

364
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,800
These are beautiful, sir.

365
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,695
These are gold leaves,

366
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,400
pearl powder,

367
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,280
and yellow orpiment.

368
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:05,080
Use tree sap glue and cover it with gold leaves,

369
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:06,907
you can make black books with gold linings.

370
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:08,360
If you use pearl powder,

371
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,160
mixed with colors, and cover it with gold leaves,

372
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:12,896
it becomes a black book with pearl linings.

373
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,520
Use yellow orpiment mixed with wood apple sap,

374
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,960
and you can also make black books with yellow linings.

375
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:22,400
There are pearls and gold.

376
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:25,040
That's so lit and fire.

377
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,400
Who got lit on fire?

378
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:29,160
No one, sir.

379
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:32,160
So the book that

380
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:34,200
we ruined...

381
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:35,680
What book was the one

382
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,360
that fell in the water?

383
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:38,800
We can buy a new one for you.

384
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:52,480
If I need to buy all of this, it would take all my money.

385
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,480
The most expensive thing I have is probably this hairpin, sir.

386
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:06,640
I'm not a scriber. A regular book would do just fine.

387
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:09,280
That took all my money, sir.

388
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:10,600
Fortunately,

389
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:13,040
I still have something of value left.

390
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,280
I told you it was fine.

391
00:26:16,404 --> 00:26:18,520
Yet you insist on paying me back.

392
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:21,440
I don't like to owe someone.

393
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,720
I made your book fall in the water. I have to pay it back

394
00:26:24,986 --> 00:26:27,560
even if it costs me my own book.

395
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:31,880
Boonta.

396
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:35,160
Do you teach?

397
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:39,360
I'm just a makeshift "teacher," sir.

398
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,120
It's my first day on the job, and I'm in trouble.

399
00:26:42,797 --> 00:26:44,800
Hey! Don't smile.

400
00:26:46,003 --> 00:26:47,960
You're not only good at cooking,

401
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,520
but your language also proves interesting.

402
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:54,320
What if I enroll in your class?

403
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:56,960
Don't even try, sir.

404
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,920
It's not that I mind you, sir.

405
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:04,200
It's just our BBQ business is going well.

406
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm afraid your mother would come and bomb us.

407
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,840
Let's go, Young Miss.

408
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:13,720
Let's not get bombed, right?

409
00:27:28,236 --> 00:27:30,160
I don't have a single feung left.

410
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:36,520
What money would I use to buy books now?

411
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:41,520
Hey, you should give up.

412
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:44,480
We're not lucky enough to be your students.

413
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:47,840
Hey, Aunt! Don't give up yet.

414
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:49,640
If we don't have books,

415
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:52,800
we can take turns and write on the board.

416
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:58,200
By the time we all have our turns, we will be too old to learn.

417
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,680
Are papers worth as much as gold in this era?

418
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,080
Maybe

419
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:08,480
I should drop my business

420
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:10,720
and start a paper factory?

421
00:28:10,808 --> 00:28:13,240
- She's thinking big. - If you really want to teach,

422
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,040
I know someone who works in a paper factory.

423
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,600
"Jinjja?"

424
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:06,040
- Wow! - That looks like oatmeal.

425
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:21,200
Thank you so much, sir.

426
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,960
We now have a lot of books to write on.

427
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,000
I'll need you to teach Ming too.

428
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,320
I want him to be literate.

429
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:33,560
Maybe he can get a better job in the future.

430
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:35,281
Of course, sir.

431
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:37,014
I'm going to do my best.

432
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:40,400
I'll make these books worthwhile.

433
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,160
Now we're talking!

434
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:48,880
Yeah.

435
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:52,582
Thank you, sir.

436
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,785
- Say thank you. Thank you. - Thank you.

437
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:21,407
It's raining so hard.

438
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Let's take shelter inside.

439
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:28,280
It rains the first day we got here.

440
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:30,760
The work has stalled.

441
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,200
Our people are more fatigued than expected.

442
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,040
If this goes on,

443
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,130
I'm afraid we will be too weak to continue.

444
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:50,960
Come on! Quick!

445
00:32:52,956 --> 00:32:55,800
- Whoa! - Come on, help!

446
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:57,920
- Hold! Lift this off! - Together!

447
00:32:58,037 --> 00:33:01,289
- Come on! Lift! - Easy!

448
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,760
Together!

449
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,160
Come on!

450
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,840
Use your strength!

451
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:21,440
Why did you bring him here?

452
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:24,080
A tree fell on him. He's seriously injured.

453
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,320
Please get a doctor to see him.

454
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:27,960
He's not one of us.

455
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,560
Why didn't you take him to his place?

456
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:30,977
This is the nearest shelter, sir.

457
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:33,240
He can die somewhere else!

458
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:34,480
Not in my place!

459
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,800
Your King

460
00:33:39,924 --> 00:33:43,040
ordered my people to do the hard work here.

461
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,440
Don't you care at all?

462
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,920
If you don't like the way it is,

463
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:48,989
you can take your people and go home!

464
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:57,722
Hang on. I'll take you to the doctor in my cabin.

465
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:04,087
He's dead, sir.

466
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,960
When this mission is over,

467
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
I'll report this to my father.

468
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:22,080
I will no longer serve you Thais.

469
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,120
Praya Suriyamat went too far.

470
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,600
If Chao Rachawong tells Chao Anuwong of this,

471
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,967
and it upsets them,

472
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:43,360
we're going to have another unrest.

473
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,880
Help!

474
00:34:49,363 --> 00:34:51,640
Help! Someone help!

475
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,200
Someone help me!

476
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:56,312
Help!

477
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:57,600
Help!

478
00:34:57,807 --> 00:34:59,520
Help! Someone help!

479
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,040
Help!

480
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:12,200
Go!

481
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,240
Finally, we can start our class!

482
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,560
It's good to know how to read and write.

483
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:01,760
One day, it could prove useful.

484
00:37:03,702 --> 00:37:05,520
Let's start, all right?

485
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,358
First letter.

486
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:11,160
Kor Kai. Everyone, repeat after me. Kor Kai.

487
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:13,780
Kor Kai.

488
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:18,487
Write it down in your paper. I'll check.

489
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:21,000
- What do I write? - Kor Kai.

490
00:37:21,544 --> 00:37:24,640
Yeah. Young Miss, well done!

491
00:37:25,824 --> 00:37:27,334
Next letter.

492
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,280
Khor Khai.

493
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:32,800
Khor Khai.

494
00:37:33,023 --> 00:37:35,280
The next one is Khor Khuad.

495
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:38,040
Khor Khuad.

496
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,560
Next one.

497
00:37:40,748 --> 00:37:42,200
Khor Khwai.

498
00:37:42,388 --> 00:37:45,880
Khor Khwai.

499
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:47,640
Next one.

500
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:49,600
Khor Khon.

501
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:52,280
Khor Khon.

502
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:55,480
Well done.

503
00:37:57,371 --> 00:38:00,000
It's boring just to memorize these, right?

504
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:01,520
I think we should

505
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:05,320
use a song to help us learn.

506
00:38:05,745 --> 00:38:08,400
- Song? - Song? What song?

507
00:38:13,494 --> 00:38:16,200
- Mother! - Kleeb.

508
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,080
How was your study?

509
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:21,306
It was fun. We had "joy."

510
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:27,080
It was fun. We had "joy?"

511
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:30,720
Did Boonta not teach you to read and write?

512
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:33,760
She did, but singing is more "lit."

513
00:38:34,756 --> 00:38:35,960
"Lit?"

514
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,800
Sing that song for me, okay?

515
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,600
(A-ki-ka-poo, a-ki-ka-pa!)

516
00:38:47,732 --> 00:38:50,120
(Kor Kai says Kook.)

517
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:54,600
(Cockadoodledoo! Khor Khai wobbles.)

518
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:57,040
(It falls and breaks, splat!)

519
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,640
(Khor Khwai is goofy.)

520
00:38:59,818 --> 00:39:01,800
(Like a buffalo gag!)

521
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:04,320
(Ngor Ngoo goes round.)

522
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:06,069
(It growls "hiss hiss!")

523
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:07,731
Stop, sweetie! Wait!

524
00:39:12,629 --> 00:39:14,080
Boonta!

525
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:15,960
You!

526
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:18,320
You!

527
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:20,240
What did you teach my daughter?

528
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,080
I told you to teach her Thai and Math.

529
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:24,254
Don't put a song in it like...

530
00:39:24,335 --> 00:39:26,880
Splat! Pop-pop! Ah-ah!

531
00:39:28,045 --> 00:39:29,200
It's a rap, Mother.

532
00:39:29,295 --> 00:39:30,907
I don't like it!

533
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,480
A child her age likes to copy what they see.

534
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:36,160
Don't put anything weird in her head.

535
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:38,632
Did you call me, Mother?

536
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:42,232
It's nothing, sweetie.

537
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:46,200
I'm just telling Boonta to teach you better.

538
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:50,040
Boonta teaches well. "No cap." She's the "GOAT."

539
00:39:52,294 --> 00:39:53,520
Stop saying those things.

540
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,760
Your mother doesn't like it.

541
00:39:55,978 --> 00:40:00,120
Young Miss, let's show her how to count to ten instead.

542
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,040
"Okay. Number one."

543
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:06,240
That's it.

544
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:07,560
That's it.

545
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:12,640
One, two, three, four, five,

546
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:16,600
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

547
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:20,640
Well done, my baby!

548
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:23,160
Very good. That's more like it.

549
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:40,960
Oh my...

550
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:42,760
What did Mother say?

551
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,800
She was mad, as usual.

552
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,320
I'm used to it, though.

553
00:40:46,566 --> 00:40:47,960
You like to make her mad.

554
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:52,880
Yor...

555
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:54,680
What are you doing?

556
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,080
I'm practicing the alphabet that you taught.

557
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:03,560
If I get better at writing, I'll write a letter to my mother,

558
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,057
so I don't have to ask someone to tell her things

559
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:07,360
even if she's illiterate.

560
00:41:08,618 --> 00:41:10,400
Oh! It's Chor...

561
00:41:10,563 --> 00:41:12,243
Then, next time,

562
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,800
I'll start teaching you to write a simple sentence.

563
00:41:16,304 --> 00:41:19,480
Then I'll think of what to write.

564
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:24,360
When I'm literate, I'm going to teach Choi so we can communicate.

565
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:26,720
Yor...

566
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:29,319
When you get better at writing,

567
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,120
I'll check it out for you.

568
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:34,360
Then you'd know what I write.

569
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:39,800
Why would you be embarrassed? It's for your mom, right?

570
00:41:41,629 --> 00:41:43,560
Or is it not your mom? Someone else?

571
00:41:43,898 --> 00:41:45,600
So that's why it's a secret.

572
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,960
Don't make fun of me!

573
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:51,360
What about you? Won't you write to someone?

574
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,680
Your Luang!

575
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:56,880
Don't you want to write anything to him?

576
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:15,967
He's been gone for about a month now.

577
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'll just say I miss him.

578
00:42:22,221 --> 00:42:24,320
Why is it so hard?

579
00:42:28,105 --> 00:42:29,400
I can't call him.

580
00:42:29,735 --> 00:42:31,520
We can't do a video call either.

581
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:34,280
Even delivering a letter is hard.

582
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:38,840
(If you don't want to write it as a letter)

583
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,600
(because someone will read it, then write it as a memo.)

584
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,040
I think this is the only way.

585
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,000
What is that?

586
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,280
Let me guess, then.

587
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,760
It's a souvenir for Boonta, right?

588
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,600
You're making it yourself.

589
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,040
Longing is such a powerful feeling.

590
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:25,800
Stop making fun of me and eat your food.

591
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:35,290
Then let me ask you one last question.

592
00:44:37,406 --> 00:44:38,720
What's the shape of it?

593
00:44:39,553 --> 00:44:40,760
It's a goose, sir.

594
00:44:41,657 --> 00:44:43,320
He told me.

595
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Shouldn't it be a swan or at least a duck?

596
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,880
Why is it a goose?

597
00:45:02,844 --> 00:45:04,480
- There! - Oh yeah.

598
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:06,578
Go and buy the condiments I told you.

599
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:09,280
I have something to do. I'll be back.

600
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:12,880
Are you going to play the lottery again?

601
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:16,280
Don't say it too loud!

602
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:21,800
Your Luang is away. Now is my chance!

603
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,360
Aunt, the Luangs are away, but there are patrols.

604
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,040
If you get arrested this time,

605
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:32,400
the police won't let you out easily.

606
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,960
Why did you have to ruin my luck?

607
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:40,800
We won't get rich without taking a risk.

608
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:42,320
If you two don't like it,

609
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,840
don't go. It won't take long. I'll be back!

610
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,840
I have to make it!

611
00:45:53,861 --> 00:45:55,560
Please win.

612
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,360
Lamjeak!

613
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:01,880
Boonta?

614
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:04,880
What? Hey!

615
00:46:05,003 --> 00:46:06,840
Are you trying to win something too?

616
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:11,840
- Yeah. - And you just criticized me.

617
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:13,680
Aunt.

618
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:19,040
- Lamjeak! Hey... - Aunt...

619
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:25,520
Guai Bo!

620
00:46:30,629 --> 00:46:32,160
- What the heck? - Oh...

621
00:46:33,753 --> 00:46:35,360
- What, Boonta? - I won!

622
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:40,359
Did you get Guai Bo?

623
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,160
- Yes. - Where did you get it?

624
00:46:43,572 --> 00:46:45,652
Bua, from "Royal Doctor."

625
00:46:45,743 --> 00:46:47,743
She bought this. So I bought it too.

626
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,974
Why didn't I win?

627
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,680
- How much did you put in? - Two phai.

628
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:56,113
- How much do I win? - Two phai...

629
00:46:56,283 --> 00:46:57,520
Two baht!

630
00:46:57,974 --> 00:46:59,560
You won two baht!

631
00:47:00,305 --> 00:47:03,120
- Boonta! - Yay!

632
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:06,618
Police! The police are here!

633
00:47:12,532 --> 00:47:13,960
Whoa!

634
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,080
Move! Ah!

635
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,040
Where...

636
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:23,280
Stop!

637
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:29,280
Run...

638
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,960
Run!

639
00:47:45,315 --> 00:47:46,454
Get them!

640
00:47:56,171 --> 00:48:00,120
Thank you, but they're gone, sir.

641
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:07,040
Wait a little longer.

642
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:11,840
Let me go. Don't do this.

643
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:14,240
If someone sees this, it's...

644
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:15,880
It's indecent, sir.

645
00:48:16,218 --> 00:48:17,600
I'm just helping you.

646
00:48:17,753 --> 00:48:19,280
How is it indecent?

647
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,000
If you really want to help, let's talk outside, sir.

648
00:48:24,116 --> 00:48:26,800
Maybe I can change my mind

649
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:29,073
and accept your offer, right?

650
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:34,160
Really?

651
00:48:34,847 --> 00:48:36,000
Yes, sir.

652
00:48:46,236 --> 00:48:48,360
Where are you going? We can talk here.

653
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:50,560
No...

654
00:48:54,294 --> 00:48:55,520
Boonta!

655
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,587
- Let me go! - You dare pull this on me?

656
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,840
You're the one who messed with me first!

657
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:01,956
Is this all that's on your mind? You chink!

658
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:04,640
Hey, stop!

659
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,920
Whoa!

660
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:14,113
Master!

661
00:49:15,697 --> 00:49:17,160
Should we take her to a doctor?

662
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:19,120
No.

663
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
Muean.

664
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:44,993
Muean!

665
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,640
Muean!

666
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:48,800
Master Gaysorn!

667
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,680
Your water's breaking.

668
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,480
Take it easy, master.

669
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,760
Master.

670
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,516
Go get a midwife!

671
00:50:07,913 --> 00:50:09,160
Master Gaysorn.

672
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:11,360
Breathe in, master. Breathe.

673
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,800
Go get Magnate Thong.

674
00:50:14,357 --> 00:50:16,840
- Get him here. Go! - Yes, ma'am.

675
00:50:28,178 --> 00:50:29,920
Are you sure it's a good idea?

676
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,160
Just get out of here.

677
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,199
- If Master Gaysorn... - I know what I'm doing!

678
00:50:39,315 --> 00:50:41,382
Don't lecture me! Go!

679
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:42,621
Yes, sir!

680
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,191
It's raining so heavily.

681
00:50:58,278 --> 00:51:00,760
We might arrive at the capital later than expected.

682
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,971
Come!

683
00:51:10,304 --> 00:51:11,360
Come!

684
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,480
What's wrong, Muean? Why are you in such a rush?

685
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,440
I'm here for Magnate Thong. Master Gaysorn is giving birth!

686
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:20,505
Aunt!

687
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
Oh...

688
00:51:22,602 --> 00:51:23,680
- Aunt! - Lamjeak.

689
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,520
Is Boonta not back yet?

690
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:28,160
I don't know. I looked for her all over.

691
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,280
Nobody saw her at all.

692
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,880
Where did she go?

693
00:51:32,513 --> 00:51:33,720
- Could it be... - Aunt!

694
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,520
Did she get arrested?

695
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,680
Watch your mouth!

696
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,761
Is Magnate Thong here?

697
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:41,320
What's wrong with you? See?

698
00:51:41,462 --> 00:51:44,080
We're not open yet. How could he be here?

699
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,200
He's not at the warehouse.

700
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,280
Come said he went to the port, but I didn't find him there.

701
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:50,800
So I suspected

702
00:51:50,934 --> 00:51:53,880
that he was here to get with Boonta.

703
00:51:54,726 --> 00:51:58,440
You're delusional. Boonta went to the market with us.

704
00:51:58,848 --> 00:52:00,200
So where is she now?

705
00:52:17,007 --> 00:52:19,160
Hang on a little longer, Mrs. Gaysorn.

706
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:23,840
Push, ma'am!

707
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:28,080
Just a little more!

708
00:52:30,102 --> 00:52:31,600
One more push!

709
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,800
You freak chink! What are you doing?

710
00:52:45,086 --> 00:52:47,160
Help! Hey!

711
00:52:57,491 --> 00:52:58,760
Who are you?

712
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:02,600
I'm the one you put in jail!

713
00:53:05,944 --> 00:53:07,440
I'm here for revenge!

714
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,440
- Stop! - What?

715
00:53:37,669 --> 00:53:38,852
Go, run!

716
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,080
What happened, sir?

717
00:53:43,225 --> 00:53:45,760
Where have you been, Come? How did she get in?

718
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,143
You told me to watch outside.

719
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,840
Nobody watched the back!

720
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,000
- You fool! Didn't you hear... - It's...

721
00:53:53,203 --> 00:53:54,560
Muean told me

722
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:57,080
Master Gaysorn is giving birth, sir.

723
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,000
Help!

724
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:07,480
Come on!

725
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,920
Thank you so much for saving me.

726
00:54:15,911 --> 00:54:18,160
How did you know I was there?

727
00:54:18,465 --> 00:54:20,280
I saw that horny Magnate

728
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:23,320
ordered his servant to carry you to his warehouse.

729
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:28,920
So, are you acquitted?

730
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,800
Don't tell me you broke out?

731
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:34,760
I didn't break out.

732
00:54:34,841 --> 00:54:39,240
Someone helped me get acquitted. I'm innocent now.

733
00:54:39,858 --> 00:54:41,600
- Someone helped you? - Yeah.

734
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,920
Boonta.

735
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,963
Chaai.

736
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,360
I went to see you at Fang's.

737
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:03,600
Lamjeak said you went missing.

738
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:05,800
I couldn't find you at the market.

739
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,600
So I went looking for you.

740
00:55:09,232 --> 00:55:11,680
I didn't expect Magnate Thong to make a move on you.

741
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,880
You're lucky this time.

742
00:55:15,255 --> 00:55:17,320
But this is your lesson.

743
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:21,200
Next time, if Luang or I can't save you,

744
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:22,680
what would happen?

745
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,200
You have to be careful.

746
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:29,360
Don't go to a lottery or do anything that risks getting violated.

747
00:55:29,847 --> 00:55:31,360
Yeah, okay.

748
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,640
I won't do a lottery again.

749
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,920
Thank you so much for saving me.

750
00:55:39,773 --> 00:55:40,773
Thank you.

751
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:48,200
Thank you too, Chaai, for coming.

752
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,720
You just got back from work.

753
00:55:52,952 --> 00:55:56,640
You helped me. Of course I'd help you back.

754
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:00,880
How did I help you?

755
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,800
You told this Luang about me.

756
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:08,280
So he reopened my case and gave me justice.

757
00:56:17,403 --> 00:56:19,120
Back then, I thought

758
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,600
I would never get to see you again.

759
00:56:23,995 --> 00:56:25,840
You finally get justice.

760
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:27,800
You're finally a free woman.

761
00:56:41,305 --> 00:56:42,489
I'm going home.

762
00:56:42,658 --> 00:56:44,640
I'll find some work to do.

763
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:46,915
If we're destined to meet,

764
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,720
we will meet again.

765
00:56:51,272 --> 00:56:54,360
Sis, I wish you a life

766
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,120
of nothing but good fortune.

767
00:56:58,604 --> 00:57:00,604
Have a safe journey.

768
00:57:02,905 --> 00:57:04,017
Let's go.

769
00:57:07,046 --> 00:57:08,760
Okay.

770
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:33,320
Boom?

771
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:40,240
She looks so much like her.

772
00:57:42,436 --> 00:57:43,880
Whose name was that?

773
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:48,560
It's someone I know.

774
00:57:51,672 --> 00:57:53,400
This is the first time

775
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:57,200
I have met someone who looks like someone I used to know.

776
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:03,360
It's uncanny.

783
00:58:25,385 --> 00:58:27,385
Don't you see she's eyeing the Luang?

784
00:58:27,535 --> 00:58:29,840
We're buying new robes and sashes

785
00:58:30,004 --> 00:58:32,005
because Maha Songkran is drawing near.

786
00:58:32,086 --> 00:58:33,320
I'm giving out food.

787
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:34,800
We have to make it fab!

788
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:37,560
Make it dope! Make it go hard!

789
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:40,760
Every time I make merit, I run into these people.

790
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,280
You Sampheng woman!

791
00:58:42,404 --> 00:58:44,800
You lowly people! The courtesans' food

792
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:45,960
is just like you people.

793
00:58:46,073 --> 00:58:48,640
It's good for a night, for one time only.

794
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,080
You're going too far, ma'am.

795
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:51,840
- Destroy their booth! - Yes, ma'am!

796
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:56,480
Building a sand pagoda is a big merit.

797
00:58:56,636 --> 00:58:58,560
It will make your love life successful.

798
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,280
- You... - I may not be as beautiful as Boonta,

799
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:08,640
but I'm younger.

800
00:59:08,782 --> 00:59:10,240
I do everything better.

801
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:12,600
I'll prove it to you, sir.
