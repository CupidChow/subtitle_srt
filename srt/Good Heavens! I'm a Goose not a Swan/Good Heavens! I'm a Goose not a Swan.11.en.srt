1
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,760
Get the manicurist here.

2
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,160
They say you do house calls.

3
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,240
What happened?

4
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:46,040
I can't accompany you to Fang's.

5
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,720
I have urgent work in Pak Nam.

6
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:49,936
You're going out of the capital, sir?

7
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:53,898
That's right. Rumor has it that the children's wrist slasher is there.

8
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,560
Magnate Thong's staff reported

9
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,400
that you stole Gaysorn's gold bracelet.

10
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,239
Did you steal it from her?

11
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:02,653
That's not mine.

12
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:05,000
- Mother, help me! - Boonta!

13
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:06,520
What did you do?

14
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,642
I got framed for stealing.

15
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,606
A slave like you would be punished hard in jail.

16
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:15,320
A courtesan without honor like her would have it harder.

17
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:21,600
(Episode 11: Other Geese Eat Grass... But Goose Nittra is Behind Bars)

18
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:46,178
Are you the parents of this child?

19
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:48,880
Yes, sir.

20
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,880
Did he wear a gold bracelet on his wrist?

21
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:56,304
He did.

22
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:00,320
Before he disappeared,

23
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,000
where were you?

24
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:06,840
This morning, we went to make merit at Wat Nok, sir.

25
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:08,742
While we were talking to the abbot,

26
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:11,400
Joi was picking bullet wood flowers in the courtyard.

27
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:13,800
When I turned around,

28
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,560
he was gone, sir.

29
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,320
We

30
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,160
Went looking for him all over the place

31
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:26,120
until someone found a child's body by the canal.

32
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:30,480
The killer is on a spree lately.

33
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,040
They put a gold bracelet on their child

34
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,084
to indicate their wealth. Yet it attracted a criminal

35
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,835
who kidnapped him, severed his hand, and killed him mercilessly.

36
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:45,880
A wandering merchant saw a strange man taking this kid from the temple.

37
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,000
Some people saw him walking through the bush in the back of the village.

38
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,560
- Is it here? - Yes, sir.

39
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:06,960
A villager in the bush said he saw a suspicious man in the abandoned cabin.

40
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:14,480
Let's go.

41
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,279
Over there, Yod and I will cut him off.

42
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Yes, sir.

43
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:17,527
Luang, sir.

44
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:19,480
You should get your wound treated.

45
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,759
I heard people talking at the market.

46
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:34,960
This afternoon, the police

47
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,880
arrested Boonta

48
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,920
for stealing your gold bracelet. Is that true?

49
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:41,520
It is, dear.

50
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,920
Don't you believe that?

51
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,840
How could I believe that?

52
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,320
Last time, you framed her for poisoning you.

53
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
- Dear. - Why do you hate her so much?

54
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:56,520
She was just a merchant's daughter.

55
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,520
Now, she's a courtesan.

56
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,320
She's no match for you.

57
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:03,400
Wasn't it you who tried to replace me with her?

58
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,441
You're obsessed with her.

59
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:08,351
You wanted her as a wife

60
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,080
so much that you made me ask for her mother's blessing.

61
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,160
If you don't mind,

62
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,160
I would like you

63
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,240
to get me a woman.

64
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:35,680
I am grateful to Magnate Thong for admiring Boonta

65
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,360
and wanting to help my family.

66
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:42,595
Even if my Magnate Tan was gone too soon,

67
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:46,200
he left some fortune for me.

68
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,440
I don't want my only daughter

69
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,640
to be someone's second wife.

70
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:58,080
Please understand, Gaysorn.

71
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:08,040
In the end,

72
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,280
you managed to bring her here lawfully.

73
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:20,000
And yet you made me let go of her.

74
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm just doing the same thing you did.

75
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,480
If I can't get rid of her lawfully,

76
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,560
I would resort to dirty tricks.

77
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,040
Gaysorn!

78
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,280
You're so disappointed, aren't you?

79
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,200
That you didn't get to have Boonta.

80
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:40,240
No matter how hard you pressure her,

81
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,840
she won't let you have your way with her.

82
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,320
After all this,

83
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,920
you still want her so desperately.

84
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,800
That's why I had to nip it in the bud, to keep peace in our family.

85
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,520
You're not doing this for our family.

86
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,320
You're just jealous of her.

87
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:10,480
I have a lot of wives and mistresses.

88
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Yet you've never despised anyone as much as Boonta.

89
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:23,640
If you would do anything to kill her,

90
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:27,680
I'll do anything to save her myself!

91
00:10:58,087 --> 00:10:59,360
(Kleeb!)

92
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,200
- (Mother, don't!) - (Kleeb!)

93
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,120
(Someone save my daughter! Help!

94
00:11:05,295 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm going in for Young Miss Kleeb. Stay here, Mother.

95
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,600
- Stay with her. - Kleeb!

96
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,280
No...

97
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,800
No! Kleeb!

98
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:30,280
Kleeb, let's go out.

99
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,000
Where to, Mother?

100
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,320
Chaai isn't home yet.

101
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,840
You and your child can wait over there.

102
00:11:38,176 --> 00:11:40,080
Yam, lead them.

103
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,480
Yes, ma'am.

104
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:04,080
I don't believe that Sampheng woman.

105
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:07,160
She took her child here to thank Chaai for saving her life

106
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,920
at this late hour?

107
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,200
That fire happened a while ago.

108
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:14,643
If she were really grateful, she would have come sooner.

109
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:18,920
I agree, ma'am. Why would she come in the middle of the night?

110
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Something's up, surely.

111
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:24,336
Is it about that courtesan?

112
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,320
The one Master Chaai is attracted to?

113
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,680
Nobody tells her

114
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,840
that Chaai is away.

115
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,200
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:07,383
You asked Muean to seek me at this late hour.

117
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,240
What's so urgent, ma'am?

118
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,640
Kill Boonta in jail.

119
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:14,360
Don't wait for her trial.

120
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,760
I don't want to give her a chance to survive.

121
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,560
Yes, ma'am. It shall be done.

122
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,240
Sis.

123
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,280
Sis.

124
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:47,760
- Sis. - Whoa!

125
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:49,920
What is it?

126
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:54,960
I wonder how long you've been here.

127
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,720
Why didn't anyone come to help you?

128
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:02,160
I've lost count of date and time.

129
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:07,080
You know it. Slaves like us,

130
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,080
without a master,

131
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,080
don't have the right to defend ourselves or have any protection.

132
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,840
Don't tell me that without a master,

133
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,680
I'll never be let out?

134
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:23,440
- Don't you know? - I don't.

135
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
All I know is

136
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,379
equality will never exist. I didn't know the discrimination was this bad.

137
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,840
So if...

138
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,960
You said if I have a master,

139
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,200
I can get out of here, right?

140
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,080
Who is your master?

141
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,360
My master is a courtesan house owner.

142
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,240
Can she save me?

143
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,880
So if she can't,

144
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,960
if it's someone else like

145
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:01,560
a Luang, can he help me then?

146
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,880
A Luang, you say?

147
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,480
If he agrees to help you,

148
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,360
you might just have a chance to make it.

149
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,440
- Mother. - Yes?

150
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm tired.

151
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,760
Hold on just a little longer.

152
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,160
How can I be of service to you, sir?

153
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,960
I want you

154
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:53,440
to help Boonta out of jail.

155
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,960
(Kill Boonta in jail.)

156
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:01,600
I don't want to give her a chance to survive.

157
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:07,440
I may be a jailer,

158
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,400
but I can't do things as I please, sir.

159
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,200
I know.

160
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
Just find a way to help me.

161
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:17,760
You're the only one I can count on.

162
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,440
Gaysorn has her uncle's support.

163
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:25,080
I fear Boonta might not make it.

164
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:54,160
They finally left.

165
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
I feel sorry for them, though.

166
00:16:58,344 --> 00:17:00,040
They waited for a good while.

167
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:02,880
It's not your place to feel sorry for them.

168
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:04,600
Go and lock the gates.

169
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:06,160
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
- Let's go. - Move!

171
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,960
Come on.

172
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,240
There. Get in.

173
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:11,824
Chaai, are you home?

174
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:13,744
Chaai!

175
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,600
Chaai, what happened to you? How did you get injured?

176
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,960
I fought a criminal and got overwhelmed.

177
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,680
That's how I got wounded.

178
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:27,320
Yod! What kind of protection did you do?

179
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,720
Why did my son come back injured?

180
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:32,840
This is nothing serious, Mother. Don't worry.

181
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:37,040
You didn't come home for days because of your injury?

182
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:41,720
I intended to pursue the criminal,

183
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,008
but he vanished without a trace.

184
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,000
So, I decided to come back to the capital.

185
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,160
Tomorrow,

186
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
Chang will leave monkhood.

187
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:55,800
Please go to the temple with me.

188
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,880
Of course, Mother.

189
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:01,080
Yod.

190
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:04,920
What are you doing?

191
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:07,143
I'm telling Yod about Fang.

192
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,999
Don't interfere with your master's matters.

193
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:12,160
It's up to her to tell them or not. Shut your mouth.

194
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,032
Stand up.

195
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:24,400
- Come here. - Where are you taking me?

196
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:26,520
Come on!

197
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,919
My whole body hurts! Help!

198
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,160
- What's wrong? - Jailers!

199
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:38,360
- Please help her! - I can't take it anymore! Help!

200
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,640
- What's wrong? - Quiet!

201
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,440
- Jailers! - Help!

202
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,739
I can't take it anymore! I'm dying!

203
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,966
- I'm dying! - Get out of here!

204
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:49,720
- Where does it hurt? - Go!

205
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,599
I want to die now!

206
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,960
- It hurts! - Where does it hurt?

207
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:01,680
- Get some painkillers! - I can't take it anymore!

208
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:04,080
I'm dying!

209
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:47,120
(Buddhist prayers)

210
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,520
(Buddhist prayers)

211
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:55,920
(Buddhist prayers)

212
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,720
(Buddhist prayers)

213
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,680
I am now leaving monkhood. All of you, please

214
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:11,200
recognize me as a layman from this moment on.

215
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:27,400
Quick!

216
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:32,480
If I had known she was in danger, I would have come sooner.

217
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,800
Me too. I wonder how she's doing right now.

218
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,783
- Let's go. - Hurry up.

219
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,560
Sorry, sir. We were in a hurry so we got careless.

220
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:47,120
Where are you lot going?

221
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:49,120
We need to see Luang Thukkarat, sir.

222
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
We need to save Boonta.

223
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,480
Mother Fang went to his house days ago but didn't see him

224
00:24:55,655 --> 00:24:57,040
because he was out of town.

225
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,280
Today, we're trying to see him again, sir.

226
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:02,040
What happened to Boonta?

227
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:04,320
Why do you need Luang Thukkarat's help?

228
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:11,404
(Buddhist prayers)

229
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:15,120
(Buddhist prayers)

230
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:18,640
(Buddhist prayers)

231
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,800
Chaai.

232
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:25,480
Oh, Puek, what's the matter?

233
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:27,568
- I have something important... - Luang.

234
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:30,320
Can you talk later?

235
00:25:32,175 --> 00:25:34,280
I just need to talk to Chaai for a minute.

236
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,040
If it's not important...

237
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:39,200
Important or not, let him be the judge.

238
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,856
What's the matter, Puek? You seem so troubled.

239
00:25:57,036 --> 00:25:59,036
You must be more troubled than I am.

240
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:03,360
I heard Boonta was arrested and put in jail a few days ago

241
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,960
because she stole Gaysorn's gold bracelet.

242
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
How did you know?

243
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,600
The courtesans from Fang's told me.

244
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,800
They also said Fang visited your house

245
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,480
to ask you to help Boonta,

246
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,040
but she didn't get to see you because you were out of town.

247
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:23,920
Chaai!

248
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,560
Chaai!

249
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,720
Where is he running off to?

250
00:26:28,816 --> 00:26:31,600
I wanted all of us to go home together.

251
00:26:38,903 --> 00:26:40,760
Why did you do that, sir?

252
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,639
I should be asking you that question.

253
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,560
Why did you keep quiet about something this serious?

254
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,480
It's got nothing to do with me.

255
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,760
Why would I interfere?

256
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:52,760
What about you?

257
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:55,030
Didn't you promise to help me?

258
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:57,400
Why did you let Chaai help her?

259
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,040
Why didn't you help her yourself?

260
00:27:02,295 --> 00:27:05,040
This is not something I can do alone.

261
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:07,575
Chaai has studied the law better than I have.

262
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:09,831
It's best he takes this case.

263
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:13,720
I'll try to impress Boonta next time.

264
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:18,237
You sure are generous.

265
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,080
You let your romantic rival get a head start.

266
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:24,320
I have my own ways.

267
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:26,560
Don't worry about me.

268
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:29,320
We're in the same boat now.

269
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,920
I will never betray you.

270
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:43,680
Take this one out!

271
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:47,520
Hey!

272
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,960
Someone's here for me.

273
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,520
Be careful. You didn't know I saved you last night.

274
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:56,280
I saw that man taking prisoners out. Nobody ever comes back.

275
00:27:56,495 --> 00:27:57,760
Screw me.

276
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,480
Screw me! No!

277
00:28:00,872 --> 00:28:02,480
Let go!

278
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:06,360
- Go! - Wait... Ouch!

279
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:08,000
Where are you taking me?

280
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,640
Answer me!

281
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,120
I'm not going! Where are you taking me?

282
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,280
Are you taking her to trial?

283
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:25,760
I'm coming with you.

284
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:28,880
Boonta's trial

285
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,424
is not your responsibility, sir.

286
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:33,511
I know! Don't lecture me.

287
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:37,400
I just wanted to accompany her to the courtyard.

288
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,520
Is there a problem?

289
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,400
Chaai.

290
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:13,000
I really didn't do it.

291
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:16,200
I believe you.

292
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,040
I'll find a way to help you.

293
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:44,200
Sit down.

294
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:18,520
Here.

295
00:30:21,646 --> 00:30:24,920
I need a date, not a lottery. What's this?

296
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,680
That's the date.

297
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,360
Can't you read?

298
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,320
On the left is the number of the day.

299
00:30:33,606 --> 00:30:35,920
One means Sunday.

300
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,080
On the right is the number of the month.

301
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,080
If there is a number up here like this,

302
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,319
that means a waxing moon.

303
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,920
That's a four. So Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed. Wednesday?

304
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:52,337
That's right. - The third month.

305
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:54,400
- There! - Waxing moon on the ninth?

306
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:56,977
- Ninth day of the waxing moon. - Ninth day of the waxing moon.

307
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:58,200
Correct!

308
00:31:00,854 --> 00:31:02,200
Could it be...

309
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,720
Could the solar eclipse happen today?

310
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:10,280
A trial is being held inside. If you wish to wait, wait here.

311
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,600
Wait here? How can I be sure

312
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:14,681
that my girl gets a fair trial?

313
00:31:14,783 --> 00:31:19,320
That's right, sir. I heard she brought her uncle.

314
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:22,920
She's using her connection. Boonta won't make it, sir.

315
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:26,440
What should we do, Mother? Should we just barge in?

316
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
Don't get in there just yet, ma'am.

317
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:30,840
You'll only cause chaos.

318
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:34,000
They're bullying one of us. How could we let this go?

319
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:35,880
Please believe Yod.

320
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:38,200
Courtesans like you

321
00:31:38,391 --> 00:31:40,560
have no right to serve as witnesses anyway.

322
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,600
You're known as courtesans.

323
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,960
Nobody would believe you're good people.

324
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,720
And if you commit a crime,

325
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,240
you will surely rot in jail.

326
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
- Isn't that right, Dang? - That's right, ma'am.

327
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,320
Isn't that too much of a prejudice?

328
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,760
We're courtesans, but we're not born bad.

329
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:02,050
We're not like some certain elite children.

330
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:04,864
You're born with good looks but with a vulgar manner.

331
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:07,560
All you do is oppress the inferior.

332
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,880
You deserve to get the taste slapped right out of your mouth, right?

333
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
These lowly women are insulting me!

334
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,160
You need to deal with them, sir!

335
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:21,480
You picked a fight with them yourself. Why would you be scared?

336
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:30,640
Rest easy. If she didn't commit a crime, the law would protect her.

337
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,200
I'm sure Chaai will not let there be injustice in court.

338
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,960
Luang, sir! Wait for me!

339
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:55,120
On Thursday,

340
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,240
the second day of the waxing moon in the fourth month, at daylight,

341
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Mrs. Gaysorn, the wife of Magnate Thong,

342
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:06,720
hired Boonta, a courtesan, to do her nails at her house.

343
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,800
Yet Boonta, the courtesan,

344
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,920
committed an act against the law

345
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:15,040
by stealing a gold bracelet from her house.

346
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,400
Mrs. Gaysorn

347
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,120
has complained to the police

348
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,520
and asked for Boonta to be arrested and questioned.

349
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,600
If you're a courtesan without a master,

350
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,520
you have no right to any trial

351
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,800
or any legal defense.

352
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:43,400
If that's the case,

353
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,000
I

354
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,960
Shall represent her myself.

355
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:06,560
Are you going to represent a courtesan, Luang?

356
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,760
This courtesan

357
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,800
is the daughter of Mrs. Bua, Your Honor.

358
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,880
Mrs. Bua,

359
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,280
who was arrested for selling sugar to the Europeans?

360
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:20,760
That is how

361
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:24,320
she became a slave of Magnate Thong

362
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:27,160
and was sold off to Fang, all because of her debt.

363
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,280
If she needs a representative who would be responsible for her,

364
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:34,520
I will bear that responsibility myself, Your Honor.

365
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:42,680
I, Muean,

366
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,120
was brought here

367
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
as a witness to this case.

368
00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:52,720
I swear I have no bias to any side.

369
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,880
If what I say is false,

370
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,600
if I mislead or distort the truth,

371
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,400
I ask that the heavens

372
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,439
punish me.

373
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:15,400
If I did not see it

374
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:18,120
and say I saw it,

375
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
if I say I know

376
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,080
about what I do not know,

377
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
I ask that the heavens punish me.

378
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:29,120
I ask

379
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,960
that I bleed out of my every pore.

380
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,720
I ask that evil spirits

381
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:44,760
shall come to me in three days

382
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:47,800
or seven days. I ask

383
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,440
that I cannot leave this seat.

384
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,560
I ask

385
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,160
that lightning

386
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,240
strike me and cut me in half.

387
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,440
If I leave my house,

388
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:24,520
I ask that

389
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:28,120
a lion

390
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
would rip me apart.

391
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:36,640
I ask that I die of a poisonous herb or venomous snake.

392
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,560
I ask that

393
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,640
I

394
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,880
Die

395
00:36:47,432 --> 00:36:49,480
of a terrible disease.

396
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,080
And be sent to hell...

397
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:05,000
- Muean! - Take her out of here.

398
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:17,320
Karma catches up to her even before we start?

399
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:20,960
Now that we don't have a witness,

400
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
please be truthful.

401
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:25,320
Did you steal a gold bracelet?

402
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,560
I swear I didn't do it, Your Honor.

403
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,840
I was framed.

404
00:37:33,023 --> 00:37:35,360
She was the only one who went into that room.

405
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,080
If it wasn't her,

406
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,080
how did the bracelet end up in her basket?

407
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:42,480
They can plant drugs in your hands and arrest you.

408
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:44,960
Why can't they plant some gold?

409
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,080
Why would I do that, Your Honor?

410
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,600
Because you're too possessive of your husband. That's why you set me up.

411
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,799
Only someone who bites the hand that feeds them would have that malice.

412
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,520
Last time, she poisoned me and nearly caused me a miscarriage.

413
00:38:01,503 --> 00:38:04,400
You have committed a crime in Magnate Thong's house before?

414
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:06,160
She did.

415
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,040
We didn't file a complaint

416
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,600
because Magnate Thong and I still had mercy.

417
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,920
All we did was sell her off to Fang's brothel.

418
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:17,240
I didn't think she would be back to strike again.

419
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:19,560
You're the one who struck me.

420
00:38:19,823 --> 00:38:23,262
It was all your scheme. Why else would you ask your maid

421
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,000
to fetch me from Fang's brothel?

422
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,680
If she committed a crime once,

423
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:29,600
it's likely she would do it again.

424
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,280
Isn't that right, Your Honor?

425
00:38:32,231 --> 00:38:33,720
If you did commit a crime,

426
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:35,600
it's likely you would do it again.

427
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,560
Likewise, if you did frame someone,

428
00:38:37,672 --> 00:38:40,240
it's likely you would do it again. Isn't that right?

429
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:44,120
What do you mean, Luang?

430
00:38:44,707 --> 00:38:46,520
They had history.

431
00:38:46,848 --> 00:38:51,160
Yet Mrs. Gaysorn still hired Boonta to her house.

432
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,416
She knows Boonta is disobedient.

433
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:57,000
Yet she allowed her to pick a piece of cloth in a room on her own.

434
00:38:57,255 --> 00:39:00,640
She even allowed her to search for a chest that contained gold.

435
00:39:01,095 --> 00:39:02,520
Isn't that odd, Your Honor?

436
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,240
If that poisoning she said

437
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,680
was a setup because of her jealousy,

438
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:11,600
this could be a setup too, Your Honor.

439
00:39:15,631 --> 00:39:17,160
There's a chest, Your Honor.

440
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:20,760
There's a chest with valuable belongings in that room.

441
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,960
She probably took it from there.

442
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:28,000
I didn't know Magnate Thong placed a chest of gold on the floor

443
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:30,400
for criminals to steal easily.

444
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:33,080
What do you say?

445
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:34,960
Could it be that what happened

446
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:37,840
was what this courtesan described?

447
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:40,574
Gaysorn is not a cunning woman.

448
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:42,400
If Boonta was indeed set up,

449
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:45,920
it was probably someone close to her who felt angry for her.

450
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:49,191
Then bring that someone in.

451
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,240
I'm nearly crapping myself in anxiety. Why aren't they coming out yet?

452
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:19,760
Muean.

453
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,760
Tell me.

454
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,040
You didn't do it, did you?

455
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,400
You didn't lie to frame her

456
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:34,960
because you wanted revenge for me. Am I right?

457
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:41,720
I...

458
00:40:44,323 --> 00:40:47,920
- Aunt! - How could you have done that?

459
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:52,360
Is she the diva of Rattanakosin Theater?

460
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:54,920
Aunt, please calm down.

461
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,000
It was my fault, Your Honor.

462
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,040
I planted that bracelet in Boonta's basket.

463
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:11,200
I did it because I felt angry on my master's behalf.

464
00:41:11,528 --> 00:41:15,600
I couldn't stand seeing Boonta stealing my master's husband, Your Honor.

465
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,120
If that's the case,

466
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,080
you're the thief who stole your own master's gold.

467
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:25,520
And you hid that gold in an effort to frame someone else.

468
00:41:27,575 --> 00:41:29,840
Report this to the jury.

469
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:34,480
Let them decide on her punishment according to the law.

470
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:38,400
What would be her punishment, Your Honor?

471
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:40,608
A slave stealing from their master

472
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:43,520
and hiding that stolen item

473
00:41:43,736 --> 00:41:46,800
is punishable by 50 flogging with a leather whip.

474
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,800
Master Gaysorn.

475
00:41:54,936 --> 00:41:58,040
Master Gaysorn, please save me. Master?

476
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,560
Does that mean I...

477
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,880
- Boonta! There she is! - Boonta!

478
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,240
Mother! Everyone!

479
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:32,600
- I'm out! - I'm so glad for Boonta!

480
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,800
Are you acquitted?

481
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:38,095
Yes, Mother. I'm acquitted.

482
00:42:38,544 --> 00:42:40,069
I'm happy you made it out.

483
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:42,240
Me too.

484
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:48,640
Which way is Khlong Ong Ang?

485
00:42:48,784 --> 00:42:50,200
- What? - Why?

486
00:42:50,374 --> 00:42:52,951
Which way is it? Khlong Ong Ang?

487
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,520
That way.

488
00:42:55,629 --> 00:42:57,629
- Hey! - Wait! Why are you rushing there?

489
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
It's on the way back home anyway.

490
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:04,920
Guys, I will never forget where our home is.

491
00:43:05,223 --> 00:43:06,960
I'll never forget you all.

492
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:09,440
Mother.

493
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:11,760
You have to buy some land.

494
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:13,720
Phat Phong would be a good idea.

495
00:43:13,863 --> 00:43:16,160
That place is really "okay."

496
00:43:16,321 --> 00:43:17,625
Don't buy land in Pattaya, though.

497
00:43:17,649 --> 00:43:19,400
Don't even go there.

498
00:43:19,512 --> 00:43:21,016
There are a lot of trans, a lot of women.

499
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,080
People wouldn't find us there, Mother.

500
00:43:24,073 --> 00:43:28,040
- You... - And girls, if you want a better life,

501
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
just get out of this place.

502
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:35,039
Pudsorn, you can go sailing with Captain Johnson.

503
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:36,416
He's going to Singapore.

504
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:38,000
And...

505
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,560
You can go to Europe.

506
00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:41,880
Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany.

507
00:43:42,064 --> 00:43:43,559
Or you can go to Scandinavia.

508
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,520
Over there, the law allows us

509
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,640
to make somewhat of a living, okay?

510
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,720
- What are you talking about? - Yeah.

511
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:53,135
This is all I can tell you, Lamjeak.

512
00:43:56,588 --> 00:43:58,240
Boonta...

513
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,320
Oh?

514
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,840
Mother!

515
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:12,960
- Oh, Boonta? Where are you going? - Boonta!

516
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,760
Boonta! What's wrong with her?

517
00:44:15,927 --> 00:44:17,040
Boonta!

518
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,983
Ouch!

519
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,120
It's so bright!

520
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:10,560
Boonta!

521
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,640
Boonta!

522
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:18,640
You're acquitted.

523
00:45:18,895 --> 00:45:20,560
Why would you still kill yourself?

524
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:23,721
I'm not killing myself.

525
00:45:23,871 --> 00:45:27,080
I just have to go before the solar eclipse is gone.

526
00:45:29,622 --> 00:45:30,960
There.

527
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,520
The solar eclipse?

528
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,840
I remember you asked Hoan about this.

529
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,920
Why are you obsessed with this thing?

530
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,600
Where is this solar eclipse taking you?

531
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:43,640
My home.

532
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:47,560
Where exactly is your home?

533
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,880
You won't understand if I tell you.

534
00:45:52,632 --> 00:45:56,600
Wherever it is, I have to go on my own way.

535
00:46:00,015 --> 00:46:02,360
But you're going your way without me.

536
00:46:03,903 --> 00:46:05,520
How would I live then?

537
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,600
You can.

538
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,040
Happiness and sadness are temporary.

539
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,200
It will pass, sir.

540
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:29,080
You have to get through this, Chaai.

541
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,320
I'll get through it too.

542
00:46:40,856 --> 00:46:42,215
Boonta!

543
00:46:44,113 --> 00:46:45,360
Boonta!

544
00:47:00,335 --> 00:47:02,240
(Please, Boonta.)

545
00:47:02,615 --> 00:47:04,560
(Take me back right now.)

546
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,320
Boonta?

547
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:19,984
Boonta.

548
00:49:16,463 --> 00:49:18,080
- Boonta? - Boonta.

549
00:49:19,351 --> 00:49:21,200
- Boonta! - Oh...

550
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,600
Boonta!

551
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,720
Why did you come back like this?

552
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:31,800
Don't tell me you drown yourself again!

553
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,360
Boonta, you lost your mind in jail and wanted to die again?

554
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:39,880
- Hey... - Come on. I'm just glad she's alive.

555
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,120
She just got out of jail. Her mind is not in the right place.

556
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:46,976
Just take her to get some rest.

557
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,440
Yes, Mother.

558
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,800
Boonta, let's eat something.

559
00:49:52,071 --> 00:49:54,800
Eat something nice so you can feel rejuvenated.

560
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,640
- Come on, come on. - Go.

561
00:49:57,815 --> 00:50:00,120
- Let's go. - Ouch!

562
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,560
Poor thing. Where did you drown this time?

563
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,040
Don't worry, sir.

564
00:50:09,263 --> 00:50:10,720
Boonta is a lucky woman.

565
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,640
She won't die so easily.

566
00:50:17,031 --> 00:50:18,560
I hope from now on,

567
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:21,320
you take better care of your people.

568
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:23,120
Yes, sir.

569
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,680
For me,

570
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,895
the debt of life is worth more than anything.

571
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,240
Boonta saved my daughter. I owe it to her.

572
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:35,920
I have to thank you too for saving her.

573
00:50:36,216 --> 00:50:39,040
You saving her meant saving us as well.

574
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,440
There he is, ma'am.

575
00:51:12,991 --> 00:51:14,720
You're finally home, Chaai.

576
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:17,480
You rushed out in a hurry.

577
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:19,998
Chang hasn't even finished his ceremony yet.

578
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:22,167
And you came home so late.

579
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,520
Chaai, Puek, Yod.

580
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,160
I'm sorry, Mother.

581
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,200
It was something urgent.

582
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,160
Your something urgent

583
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,920
was to offer yourself up to save that vile woman?

584
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,800
It's such a shameless act.

585
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
How can saving someone be a shameless act?

586
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,800
You probably don't know.

587
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,600
The people are saying

588
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,480
that not only did Luang Thukkarat save a courtesan in court,

589
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:59,800
but he also made out with her in the water

590
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,960
and made love to her in the canal.

591
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,800
If those people had eyes

592
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:05,680
and innocent minds,

593
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,576
they would have seen that I jumped in there to rescue her.

594
00:52:08,623 --> 00:52:10,160
We didn't make love.

595
00:52:13,912 --> 00:52:15,160
Chaai.

596
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:17,720
Are you still making excuses for her?

597
00:52:17,975 --> 00:52:19,600
How could you have done this?

598
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,440
You don't care for our family's image,

599
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,760
and you don't care for Dokgaew's image!

600
00:52:32,903 --> 00:52:36,000
I'm sorry if I offended anyone,

601
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,120
but if you want me to stop saving someone,

602
00:52:40,415 --> 00:52:41,880
that's something I can't do.

603
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,400
Chaai!

604
00:52:46,107 --> 00:52:48,920
You won't leave that vile woman alone?

605
00:52:49,928 --> 00:52:51,640
If you say she's vile,

606
00:52:52,174 --> 00:52:54,600
wouldn't someone who set her up be more vile?

607
00:52:55,143 --> 00:52:57,240
If I stand still while someone's in trouble,

608
00:52:57,655 --> 00:53:00,600
I wouldn't be the pride of the family either.

609
00:53:00,934 --> 00:53:04,480
- Chaai! - Mother, please!

610
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,160
Saving a life,

611
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,360
no matter what class they belong to,

612
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,640
is a huge merit.

613
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:19,320
Chaai stood up for justice.

614
00:53:20,047 --> 00:53:22,080
You should be proud, Mother.

615
00:53:23,695 --> 00:53:25,040
Besides,

616
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:27,280
we're all together today.

617
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:30,000
Let there be no resentment, please.

618
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,520
Please calm down.

619
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,000
I think if you let this go,

620
00:54:04,144 --> 00:54:07,720
your son would be even more attached to Boonta.

621
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,240
I think you should be more decisive.

622
00:54:12,976 --> 00:54:15,920
I'm as troubled as you are, Pikul.

623
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,240
It's just that Chaai is too stubborn.

624
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,800
If he gets upset and rebels against us,

625
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,880
Dokgaew would have to live in shame.

626
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:27,152
And our families' relationship will never be the same.

627
00:54:27,888 --> 00:54:30,600
Dokgaew is turning 18 this year.

628
00:54:30,857 --> 00:54:32,857
If no one comes to ask for our blessing,

629
00:54:32,975 --> 00:54:37,080
she would be ashamed for being an unwanted woman.

630
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:40,640
If Chaai

631
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,897
really takes that courtesan as his wife,

632
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,960
I would have to look for a new son-in-law.

633
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:51,720
What would you have me do then?

634
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:56,120
You can hold a big event with a large crowd.

635
00:54:56,383 --> 00:55:00,440
And use that opportunity to announce Chaai's wedding to Dokgaew.

636
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,600
He won't dare to embarrass you in an event.

637
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,160
Coming home this time, I didn't think

638
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:16,840
I would see something I'd never seen before.

639
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:22,360
Who knew Chaai could stand his ground against our mother?

640
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,760
You're going to see more than that

641
00:55:25,968 --> 00:55:28,720
if your mother doesn't stop interfering with Chaai's love life.

642
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,240
It's natural for a mother to worry about her child.

643
00:55:33,734 --> 00:55:35,000
After all,

644
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:36,840
our mother still loves you, Chaai.

645
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,680
I think

646
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,200
if you visit her at the Courtesan House,

647
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,040
Mother wouldn't mind.

648
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,160
I don't intend to just "visit" her.

649
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:49,999
The poison of love is such a strong one.

650
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,520
It's no wonder

651
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,760
that people would say that you

652
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,120
are attracted to Boonta.

653
00:55:57,864 --> 00:55:59,200
Chang.

654
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,040
Were you really studying Dharma?

655
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:04,160
If you wish to understand Dharma,

656
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,000
you have to understand the outside world.

657
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:08,880
Seeing as she troubles your mind so much,

658
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,440
I would like to get to know Boonta better.

659
00:56:15,263 --> 00:56:17,400
You smirk at the mention of her name.

660
00:56:17,696 --> 00:56:19,280
You can smile all you want.

661
00:56:19,535 --> 00:56:21,920
I won't arrest you for thinking of someone.

662
00:56:24,711 --> 00:56:26,711
I would like to see you two in love.

663
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,680
You could even be more infatuated than I am.

664
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,920
My soulmate won't show up as so soon as yours did.

665
00:56:53,055 --> 00:56:54,800
You're still here, Dokgaew?

666
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:57,920
I thought you were mad at Chaai and went home.

667
00:56:58,906 --> 00:57:02,600
I realized now that getting mad is pointless.

668
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:05,520
So I have to change plans.

669
00:57:08,714 --> 00:57:10,960
I now know what to do

670
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,960
to make Chaai agree to marry me.

671
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,800
What are you going to do?

672
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,559
You will find out soon, sir.

673
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:22,000
When the time comes,

674
00:57:22,368 --> 00:57:25,160
you have to help me as promised.

675
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,520
(Guest Starring - Sirichai Charoenkitthanakul)

676
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,160
So am I a special one or not?

677
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:48,000
A special one can kiss, right?

678
00:57:52,956 --> 00:57:54,400
We've received an anonymous report

679
00:57:54,741 --> 00:57:56,935
that you sell illegal liquor here.

680
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:01,080
Take Fang in for questioning.

681
00:58:01,336 --> 00:58:02,880
If you agree

682
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,960
to sell Boonta to me for a cheaper price,

683
00:58:06,272 --> 00:58:08,120
I would be happy to be your witness.

684
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,520
The girls at Fang's won't last more than a few days.

685
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,840
Fang will have to accept my offer.

686
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,840
We have to take our customers back.

687
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:16,800
If we can't sell booze,

688
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:18,600
we will sell something else.

689
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,640
Are we going to do a harem?

690
00:58:21,994 --> 00:58:23,560
Not that!

691
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,400
This is a "soft power."

692
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,360
This is our national dish.

693
00:58:28,863 --> 00:58:30,536
It's so good my mouth lights up!
