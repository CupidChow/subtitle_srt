1
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,479
Your heart may belong to Luang,

2
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,520
but Captain Jon will own your body.

3
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:33,600
I won't have just your heart.

4
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,080
Your body will be mine too.

5
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:37,728
I may not have the right to be with you now, but I will have it.

6
00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:39,280
You heard my secret.

7
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,359
I can't let you breathe any longer!

8
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
Promise me

9
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:46,640
you won't let Lamjeak die for nothing.

10
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:47,899
Arrest all of them!

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,720
What are you arresting us for?

12
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:51,440
For the murder of a courtesan

13
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:53,200
and Sarang.

14
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,080
You used me as a tool

15
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:57,120
to spread rumors of European invasion.

16
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:59,440
It is proven that you and your subordinate

17
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:00,840
are both guilty.

18
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:03,960
This is punishable by seizure of wealth

19
00:03:04,338 --> 00:03:05,720
- and death! - Execution?

20
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:07,926
But Tis' trial

21
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:09,495
is not over, ma'am.

22
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:12,944
I'm willing to be taken in custody, sir.

23
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:15,200
There is but one request.

24
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,320
My aunt was arrested as an accomplice in Boonta's attempted murder?

25
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:25,920
Chaai is taking your aunt

26
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,480
to the police jail.

27
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,631
He asked me to inform you.

28
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,720
Chaai did such a thing.

29
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
How can our families remain friends?

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,440
I have to stop him.

31
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,880
Mother.

32
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:50,240
Don't make Chaai any more uncomfortable than he already is.

33
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,936
I know what kind of a man he is.

34
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:58,760
If he has to spare a criminal

35
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
just because they're an acquaintance,

36
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,320
Chaai and I

37
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:07,800
will never be the same for the rest of our lives.

38
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,440
In the past,

39
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,840
I used to think a woman's jealousy was toxic.

40
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:19,680
Now, I realize

41
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:24,120
it's nothing compared to the greed

42
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:26,800
and ambitions of a man!

43
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,240
Am I wrong

44
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:33,088
for having such ambitions

45
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:37,280
when those evil elites have always oppressed me?

46
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,240
Am I wrong

47
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,840
for wanting to stand above them

48
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,360
and take my deserved revenge?

49
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,840
When I'm useful, they all run to me.

50
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:55,480
Now that I'm useless, they just kicked me out!

51
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:57,320
I worked hard

52
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:59,560
to serve them with everything I had,

53
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:01,840
and this is what I got!

54
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:06,560
It's because of your greed and lust!

55
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:13,440
How can you blame me alone?

56
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,320
You yourself

57
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:21,120
have brought nothing but shame to our family too!

58
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,200
Otherwise,

59
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,040
we wouldn't have ended up together here!

60
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,360
I ended up here because of you.

61
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,840
Had you not wanted Boonta as a wife,

62
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:40,120
had you loved me

63
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,800
and our child more than you do,

64
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,600
this wouldn't have been the end of you!

65
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,960
However,

66
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,120
I never regret

67
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:13,040
marrying you, my dear.

68
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,040
Ouch!

69
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:32,000
Before Magnate Thong was executed,

70
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,360
Come confessed everything.

71
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,760
Magnate Thong was behind all the misfortune,

72
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:41,560
including the report to arrest Bua

73
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:44,160
for selling sugar to the Europeans.

74
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:47,760
That was him too?

75
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:52,360
Come said Magnate Thong had been eyeing you for a good while.

76
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,560
He even asked Gaysorn

77
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:57,760
to ask for your mother's blessing.

78
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,200
When your mother refused,

79
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:02,400
he set her up.

80
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:08,880
So that's why his wife was so mad she ordered a hit on me.

81
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,400
Tis also confessed.

82
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,680
That day, he had an opportunity to strike

83
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,520
when you ran out of Fang's.

84
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,280
No...

85
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:43,160
There was a solar eclipse that day too, right?

86
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:45,640
I was worried about your life.

87
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,120
I didn't notice.

88
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:49,960
(The day Boonta and I both drowned, )

89
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:52,560
(there was a solar eclipse.)

90
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,080
Cops!

91
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:10,200
That day, you probably wanted to tell me you didn't want to die that way.

92
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:15,800
(You needed someone to reveal the truth and acquit you.)

93
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
(I get it now, Boonta.)

94
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:24,176
Do you think I'm Wonder Woman or something?

95
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:26,320
You made me a prostitute.

96
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,640
What power would I possibly have to help you?

97
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:47,760
Why are you looking at my hand?

98
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,120
Why don't you look at my face?

99
00:11:52,104 --> 00:11:53,920
Your hands

100
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,720
are just as important as your face.

101
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:02,320
I got to this point because of these hands.

102
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,784
Whenever I'm in trouble,

103
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:08,448
these hands have always been there to help me.

104
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,680
Without these hands,

105
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:16,360
I don't know how I would have survived in this world.

106
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:40,040
Now that my trouble is over,

107
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:43,480
I hope there is no more problem to deal with.

108
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,080
We can finally be "happy."

109
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,240
"Haeb-pee?"

110
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,080
It's "happy," sir.

111
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:54,880
It's the European language. It means "delightful."

112
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:00,840
It seems you're speaking their language

113
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,800
more fluently than Thai now.

114
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:05,480
Are you changing your mind?

115
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Are you marrying a European man, perhaps?

116
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:10,144
Hey, Chaai!

117
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,960
With that mouth of yours, you deserve some punishment.

118
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:17,120
What's my punishment, huh?

119
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,400
Too slow.

120
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
I warned you!

121
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:43,766
Yet you made out with him

122
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:46,080
and let Captain Jon catch you?

123
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:49,424
I'm sorry, Mother.

124
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,393
We can't stop the feelings, right?

125
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:57,120
You can have your feelings, but keep it inside!

126
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,691
I told you that no matter what,

127
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,760
you will end up with Captain Jon.

128
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,880
What if Captain Jon and Chaai came to an agreement?

129
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:07,360
Will you allow it, then?

130
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:16,280
(Episode 20: My Dear... You Need to Become A Husband Now)

131
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,688
I'm sorry.

132
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,040
Sorry?

133
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,760
Sorry for seeing my girl?

134
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,440
I'm sorry I didn't make enough of an effort.

135
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:48,240
Had I made more effort,

136
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,735
Boonta wouldn't have been in someone else's hands.

137
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:58,640
I love Boonta.

138
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,400
I've loved her since we first met.

139
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,600
That has never changed.

140
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Yet you let her slip through your fingers.

141
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:14,656
"A river has no return."

142
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,440
Water doesn't flow back.

143
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,320
Neither does the past.

144
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,040
But sometimes,

145
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,320
life is like wind

146
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:27,480
and not water.

147
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:31,240
It can always blow away and come back.

148
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,200
A ship can sail thanks to the wind.

149
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,560
Life can go on

150
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:42,680
thanks to the heart.

151
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:46,800
A life without a heart

152
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,280
is like a ship without the wind.

153
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,480
It will never reach the shore.

154
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,280
Do you agree with what I said?

155
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:07,800
Mother asked you

156
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,360
and Captain Jon to discuss this in the guest room upstairs, sirs.

157
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,080
Twenty chang.

158
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,080
Is this enough to change your mind?

159
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,040
No matter how much,

160
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,240
I can't break the promise I made to Captain Jon, sir.

161
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,080
Unless

162
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,720
Captain Jon himself

163
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,720
willingly gives you the right to Boonta, sir.

164
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson.

165
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:14,720
"I am sorry."

166
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:17,000
"Really sorry." I truly am.

167
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,600
I know I owe you.

168
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,800
If you hadn't paid the deposit for me that day,

169
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,375
I wouldn't have got to live a happy life.

170
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,213
But I can't repay your kindness for the rest of my life

171
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,080
because I have given all my heart

172
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,520
to Chaai already, sir.

173
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,760
If anyone is wrong, it's me alone.

174
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:48,520
Please forgive me, sir.

175
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:51,272
And...

176
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,800
Please let me go.

177
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:58,120
"Please."

178
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:27,520
Chaai, what are you doing?

179
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,520
You can't do this.

180
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,000
Why can't I?

181
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,120
Captain Jon

182
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,807
is someone I owe a lot to.

183
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,480
Had Captain Jon

184
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,440
not paid the deposit for you that day,

185
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,120
my heart would have already been broken.

186
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,760
Luang.

187
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,080
You swallowed your pride

188
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:04,720
just for a woman.

189
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,040
Is that right?

190
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:08,880
Pride

191
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,200
and honor

192
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,080
without happiness

193
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,680
is nothing to me.

194
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,240
Even if it costs everything I have,

195
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,320
I will never lose Boonta again.

196
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,880
I'll allow it this one time.

197
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,520
I'll leave Boonta in your care.

198
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,160
If one day,

199
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,200
you hurt Boonta,

200
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,720
physically or mentally,

201
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,519
I'll take her back immediately!

202
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,480
Don't worry, Captain.

203
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:29,520
I'll cherish Boonta.

204
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:34,560
That day will never come.

205
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,440
This money,

206
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:45,520
you can have it back, sir.

207
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,280
I also love Boonta

208
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,760
like a real daughter.

209
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,640
How can a mother sell her own daughter for money?

210
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,680
Your charm works until the very end, indeed.

211
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,280
I'm glad you can leave my brothel now,

212
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:38,800
so you can never annoy me again.

213
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:41,239
Well, Mother.

214
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:43,920
You can speak your mind.

215
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:50,120
Listen.

216
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
Did you really think this through?

217
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,360
In his house,

218
00:21:55,457 --> 00:21:57,280
you can only be a slave wife.

219
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:59,000
Your mother-in-law

220
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:01,329
will eventually find an elite woman

221
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:03,288
as his main wife.

222
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:08,280
Now he loves you. Everything is good.

223
00:22:08,424 --> 00:22:10,160
If one day he changes,

224
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,040
you're the one who will suffer a great deal.

225
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:17,400
Mother.

226
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,080
We don't know what lies ahead.

227
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:23,199
We don't know how much longer we can keep breathing.

228
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,720
If that day really comes,

229
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:30,640
all I need is to make the most of the days we have together.

230
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:32,360
That's enough for me.

231
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:43,840
So, you can keep this contract.

232
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:59,200
You're a free woman now, Boonta.

233
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,824
Thank you, Mother.

234
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,760
Thank you.

235
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:08,120
Hey!

236
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,080
Good luck, girl.

237
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:43,600
I saw your sash was torn.

238
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,600
I'm here to give you a new one.

239
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:52,640
Could you stay still for a moment?

240
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll help you tie your hair.

241
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,927
Thank you, sir.

242
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,240
That poem was written for me, wasn't it?

243
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,453
I was missing you,

244
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,160
and this verse just popped up in my head.

245
00:24:22,872 --> 00:24:25,520
This is for you. I missed you too.

246
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,440
I may not know where your home is.

247
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:44,320
But here,

248
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,680
I'll be your home.

249
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:53,586
I told my mother about us.

250
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,320
Your mother disapproves, does she?

251
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:00,120
I'll try harder.

252
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:02,360
I want her to approve.

253
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:04,400
I'll marry you into our household.

254
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,640
I know I've made you sad,

255
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,000
but I would like you to trust me.

256
00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:30,880
I now leave Boonta in your care, sir.

257
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,400
When you live together,

258
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,560
don't make a big issue out of trivial things.

259
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,800
I wish you good luck, Boonta.

260
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:42,360
You love him

261
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:44,800
but don't forget to love and take care of yourself.

262
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,840
If one day,

263
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,960
you're in trouble or you're sad and have nowhere to go,

264
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,640
come back here.

265
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,920
Think of this place as your own home.

266
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,320
Yes, Mother.

267
00:26:01,423 --> 00:26:02,880
Thank you, Mother.

268
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,640
Behave well.

269
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,120
I will. I'll be visiting you really often.

270
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:21,783
"Bye-bye."

271
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
"Bye-bye."

272
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,360
- Boonta, come hang out sometimes. - I will.

273
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,960
(This place used to feel like hell for me.)

274
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,240
(But now, )

275
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,567
(it's the warmest home I've ever had.)

276
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:45,920
(It's the home that no matter where I go, )

277
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,840
(when I turn back, )

278
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:49,840
(I have my family waiting for me.)

279
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,240
(In life, we all go through departures.)

280
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,560
(Farewells lead to new encounters.)

281
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,360
(I don't know what's waiting for me in my new home.)

282
00:27:16,623 --> 00:27:18,080
(All I know is)

283
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,760
(I have to face the mom, the mother, the big lady of the house!)

284
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,720
(Welcome to your new hell, Jeed.)

285
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,440
Chaai! How dare you bring her to step foot in here?

286
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:36,960
I told you

287
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,600
Dokgaew is the only woman who can be your main wife!

288
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:41,751
Anyone else

289
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:44,480
can be a mistress or a slave wife!

290
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:56,280
Chaai gave me this ring a while ago.

291
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,640
I'm afraid the mistress is

292
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:00,600
the one that comes after.

293
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:03,440
Do you dare argue with me?

294
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:05,104
I'm in charge of this house!

295
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:07,494
If I disapprove, none of you

296
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:10,360
can ever live in this house!

297
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,240
Mother.

298
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,440
Boonta is not a stranger.

299
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:18,520
She is the one Chaai loves.

300
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:21,125
She is like family to us, Mother.

301
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,840
I'll never consider her family!

302
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,111
Mother.

303
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:28,920
One day, when she shows her old habits

304
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:30,840
and has an affair with another man,

305
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:34,000
we're going to be embarrassed all over town!

306
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,320
And yet you're still taking this vile woman in

307
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:38,447
as a wife of yourself?

308
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Boonta is not the terrible kind of woman.

309
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,946
Terrible?

310
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:47,240
If you really want to be with her,

311
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:48,640
you can!

312
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,808
But to me, she

313
00:28:50,953 --> 00:28:53,280
is the one who packs things up and runs away to you

314
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:55,200
like worthless women do!

315
00:28:58,096 --> 00:29:00,280
I was worthless as a courtesan.

316
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:03,080
And I'm still worthless as a wife?

317
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:06,439
What's a woman's worth, after all?

318
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:16,240
Boonta is worth more than anything to me.

319
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:20,280
If you don't let her live in this house,

320
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:24,760
I will live with Boonta in the small house by the river.

321
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,400
Up to you then.

322
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:33,160
Even if I die,

323
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,440
I'll never let her live here

324
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,600
to taint our house!

325
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:41,352
Mother!

326
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,800
Are you awake?

327
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:15,800
My name is Chaai.

328
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,520
You ran away and collapsed last night.

329
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:20,880
Do you remember?

330
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:23,840
So you saved me and brought me here?

331
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,120
I never thought

332
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,920
that I would be back here.

333
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm sorry I caused you trouble.

334
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,080
This place might be small.

335
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:47,760
Can you live in this?

336
00:30:48,743 --> 00:30:50,480
Why can't I, my dear?

337
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,240
You're my home.

338
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,520
This home is the home of my heart.

339
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:02,120
I can stay anywhere.

340
00:31:22,935 --> 00:31:26,120
You can stay if you like, but I can't!

341
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,600
Hey!

342
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:45,480
Mother.

343
00:31:45,623 --> 00:31:47,920
Please think of Chaai's happiness.

344
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:52,080
How can I accept such an unworthy woman?

345
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:56,120
Chaai must be sure that he really loves Boonta.

346
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,720
These are two people who are genuinely in love.

347
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,000
Please don't interfere anymore, Mother.

348
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:04,120
Love alone doesn't make a marriage last.

349
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,040
People who are incompatible

350
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,160
always ruin their marriages.

351
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,120
Ever since Chaai started seeing Boonta,

352
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:16,000
I have noticed that they both have faith in the same thing.

353
00:32:16,152 --> 00:32:17,600
They are equal in morality

354
00:32:17,752 --> 00:32:19,400
and equal in kindness.

355
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Their intelligence supports that of one another.

356
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,400
If by compatible,

357
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:27,280
you don't mean they have the same status,

358
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:29,640
Chaai and Boonta

359
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
are not incompatible by any means.

360
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:34,840
Even if I die,

361
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,240
I'll never approve of Boonta as my daughter-in-law.

362
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,400
I let Chaai take him in.

363
00:32:41,512 --> 00:32:44,520
Chaai has to follow my conditions too.

364
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:55,440
Brows, eyes, and lips are spot on.

365
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,360
I have applied Pudsorn's foreign flower water.

366
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,920
I skipped the pit smoke.

367
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:02,440
It should be fine.

368
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:06,120
You don't have to put anything on.

369
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,510
I'm already obsessed with you.

370
00:33:30,536 --> 00:33:31,840
Dear...

371
00:33:32,192 --> 00:33:33,760
I'm tired.

372
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,480
Let me go to bed.

373
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:37,920
You're tired,

374
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,480
but I'm not.

375
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,640
If you're not, you can

376
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:46,800
find something to do.

377
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:50,720
I'm so close to you.

378
00:33:51,632 --> 00:33:53,960
I can't possibly do anything else.

379
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:59,360
So what do you want to do?

380
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,560
You have cured my uneasiness.

381
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:08,080
Are you sure that's a good idea?

382
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:11,160
You're going to feel even more uneasy.

383
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:15,920
Even if I feel uneasy all night, I'll take it.

384
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:23,320
I love you, Boonta.

385
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:15,496
Why didn't you wake me up?

386
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,760
I didn't want to bother you, Chaai.

387
00:35:24,368 --> 00:35:26,000
It's "my dear Chaai."

388
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,040
We're not undercover like we were in the Vietnamese village.

389
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:37,280
Yeah, my dear Chaai.

390
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,720
I'm happy I can spend my life with you.

391
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:52,880
Even if we're not traditionally married yet,

392
00:35:53,256 --> 00:35:54,880
I'll make it happen.

393
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:12,776
I'll respect and honor you.

394
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,080
You will be my one and only beloved wife.

395
00:36:18,232 --> 00:36:19,520
I promise.

396
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,280
Chaai moved her in?

397
00:36:57,408 --> 00:37:01,600
Do you still expect Dokgaew to be cucked by that Sampheng woman?

398
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:04,040
Pikul, don't say that.

399
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:07,480
No matter what, Dokgaew will be the main wife,

400
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:10,480
as we agreed upon with our families.

401
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:12,480
What will you do then?

402
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:13,895
She's moved in.

403
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:16,064
I don't think she would move out easily.

404
00:37:16,808 --> 00:37:18,199
That's why I would like Dokgaew

405
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,400
to claim what's rightfully hers.

406
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:23,560
If she's bold enough to stay, then so be it.

407
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,000
Is that right, Dokgaew?

408
00:37:50,063 --> 00:37:51,480
Dokgaew.

409
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:53,680
Why don't you get dressed?

410
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,280
Don't worry about it too much.

411
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,728
You have Aunt Tubtim's support.

412
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:02,920
Soon,

413
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,560
Boonta will leave the house.

414
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,280
Do I really have to marry Chaai?

415
00:38:18,968 --> 00:38:20,968
Why did you ask that question?

416
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,720
You're a woman. You have to get married at the right age.

417
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,000
I served in the palace during my teen years.

418
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,800
Once I left,

419
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,680
I married your father.

420
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,560
Then, you were born and became my heart and soul.

421
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,880
I've chosen what's best for you.

422
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:50,080
You will be happy like I once was.

423
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,920
Trust me.

424
00:39:00,095 --> 00:39:01,960
Don't you think you should

425
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:03,880
ask me?

426
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,840
Who

427
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,040
I like and love.

428
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:18,840
Do you like someone else that's not Chaai?

429
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,240
Who is it?

430
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,880
Well...

431
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,720
I don't, Mother.

432
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,320
Then just do as I say.

433
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,760
Of all the men in the capital,

434
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,360
who could possibly be better than Chaai?

435
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,680
I'm sorry.

436
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:59,080
I didn't say hello to you yesterday.

437
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,960
The house went boom before I had the chance.

438
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:07,440
I mean, we got bombed.

439
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,520
I like your comparisons.

440
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,320
I have to apologize on my mother's behalf.

441
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:17,920
She has her bias against you.

442
00:40:18,135 --> 00:40:19,520
However,

443
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:22,640
we welcome you here.

444
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:26,520
It's good you're here. Pad will have a friend to talk to.

445
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:30,840
I'll teach you our household chores.

446
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:32,600
You're going to win Mother over.

447
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,600
Please trust Pad.

448
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,680
She did it once.

449
00:40:38,823 --> 00:40:41,400
If you're bored, you can teach me to sing

450
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:43,256
that "pop, pop, chick, chick" song of yours.

451
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:45,863
You can also help me with accounting.

452
00:40:47,135 --> 00:40:48,680
You can do accounting?

453
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:50,680
A little, sir.

454
00:40:51,847 --> 00:40:53,200
Then that's great.

455
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:55,640
I can rest easy now that Chang has some help.

456
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:58,520
Chim, Pad,

457
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:01,720
and Chang all wanted Boonta.

458
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,240
Perhaps

459
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:05,640
you're going to sleep alone, Chaai.

460
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,400
You won't be sleeping alone for long.

461
00:41:23,303 --> 00:41:25,480
Take care of Chaai.

462
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:27,360
Get used to it.

463
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:36,000
That's the job for Boonta,

464
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,960
my wife, Mother.

465
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm hungry.

466
00:41:49,248 --> 00:41:50,400
Let's eat.

467
00:41:53,205 --> 00:41:55,200
We have Shrimp Koi today?

468
00:41:56,353 --> 00:41:57,880
Dokgaew made it for us.

469
00:41:58,103 --> 00:42:00,103
Her Shrimp Koi looks delicious.

470
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,791
Her chili paste smells good too.

471
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,809
That doesn't look like Laab Koi

472
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,360
and Soi Chu that Boom had on set.

473
00:42:11,336 --> 00:42:12,720
Laab Koi?

474
00:42:13,152 --> 00:42:14,480
And Soi Chu?

475
00:42:17,192 --> 00:42:18,720
I've never heard of them.

476
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:22,040
It's probably your unusual food.

477
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,480
Just like

478
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:25,800
your grilled meat, Ko...

479
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,560
Koleen style, right?

480
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,160
Korean, sir.

481
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:33,720
Korean.

482
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:38,200
The name of the dish sounds simple, but if you try it,

483
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:40,160
it's nice and spicy!

484
00:42:43,422 --> 00:42:46,440
Simple commoner foods are no match for a palace dish.

485
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:55,360
To each their own.

486
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,320
It's not like we all prefer the same things, Mother.

487
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,960
If that's the case, why don't you try my cooking?

488
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:21,880
Shrimp Koi looks like it's sweet.

489
00:43:28,046 --> 00:43:31,520
If nobody's going to try it...

490
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,240
If nobody's going to try it,

491
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,080
I'll be the first.

492
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:53,720
Bussin!

493
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,840
It tastes so good your mouth lights up!

494
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:00,200
What language are you speaking?

495
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,160
Your words are giving me a headache.

496
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,880
Mother.

497
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,720
It means really, really delicious.

498
00:44:07,415 --> 00:44:09,000
You're such a great cook.

499
00:44:09,136 --> 00:44:11,360
You should be featured in the Michelin Guide.

500
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,840
Try it, dear.

501
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,575
How is it?

502
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:28,872
Right?

503
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:30,760
Bussin?

504
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:33,640
That's right, my dear.

505
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,960
- Let's eat. - Okay.

506
00:45:06,975 --> 00:45:09,841
Dokgaew sure knows what Chaai likes.

507
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:13,040
Shrimp on sticky rice is Chaai's favorite too.

508
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,960
Here.

509
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:21,040
Shrimp on sticky rice, your favorite.

510
00:45:22,912 --> 00:45:24,144
Thanks.

511
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,600
Thank you.

512
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,560
Let me have it, then.

513
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:46,720
It's good!

514
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:51,360
If you swap the shrimp with some mango,

515
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,360
that'd be so lit!

516
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,960
Your manners are such a rude embarrassment!

517
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,040
People are going to say Chaai made a wife out of a homeless person.

518
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:02,560
You're no match for Dokgaew.

519
00:46:02,688 --> 00:46:05,280
Her manners are gentle and lovely,

520
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,000
as expected of a Lady.

521
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:09,120
Mother.

522
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:11,000
What people will say that?

523
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,280
All of us here

524
00:46:13,655 --> 00:46:15,260
are brothers and sisters

525
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:17,080
and familiar faces.

526
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,176
You're just brothers and sisters for now.

527
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,017
Soon, you will share her chamber.

528
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:23,631
Don't forget your promise to me.

529
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:28,480
I just remembered that I have work.

530
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:29,760
I have to go.

531
00:46:30,095 --> 00:46:32,000
Puek, are you full already?

532
00:46:37,343 --> 00:46:39,960
I just remembered my mother asked me to buy some clothes.

533
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,640
I have to go too.

534
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,640
The guests have left.

535
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,760
Let me take my wife back to her house then.

536
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,584
Not yet.

537
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,360
You can't just be sitting around doing nothing.

538
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,960
If you want to be here, you need to work.

539
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,640
Of course, Mother.

540
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:16,480
What you want me to do,

541
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:17,960
you can tell me.

542
00:47:18,348 --> 00:47:19,960
Because my motto is

543
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:23,000
you won't be poor if you don't refuse a job.

544
00:47:26,063 --> 00:47:27,240
Fine.

545
00:47:31,788 --> 00:47:33,440
Wait, Luang.

546
00:47:39,488 --> 00:47:41,120
Why are you following me?

547
00:47:41,784 --> 00:47:43,784
Why don't you go take care of your husband-to-be?

548
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,920
So you mean

549
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,480
you're jealous?

550
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:53,920
Do I have the right to be?

551
00:47:57,415 --> 00:48:00,400
You know Chaai moved Boonta in already.

552
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,560
Yet you still allow yourself to be arranged with him?

553
00:48:10,864 --> 00:48:12,400
I asked you once.

554
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,800
I think you know the answer now.

555
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,520
You don't like me.

556
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
Luang.

557
00:48:46,482 --> 00:48:48,080
You're doing this...

558
00:48:48,855 --> 00:48:50,480
What does it mean?

559
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,080
I know I shouldn't,

560
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,720
but I can't stop my feelings

561
00:49:37,847 --> 00:49:39,440
for you

562
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:41,520
from developing.

563
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,920
What do you mean?

564
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,480
I probably ate too much.

565
00:49:56,264 --> 00:49:58,880
That's why I spoke without making sense.

566
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,120
Just forget it.

567
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:04,720
Forget?

568
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,480
Who can forget that?

569
00:50:07,936 --> 00:50:10,880
You can't stop my feelings for me?

570
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:14,720
Does that mean

571
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:16,560
you love me?

572
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:27,680
What did you say? Where are you going?

573
00:50:27,848 --> 00:50:29,880
Come back and say that again.

574
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,800
She ran away from her fiancé for him?

575
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,200
You shouldn't do that, my Young Miss!

576
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,840
Why did you come home so early?

577
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:53,840
Did Aunt Tubtim's plan not work?

578
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,040
It did, Mother.

579
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,720
It did better than you expected.

580
00:51:03,448 --> 00:51:06,520
I've had a long day. Let me go get some rest, Mother.

581
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,920
Right.

582
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,920
I'm relieved to hear that.

583
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:20,600
My Dokgaew

584
00:51:20,696 --> 00:51:22,840
is finally going to settle down.

585
00:51:29,495 --> 00:51:31,360
She's going to settle down all right,

586
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:33,343
but the question is, "with whom?"

587
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,320
Ground more chilies?

588
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,480
I've grounded three mortars full.

589
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,155
If I do more,

590
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,440
I'm going to win the Olympics in grounding chilies.

591
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:47,760
Mother...

592
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,312
No, Mrs. Tubtim.

593
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,960
You have a lot of staff. Why don't you let them do that?

594
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,720
We all have work to do.

595
00:51:56,816 --> 00:52:00,320
Nobody is going to serve a vile woman like you.

596
00:52:01,112 --> 00:52:02,160
Kerd!

597
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:04,249
Are you giving up already?

598
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,320
You Sampheng woman.

599
00:52:07,488 --> 00:52:09,640
All you've done is easy work in bed.

600
00:52:09,721 --> 00:52:11,800
That's how she got lazy, ma'am.

601
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:13,360
Hey, Aunt.

602
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:15,640
How did you know it was easy?

603
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:17,440
Were you a courtesan?

604
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,120
Hey, you!

605
00:52:19,728 --> 00:52:21,008
Kerd.

606
00:52:26,783 --> 00:52:29,240
Mother asked you to make various chili paste

607
00:52:29,328 --> 00:52:31,160
because Chaai likes it.

608
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:33,614
She's asking you to ground more chilies

609
00:52:33,879 --> 00:52:37,080
to make roasted sour chili paste with wild boar meat and zalacca.

610
00:52:37,495 --> 00:52:39,120
Chaai loves that dish.

611
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:42,680
These are all Chaai's favorite?

612
00:52:45,335 --> 00:52:47,920
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

613
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,304
If you're only good in bed,

614
00:52:50,385 --> 00:52:52,385
you won't last long with one.

615
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,800
Master Tubtim!

616
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,480
This is bad!

617
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,160
People all over the market are talking about Young Miss Dokgaew!

618
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:06,240
What? Dokgaew? Pikul's daughter?

619
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:08,960
She was sneaking and being indecent with another man?

620
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,680
They said they even saw her at the dock

621
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:12,831
of Luang Thukkarat's house!

622
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,160
Luang and Dokgaew are getting married.

623
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,720
That man could have been him.

624
00:53:18,855 --> 00:53:20,200
No, he wasn't.

625
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,480
That man looked like him, but he was not Luang Thukkarat.

626
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,440
Did they say...

627
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,200
Did they say

628
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:29,960
engaging in such gossip

629
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:32,200
would get you killed?

630
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,320
Luang.

631
00:53:40,439 --> 00:53:42,000
These rumors are nonsense.

632
00:53:42,112 --> 00:53:43,680
Just pay them no mind, sir.

633
00:53:46,327 --> 00:53:48,280
I don't care what the people say.

634
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:52,040
But what would Dokgaew feel?

635
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:55,487
These rumors spread fast. I wonder how she is doing.

636
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,320
Tell me, Dokgaew!

637
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,680
Who was the man who did indecent things to you?

638
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,200
I can't, Mother.

639
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:14,080
Are you too afraid?

640
00:54:14,504 --> 00:54:17,000
So that means that man doesn't deserve you!

641
00:54:17,976 --> 00:54:20,360
You have to marry Chaai.

642
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,687
The one who should be held responsible

643
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:26,080
is that man.

644
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:27,280
Chaai!

645
00:54:27,503 --> 00:54:29,880
Are you going to let her live in shame?

646
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:33,320
You kept stalling until something bad happened.

647
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:36,240
This is partly your fault too.

648
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:38,440
I have a wife.

649
00:54:39,088 --> 00:54:40,920
There are plenty of good men.

650
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,000
Dokgaew will certainly meet a good partner, Mother.

651
00:54:44,263 --> 00:54:47,760
Who's going to be better for Dokgaew than you?

652
00:54:48,031 --> 00:54:50,960
You're her equal in nobility and wealth.

653
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,520
Your and her marriage would only elevate one another.

654
00:54:54,143 --> 00:54:56,760
She's not like someone who reaches out of her league.

655
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,680
All she'd do is drag you down.

656
00:55:01,135 --> 00:55:02,840
But I don't love Dokgaew.

657
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:07,120
Pikul and I agreed on this.

658
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:10,560
If you want to cut ties with me,

659
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,160
so be it!

660
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:17,332
See? Because of you,

661
00:55:17,455 --> 00:55:19,320
my house is on fire!

662
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:21,456
If you truly love Chaai,

663
00:55:21,608 --> 00:55:23,000
you should think about it.

664
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,800
Will you remain bold and selfish?

665
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,920
Or will you make the sacrifice for Chaai's sake?

666
00:55:46,183 --> 00:55:47,200
Dear.

667
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:49,600
You should do as your mother said.

668
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:54,160
Why are you pushing me away to someone else?

669
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,840
Don't you love me anymore?

670
00:55:57,999 --> 00:56:00,280
No, my dear.

671
00:56:03,296 --> 00:56:05,296
I will always love you.

672
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,080
Do you know why?

673
00:56:08,303 --> 00:56:11,160
Because I'm confident in our love,

674
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,040
and I'm confident in my eyes.

675
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:21,800
Dear, do you see Luang Vasuthep's and Dokgaew's eyes for each other?

676
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,880
They may be arguing,

677
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,200
but their eyes...

678
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,640
I think there's something more between them.

679
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,560
You also think Puek and Dokgaew

680
00:56:32,064 --> 00:56:33,680
have feelings for one another?

681
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,920
Actually, I'm not so sure.

682
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:40,000
If you want to be sure,

683
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,160
we have to play along with their games.

684
00:56:44,496 --> 00:56:46,320
You have to make Luang Vasuthep

685
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:48,080
admit his feelings.

686
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,600
I'll do the same with Dokgaew.

687
00:56:57,016 --> 00:57:00,120
You usually don't care much about what you wear.

688
00:57:02,104 --> 00:57:04,720
It's the big day. I should dress well, right?

689
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,920
You said you love Boonta so much.

690
00:57:09,362 --> 00:57:12,160
After all, you're happy to marry Dokgaew, right?

691
00:57:17,503 --> 00:57:19,200
What about it that upsets you?

692
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,920
I just

693
00:57:22,246 --> 00:57:25,640
didn't think you would agree to marry Dokgaew so easily,

694
00:57:26,384 --> 00:57:29,000
as you're usually stubborn and never give in.

695
00:57:29,456 --> 00:57:31,160
Even if it's Aunt Tubtim,

696
00:57:31,272 --> 00:57:33,040
you wouldn't let her have her ways.

697
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,480
Luang Vasuthep sure knows you well, sir.

698
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,800
But he doesn't know his own heart.

699
00:57:43,504 --> 00:57:44,920
What are you whispering about, Yod?

700
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:46,320
I'm just saying

701
00:57:46,401 --> 00:57:48,400
this piece of cloth is gorgeous.

702
00:57:48,624 --> 00:57:50,600
It would suit my Luang well, sir.

703
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:54,640
Don't waste your time picking one.

704
00:57:55,135 --> 00:57:57,680
Even if you show up wearing a loincloth,

705
00:57:57,761 --> 00:57:59,720
Dokgaew would still love you.

706
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,840
Not only do you know me well, Puek,

707
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,800
but you also know Dokgaew well, even more so than I do.

708
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,320
Your effort when I asked you to keep her company was well worth it.

709
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:50,200
Why are you acting so sneaky here?

710
00:58:50,336 --> 00:58:52,520
Pudsorn, Nual, Chor?

711
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:54,600
What are you doing here?

712
00:58:54,975 --> 00:58:56,800
We're here to buy groceries.

713
00:58:56,904 --> 00:59:00,040
Without you, that job falls to us.

714
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:03,927
Hey, you asked to tag along,

715
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:05,440
hoping to see Captain Jon.

716
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:07,400
Don't blame it on Boonta.

717
00:59:10,455 --> 00:59:13,280
So why are you here alone?

718
00:59:13,448 --> 00:59:15,040
Where is your husband?

719
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,920
Did his mother kick you out already?

720
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,560
Easy now. Don't jinx me yet.

721
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,840
I'm just waiting for Dokgaew.

722
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,800
What do you want with that woman?

723
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,360
Your mother-in-law is cruel.

724
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,760
She knows Luang loves you, but she won't give up.

725
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,680
Dokgaew too. She caused chaos for everyone.

726
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,400
I wish I could slap them both and teach them a lesson.

727
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,120
I can't believe your Luang, either.

728
00:59:51,224 --> 00:59:52,664
You just moved in.

729
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:54,720
He shouldn't have given in so easily.

730
00:59:55,197 --> 00:59:57,160
Then, I'll slap him too!

731
00:59:57,424 --> 01:00:00,000
I won't spare him just because he's Boonta's husband.

732
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,480
You're amazing.

733
01:00:02,584 --> 01:00:03,839
Are you a slapper?

734
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,000
You don't care who it is, then?

735
01:00:07,405 --> 01:00:10,160
So why are you still calm, Boonta?

736
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,040
Will you lose your husband to her?

737
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:16,680
If I were calm, I wouldn't be waiting for her here.

738
01:00:16,983 --> 01:00:19,600
It's just that I know we're courtesans.

739
01:00:19,752 --> 01:00:21,752
We're not someone they would approve of.

740
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:24,680
I also understand his mother.

741
01:00:24,816 --> 01:00:27,640
She doesn't want one of us to be publicly known as family.

742
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:29,200
And I get it.

743
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,560
Chaai's hands are being forced.

744
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:35,520
The only one I don't understand...

745
01:00:35,608 --> 01:00:37,440
There is only one.

746
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,560
Who?

747
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,040
It's the elite girl, Dokgaew.

748
01:00:43,212 --> 01:00:44,880
Every single time!

749
01:00:48,754 --> 01:00:50,720
Speak of the devil. There she is!

750
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:55,040
Her face gives me the urge to slap!

751
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,040
Now that I found her...

752
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,040
Come on.

753
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,960
Would you help me with something?

754
01:01:21,168 --> 01:01:23,760
It's really hot tonight. Don't you think?

755
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,480
I think it's...

756
01:01:27,703 --> 01:01:30,520
You're being even hotter than the weather.

757
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:32,560
Who can resist you like this?

758
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:34,400
I think we should have a child.

759
01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:37,321
When I go out of town on a mission, you can hold our child in my stead.

760
01:01:37,471 --> 01:01:39,800
Would you like a son or a daughter?

761
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,440
No matter what,

762
01:01:42,576 --> 01:01:45,360
I can't accept that kind of woman as a daughter-in-law!

763
01:01:45,464 --> 01:01:46,784
Tell me honestly.

764
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,440
Are you really going to marry Chaai when you love Luang Vasuthep?

765
01:01:56,304 --> 01:02:00,923
They say this household has some beautiful vegetables.

766
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,320
We would like a seed to grow some of our own.

767
01:02:05,449 --> 01:02:07,160
Let's not worry about it.

768
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:09,160
It's already happening.
