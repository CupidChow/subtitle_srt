1
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,760
I'm happy you haven't shared a bed with anyone.

2
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:33,080
She just got here, and she's your favorite?

3
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,480
Learn to behave, Lamduan.

4
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:37,800
I know you don't want to work,

5
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,520
but do you want to die here?

6
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:41,160
The more you try to run,

7
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
the more Mother punishes you.

8
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,127
My master is leaving.

9
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:47,824
Wipe her feet and put on her shoes.

10
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,240
It was this girl.

11
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:53,348
She poisoned your Aunt Gaysorn and almost gave her a miscarriage.

12
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,040
What happened with Boonta today,

13
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,792
my husband must never know.

14
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,377
You don't have to service our guests anymore.

15
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,120
All I did was stand up for myself,

16
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,240
and you rewarded me, Mother?

17
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:05,120
Someone bought your freedom.

18
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,746
While I'm away,

19
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:08,360
I would like you

20
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,840
to consider

21
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
if you can open up your heart for me.

22
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,200
Has anyone seen Lamduan?

23
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:15,560
What?

24
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,840
- Seen her? - She's not upstairs either.

25
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:23,648
She's not in the sleeping quarter.

26
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:26,560
- She didn't go to the toilet. - She's not in the banana bush.

27
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:28,176
I didn't see her in the dressing room.

28
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:31,184
Could it be...

29
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:32,680
What's going on?

30
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:35,520
Are you girls fighting again?

31
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,721
Oh, not at all, ma'am!

32
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,800
Who's fighting? We love each other. Girl power, right?

33
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,120
Yeah! Right?

34
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:47,440
- Yeah! Woo! - Stop playing crazy.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,440
Boonta, get dressed.

36
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,407
Go and see Captain Jon off at the port. He requested it.

37
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:55,440
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:57,521
Mian, you go with her.

39
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:58,760
Yes, ma'am.

40
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,320
You should go, Boonta. We'll find Lamduan.

41
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,203
- Hey! - Go get dressed.

42
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,520
- Yeah, I will. - Go get dressed.

43
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,391
Come back straight away. Don't hang around.

44
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:11,780
Yes, ma'am.

45
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:14,679
Let's find her

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,254
before Mother notices she's gone.

47
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:18,600
What's going on?

48
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:21,360
Nothing, Mother. It's nothing.

49
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:23,800
Let's go.

50
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,600
Come on. Let's go.

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,840
Sir, the items on the ship are all listed in the manifest.

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,320
I told you.

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,400
The Port Authority has already inspected my ship.

54
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:47,040
You yourself recently inspected Captain James' ship.

55
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:49,280
Let me ask you this.

56
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,040
What are you really suspecting?

57
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,520
I just wanted to double-check.

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,920
The Port Authority is busy.

59
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,640
They may have overlooked things.

60
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,480
Please rest assured.

61
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,200
I'm just a merchant

62
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,280
who does business in an honest way.

63
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,840
That'd better be true.

64
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,960
If I find out there's a threat to my homeland,

65
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,440
I will not let it go.

66
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:30,960
We inspected two European ships

67
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,883
and found nothing suspicious to prove they were spies.

68
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,920
Could it be that our intel from the south

69
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,040
that the Europeans were waging war on Siam was false?

70
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,400
It could be some kind of manipulation.

71
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,920
I think we should remain calm.

72
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:52,120
Let's keep an eye on things.

73
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,000
If it wasn't true, the rumor will die out.

74
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,840
Luang, sir.

75
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm happy you came to see me off.

76
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,680
I would like you to keep yourself safe.

77
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
Don't forget what I asked.

78
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:42,280
Yes, sir. I'll sleep on it.

79
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,120
I'll come back soon.

80
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,760
I hope to hear good news.

81
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:54,280
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:59,400
So, "safe trip," sir.

83
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:01,748
- "Take care of yourself." - "Yes, you too."

84
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,280
- "Bye-bye." - "Yeah. Bye."

85
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:09,320
- Wait, sir. Captain Jon. - What is it?

86
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,440
I'm not giving you bad luck or anything,

87
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:13,640
but you should lower your expectations.

88
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,880
Boonta is attractive.

89
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,760
When you come back, you could be disappointed.

90
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:27,280
But if you open your heart,

91
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,000
you'll see other nice and beautiful girls,

92
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:32,700
no less so than Boonta, waiting for you, sir.

93
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:52,120
(Episode 3: Chinese and European Fighting Over Me... Cupid is Matchmaking)

94
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:53,720
Look at her.

95
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,040
Hey.

96
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:58,080
Mother told you to see Captain Jon off,

97
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,560
not to go shopping at the market.

98
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm just stopping by to see things.

99
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,520
Oh! Are these makeups?

100
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,480
Let me take a look, please.

101
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:17,080
It's powder!

102
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,000
I want it.

103
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,400
No money, no shopping.

104
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,960
How much could it cost?

105
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,391
Aunt, lend me some.

106
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:31,005
What?

107
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:35,520
Look, for someone like you,

108
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
lychee paper will do.

109
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:41,520
Just put this on your lips. You don't need powder.

110
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:43,120
This is cheaper.

111
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,320
No. Red lips are not enough. My face needs to glow too.

112
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,840
I want powder like I had on my auction day.

113
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,200
The one that smells good and has turmeric in it.

114
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:55,640
It was saffron. That's why it's expensive.

115
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,960
That's why Mother only lets you use it on auction day.

116
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,600
Look, for Pudsorn,

117
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:02,160
she can buy things.

118
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:06,600
She's got a lot of regulars. She's got money.

119
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:09,561
- You've got money too. - What?

120
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:12,560
- Can't you lend me some? - Leave my money alone!

121
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:16,280
- This is the brothel's money. - Why are you so stingy? Fine. Keep it.

122
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,080
- It's for your food! - Stingy!

123
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll pay for Boonta's powder.

124
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,920
Are you still working at Fang's brothel?

125
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,520
I'll see you there.

126
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,000
Who was that?

127
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,720
It's Magnate Thong.

128
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,967
He's a rich philanthropist.

129
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:05,320
He likes to help out people in need.

130
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,880
He saw you had no money and felt pity.

131
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,760
Pity?

132
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:13,680
Was that pity, or did he want me? He was suspicious.

133
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,960
- Who was? - How did I know him, though?

134
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,520
Oh, Boonta.

135
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,840
You once lived in his house.

136
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:23,560
Oops.

137
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,400
Boonta is a hot one.

138
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:29,240
She has a farang, a police,

139
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,320
- and now a rich man? - Yeah.

140
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:38,800
You're a multiple-timer woman now. There.

141
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,920
- One of your men is here. - Come back with me.

142
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,880
- Luang, sir! Boonta is already spoken for! - Hey, be gentle!

143
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,280
Luang!

144
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:49,120
Are you in a hurry or what?

145
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:51,942
How is Boonta better than me?

146
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,440
A Chinese and a European are fighting over her. She's guided by angels.

147
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:57,440
How? Every way.

148
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:01,160
She's younger, cuter, healthier.

149
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:02,800
Her skin is smoother.

150
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:04,904
Her hair is softer to the touch.

151
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,055
Her belly is flatter.

152
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,120
- And her boobs aren't saggy. - Aunt, stop!

153
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:13,160
Oh? Didn't you ask me?

154
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,040
Hey!

155
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:29,600
No! My powder!

156
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:31,784
I'll buy you a new one.

157
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:34,840
Or does it have to be from your Magnate?

158
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,720
Look, do you think you can boss me just because you're rich?

159
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:41,760
I'm not angry that you broke my powder.

160
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:44,320
I don't like how you drag me around.

161
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:45,840
Are you crazy?

162
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,975
So only the European is allowed to touch you?

163
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,440
No, not just him.

164
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:52,080
Your Magnate too.

165
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:57,000
Did you stalk me?

166
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,040
You let a man hold your hands in public.

167
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,920
Everyone there saw it.

168
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,800
I didn't have to stalk you.

169
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:11,080
Well, the one holding my hands

170
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,920
is going to buy my freedom.

171
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:16,040
I have to be nice to him. It's only right.

172
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:21,080
Did Fang sell you to Captain Jon?

173
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,960
Not yet.

174
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:29,480
He just paid a deposit on me.

175
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:32,360
I'll give him my answer when he comes back from Singapore.

176
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,080
What's your answer?

177
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,200
I don't think you can trust a European.

178
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:41,680
All they think about is trading and exploiting us.

179
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,800
If he buys you, he becomes your master.

180
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:45,880
He can do anything to you.

181
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:49,880
Are you asking me or asking yourself?

182
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,080
That was a long speech.

183
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,440
I was just giving you some advice.

184
00:12:56,744 --> 00:12:58,120
What do you say?

185
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:02,040
I haven't said anything to him yet.

186
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,120
So you don't have feelings for your Magnate anymore?

187
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,240
Do you know about Boonta and

188
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,080
Magnate Thong?

189
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:19,720
Tell me what happened.

190
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:26,360
Do you really want to recall what happened at the house?

191
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:32,520
Boonta!

192
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,360
Come back now! Something happened to Lamduan!

193
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
Whoa! What's going on?

194
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
- Come on! - Let's go!

195
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:42,680
Lamduan?

196
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:45,280
Strip her.

197
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:46,760
No, Mother!

198
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,360
- Let me go! - Lamduan!

199
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:50,816
- No! - Lamduan!

200
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:10,640
If you had run empty-handed, I could have forgiven you.

201
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:12,600
Now you stole my stuff!

202
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:14,600
You betrayed my trust.

203
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:17,320
You dare deceive me on a holy day such as today?

204
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:20,640
Mother! I'm sorry!

205
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:23,200
Please forgive me.

206
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:27,920
I won't forgive you.

207
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,120
Ming, take her away and flog her. Then, tie her up in Cham's room.

208
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,680
Nobody feeds her food or water.

209
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:38,800
Yes, ma'am. Take her away!

210
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,480
- Let me go! - Come on!

211
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:42,320
No! Let me...

212
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:45,858
- Chor! - Lamduan!

213
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:48,040
- Chor, help me! - Help her!

214
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,120
Lamduan!

215
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:52,980
Let me go. I'm going to...

216
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:04,655
Lamduan!

217
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:20,584
Please wait a minute, sir.

218
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:21,960
Have you been fine?

219
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,400
Freeloaders!

220
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,880
Dear, Uncle has been waiting.

221
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:41,640
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.

222
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,880
A ship arrived this morning, so we were busy all day.

223
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
I understand.

224
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:49,680
Your business is thriving, of course you'd be busy.

225
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,840
My niece and nephew-in-law are doing well.

226
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,480
I'm proud of you.

227
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,040
Now that you're here today,

228
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:02,160
how can I help you, sir?

229
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,840
Thank you so much, Magnate.

230
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:16,720
You're welcome, sir.

231
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:18,200
It's just a favor.

232
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,440
- Come. - Yes, sir.

233
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,911
Take the servants and carry sugar to my uncle's house.

234
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:24,080
Yes, sir.

235
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,360
You two, take the sugar and come with me.

236
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:30,455
I'll take my leave, Gaysorn.

237
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:35,040
Goodbye, Magnate.

238
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,400
Yes, sir.

239
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,400
These Thai officials are scoundrels!

240
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:16,240
All they do is rob people!

241
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,640
Don't get upset, dear.

242
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,680
At least

243
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,680
my uncle is a Chief in the Treasury.

244
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:28,726
He promised

245
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:31,040
to help with the bird nest tax.

246
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,240
These officials don't keep their word.

247
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,120
We need them as much as they need us.

248
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:45,400
Chinese merchants like you have a much easier time than Europeans.

249
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,840
You're right.

250
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,480
Let me give you a massage.

251
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,280
It's alright.

252
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:06,120
You're pregnant.

253
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,560
You had to wake up early too. Get some rest.

254
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,360
Right.

255
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:15,440
Muean.

256
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,280
Take your master to get some rest.

257
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,080
Yes, sir.

258
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:25,880
Easy, ma'am.

259
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,166
Samlee is here, sir.

260
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:51,496
Come closer.

261
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,240
You sure look like Boonta.

262
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,160
Give me a massage inside.

263
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,160
He's obsessed with her.

264
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:34,893
I wonder if he visited her, perhaps.

265
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:43,280
Why won't she just die?

266
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:04,440
Lamduan.

267
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:13,360
You're not afraid Fang would catch you

268
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:15,520
and punish you?

269
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,920
Boonta saw me worried,

270
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,440
so she snuck in and took the keys.

271
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,787
Mian told me to give you some medicine.

272
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,160
Take it and use it so you can get well soon.

273
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,480
You shouldn't have done such a foolish thing.

274
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,320
Mother is now more angry at you.

275
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,040
I stole some gold

276
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:44,880
because it was what I was supposed to earn.

277
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,240
I told you

278
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,280
I was going to get you out.

279
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
I don't want to wait anymore.

280
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,640
Being here

281
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,680
feels like Hell.

282
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,600
So you take yourself to Hell the fast way?

283
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,560
Listen.

284
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I don't want to stay here either.

285
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:11,000
I put up with it because life is worth something.

286
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,600
I don't think you should risk your life with her temper.

287
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
As long as you're alive,

288
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:19,120
you still have hope.

289
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,120
You're one to speak!

290
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,680
You can rest easy in the house!

291
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You don't have to take beatings from any guest!

292
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,520
You don't have to sleep in Cham's room like I do!

293
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,240
Other lives may be worth something,

294
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,760
but not us courtesans.

295
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:43,960
No matter what you say,

296
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,520
if I have a chance,

297
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:48,720
I will always run away.

298
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:53,280
I don't want to waste my life here.

299
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:03,600
You're right, Lamduan.

300
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,920
When I'm here,

301
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,200
I have it easier than others.

302
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,080
If you really want to leave this place,

303
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,160
I'll find a way to help you.

304
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:06,755
Is this all of Boonta's belongings?

305
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:09,880
How can I help Lamduan, then?

306
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:15,880
If this were the current era,

307
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,840
I'd just get on Hone-Krasae and ask for donations on Facebook and Twitter.

308
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,880
Lamduan would have been a free woman by now.

309
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:27,000
I sure miss Noom Kanchai.

310
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,760
I appreciate your kindness, Boonta.

311
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,440
But it's fine if you have no money.

312
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:41,600
Aunt.

313
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,440
Everyone said Boonta's family used to be rich, right?

314
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:46,080
Why don't I have a gold necklace?

315
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,560
This is all you had when you came from Magnate Thong's house.

316
00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:53,915
I think you told me

317
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,720
I used to live in his house.

318
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,360
That means...

319
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:01,400
That means you know something more, don't you?

320
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,880
Well, you

321
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:12,440
took a loan from Magnate Thong to pay for your mother's medicine.

322
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,680
When she died,

323
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:18,640
you couldn't pay him back.

324
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:21,440
That's how you became a slave to pay off your debt.

325
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:26,240
"My god!"

326
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:30,640
Is this real life or a TV show?

327
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:34,480
Suddenly, one day,

328
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:37,760
a servant from that house took you here and sold you.

329
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,320
What did she do?

330
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:50,696
She poisoned my master to cause a miscarriage

331
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,568
because she wants to be the Magnate's wife!

332
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:54,880
- I didn't do it. - Liar!

333
00:24:55,182 --> 00:24:56,560
You're a slut.

334
00:24:56,752 --> 00:24:58,840
You're desperate to become the main wife.

335
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:01,880
My master shows mercy by selling you to this place.

336
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,640
Otherwise, you would have died in chains.

337
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:13,160
How much are you selling her for?

338
00:25:38,658 --> 00:25:40,738
He gave me the creeps just by looking into his eyes.

339
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,000
Did Boonta really want to be his wife?

340
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:14,480
Why would I compare them?

341
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,640
Chaai!

342
00:26:57,464 --> 00:26:59,080
What is it, Mother?

343
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,480
Tomorrow, I need you to do something for me.

344
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:06,672
What do you need?

345
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,440
They sure look good together.

346
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,670
Just look at my boss' face.

347
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,120
I don't think they look good at all.

348
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,960
Are you blind or something?

349
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,760
You're the blind one.

350
00:27:37,912 --> 00:27:39,752
This is all you see, yet you're a know-it-all.

351
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,000
That's you!

352
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:42,520
Stop arguing.

353
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,160
Will you go home right away, Brother?

354
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,120
We're not.

355
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:07,200
Your mother told Chaai to go to the market with me.

356
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:09,360
His Majesty's birthday is next month.

357
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:11,760
I'm looking for a present for him.

358
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:16,200
It seems my mother

359
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,560
has become a matchmaker.

360
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:24,800
She probably just wants Chaai to accompany me.

361
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,560
You're right.

362
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:29,760
My mother knows

363
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,640
it's up to the couple.

364
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,800
These things can't be forced.

365
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,920
She wouldn't do that.

366
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:39,255
If you want to go to the market, let's go.

367
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,960
It's going to get hot later.

368
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:49,920
Goodbye.

369
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:01,680
- That one looks great. - Really?

370
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,400
The market is pretty big.

371
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,640
Well...

372
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:11,360
If we don't run into the husband, it's the wife instead.

373
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,400
- Who do you mean? - There she is.

374
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:15,760
It's Gaysorn, Magnate Thong's wife.

375
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,120
So that's why she picked a fight with me at the temple.

376
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:25,988
How is she related to Luang Thukkarat?

377
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,280
Why were they together?

378
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:29,600
They're not related.

379
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
It's just...

380
00:29:31,474 --> 00:29:34,000
Tubtim, Luang's mother,

381
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:37,200
is close friends with Pikul, Gaysorn's sister.

382
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:42,520
What about the nice-looking woman that was with Luang?

383
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:43,920
Is that his wife?

384
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,200
- Well... - I don't have a wife.

385
00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:50,080
Oh!

386
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:52,280
Terrible timing.

387
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,880
- We said a lot of things. - How long have they been there?

388
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,040
About six minutes.

389
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,000
Six minutes?

390
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:03,960
Aunt Mian, Lamjeak.

391
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:05,840
We're here to buy clothes, right?

392
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:10,600
- Let's go. Come on. - Wait, I'm not buying clothes!

393
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:24,160
Yeah, just come and pick something.

394
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,800
- Boonta. No... - Boonta!

395
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,200
Why did you drag us into this clothing store?

396
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,520
I'm not buying clothes.

397
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:33,920
I just bought some. I have no money left.

398
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,760
I'm not asking you to buy clothes.

399
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,469
Or would you stay and face the Luang? There he comes.

400
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,400
Yeah. Pick something.

401
00:30:40,848 --> 00:30:44,920
- This. Look. - You said European ships

402
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,320
and Chinese boats came earlier.

403
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:49,040
They brought glassware,

404
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,456
enamelware, and chinaware.

405
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:54,160
So why did you bring me to a clothing store?

406
00:30:55,527 --> 00:30:57,320
It will be summer in a few months.

407
00:30:57,863 --> 00:30:59,640
It won't hurt to get a good silk fabric.

408
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:03,240
- Let's look at something. - This one is a dragonfly pattern.

409
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:07,520
I want this one.

410
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,280
This is nice, Lamjeak.

411
00:31:18,328 --> 00:31:20,320
Try this on. It'll look good on you.

412
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:22,240
- This one. - Wow.

413
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,400
No, I'm not beautiful. My skin is dark.

414
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,400
Red is not going to look good on me.

415
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,920
- Yeah, it's... - Okay.

416
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,160
Then, this...

417
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,640
This, right here.

418
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:39,040
These colors are great. They're similar. It's easy on the eyes.

419
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
See? These two are your colors.

420
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:43,120
- What? - Yeah...

421
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,246
Yeah. This is good. Is there more?

422
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,320
Of course. Yellow works too.

423
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,200
This one is good too.

424
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:51,760
Look, this one looks so relaxing.

425
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,320
- Wow. - It makes your skin glow.

426
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:56,280
Wow. This is great too!

427
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
Weird.

428
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,920
Those colors are not worn in the palace.

429
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,440
On a Monday like this, you should wear a ripe bael yellow.

430
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,360
Match it well.

431
00:32:07,608 --> 00:32:09,608
Wear the color of the day.

432
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,360
Angels will protect and bless you.

433
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,280
Is that right, dear?

434
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:18,151
I'm not an expert at clothing.

435
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:21,880
I think her colors look uniquely beautiful.

436
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,480
Is that right?

437
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,440
You seem to be the only one in town, Luang Vasuthep,

438
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:31,680
who shares such a weird taste.

439
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:35,893
I would like a sash in a black plum color

440
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:38,192
and an indigo robe like the one she picked.

441
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:42,480
- This? You can take this one. - Thank you.

442
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:43,601
I'm so glad!

443
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:47,408
I would like a sash in moonlight color and an earth-ish yellow robe.

444
00:32:48,696 --> 00:32:50,280
Of course!

445
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,080
- She beat you to it now. - Red sash and orange robe, please.

446
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,200
Red sash and orange robe? There they are.

447
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,880
Excuse me. Here you are.

448
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,040
- Look. - Here.

449
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:08,000
Soon, there will be weird people all over town.

450
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,400
These sure look nice.

451
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:25,120
People in the past

452
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:27,240
were obsessed with new things too.

453
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:28,480
Well, you...

454
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,800
You sure have eyes for this, Boonta.

455
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,600
Next time I buy clothes, pick some for me.

456
00:33:33,736 --> 00:33:34,920
Of course.

457
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:37,240
Maybe

458
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:40,280
I should open a clothing store to compete with him?

459
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:43,829
I don't know what tradition is, yet I started a trend!

460
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,800
"Oh my god." I'm a "genius."

461
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:48,600
So fab!

462
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:50,240
You see, Dokgaew?

463
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,000
Weird people are walking all around town.

464
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,120
Let's go, Chaai.

465
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:26,680
- Dang. - Yes, ma'am.

466
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:28,400
Is he following me?

467
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,000
I said is he following me?

468
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,480
He is, but...

469
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:43,720
Luang...

470
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,640
Why are you following me, sir?

471
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,480
Who could let you go home alone?

472
00:34:50,951 --> 00:34:53,080
The one who came with me.

473
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,720
Chaai has to go to work.

474
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,040
He asked me to come and watch you.

475
00:34:57,215 --> 00:35:00,880
Is he working or stalking that courtesan?

476
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,000
So...

477
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,040
Are you jealous of that courtesan woman?

478
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm a high-ranking official's daughter.

479
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:13,520
Why would I be jealous of a courtesan?

480
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah, right?

481
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:18,080
She can't compare to you in any way.

482
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,560
She's just a courtesan who's extremely beautiful.

483
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,400
Her late father was a sugar Magnate.

484
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,520
She knows about clothing.

485
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:29,600
She is well-articulated.

486
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,200
Her manners are unique and interesting.

487
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,200
And you're a high-ranking official's daughter.

488
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,263
When you get married, the King would officiate the wedding himself.

489
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,760
You're number one.

490
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,760
Why would you be afraid of a courtesan who can only be a mistress?

491
00:35:45,703 --> 00:35:47,480
I don't want to be number one.

492
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:49,703
I want to be the only one.

493
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,760
I want to be his only lover.

494
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:07,600
Luang.

495
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,400
Why are you following me, sir?

496
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,240
I'm not.

497
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,680
I'm working.

498
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,640
Wrong. Answer again.

499
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:18,360
Tell me the truth, sir.

500
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,320
I just wanted to walk you home.

501
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,360
Walk me home, sir?

502
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:27,560
You're being a "stalker."

503
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:30,360
"Stock?"

504
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:33,562
Husband and wife are being lovey-dovey.

505
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:37,720
His fiance was there. He had to sneak out here.

506
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,320
If that's so, please don't interrupt them.

507
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,985
Let them spend time together.

508
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:44,080
Well, it's...

509
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:49,320
Hey, you don't have to drag me.

510
00:36:49,463 --> 00:36:50,463
Luang.

511
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,680
If you want to walk me home, you can just tell me.

512
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,800
Aren't you supposed to go home with your "girlfriend?"

513
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
"Girlfriend?"

514
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,560
The one who came with you.

515
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,720
You mean Dokgaew?

516
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,332
She went with Luang Vasuthep.

517
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:29,000
Now that you're here with me,

518
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,448
I have a few questions.

519
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:38,039
What was Boonta like?

520
00:37:39,104 --> 00:37:40,560
Why are you suddenly asking this?

521
00:37:40,863 --> 00:37:42,880
I heard that

522
00:37:43,008 --> 00:37:46,440
Boonta poisoned Magnate Thong's wife.

523
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,880
So she got sold to Fang's brothel.

524
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,360
Did Boonta really do that?

525
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,080
Do you happen to know?

526
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,440
Please rest assured.

527
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,480
You would never have done that.

528
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,920
From what I know of you,

529
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:08,360
you may look sweet and innocent,

530
00:38:09,784 --> 00:38:12,280
but you're determined and prideful.

531
00:38:15,104 --> 00:38:18,184
If you had shown weakness and asked for my help,

532
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:22,600
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

533
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,640
Why are you asking me?

534
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,240
Well...

535
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:36,328
I notice you

536
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,880
like to follow Boonta around.

537
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:45,360
If you don't do that out of duty for the people,

538
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,440
you probably do that

539
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,080
out of guilt for what you did to Boonta and her family, right?

540
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,240
Did you forget what happened between us?

541
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:18,246
Or are you pretending not to remember

542
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:20,280
just to upset me?

543
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:30,440
Why is your life so chaotic, Boonta?

544
00:39:30,847 --> 00:39:32,600
You haven't solved your problems,

545
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:34,360
yet he's talking about "us?"

546
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:40,000
- Too close, sir. - Boonta!

547
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,960
What's wrong, Lamjeak?

548
00:39:44,263 --> 00:39:45,920
Lamduan ran away again.

549
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:49,040
Luang, sir!

550
00:39:50,248 --> 00:39:52,464
A woman's body was found near Khlong Lod.

551
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:01,400
Who is she?

552
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:03,680
Poor thing.

553
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,400
Where?

554
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:09,880
- Is she here? - Keep an eye on Chor.

555
00:40:10,737 --> 00:40:13,040
- Move it, please. - Holy crap!

556
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:18,600
Turn her around.

557
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:28,360
Lamduan!

558
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:31,760
Chor!

559
00:40:33,576 --> 00:40:35,160
Lamduan!

560
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:38,680
Who did this to you?

561
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,840
Is it those thieves who cut off children's hands?

562
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:44,760
Those thieves steal gold.

563
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:47,160
She's a prostitute in a brothel.

564
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:48,751
What could they have stolen from her?

565
00:40:54,895 --> 00:40:56,720
If Lamduan was locked inside,

566
00:40:58,183 --> 00:40:59,400
it couldn't have been a thief.

567
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:02,176
It's an inside job.

568
00:41:17,176 --> 00:41:19,176
I came to check on her this morning,

569
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:20,800
but she was gone.

570
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:33,640
It's locked tight.

571
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,840
If nobody had taken her away,

572
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:38,360
she would have had to teleport.

573
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,840
Before Lamduan died,

574
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:49,240
what happened?

575
00:41:49,749 --> 00:41:53,207
Last night, when Chor and I brought food and medicine to Lamduan,

576
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,920
she was all right.

577
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,040
The one who holds the keys

578
00:41:57,447 --> 00:41:58,880
is Fang, sir.

579
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:01,120
Are you suspecting Fang?

580
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,600
When I ran away,

581
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,560
she threatened to kill me.

582
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:06,623
Lamduan was probably threatened that way.

583
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,920
Why would I kill her and lose my profit?

584
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:13,223
I just wanted to teach her a lesson not to run away.

585
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:52,120
You don't have to work tonight.

586
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,600
Lamduan will be servicing our guests.

587
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,080
I won't do it, Mother.

588
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:09,640
Just get in!

589
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:11,520
Mother!

590
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:14,000
Help me! Mother!

591
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,280
Let me go! Mother!

592
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:17,840
Mother!

593
00:43:18,624 --> 00:43:20,640
Let me go! Mother!

594
00:43:20,992 --> 00:43:22,320
Mother!

595
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:03,920
Fang, you heartless prostitute!

596
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,840
- You! - Lamduan!

597
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:09,280
- Lamduan! - How could you do this to me?

598
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:10,760
Let go!

599
00:44:10,888 --> 00:44:12,022
You!

600
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:14,240
Take her away!

601
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:15,360
Yes, ma'am!

602
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:18,000
Come with me! Come on!

603
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:21,760
Take her out! Quick!

604
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:26,520
Everything's fine. Please continue.

605
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,080
What did you do to her?

606
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:40,280
What would I have done to her?

607
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:43,080
Captain Jam liked her and would like to buy her.

608
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,920
I was going to sell her to him.

609
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:47,760
Fang agreed to sell her to me for cheap

610
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:50,840
to spare the trouble Lamduan was causing.

611
00:44:51,232 --> 00:44:53,600
That's why I agreed to come and buy her out today.

612
00:44:53,681 --> 00:44:55,681
Fang had ordered Ming

613
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:58,103
to lock Lamduan inside for me.

614
00:44:58,608 --> 00:44:59,920
After that,

615
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:02,200
Mother went straight home, sir.

616
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,320
In the middle of the night?

617
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:05,800
Yes, sir.

618
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,280
Her mother is sick.

619
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,320
Lately, Mother goes home often.

620
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,520
While Mother's away, I would be in charge of this place.

621
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:15,080
Last night,

622
00:45:15,293 --> 00:45:17,720
Ming asked for a day off to go home on Khlong Ma Hon, sir.

623
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,800
Ming's home is in Phra Pradaeng, man!

624
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,480
I mean... Is that right, sir?

625
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,800
It's my relative's home, sir.

626
00:45:33,407 --> 00:45:34,880
What happened to your face?

627
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:42,840
I was careless, sir.

628
00:45:43,024 --> 00:45:44,400
I fell and hit my head.

629
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,312
What color should I pick, sir?

630
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:09,040
Any color would be good.

631
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,960
Then I want every color.

632
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:17,040
I'll leave these with you, please.

633
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:19,680
Dokgaew?

634
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:28,560
Oh...

635
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:33,880
I want this pair, this pair, this pair, this pair, and this pair.

636
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:37,320
Do you have ten feet?

637
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,760
You have one body.

638
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:42,120
Yet you have different clothing.

639
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,600
You knew how to pick a sash.

640
00:46:45,295 --> 00:46:47,295
I thought you understood women well.

641
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,520
I do.

642
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,600
I just don't see His Majesty's present.

643
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:58,800
I can't decide on one yet. We'll come back later.

644
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,252
Dokgaew.

645
00:47:04,392 --> 00:47:05,560
Dokgaew.

646
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:33,048
Help your master get in the boat.

647
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:35,008
You can take off.

648
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,240
Hey, aren't you coming home?

649
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:40,479
She's visiting Tubtim, sir.

650
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,520
- Please take her stuff inside her house. - Hey!

651
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,502
Dokgaew!

652
00:48:16,703 --> 00:48:18,520
Bless you, Aunt.

653
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,280
Bless you, Pad.

654
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,697
I just got back from the market. I bought some bird nests for you.

655
00:48:30,736 --> 00:48:32,816
You shouldn't have to, Dokgaew.

656
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,080
Thank you.

657
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:43,016
What about Chaai?

658
00:48:54,943 --> 00:48:56,440
He's coming, ma'am.

659
00:48:58,607 --> 00:49:00,607
Chaai, come here.

660
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:13,400
I know you have work to do,

661
00:49:13,503 --> 00:49:15,880
but you shouldn't have let her come home alone.

662
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,200
I asked Puek to watch her.

663
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,560
Puek couldn't help you pick a present you like?

664
00:49:28,887 --> 00:49:30,980
You saw how Luang Vasuthep and I

665
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:33,080
had nothing in common.

666
00:49:35,991 --> 00:49:37,040
Next time,

667
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,400
bring her again and get something.

668
00:49:40,576 --> 00:49:43,840
She didn't get the present, but she bought something for me.

669
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,880
Thank you.

670
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,280
I'm sorry.

671
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,920
I can't go with you next time.

672
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,880
I have a case to solve.

673
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,520
What case is it this time?

674
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,680
One of Fang's courtesans was murdered, ma'am.

675
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,400
I have never seen someone die such a horrible death.

676
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,711
The killer is brutal.

677
00:50:06,973 --> 00:50:09,000
It's just a dead courtesan.

678
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:10,720
Why would you care?

679
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,680
She probably had enemies

680
00:50:12,784 --> 00:50:14,480
and got killed by them.

681
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,200
Doctors can't choose patients.

682
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,360
I'm the same way.

683
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,120
My duty

684
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,176
is to protect all the people.

685
00:50:26,303 --> 00:50:28,303
I don't want anyone to be treated like this.

686
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,200
Allow me to take my leave, Mother.

687
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:47,720
Dokgaew.

688
00:50:47,856 --> 00:50:49,760
I'll get him next time.

689
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:58,440
Chaai's mother seems afraid to upset him.

690
00:50:58,912 --> 00:51:00,800
You're losing your husband...

691
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,920
You're definitely losing Luang to that courtesan.

692
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:08,480
I won't allow it, no matter what!

693
00:51:09,823 --> 00:51:11,823
But what are you going to do, ma'am?

694
00:51:13,288 --> 00:51:15,288
If approaching his mother doesn't work,

695
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:17,623
I have to find another way.

696
00:51:30,574 --> 00:51:31,720
Chor.

697
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:33,840
Eat something, please.

698
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,600
You need strength for Lamduan's funeral.

699
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:50,240
She's at Wat Yuan, right?

700
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:52,200
So...

701
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,120
How many nights are we doing?

702
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,760
One, and cremate her right after.

703
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:06,872
I don't have money for a long funeral.

704
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,400
We don't have any relatives.

705
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,560
Even if you do, who would come?

706
00:52:17,423 --> 00:52:20,600
Nobody wants to count us vile women as family.

707
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,600
There, there.

708
00:52:34,024 --> 00:52:35,160
Here.

709
00:52:35,408 --> 00:52:36,640
For her funeral.

710
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,840
As for her debt,

711
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:49,280
it's forgiven as my merit.

712
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,840
It's alright.

713
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:06,760
She's making merit to cover up.

714
00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:12,160
If you didn't see her do it,

715
00:53:12,335 --> 00:53:14,400
don't accuse Mother baselessly.

716
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:18,080
She's just cruel, but she can't order a kill.

717
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,040
Otherwise, Ming would have killed you by now.

718
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:23,080
She's generous.

719
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,000
She even takes care of us.

720
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:28,880
It's because you're useful to her. That's why she's supportive.

721
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,000
That's not the case for Lamduan.

722
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,136
Lamduan won't have to run anymore.

723
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,560
She's resting in peace now.

724
00:54:01,175 --> 00:54:02,840
I'll find evidence

725
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,280
to prove that Fang had Lamduan killed.

726
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,080
Then she'll be arrested.

727
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:10,608
Her brothel will be closed.

728
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,584
Then all of us will be free.

729
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:16,000
No one will die like Lamduan.

730
00:54:16,614 --> 00:54:18,720
I'm doing this for all of us.

731
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,320
For us or for you?

732
00:54:21,735 --> 00:54:22,975
You said Mother has her profit.

733
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:25,135
You're looking to benefit yourself too.

734
00:54:27,328 --> 00:54:28,800
The dead are gone.

735
00:54:29,943 --> 00:54:31,800
The living has to carry on.

736
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,080
The dead are gone.

737
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:55,600
I can't turn back time to say anything to you, Lamduan.

738
00:54:57,264 --> 00:55:00,040
But I'll prove that you are worth something.

739
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,240
You shouldn't have died for nothing, Lamduan.

740
00:55:39,696 --> 00:55:40,880
Hey!

741
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,656
Are you waiting for other brothels to steal your guests?

742
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,360
Stop dressing up and go to work!

743
00:55:45,744 --> 00:55:46,840
Lamjeak.

744
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:48,640
Go light some incense.

745
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,200
Who are you lighting your incense for?

746
00:56:05,848 --> 00:56:07,880
For your mother, maybe?

747
00:56:08,344 --> 00:56:10,240
We light incense and smoke it under the lamps

748
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:12,231
to attract customers.

749
00:56:20,488 --> 00:56:21,678
Hey!

750
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,040
We're open! If you're hungry, eat and go to work!

751
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,560
Ming.

752
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,760
Are you eating too much? You asked for seconds twice already.

753
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,000
Aunt, my job is hard. It's normal for me to eat a lot.

754
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,160
It's your job to feed us. Do it. Don't be stingy.

755
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:47,080
Who's stingy? I'm just saying.

756
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:49,080
I'm worried you'd be out of shape.

757
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,160
Aunt!

758
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,280
Do we have more? I want seconds too.

759
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,400
Whoa! You guys are eating too much!

760
00:57:01,504 --> 00:57:03,360
Why are you eating so much?

761
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,199
Look. If you eat this much, don't waste the food by slacking off.

762
00:57:07,295 --> 00:57:08,815
- We will. - Yeah.

763
00:58:10,616 --> 00:58:11,832
Where did he go?

764
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,255
I didn't see her. No.

765
00:58:33,721 --> 00:58:34,880
Is she gone?

766
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,400
Where is she?

767
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:38,400
Who was that?

768
00:58:38,604 --> 00:58:40,960
Every girl is inside.

769
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:45,000
Don't tell me...

770
00:58:46,744 --> 00:58:48,120
Lamduan?

771
00:58:56,688 --> 00:58:57,920
I'm spooked!

772
00:58:59,343 --> 00:59:00,695
Was that Lamduan?

773
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:25,880
How dare you stalk me?

774
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,560
If you didn't do anything,

775
00:59:27,657 --> 00:59:28,800
why would you be afraid?

776
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:32,400
Don't think I can't hurt you because I sold you.

777
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,040
I can change my mind and sell you to someone else.

778
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,760
I know I'm one of Mother's properties.

779
00:59:37,904 --> 00:59:41,040
You have no right to help me if it's not your duty.

780
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:43,360
And we're not related in any way.

781
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,280
- I'm just... - "Girlfriend?"

782
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,040
That night, Ming didn't go to Khlong Ma Hon.

783
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,920
He took a boat to Phra Pradaeng, sir.

784
00:59:53,384 --> 00:59:54,384
Ming!

785
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:03,840
- Get him! - Ming!

786
01:00:04,016 --> 01:00:05,118
I'm here to help you,

787
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:06,317
but you left me!
