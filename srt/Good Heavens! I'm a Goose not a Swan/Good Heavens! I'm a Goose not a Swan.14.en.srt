1
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,407
Are you going out of town again?

2
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:29,760
Help!

3
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:43,080
Whoa!

4
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:50,520
Go get Magnate Thong.

5
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,648
- If Master Gaysorn... - I know what I'm doing!

6
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,880
Don't lecture me! Go!

7
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,440
Master Gaysorn is giving birth!

8
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,960
Master Gaysorn is giving birth, sir.

9
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,479
You helped me.

10
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,280
Of course I'd help you back.

11
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:12,520
Boom?

12
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,040
Chaai?

13
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,120
I was late because I got caught up with work.

14
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,440
Are you alright?

15
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:48,480
Yes, dear.

16
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,920
Even if you're not here with me,

17
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:55,960
I won't die so easily.

18
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:03,040
My son.

19
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,720
That's your daughter.

20
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:09,960
Our child is a girl.

21
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:32,720
Boonta.

22
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:38,680
You're finally back.

23
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,280
I was about to go and help you look for her.

24
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,640
Luang!

25
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:54,900
He returned and came right here to see you with Luang Vasuthep.

26
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,520
This girl came with them.

27
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,520
So,

28
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,480
who is she, sir?

29
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
We came from the Police Force.

30
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:17,480
What happened?

31
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:19,200
You can tell us.

32
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:24,200
I was coming home from gathering wild herbs.

33
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
I saw someone moving

34
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,240
like they were doing something.

35
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:32,840
I didn't even approach them.

36
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,640
Those bandits saw me,

37
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:36,800
and they chased me, sirs.

38
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:38,360
If you are alright,

39
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,280
I'll escort you home.

40
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,120
You might run into them again.

41
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,080
I don't want to go home, sirs.

42
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm an orphan. I don't have anyone.

43
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:53,320
If you don't mind,

44
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:57,760
please take me in as your slave.

45
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,280
You don't have anyone?

46
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,200
But you don't have to become a slave.

47
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,680
You can work, you know.

48
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,360
I don't know any craft.

49
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
What work can I possibly do?

50
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:16,977
Luang saved my life.

51
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:20,298
Please take me in as your slave, sir.

52
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:24,320
Girl.

53
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,600
What's your name?

54
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,000
Noknoi.

55
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,760
Noknoi, you can stay here for a while.

56
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,360
Hey, Boonta.

57
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:39,440
Don't you think you should ask me? I own this place.

58
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:41,320
No.

59
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm not a courtesan. Why would I stay here?

60
00:06:44,623 --> 00:06:45,960
Look, girl.

61
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:49,440
This place is not just for courtesans.

62
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,960
Isn't that right, Mother?

63
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,480
Here, we have food, beds, and work.

64
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,320
If you don't know anything, someone will teach you.

65
00:06:57,344 --> 00:06:58,440
More importantly,

66
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,687
our mother is really, really kind.

67
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:02,680
She welcomes a complete stooge...

68
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:06,296
A complete stranger like you

69
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:08,120
to stay here.

70
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:21,942
You can stay.

71
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:25,200
Just help out in the kitchen as Boonta does.

72
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:28,680
That's settled,

73
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,520
Noknoi.

74
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:44,139
(Announcement for Songkran.)

75
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,600
(1188 Minor Era.)

76
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:49,040
(In the auspicious year)

77
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:52,600
(of 2365 Buddhist Era.)

78
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:57,080
(On this joyous occasion on the waxing moon, )

79
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,800
(the fifth day is an auspicious day.)

80
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,200
(The God of Sun)

81
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:06,080
(has made the journey from Pisces to Aries, )

82
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:09,040
(traveling along a distant path to the celestial mountain.)

83
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:12,200
(All the while, there was a celestial goddess)

84
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:15,520
(by the name of Raksasthevi, )

85
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,320
(descending from the Realm of the Four Heavenly Kings.)

86
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:20,280
(She performed sacred miracles)

87
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:23,407
(while wearing a protective armlet, adorning herself with a lotus flower, )

88
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,160
(donning a divine agate robe, and consuming sacred blood food.)

89
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,480
(In her right hand, she holds a trident.)

90
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,080
(In her left hand, she holds a bow and arrows.)

91
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,560
(She traveled majestically)

92
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:37,200
(on the back of a divine swine.)

93
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:39,520
(On this Maha Songkran, )

94
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,960
(Wednesday is the New Year's Eve.)

95
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:45,320
(Thursday is the New Year's Day.)

96
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,120
(Thus the turn of the year is)

97
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:51,880
(Thursday the seventh of the waxing moon in the fifth month, )

98
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:54,240
(at 24 past nine in the evening.)

99
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,800
(This time marks the end of the year of the Rooster, )

100
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,280
(and the beginning of the year of the Dog.)

101
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:03,640
(Thus the new year is 1188 Minor Era, )

102
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:06,320
(the year of the Dog.)

103
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,026
This pink one...

104
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:11,820
Wow! It matches so well.

105
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:15,200
Boonta's grill and soup

106
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:17,281
have made me so much money.

107
00:09:17,362 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm giving out food.

108
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,720
Wait, Mother.

109
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:26,440
Do you have to go this big just to give out food? Do we need new clothes?

110
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:30,440
We'll just be cooks and give out food.

111
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,840
We're not going on a runway.

112
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,840
You're so amnesiac you forget the day and time, Boonta.

113
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,295
We're buying new robes and sashes

114
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:41,720
because Maha Songkran is drawing near.

115
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:43,008
They just announced it.

116
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,480
This year, it's Tuesday, the fifth of the fifth month.

117
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:49,719
You need the government to announce Songkran Day?

118
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:55,760
Don't you know, Boonta? Songkran is the turn of the Minor Era year.

119
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:59,800
We find out the date from the government's announcement.

120
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:07,080
So, Songkran is the Thai New Year.

121
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,720
Boonta drowned and lost her memory.

122
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,560
Next year is the year of the Dog, 1188 Minor Era.

123
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,680
So, what do you do during Songkran in this era?

124
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,640
If you don't remember, just wait and see.

125
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:23,920
We have to choose clothes. Stop talking.

126
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,680
No, Songkran is the occasion for flowers.

127
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,800
I have a flower pattern too. Here.

128
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:40,400
Boonta!

129
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,000
Can you even afford this? It's so expensive. Only rich people wear this.

130
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:50,680
Those flowers aren't enough for me.

131
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,240
I need more flowers.

132
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,303
I'm going to make flower-patterned shirts.

133
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:03,160
I saw my "stylist"...

134
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:06,280
Someone I know

135
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,320
printed patterns on shirts like

136
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:10,557
flowers, leaves, and things.

137
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:14,920
The tools aren't quite the same, but I think we can do it.

138
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,800
- So how do you do that? - Yeah.

139
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,840
Make it damp, not completely dry.

140
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:27,800
- And then what? - Spread it out.

141
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:30,440
Stretch it all the way.

142
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,960
- That's right. Stretch it tight. - Is this good?

143
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,440
Lay it down.

144
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:39,960
Then, place the leaves and create a pattern.

145
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:52,240
See? Then, we fold the edges in.

146
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:53,640
Just a bit.

147
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:56,520
Just to prevent the leaves and flowers from falling off.

148
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,040
I'm going to roll it in.

149
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:05,640
- Just roll it over? - That's right.

150
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,880
Stretch it out for me. Make it tight.

151
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:10,423
- Stretch. Easy. - Be careful. Don't place one on top of the other.

152
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:12,040
Watch your fingers.

153
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,646
- See? - Roll it in.

154
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:21,352
- Oh? - You do it like you've done it before.

155
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:23,960
- You're good. - Now that's done. Come on.

156
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,437
Use this thread...

157
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:28,520
Here, Aunt.

158
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,290
- Wrap it like a sausage. - Huh?

159
00:12:58,623 --> 00:12:59,880
Here.

160
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,920
Wow!

161
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,600
The color sticks!

162
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,720
- Take the leaves out. - Pick them off.

163
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,600
- Pick them off. - Go ahead and remove them.

164
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,760
- It turned purple. - That's right. See?

165
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:21,320
See? This is a flower sash. Khaosan style.

166
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,760
Is this all it takes? Is it going to last?

167
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,080
It doesn't matter if it washes off. We just wear this during the festival.

168
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:33,080
For Songkran, we can't dress boringly.

169
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:37,360
We have to make it fab! Make it dope! Make it go hard!

170
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,360
Cute, lit, and dope.

171
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:44,960
Yeah, I want it. Let me. I'll try it on.

172
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,801
I'm old anyway. It won't make a difference.

173
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,240
See? What do you think?

174
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:53,281
- It looks good on you! - You look great, Aunt!

175
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:54,640
-You do. - It's bright!

176
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:59,362
- See? It does look good. It's cooling too. - Looking good, Aunt.

177
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,808
Hey, won't you do it with us?

178
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:03,360
No.

179
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,559
I don't do weird things.

180
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:07,680
It was good the way it was before.

181
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,080
Listen, Boonta.

182
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,920
Why did you let that girl stay here?

183
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,320
Don't you see she's eyeing the Luang?

184
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm not stupid.

185
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:24,320
It's better if I keep her close.

186
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:26,160
If she's here,

187
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,560
I can watch her and stop her from getting close to Chaai.

188
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:32,760
- Move. - Hey.

189
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:34,360
What are you doing?

190
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Ming, do you want this too?

191
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:40,760
Let's "squad up" as a gang.

192
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:47,040
So where can I find men's shirts?

193
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:56,263
(Episode 14: War on Songkran... Battlefield Kitchen)

194
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:50,000
- Here, take this too. - Aunt, sorry.

195
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:54,720
Every time I make merit,

196
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,480
I run into these people.

197
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:01,880
The abbot said someone else was also giving out food.

198
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:06,080
I didn't think it would be Mrs. Tubtim.

199
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,160
Should we move, Mother?

200
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:11,160
I won't. I intended to do it here.

201
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:13,440
Focus on the pots and grills.

202
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:16,960
Are you sure, Mother?

203
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:18,200
Luang and Boonta...

204
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,680
If Boonta and Luang are in love,

205
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,440
they have to get through his mother.

206
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:26,960
Let's find out what she thinks so we can deal with her.

207
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,600
I was going to announce Chaai and Dokgaew's wedding.

208
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:35,960
Yet these courtesans

209
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,151
are ruining my event.

210
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:41,520
Don't get upset.

211
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,280
It's good they're here.

212
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,200
We'll show them

213
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:47,160
that they don't belong.

214
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,320
What are they giving out? Why are there so many people?

215
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,800
They do rice and shrimp paste dip

216
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,181
with a big fried mackerel

217
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:11,181
and a side of vegetables. That's like palace food.

218
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:20,560
Are they here to make merit or to brag about their wealth?

219
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:23,680
Did they bring all their belongings and servants?

220
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,800
Hey, cutie.

221
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,600
We got food over here too.

222
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,440
I'm sorry.

223
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,880
I almost dropped it.

224
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,880
Chaai, hold her hands, son.

225
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:09,669
She had the strength to run after my Luang before.

226
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:11,560
Why is she suddenly weak?

227
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:13,160
Don't you think so, sir?

228
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:20,560
If it's too heavy, I'll help you.

229
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:23,720
Thank you, sir.

230
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,360
But I can hold it with Chaai.

231
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,240
You said you would help me.

232
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:40,640
Gods bless you.

233
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,880
Luang and...

234
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:44,471
Dokgaew.

235
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,080
She's Chaai's fiancée.

236
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,920
They look good together.

237
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:57,031
These foods are Dokgaew's cooking.

238
00:20:57,221 --> 00:21:00,163
She is in charge of the kitchen for this event.

239
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:09,800
I want to see my son settle down with a good woman like Dokgaew

240
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:11,600
so I can rest easy.

241
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:15,840
Mother.

242
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,911
All Chaai does is work.

243
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,480
Chim is busy

244
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,760
because he just became the Bird Nest Taxmaster.

245
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:25,200
At least I have Chang,

246
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,800
who left monkhood and took over my family's business.

247
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,600
You should get married soon, sir.

248
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:36,240
Tubtim needs a daughter-in-law to take care of her.

249
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,040
If you get married too old, your children won't grow up soon enough.

250
00:21:41,152 --> 00:21:43,760
Tubtim needs company too.

251
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:49,960
With that being said, I think I should schedule the wedding day.

252
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,280
So perhaps the rumors that Luang is attracted to a courtesan

253
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,960
aren't true?

254
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,720
It's not!

255
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:08,640
Why would Chaai stoop so low and take that kind of woman as his wife?

256
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:12,840
She spreads her leg for others, yet she doesn't make enough to live.

257
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,520
She has to do other work.

258
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,920
I don't spread...

259
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:22,080
Mother, that's enough.

260
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:27,800
I think I should go.

261
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:42,640
Boonta.

262
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:44,181
Yes?

263
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:47,040
My booth barely gets any guests.

264
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,960
They're all over there.

265
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:53,241
Boat racing

266
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:55,400
is something you can compete in.

267
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:59,800
But heritage and prestige are not something you can compete in.

268
00:23:00,473 --> 00:23:02,640
People want palace food.

269
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:07,280
They don't want something courtesans cook.

270
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:13,720
Then, make them want to eat what courtesans cook.

271
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:18,520
Your cooking is every bit as good as an elite's.

272
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,600
Show them what you can do.

273
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:27,360
You're right.

274
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:34,832
What's this?

275
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:38,920
What are you doing?

276
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,480
We didn't do anything.

277
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:44,320
It's those people.

278
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:46,600
Those people?

279
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:51,560
Are they trying to burn the temple down?

280
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:53,320
Why is there so much smoke?

281
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:02,520
Mrs. Tubtim, would you like some grilled meat, ma'am?

282
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:03,880
We have some done and ready.

283
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm not here to...

284
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,703
- Sauce, come on. - Yes, Mother.

285
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:12,240
Here you go.

286
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:13,760
Boonta!

287
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,760
Please try it, Mother.

288
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:20,600
It tastes quite good.

289
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:22,840
It's really good, Mother.

290
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:24,520
I love it!

291
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,448
Can I have some too?

292
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,174
And I would like a take-home for my wife.

293
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:34,440
Yes, sir.

294
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:37,920
- Me too. - Of course.

295
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:43,200
- Thank you. - Thanks.

296
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:17,120
Master Tubtim, don't fall for them. Spit it out! Spit!

297
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,240
Whoa!

298
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:40,080
Courtesans like you people

299
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,623
always do strange and weird things.

300
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,360
You think doing this would improve your image?

301
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,520
The courtesans' food

302
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:49,960
is just like you people.

303
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:52,840
It's good for a night, for one time only.

304
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,520
It's not good for life.

305
00:25:55,648 --> 00:25:57,648
- Tch! - You're going too far, ma'am.

306
00:25:57,744 --> 00:26:00,080
We're courtesans, but we're humans too.

307
00:26:00,176 --> 00:26:01,480
We can make merit too.

308
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:03,760
You want to make merit?

309
00:26:03,848 --> 00:26:06,960
Spend the money from sleeping with men to build your own temple!

310
00:26:07,057 --> 00:26:10,295
You can make merit and give out food all you want then!

311
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:11,600
I will, ma'am!

312
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,280
Just wait and see. I'll build a temple.

313
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,560
Mrs. Tubtim, you sure go big.

314
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,200
You make merit as a front,

315
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,760
but you actually want to announce

316
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,400
your son's got a fiancée.

317
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:24,760
Isn't that right?

318
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:29,183
I think you should ask your son, ma'am.

319
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:30,800
You're arranging his marriage

320
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:34,520
knowing that your son is attracted to my girl.

321
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:38,240
He visits my place almost every night.

322
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:41,480
He even said he'd buy Boonta's freedom.

323
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,280
Watch your mouth, Fang.

324
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:45,647
I'm sorry, sir.

325
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,680
I forgot you and your mother are both thin-skinned.

326
00:26:50,448 --> 00:26:52,800
You Sampheng woman! You lowly people!

327
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,640
It's your girl who eyes my son!

328
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,400
Let me warn you. Don't be too ambitious.

329
00:26:58,481 --> 00:27:00,481
You're the one who should warn your son

330
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,825
not to stoop down to our level.

331
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:05,465
Take me home!

332
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:06,963
- I don't want to stay too long. - Yes, ma'am.

333
00:27:06,987 --> 00:27:10,000
- The low-class disease is spreading to me! Chaai, go! - Yeah, go!

334
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:12,680
- Luang! - Who are you talking to?

335
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:14,400
What are you to him?

336
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,680
You darned woman!

337
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:19,279
Are you trying to embarrass my master?

338
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,520
You wicked people!

339
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:23,280
I'm going to teach you how to know your place!

340
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,352
- Calm down! - Are you going to fight in a temple?

341
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:30,760
- Dang! Destroy their booth! - Yes, ma'am!

342
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:43,160
No! Don't!

343
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:48,859
Stop!

344
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:50,479
I said stop!

345
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,680
If you don't, I'll put you all in jail!

346
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:18,400
Chaai, how could you do that?

347
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:21,000
You helped that woman in front of Dokgaew!

348
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:23,760
Don't you think Pikul and I would be embarrassed?

349
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:26,960
Officials all over town have daughters.

350
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,920
How dare you like a lowly courtesan of all people?

351
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Mother.

352
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:34,240
For me,

353
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,680
a courtesan is not a lowly woman.

354
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:40,920
I love Boonta for who she is and for her personality.

355
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,280
I don't care about ranks or classes.

356
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:49,911
I have been in love with her for a long time.

357
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:53,720
I love her even more now.

358
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:57,520
Boonta will be my only love.

359
00:28:58,144 --> 00:28:59,560
My everlasting love.

360
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,920
Even if you don't approve,

361
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,400
I won't stop loving her.

362
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,036
I will marry Boonta no matter what.

363
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:13,127
No, I won't allow it.

364
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:17,711
Chim, Chang.

365
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:19,783
Please convince him for me!

366
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Mother.

367
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:31,640
Chaai.

368
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:34,400
If you really like Boonta,

369
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:37,400
you must buy her freedom.

370
00:29:39,023 --> 00:29:41,023
- Chim! - Mother.

371
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,800
You know Chaai is a passive-aggressive type.

372
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:45,680
If he's made up his mind,

373
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:47,200
no matter what I say,

374
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,976
he won't listen.

375
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:53,000
If you care about our mother,

376
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,360
just don't take her home.

377
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,000
Mother.

378
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,560
I disagree.

379
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,360
She should visit us from time to time.

380
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,600
If you get to know Boonta better,

381
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:11,360
you might understand

382
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
why Chaai likes her.

383
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
No!

384
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:16,680
I won't allow you

385
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,400
to be in love with her!

386
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,960
That woman, all she does is drag you down!

387
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,360
I won't allow it, no matter what!

388
00:30:27,831 --> 00:30:29,080
Mother?

389
00:30:29,752 --> 00:30:31,320
Mother?

390
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:34,400
- Mother? - What's wrong?

391
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:40,000
Is someone here? I need an inhaler!

392
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:42,824
Mother...

393
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:44,329
I'll leave Mother with you.

394
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:53,160
- Kerd! - Chaai.

395
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,080
Let him go.

396
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,560
Mother is not that sick.

397
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:14,080
Puek.

398
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:15,920
What's the matter?

399
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:18,717
Dokgaew is waiting for you at the temple.

400
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:20,480
She asked me to find you.

401
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,760
That's all. Goodbye.

402
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm not trying to interfere or anything, Chaai,

403
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:36,360
but if you don't have feelings for Dokgaew, just tell her.

404
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,720
You don't like to be direct.

405
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,007
That's why it has dragged on for far too long.

406
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,000
Puek said you wanted to see me.

407
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,360
Yes.

408
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:23,160
It's Songkran.

409
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,800
I want to build a sand pagoda with you.

410
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:29,760
It was too chaotic earlier, so I didn't ask you to come.

411
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:38,566
I heard building a sand pagoda

412
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,400
is equal in merit to donating pebbles and sand.

413
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:44,672
If a man and a woman build one together,

414
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:46,480
- they will be... - Dokgaew.

415
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,080
I can't build a sand pagoda with you.

416
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,120
Why not?

417
00:32:57,448 --> 00:33:00,280
I want to build a sand pagoda with the woman I love.

418
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,880
Do you mean

419
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,280
Boonta?

420
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,640
You may love her,

421
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:17,400
but you won't end up together anyway.

422
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:20,639
Even if I don't end up together with Boonta,

423
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:23,520
I don't think of you

424
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:25,720
more than a little sister.

425
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,600
I'm sorry.

426
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:21,160
Young Miss.

427
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:23,920
Let me go. I want to cry alone.

428
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,158
We...

429
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,240
Leave me alone. I said go!

430
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,280
Boonta, did you see what Luang's mother is capable of?

431
00:35:09,536 --> 00:35:11,536
No matter how much the man loves you,

432
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:15,920
sometimes he can't protect you from the women around him.

433
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:17,916
And if one of those women is his mother,

434
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,380
would he dare go against his parent?

435
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,200
If you insist on being in love with him,

436
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:23,281
this is far from the last time.

437
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:25,960
I played this role in a show,

438
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:28,040
and I'm playing this role in real life?

439
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:30,720
I finally have an off-screen boyfriend.

440
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:35,120
Do I still get the cliché daughter-in-law role?

441
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,800
There's also a class gap.

442
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:40,200
In acting, I got it nailed, though.

443
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,120
Can I ask for a role change?

444
00:35:42,463 --> 00:35:44,960
Why would you worry, Boonta?

445
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,960
It's not like Luang will marry you as his legit wife.

446
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:51,320
It's better to be his favorite courtesan.

447
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:53,079
You have Mother to protect you.

448
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,520
No mother-in-law can hurt you.

449
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,400
Hey, are you trying to comfort her or not?

450
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,720
Don't listen to Pudsorn.

451
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:03,480
She's never been in love.

452
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,679
Should I listen to someone who's been in love

453
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,720
and got dumped by a husband like you?

454
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,320
I may not have love,

455
00:36:12,023 --> 00:36:13,640
but I have money.

456
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:16,760
You can survive without love, but without money,

457
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,120
you'll surely die.

458
00:36:19,904 --> 00:36:21,520
Pudsorn is right, though.

459
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:27,320
I won't be anyone's secret wife or a third or fourth family.

460
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,760
I'd rather be single and save up to buy my own freedom.

461
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:37,440
Over there. Someone is waiting to make up with you.

462
00:36:42,445 --> 00:36:44,824
Come on. Let's get in the boat and go home.

463
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,520
- Yes, Mother. - Not you, Boonta.

464
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,320
Clear it up with your Luang.

465
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,912
- Mother just set you up. - Aunt!

466
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,640
Bye.

467
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,080
I said go away, Dang.

468
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:36,440
I'm not Dang.

469
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,520
Luang.

470
00:37:44,183 --> 00:37:45,600
Why are you here, sir?

471
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,000
Don't you see I'm crying?

472
00:37:51,183 --> 00:37:52,800
You don't own the temple.

473
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,920
You can cry all you want.

474
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:57,240
I'm going to build a sand pagoda.

475
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:15,040
Are you still crying?

476
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,080
Why are you crying so much?

477
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:22,969
Your tears are going to flood my sand pagoda.

478
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:25,920
You must rebuild it for me.

479
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:31,720
Are my tears Khlong Ong Ang or something?

480
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,160
If you keep making fun of me,

481
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:36,241
I can't cry anymore.

482
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:38,760
That's good.

483
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,440
Come and build a sand pagoda with me then.

484
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:26,784
Building a sand pagoda is a big merit.

485
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,560
The merit will guide you.

486
00:39:29,928 --> 00:39:31,832
It will make your love life successful.

487
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,240
Chaai.

488
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,720
Are you going to walk until 2567 B.E.?

489
00:40:29,655 --> 00:40:31,840
2567 B.E.?

490
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,680
I was being sarcastic.

491
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:36,960
If you have something to say, just say it.

492
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:38,640
You're sarcastic.

493
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,880
That means you're mad at me.

494
00:40:46,463 --> 00:40:48,920
I'm mad at destiny, actually.

495
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,200
It's like

496
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:55,400
you win a lottery, but you can't cash it in.

497
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,560
Wait. Don't get down on your knee.

498
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
You have to say...

499
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,280
"Yes, you do?"

500
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:17,280
"Yes, I..."

501
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,000
"I" is me. "You" is you.

502
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,360
"Yes, I do." Yeah.

503
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,200
"Yes, I do," sir.

504
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,320
Why would I get down on my knee?

505
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,440
I'm giving you this ring as a gift.

506
00:41:57,751 --> 00:41:59,600
I told my mother about us.

507
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,280
Your mother disapproved, did she?

508
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:16,960
I'll try harder.

509
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,200
I want her to approve.

510
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:23,160
I'll marry you into my household.

511
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,400
I know I've made you sad,

512
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:30,600
but I want you to trust me.

513
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,000
This ring must be so expensive, right?

514
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:44,800
Is that why you're buying my trust with this?

515
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,280
It's an insurance from me.

516
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,319
If I make you too sad to bear

517
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,560
and don't want anything to do with me again,

518
00:42:57,312 --> 00:42:58,760
just sell this ring

519
00:42:58,983 --> 00:43:00,303
and buy your own freedom.

520
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:07,831
"Okay."

521
00:43:09,696 --> 00:43:11,640
With this secret "deal" of love,

522
00:43:12,648 --> 00:43:14,648
I'll accept your logic.

523
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,136
I hope it's not fake, though.

524
00:43:20,504 --> 00:43:23,040
Now that you've given me something,

525
00:43:24,223 --> 00:43:26,560
I have something for you too.

526
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:38,680
I made this for you because if I sew your old shirt, it won't be the same.

527
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:45,680
It's the same pattern as your robe.

528
00:43:46,863 --> 00:43:50,536
Of course. This is our couple's outfit.

529
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:52,744
Even if we're in the chatting phase,

530
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:55,720
we can wear a couple's outfit.

531
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,720
If we're lovers,

532
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,240
what do we wear then?

533
00:44:02,694 --> 00:44:04,000
Wedding outfits?

534
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,120
Hey, Luang! What are you saying?

535
00:44:07,263 --> 00:44:09,200
That's really too far!

536
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,920
I'll elope with you. Let's go.

537
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:20,080
Are you worried someone might recognize you?

538
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,416
Come on. Let me borrow this.

539
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:29,560
Here.

540
00:44:30,102 --> 00:44:32,975
Put some white clay on so nobody recognizes you.

541
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:36,600
On your cheeks. And here.

542
00:44:43,953 --> 00:44:45,720
You put on some too.

543
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:47,400
So nobody recognizes us.

544
00:44:57,815 --> 00:44:59,060
Boom!

545
00:45:04,345 --> 00:45:05,680
Let's trade.

546
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:07,320
Come on.

547
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:10,168
Here. Take this!

548
00:45:13,551 --> 00:45:14,871
Take this!

549
00:45:22,104 --> 00:45:23,472
Here goes!

550
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:27,368
Let me take some.

551
00:45:40,624 --> 00:45:42,480
It looks like you've accepted it now.

552
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,440
No, sir.

553
00:45:45,736 --> 00:45:48,080
I still like Chaai.

554
00:45:51,735 --> 00:45:54,480
Even if Chaai is in love with Boonta

555
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,880
and sees me as a little sister,

556
00:45:57,792 --> 00:46:00,360
he and Boonta won't end up together.

557
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:03,720
If they keep pushing their love, all they will face is trouble.

558
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:08,480
Are you going to add to their trouble?

559
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:10,560
Is it so wrong, though?

560
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:12,240
I'm just obedient to my parents

561
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:14,280
and do what they want.

562
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,480
Aunt Tubtim favors me

563
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:19,520
because I'm better, more worthy.

564
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:22,720
It's wrong that you're stubborn.

565
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,200
You're selfish.

566
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:26,985
You're just using your parents to force Chaai to do what you want,

567
00:46:27,662 --> 00:46:30,640
even if it's against the will of the man you love.

568
00:46:31,312 --> 00:46:33,080
You said you would help me.

569
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,800
So why do you keep getting in my way?

570
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:38,367
If I end up together with Chaai,

571
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,880
you can end up together with Boonta.

572
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:43,440
Or are you just putting up a good front

573
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,482
and waiting to steal your friend's girl?

574
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:46,682
Dokgaew.

575
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,120
If what I say isn't true,

576
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,200
then deny it.

577
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,080
Explain why you don't help me.

578
00:46:55,056 --> 00:46:57,520
Do you still like Boonta?

579
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,400
Who I like is not your business.

580
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,094
You said Chaai and Boonta are pushing their love.

581
00:47:10,383 --> 00:47:11,560
They're not.

582
00:47:12,176 --> 00:47:14,880
The one who's pushing is you.

583
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,640
What's wrong, Puek?

584
00:47:35,721 --> 00:47:37,280
Why did you suddenly want to drink?

585
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:45,600
I think I've seen this emotion before.

586
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,280
It's the same emotion you had on Boonta's auction night.

587
00:47:54,015 --> 00:47:55,880
If it's the same as Chaai,

588
00:47:56,632 --> 00:47:57,880
could it be

589
00:47:58,327 --> 00:47:59,880
Puek is in love?

590
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,360
Nonsense. What love, Chang?

591
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,240
Doing business in Siam is troublesome.

592
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,840
There's a lot of fees to pay.

593
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:13,720
We have to pay for the translator's clerk

594
00:48:13,856 --> 00:48:15,480
even if he doesn't have one.

595
00:48:16,255 --> 00:48:18,160
And what about the ship tax?

596
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,600
There's no standard to it.

597
00:48:19,879 --> 00:48:21,320
What a coincidence.

598
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,520
Captain Henry is negotiating ship tax.

599
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,320
But the Treasury said

600
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,120
he's asking for too much of a discount.

601
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,993
However, the lower the tax is,

602
00:48:33,097 --> 00:48:38,000
the more incentive there is for Great Britain's ships to come to Siam.

603
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:40,200
The Siamese business

604
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:43,000
is all about exploiting and profiting!

605
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,000
Isn't that too far, Captain?

606
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,360
If you do business with a foreign nation,

607
00:48:48,616 --> 00:48:50,200
you have to follow their rules.

608
00:48:53,274 --> 00:48:55,071
I tried to avoid Fang's.

609
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,080
Yet I still run into the Luangs here.

610
00:48:58,504 --> 00:49:02,720
I heard you like to visit Courtesan House.

611
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,840
I didn't expect to see you here.

612
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:10,280
Your voice is heard all the way at our table.

613
00:49:11,568 --> 00:49:13,568
You seem to be having an interesting conversation.

614
00:49:15,696 --> 00:49:17,640
You're talking about us anyway.

615
00:49:17,816 --> 00:49:18,960
If you don't mind,

616
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:20,864
let us join your table.

617
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,840
The Treasury didn't agree

618
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:33,560
because we're losing income from both import

619
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,400
and export taxes.

620
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,880
How can you expect us to lose profit?

621
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:42,800
But the Treasury's business is not honest.

622
00:49:42,928 --> 00:49:45,800
There are loopholes that have led to troubles.

623
00:49:46,344 --> 00:49:47,560
Such as the case

624
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:50,440
in which you had to arrest that sugar merchant.

625
00:49:53,551 --> 00:49:55,551
You spread the news all over

626
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:57,360
that it's a free trade here.

627
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:00,440
Yet you have an internal notice

628
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:03,680
preventing anyone from doing their own business.

629
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,000
Everything is to be bought and sold at the price set by the Treasury.

630
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,040
That's why the merchant was arrested

631
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,240
for selling a small amount of sugar to Captain Johnson

632
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,840
without reporting it to the Treasury.

633
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:20,520
Moreover, Siamese officials

634
00:50:21,223 --> 00:50:24,160
often trick or force us Europeans

635
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:28,000
to buy their own products.

636
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:31,640
And we found out later

637
00:50:31,951 --> 00:50:33,440
that the price we bought

638
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:37,840
was much more expensive than the market price.

639
00:50:39,864 --> 00:50:42,400
As long as Siamese officials

640
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:45,720
are allowed to interfere with trading

641
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:48,000
and have the privilege

642
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,440
of priority trading,

643
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,640
free trade will never happen.

644
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,460
If you're not busy blindly taking your people's side, maybe

645
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:02,207
you would see

646
00:51:02,328 --> 00:51:04,200
that we're being taken advantage of

647
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:06,200
and getting extorted.

648
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:09,840
Don't just keep following a courtesan's skirt all day!

649
00:51:10,523 --> 00:51:13,440
- Watch your mouth, Captain. - "I told you the truth!"

650
00:51:14,296 --> 00:51:16,880
Calm down, Captain Jam, Chaai.

651
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:19,600
It's not often that we visit a liquor bar.

652
00:51:19,856 --> 00:51:21,856
Can we drink in peace?

653
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Khun, sir.

654
00:51:26,081 --> 00:51:28,600
Do you know about the European trading contract?

655
00:51:29,135 --> 00:51:30,640
I'm losing patience.

656
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,480
Lately, sugar has been getting way cheaper.

657
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:36,600
So that's your issue.

658
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,880
What change could possibly be made?

659
00:51:39,823 --> 00:51:42,960
Everyone has to sell sugar to the government as usual.

660
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,320
If that's a fixed rule,

661
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,240
merchants like me will be in trouble.

662
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:48,648
I pay my tax in full.

663
00:51:48,816 --> 00:51:52,040
Yet, I'm forced to sell things at a price set by the government.

664
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,880
Even if I'm in charge of the Treasury's sugar,

665
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,720
there won't be anything I can do, Magnate.

666
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:00,840
You own a large business.

667
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,880
You can make profits off other products.

668
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:23,400
Good afternoon.

669
00:52:25,438 --> 00:52:27,000
You're home early.

670
00:52:27,303 --> 00:52:28,816
Was it an easy day at work?

671
00:52:29,782 --> 00:52:31,502
I just visited Luang Phitak.

672
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:37,720
How is our daughter doing?

673
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:41,840
She's easy to raise. She doesn't cry much at all.

674
00:52:43,104 --> 00:52:44,720
Do you want to hold her?

675
00:52:45,992 --> 00:52:47,400
No. I'm not good with kids.

676
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,600
She might wake up.

677
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,360
And she would trouble you again.

678
00:52:58,023 --> 00:52:59,800
It's your duty as a mother. I won't.

679
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:01,968
I'm tired of work.

680
00:53:02,502 --> 00:53:03,680
I need to rest.

681
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,200
Do you see that?

682
00:53:17,512 --> 00:53:19,680
I thought that if I had a son,

683
00:53:20,455 --> 00:53:23,160
he would care about us more.

684
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,880
Unfortunately, I have a daughter.

685
00:53:29,663 --> 00:53:31,160
Don't be too sad.

686
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,480
You can still bear another child with him.

687
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,591
How can I bear another child?

688
00:53:37,985 --> 00:53:40,320
He rarely sleeps with me at all.

689
00:53:40,535 --> 00:53:42,960
He has his mistresses. And Boonta's still out there.

690
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,720
I don't know what to do with her anymore.

691
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,520
I know how you feel, Gaysorn,

692
00:53:50,863 --> 00:53:54,360
but think carefully before you do anything.

693
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:58,000
Your child and family come first.

694
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,120
Don't worry, Aunt.

695
00:54:01,647 --> 00:54:03,200
Just take care of yourself

696
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,480
and your family's matter.

697
00:54:05,896 --> 00:54:08,080
As for an outsider like Boonta,

698
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,200
let me take care of her myself.

699
00:54:11,104 --> 00:54:13,680
She will never end up with Chaai

700
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,440
or Magnate Thong.

701
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:05,602
We have stopped serving BBQ,

702
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,040
but we still have a full house, as always.

703
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,282
Fang's brothel got fine booze and great music.

704
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,920
The courtesans are gorgeous and work hard.

705
00:55:14,058 --> 00:55:17,280
Guests love it here and will sure come back.

706
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,320
- You're mistaken. - Oh?

707
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,840
She works in the kitchen.

708
00:55:22,975 --> 00:55:25,280
Yet she's got guests vying over her.

709
00:55:25,424 --> 00:55:26,840
This girl is something.

710
00:55:28,174 --> 00:55:29,440
I see you.

711
00:55:29,608 --> 00:55:33,480
Whenever a new girl cuter than you come in, you always bully them.

712
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:35,561
As you did with Boonta.

713
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,640
That's not it this time, Aunt Mian.

714
00:55:37,783 --> 00:55:40,303
It's true Pudsorn was jealous Boonta was cuter,

715
00:55:40,483 --> 00:55:41,938
but she told me

716
00:55:42,026 --> 00:55:44,560
Boonta's eyes looked empty, like someone ready to die.

717
00:55:44,728 --> 00:55:46,600
If Mother had made her work a guest,

718
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:48,257
she would have killed herself like Cham did.

719
00:55:48,281 --> 00:55:50,480
And she did try to kill herself.

720
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:52,800
That's unlike Noknoi.

721
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,120
Her eyes look eager and fearless.

722
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,080
She looks like she's been with a hundred men.

723
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,360
After all, I'm convinced

724
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,000
this girl is not as innocent as she acts.

725
00:56:05,047 --> 00:56:06,962
She knows how to put on makeup and dance.

726
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,960
She knows sex positions without having a lover.

727
00:56:10,064 --> 00:56:11,960
She knows courtesans drink birth control soup.

728
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:14,241
She knows all those things on the first day of the job.

729
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:16,560
You're right.

730
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,480
That's like an expert on prostitution,

731
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,680
a complete textbook knowledge.

732
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:24,160
Are you saying Noknoi is one of us?

733
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:25,920
I'm confident.

734
00:56:26,152 --> 00:56:27,640
She's an expert.

735
00:56:28,046 --> 00:56:29,600
- She's just 15. - Hey!

736
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,970
Age doesn't have anything to do with this.

737
00:56:32,051 --> 00:56:34,290
There are girls younger than her at other brothels.

738
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:36,416
Maybe she's just observant.

739
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:39,160
Yeah. She's observant.

740
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,640
Because I saw her observe Boonta's every move

741
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:46,192
and copy everything that Boonta does.

742
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,880
Maybe it's because Luang likes you.

743
00:56:55,431 --> 00:56:57,560
That's why she tries to match you

744
00:56:57,672 --> 00:57:00,160
- to get his attention. - Yeah, right.

745
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:03,880
- She's cunning. - Right.

746
00:57:04,479 --> 00:57:06,320
You mean Noknoi, right?

747
00:57:06,512 --> 00:57:08,520
I mean Pudsorn.

748
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,960
You're cunning, and you have too much free time.

749
00:57:11,072 --> 00:57:13,000
You're analyzing her every detail.

750
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,000
Don't just stand here.

751
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,560
Go and do your job.

752
00:57:16,648 --> 00:57:18,200
Otherwise, I'm going to tell Mother.

753
00:57:18,336 --> 00:57:20,960
- Boonta. - Go! Quick!

754
00:57:21,653 --> 00:57:25,440
- You're as fierce as a dog. - I'm too old for this, Ming.

755
00:57:38,311 --> 00:57:39,360
Noknoi?

756
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:41,856
Noknoi.

757
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,240
Luang, sir. Please help me.

758
00:57:46,656 --> 00:57:47,967
Luang.

759
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,200
What happened?

760
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:59,680
You appear to be running from someone.

761
00:58:01,007 --> 00:58:02,240
It's one of the bandits.

762
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,080
It seems he recognizes me.

763
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:06,960
I'm scared.

764
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,480
How could he be here?

765
00:58:10,848 --> 00:58:12,440
Those bandits got arrested.

766
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,520
I'm here to tell you this.

767
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,560
One of them is a wanted criminal, the children's wrist slasher.

768
00:58:22,808 --> 00:58:24,600
They ran away that day.

769
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:26,720
They have just been caught by the police.

770
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,560
They're now in the Police Jail.

771
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:33,720
I must have been mistaken, then.

772
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,400
Please rest easy.

773
00:58:39,352 --> 00:58:41,280
The bandits can't hurt you again.

774
00:58:42,536 --> 00:58:45,320
You can go home and work there.

775
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,360
You don't have to work here.

776
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,960
I don't intend to go home, sir.

777
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:52,240
Here,

778
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,280
I have a chance to see you sometimes.

779
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,760
When I visit Boonta,

780
00:59:01,031 --> 00:59:02,600
you might see me.

781
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:13,000
It's here.

782
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,720
Three guests and this is all they ordered?

783
00:59:16,951 --> 00:59:18,120
Boonta.

784
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:19,440
Have you seen my Luang?

785
00:59:20,271 --> 00:59:21,760
Chaai is here?

786
00:59:23,744 --> 00:59:25,520
- You... - I like you.

787
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,680
I want you to free me from this life.

788
00:59:28,087 --> 00:59:29,447
I won't hope to be your main wife.

789
00:59:29,512 --> 00:59:31,680
All I want is to be loved by you.

790
00:59:32,023 --> 00:59:34,000
I may not be as beautiful as Boonta,

791
00:59:34,096 --> 00:59:36,960
but I'm younger. I do everything better.

792
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:38,991
I'll prove it to you, sir.

793
00:59:48,824 --> 00:59:51,040
Did you speak of someone called "Noknoi?"

794
00:59:51,903 --> 00:59:54,560
So you know this Noknoi girl, sir?

795
00:59:57,959 --> 00:59:59,560
You can have feelings for the Luang,

796
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,560
so why can't I?

797
01:00:01,672 --> 01:00:04,960
I want to grab her by the hair and shake her head!

798
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,800
Come to think of it,

799
01:00:08,143 --> 01:00:10,600
I should let someone else do it for me.

800
01:00:12,551 --> 01:00:14,480
What are you screaming for, you foot face?

801
01:00:14,648 --> 01:00:16,760
Save your lowly manners

802
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,800
for another man.

803
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,200
You fought in a crowded market.

804
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,120
Don't you fear the law at all?
