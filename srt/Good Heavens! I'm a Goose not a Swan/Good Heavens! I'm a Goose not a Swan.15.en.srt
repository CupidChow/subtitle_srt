1
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:26,759
Let me warn you. Don't be too ambitious.

2
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:28,831
You're the one who should warn your son

3
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:31,000
not to stoop down to our level.

4
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,480
Even if you disapprove,

5
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,040
I won't stop loving her.

6
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:36,000
I will marry Boonta no matter what.

7
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:39,760
I know I've made you sad, but I want you to trust me.

8
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,399
If you really like Boonta,

9
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,760
you must buy her freedom.

10
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:47,520
Lately, sugar has been getting way cheaper.

11
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:50,240
You can make profits off other products.

12
00:02:50,328 --> 00:02:52,328
She knows how to put on makeup and dance.

13
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,880
She knows sex positions without having a lover.

14
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:57,680
Are you saying Noknoi is one of us?

15
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,480
Noknoi?

16
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:05,360
- Noknoi. - Luang, sir. Please help me.

17
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
I may not be as beautiful as Boonta,

18
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,640
but I'm younger. I do everything better.

19
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:14,120
I'll prove it to you, sir.

20
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:19,083
(Episode 15: A Sparrow... Who Can't Be Tamed)

21
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:27,520
Pudsorn.

22
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,920
Have you seen Noknoi?

23
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:34,200
You like to keep an eye on her, don't you?

24
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,800
It's not that I like it.

25
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,560
She's acting suspicious, so she stands out.

26
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,400
Why are you asking for her, by the way?

27
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,240
Just now...

28
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
Did you speak of someone called "Noknoi?"

29
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:52,280
So you know this Noknoi girl, sir?

30
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:04,688
What are you doing here alone with Luang?

31
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:09,640
We're not alone. Young Miss Kleeb is here too.

32
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,560
I may not be as beautiful as Boonta,

33
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:12,999
but I'm younger.

34
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:14,800
I do everything better.

35
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:17,120
I'll prove it to you, sir.

36
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:20,543
Chaai and Noknoi, what are you doing?

37
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:21,624
Kleeb?

38
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:26,080
What are you doing here alone?

39
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,960
I'm reading.

40
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,400
What book is that?

41
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:33,256
May I have a look?

42
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,240
Don't think I don't know what you want.

43
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,560
What can you do about it?

44
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:52,440
That's mine!

45
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,560
Did you read inside?

46
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,152
What happened?

47
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:06,520
Why are Luang, Kleeb, and you girls in here?

48
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:08,480
Nothing happened.

49
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:11,216
I'm just here to inform Noknoi about the children's wrist slasher.

50
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:13,920
In here, sir?

51
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
Noknoi ran from her regular guest, Mother.

52
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,240
You have a regular guest?

53
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:37,680
I don't mind you lying about having been a courtesan!

54
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,519
But you tried to do indecent things in my place!

55
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,760
I won't allow that!

56
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
I was wrong, Mother.

57
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:48,134
Please forgive me.

58
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
I pitied you.

59
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,174
I gave you a place to live and work.

60
00:05:52,303 --> 00:05:54,200
Yet you almost got me in trouble.

61
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,880
What should I do with you?

62
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:00,640
Please don't kick me out, Mother.

63
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,120
I have nowhere to go.

64
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,280
You said your father sold you to a courtesan house when you were young.

65
00:06:08,497 --> 00:06:10,880
And your freedom was already bought.

66
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,120
Is that how you met the Luang?

67
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,680
Yes, Mother.

68
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:18,840
I followed Luang here, telling him I'd serve as a witness

69
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:21,720
because I wanted his protection.

70
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,880
But he brought me here.

71
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:28,440
Your case is over, isn't it?

72
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,320
You don't need to stay here any longer.

73
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:36,400
If you want to stay,

74
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,792
the only work you can do

75
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,680
is the very thing you used to do!

76
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,520
Chaai, you haven't told me

77
00:06:57,631 --> 00:07:00,000
whether you have read my diary or not.

78
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,160
"Fate can't keep us apart."

79
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,840
"Even incarnations can't separate us,"

80
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:15,000
"when destiny brings us together."

81
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,360
"No one will ever change my feelings,"

82
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:22,160
"like I was made to love you."

83
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,520
"I wait to meet you and be with you forever."

84
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,400
You didn't just read it.

85
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,880
You memorized it. That's why you nailed it.

86
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't understand how you wrote it.

87
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:38,920
I don't get the rhymes or anything.

88
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,160
But your poem is good.

89
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,320
I'm sorry I forgot my manners.

90
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,160
I shouldn't have violated your privacy.

91
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,310
It's fine, sir.

92
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,200
It's me who didn't keep it well.

93
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:55,960
Next time Mother is away, Young Miss Kleeb

94
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,800
is getting spanked!

95
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,920
That poem

96
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:03,960
was written for me, wasn't it?

97
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,320
I wrote it for a cat.

98
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:09,480
Just kidding, sir.

99
00:08:10,151 --> 00:08:12,400
I didn't write this poem myself.

100
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,930
I was missing you,

101
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,600
and this verse just popped up in my head.

102
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:29,800
For you.

103
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,040
I missed you too.

104
00:08:36,862 --> 00:08:38,455
Thank you, sir.

105
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,440
You made my thing look lackluster.

106
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,800
You made this for me.

107
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:48,776
I don't know what to write about you yet.

108
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,440
Next time you write something for me,

109
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,840
you can show it to me.

110
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,480
If that's the case,

111
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:01,960
I can say it right to your face.

112
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:08,360
Thank you anyway.

113
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,400
I like it a lot.

114
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,760
I like you a lot too.

115
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,320
Thank you for missing me.

116
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,495
Oh, you...

117
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,640
Quack, quack.

118
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
What does the goose say?

119
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:47,328
Look up!

120
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:49,920
Answer me.

121
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,360
Were you really operating alone?

122
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:55,360
Yes, sir.

123
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,840
I was chasing you in Pak Nam.

124
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:00,720
Who was the one that saved you?

125
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I don't know him, sir.

126
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,720
The case is over.

127
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:14,088
He had to be punished by law.

128
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:17,000
His punishment was a death sentence.

129
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:19,600
In the end, he didn't say who was with him.

130
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:23,480
He was obviously acting suspiciously.

131
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,000
I wonder what these criminals were hiding.

132
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,480
I found out something, sir.

133
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,800
The killer used to be in an acrobatic troupe.

134
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:14,512
If that's the case,

135
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,240
the bandit who saved him must know him.

136
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,120
That man was quick

137
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,520
and agile.

138
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:23,840
He had great balance himself.

139
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:26,200
He must be in an acrobatic troupe.

140
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:30,560
Then, let's investigate acrobatic troupes.

141
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:33,880
Perhaps the children's wrist slasher

142
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,880
could be linked to other cases too.

143
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:48,680
I made Kleeb Lamduan for you.

144
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:51,565
Eat this with some hot tea.

145
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,920
Do you feel uncomfortable accepting a dessert from me?

146
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,240
I made myself clear with you, didn't I?

147
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:12,720
You did.

148
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:16,040
I'm not giving you this as your fiancée.

149
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm giving you this as a little sister.

150
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:21,040
So,

151
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,800
you won't refuse, right?

152
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,753
Thank you.

153
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,760
Boonta, I heard the girls say last night

154
00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:07,160
Luang came to see you without a disguise.

155
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,000
You're truly attractive.

156
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,760
Even a thin-skinned Luang

157
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:14,877
is obsessed with you!

158
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,014
Well, I'm gorgeous.

159
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,560
What should I say? I used to be a rising star actress.

160
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:24,703
And I'm also

161
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,960
the prettiest courtesan at Fang's, right?

162
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,273
Yeah, you're the prettiest courtesan.

163
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,920
Yeah. That made me think of Noknoi.

164
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:34,360
If I were her,

165
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I would hate you too.

166
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:40,080
Look at her. She was seducing your Luang.

167
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:42,680
And he wasn't interested at all!

168
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,640
His only love is you.

169
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:48,214
I can't be sure about that, but I got a ring!

170
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm waiting for his mother's blessing.

171
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,000
Boonta!

172
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:56,320
You won't just be his nightly wife at the Courtesan House now.

173
00:13:59,143 --> 00:14:00,600
Watch out!

174
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:06,415
That's mine. Give it back!

175
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:10,120
Come!

176
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,560
I'm sorry, sir.

177
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,720
I'm sorry.

178
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,680
This is a gift for someone. I'm afraid it will be damaged.

179
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,520
That was why I was aggressive.

180
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,320
Hold it carefully.

181
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:38,920
Boonta, are you alright?

182
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:41,560
I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

183
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:43,800
I'm glad.

184
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:46,120
I can't stay and talk today.

185
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,800
I have somewhere to go.

186
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:51,880
Let's go, Come.

187
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:58,640
What's got into him?

188
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:02,720
We were helping, but he yelled at us!

189
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,840
That's sus.

190
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:17,280
This is a gift, sir.

191
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,400
My staff is loading up sugar here,

192
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,680
so I came by.

193
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,840
This time,

194
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,680
I'm counting on you again.

195
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm afraid I can't help you this time.

196
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:37,840
If it were another Captain,

197
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,160
I wouldn't be afraid to do this.

198
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:43,040
But with Jam...

199
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:45,200
It's fine.

200
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,640
Just do it.

201
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:48,720
If there's a problem,

202
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:50,911
I won't hold you accountable.

203
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,240
Between him and me,

204
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,040
we have a binding contract.

205
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,400
If that's the case,

206
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,360
I'll have my staff weigh the sugar you brought here

207
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,440
and issue the document accordingly.

208
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,960
Thank you so much.

209
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:12,840
I need to go and oversee my staff

210
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:15,120
loading up sugar on his ship, sir.

211
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,600
Come on. Quick.

212
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:34,800
Hey, you two!

213
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,560
Hurry up!

214
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:42,960
You have sold sugar mixed with dirt to European captains

215
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,480
without problems three times in a row.

216
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:49,280
But this time, I'm afraid you won't get away, sir.

217
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,560
Don't be a coward.

218
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,720
If we don't do this, there's no profit.

219
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,400
If you're afraid of this,

220
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,000
what big deal can you possibly do?

221
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,000
I could use someone like Tis, your big brother.

222
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,920
I like his fighting skills.

223
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:05,600
It's a shame he wanted to serve the government.

224
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:07,400
Stop right now!

225
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,840
All of you, stop!

226
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,520
What's wrong, Captain?

227
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,960
What the heck is this?

228
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:17,200
This is the sugar you ordered.

229
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,080
I brought it here as agreed.

230
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:21,480
Sugar with dirt?

231
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:27,520
Clerm Im has verified my goods.

232
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,840
If you don't buy, that's a breach of contract.

233
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:34,840
Guys.

234
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:36,360
Why did you stop?

235
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:38,521
Keep loading it up. It's getting dark!

236
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:39,840
Stop right now!

237
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:41,240
Don't move it!

238
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:46,440
Don't think I would pay for these sacks of dirty sugar!

239
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,760
If you don't take them back, I'll sue you!

240
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:51,640
I'm ready to go to court any time!

241
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,560
I'm fine with

242
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:56,240
an added charge of punching a scammer.

243
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,239
Magnate!

244
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:01,760
Jam!

245
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,200
Magnate!

246
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,880
Stop them! Magnate!

247
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,640
What's wrong, Puek?

248
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:13,120
Nothing.

249
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,600
Why would anything be wrong?

250
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
I don't know. You've been quiet

251
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:19,544
since we left Dokgaew earlier.

252
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:24,560
Just take one. Don't just lift them up and down.

253
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:27,160
I'm not buying one. I just want to see how heavy one is.

254
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:30,400
- Magnate Thong's jar was oddly heavy. - What are you doing?

255
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,400
Chaai.

256
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:36,560
- I have something to ask you. - Luang, sir!

257
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,280
Luang, sir.

258
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,000
There's an incident at the port.

259
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,400
What's going on?

260
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,360
Captain Jam and Magnate Thong

261
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,800
are in a fight over a sugar deal, sir.

262
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:54,008
Aunt.

263
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,760
Go home without me.

264
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:57,824
- Make up some excuse. I'll be back. - Right.

265
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:02,240
Boonta!

266
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,880
I'm getting in trouble for you again.

267
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,400
Lately,

268
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,789
I've heard Magnate Thong selling low-quality sugar to ships from the West.

269
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,920
That's not true.

270
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:15,720
Captain Jam

271
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,640
accused me and assaulted me.

272
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,960
I've sold sugar to other captains without issues.

273
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:24,480
You're the only one who finds problems, Captain Jam.

274
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:30,560
Other captains don't want to go to court when Siam has problems!

275
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,240
But I can't allow it.

276
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,560
I hope you give me justice.

277
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:39,280
Don't take your people's side like you always have.

278
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,520
- Yod. - Yes, sir.

279
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,600
Get some of Magnate Thong's sugar.

280
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:52,120
I'll inspect it to see if it is of low quality, as Captain Jam claims.

281
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:53,480
Yes, sir.

282
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:58,480
Luang, is that not a breach of my work?

283
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:01,080
If you do that,

284
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:04,240
that means you accuse a Treasury official of negligence.

285
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,080
I have my verification.

286
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,839
Why do you have to inspect it?

287
00:20:10,056 --> 00:20:12,800
If you have your verification, why are you worried?

288
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:16,600
We'll see if you've committed a crime or not.

289
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,960
Here, sir.

290
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:46,880
It's the sugar factory.

291
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,287
They sent me low-quality sugar.

292
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:52,720
My staff just failed to inspect it.

293
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,440
That's why we're having this problem.

294
00:20:55,977 --> 00:20:57,977
I'm sorry, Captain Jam.

295
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll have a new batch for you.

296
00:21:01,256 --> 00:21:02,880
Okay? Please be patient.

297
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,520
That's not enough.

298
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,880
I want an investigation into this case

299
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,160
so that no one exploits my people again!

300
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,600
Hey, what are you doing?

301
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,600
Give me back my jar!

302
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,920
Give it back! Give me my jar back!

303
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,349
Give it back right now!

304
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,880
- Let me see. - You can't! Give it back!

305
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:45,040
Give it back! Hey!

306
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,200
What are those bags, sir?

307
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,160
I knew it.

308
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,000
You deliberately sold low-quality sugar.

309
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,520
You also bribed a government official.

310
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:48,640
This is a serious crime, Magnate.

311
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,240
The official who took this bribe

312
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,000
committed a serious crime too.

313
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,560
I'll seek maximum punishment.

314
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,200
Here, sir.

315
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,600
Captain Jam and Luang, please enjoy your drinks.

316
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,320
This meal is on me.

317
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:19,320
- Please enjoy. - I take no bribe.

318
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,240
Oh, Luang.

319
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:23,321
You always see me in a bad light.

320
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:26,320
This is just an apology to Captain Jam and you

321
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:29,240
for causing you trouble. That's all.

322
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:31,560
We're doing our job.

323
00:23:31,672 --> 00:23:33,440
We're here to be witnesses.

324
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:35,536
If you two can come to an agreement,

325
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,640
and if Captain Jam decides not to press charge,

326
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:40,760
our job will be done.

327
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,840
Magnate Thong promised to pay for damages

328
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:46,680
and give us more sugar, free of charge.

329
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,520
That's all I want.

330
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,240
Let's just say

331
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,000
I never saw that half sugar

332
00:23:52,136 --> 00:23:53,920
and half dirt at all.

333
00:23:56,264 --> 00:23:58,920
Now that you have money, a new batch,

334
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:02,520
and a goodwill meal at your favorite place,

335
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,400
you could just change your mind

336
00:24:04,536 --> 00:24:07,280
and pretend you have seen nothing.

337
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,840
I'm just doing what the Siamese do.

338
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:15,520
Let's choose compromise over court, which is a waste of time

339
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,400
and a waste of money for legal fees.

340
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,279
However,

341
00:24:24,825 --> 00:24:27,320
we need a written contract

342
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:30,840
so that we don't have to mediate your matter again.

343
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
Thank you for your suggestion.

344
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:37,640
Let me pour you a cup, Luang.

345
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:41,000
This doesn't count as a bribe, does it?

346
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:06,080
The auction for Noknoi starts at

347
00:26:06,256 --> 00:26:07,960
one baht, sirs.

348
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,800
- Two baht. - We have two baht.

349
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:15,200
She made it out of a courtesan house. Yet she got into one again.

350
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,880
She's willing. Nothing forced her.

351
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:20,480
I can tell from her eyes. Don't feel sorry for her. She chose this.

352
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,240
- Three baht. - We have three baht.

353
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,279
I'll feel sorry for her if Captain Jam wins the auction.

354
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,920
I fear for her if it's him.

355
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:29,560
One tamleung.

356
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,400
We have one tamleung.

357
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:34,080
- Two tamleung. - We have two tamleung.

358
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,720
Three tamleung!

359
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:37,320
Three tamleung?

360
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:42,320
Do we have more from anyone?

361
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:45,320
If that's so,

362
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,640
tonight, Noknoi belongs to Magnate Thong.

363
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:04,560
I'm offering this girl as a courtesy

364
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,960
to Captain Jam.

365
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,240
Please.

366
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:11,560
Thank you.

367
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,120
I still haven't picked a girl for tonight.

368
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:18,640
Don't be violent with her

369
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:20,360
and cause trouble again.

370
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,000
Otherwise, you will never be able to step foot in here again.

371
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:28,960
Seeing as you care so much about her,

372
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,280
I'll give her to you then.

373
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,800
I don't take bribes.

374
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,560
Please take her back, Captain.

375
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,200
As you wish.

376
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,680
Then please excuse us.

377
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:54,560
I hope you don't break your promise to Mother Fang.

378
00:27:56,335 --> 00:27:57,840
If you do,

379
00:27:57,944 --> 00:28:01,640
I'll make you run right back to Singapore.

380
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:05,160
You and your threat! Both the husband and wife talk big!

381
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:08,160
Don't worry, Luang.

382
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,040
I'll cherish this one

383
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,280
like you cherish

384
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:14,703
the woman you have your eyes on.

385
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
Thank you for all the gifts.

386
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,800
I hope there's no trouble next time.

387
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,200
Please don't get the idea

388
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,200
that you can do anything you want in your trade.

389
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Politics are always moving.

390
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:30,800
Who knows?

391
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:32,120
Great Britain

392
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:34,800
could strike a deal with Siam soon.

393
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:48,120
We're done here. Excuse me.

394
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,200
I have to go too.

395
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:13,120
- Who did that? - Oh, Magnate?

396
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:14,320
I'm sorry, sir.

397
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:15,840
Are you alright?

398
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:20,592
Magnate Thong.

399
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,120
I exposed your bribe today

400
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:26,120
as revenge for what you did to me.

401
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:29,200
I might not be able to hurt you so badly now,

402
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:30,856
but in the future, who knows?

403
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:33,160
If I get back to where I came from,

404
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,160
I'll find out about your family tree and where you work.

405
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:39,840
I'm going on Hone-Krasae.

406
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,960
Your family will be embarrassed.

407
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,240
Your descendant will have no place in the society.

408
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:48,760
Magnate!

409
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:50,295
Are you alright?

410
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,760
Are you hurt?

411
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:56,960
What are you talking about?

412
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,520
That may be further than you can imagine. Let's talk about something close.

413
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,840
I heard your wife just gave birth to a daughter, right?

414
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,760
Please be careful.

415
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,680
Your karma for what you did to others is going to catch up on her.

416
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:12,807
You...

417
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:25,928
Magnate!

418
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,479
Magnate!

419
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,480
The soup is hot.

420
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,760
I told you this girl

421
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,880
isn't as innocent as she looks.

422
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,960
She's an expert indeed.

423
00:30:45,352 --> 00:30:47,152
She made it through a night with Captain Jam.

424
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,320
I'm glad Boonta is good enough.

425
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:53,800
Luang didn't slip through her fingers and get with Noknoi, right?

426
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,440
Don't speak too soon.

427
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:57,560
I don't think she'll give up so easily.

428
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:01,983
Be careful. It's hot.

429
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:16,600
I want to see the Luang.

430
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:19,080
Can you lead me to him?

431
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,320
What do you want with Chaai?

432
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:28,640
I want to thank him

433
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,920
for warning Captain Jam.

434
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,560
So last night,

435
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,840
I didn't get hurt.

436
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,480
I can tell him for you if that's it.

437
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:42,720
I'll tell him right to his ears.

438
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,840
But...

439
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,560
I want to tell him myself.

440
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:57,960
You don't mind, right, Boonta?

441
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't make appointments with him.

442
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,520
If you want to see him, just pray he comes to patrol the market.

443
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,944
It looks like my prayers

444
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:31,400
have been answered.

445
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:38,760
Why did you agree to bring her here?

446
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,840
I don't own the market.

447
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:44,400
I can't possibly stop someone from coming.

448
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:46,120
But Luang is yours.

449
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,840
- You're right about that. - Yeah.

450
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,880
But I can't stop Chaai from seeing her, he needs to deal with her himself.

451
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:11,360
Are you so certain that you can rest so easily?

452
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,920
Honestly?

453
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,600
I want to grab her by the hair and shake her head!

454
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:22,120
Come to think of it,

455
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:24,880
I should let someone else do it for me.

456
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,800
This is bad!

457
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,680
My prayers have been answered too.

458
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,960
I'll just stand here and eat some "popcorn" while watching.

459
00:33:59,135 --> 00:34:01,464
What are you screaming for, you foot face?

460
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,880
I saved you from falling.

461
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:08,760
My master is too familiar with this method of seduction.

462
00:34:14,415 --> 00:34:15,640
You slave!

463
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:18,047
You don't know your place.

464
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:20,360
Save your lowly manners

465
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:22,560
for another man.

466
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:25,000
A manual laborer would suit you.

467
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,960
You'd look good together.

468
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,160
Young Miss?

469
00:34:33,258 --> 00:34:35,600
A high-ranking official's daughter like you

470
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:38,223
is no different from a courtesan like me.

471
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,640
You're desperate for a man too.

472
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,840
You underage whore!

473
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,360
- I'm going to teach you a lesson! - Just bring it!

474
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:49,800
You classless slave!

475
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:56,680
Let go, you wench!

476
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:59,146
You let go, you piece of trash!

477
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:00,696
How much longer are you going to call her names?

478
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
Dang, just slap her already!

479
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:07,600
- If you're not fighting, just go. - Don't interfere!

480
00:35:07,735 --> 00:35:09,240
Don't even pretend to be nice!

481
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:10,920
If you won't help, move.

482
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:15,400
Let the police settle it, then. They're right behind you.

483
00:35:20,063 --> 00:35:21,600
This market is not a Muay Thai ring.

484
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,680
If you don't stop, I'll put you both in jail.

485
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,680
"An insult such as a low-class slave,"

486
00:35:37,872 --> 00:35:39,120
"classless slave,"

487
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,880
"ugly mute,"

488
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,760
"or the likes of unfaithful liar, adulterer, or promiscuous one,"

489
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,911
"or accusing someone of stealing your husband,"

490
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:50,640
as well as calling someone a wench, or a whore"

491
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,720
"is punishable by a fine according to ranks."

492
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,935
"If an insult mentions one's family or ancestors,"

493
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,560
"the fine can be multiplied."

494
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:00,440
Is this what you want?

495
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:06,560
Do we have a defamation fine?

496
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:09,680
How much is the fine, sir?

497
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:11,480
For an altercation and insult,

498
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,520
if the offender owns 400 units of land or lower,

499
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,400
the victim's rank will determine the fine.

500
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,703
If the offender owns 400 units or more,

501
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,600
the offender's rank will determine

502
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,440
the fine paid to the victim.

503
00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:26,064
If it's a fight between both parties,

504
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:28,344
each party must pay the fine by their rank.

505
00:36:28,607 --> 00:36:32,320
The difference is calculated as half damages and half fine.

506
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:35,600
Where does the fine go, sir?

507
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:37,240
It's paid to the government

508
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,000
as a fine for causing unrest, ma'am.

509
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,400
If you insult someone, think of the price you have to pay.

510
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:50,920
As for you,

511
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:55,520
it's not good if your mouth costs you money, girl!

512
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,800
So what do you say?

513
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,400
We'll stop, sir.

514
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:16,720
Then promise me

515
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:19,920
never to fight and insult at a market again.

516
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,160
Okay, sir.

517
00:37:23,735 --> 00:37:25,480
I won't cause trouble again.

518
00:37:27,543 --> 00:37:29,480
I won't do it again either

519
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,451
if I don't have to.

520
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:35,960
Are you sure?

521
00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:49,600
Young Miss.

522
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,959
Hey, where are you going, ma'am?

523
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,160
Why would she stay? Her fiancé doesn't take her side.

524
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:57,960
If she stays, everyone who sees her would think it's funny.

525
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:02,760
If we're done, please excuse us, sir.

526
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:05,984
Let's go.

527
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:09,720
Come on!

528
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:17,080
- Don't stall. Walk faster. - Let me go.

529
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,560
- I can walk on my own. - Whoa!

530
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,600
If I let you go, you'd pretend to collapse again and embarrass us.

531
00:38:22,696 --> 00:38:26,960
It's fine to fall on the ground, but someone's wife might stomp you.

532
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,920
Hey!

533
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,600
Hey! Take it easy, girl. Don't push your luck.

534
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:36,200
You can be confident, but don't be overconfident.

535
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:39,720
If you seduce someone, make sure they don't have a wife.

536
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:43,680
If you get hurt badly, don't say I didn't warn you, Little Nok.

537
00:38:44,663 --> 00:38:46,400
You should warn yourself too.

538
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:48,320
I may not have been here long,

539
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:52,040
but I know what's going on between you and him.

540
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:56,000
You know they're in love and still try to steal him?

541
00:38:56,143 --> 00:38:57,423
You're too thick-skinned.

542
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:00,200
Boonta shouldn't have helped you get a job.

543
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,760
If I'm thick-skinned,

544
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,040
you both are as thick-skinned as I am.

545
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
We're all courtesans.

546
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:09,280
You can have feelings for the Luang,

547
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,680
so why can't I?

548
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,360
He doesn't officially have a wife yet, does he?

549
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:16,880
I may not have one yet.

550
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,600
But I will have one soon.

551
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,080
I love Boonta.

552
00:39:38,535 --> 00:39:40,200
If I have a wife,

553
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,720
my wife can only be Boonta.

554
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,080
I saved you

555
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:56,400
because you were in trouble.

556
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,280
You had no one. You needed someone to depend on.

557
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,480
You can depend on me,

558
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:03,880
but don't get the wrong idea

559
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,760
and see my kindness as something else.

560
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:08,360
I already have someone I love.

561
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:11,480
I will never have eyes on anyone else.

562
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,280
In other words, no matter what,

563
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:17,560
he will never love you.

564
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,840
He has a soon-to-be wife.

565
00:40:20,478 --> 00:40:22,080
You can cope with that.

566
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:53,480
Oh my goodness!

567
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:13,080
Stop!

568
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,720
You fought in a crowded market.

569
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:18,624
Don't you fear the law at all?

570
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,000
It's these thugs!

571
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,640
They were causing trouble.

572
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:29,080
They were bullying a helpless man.

573
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:35,120
What happened?

574
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,680
They thought my brother was ugly

575
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,520
and assaulted him.

576
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:43,880
They assaulted him? Isn't that too far?

577
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:47,400
Chaai, can you arrest them for something?

578
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,360
There's no need for that. I'm fine.

579
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:55,480
How are you fine? You're bleeding so much!

580
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,000
No matter what you look like, you don't deserve to be bullied.

581
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:01,151
If you get bullied, stand up for yourself.

582
00:42:01,272 --> 00:42:04,040
If you can't fight them, get some help.

583
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,000
I don't want anyone's help.

584
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:08,240
Chuen, let's go.

585
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,320
Just go. We have work to do.

586
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:14,399
What's wrong with him? He doesn't want help? That's odd.

587
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,320
The odd one is her.

588
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:22,880
He is handsome and brave.

589
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:25,600
Such a man is not easy to find.

590
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:28,600
These two are brothers.

591
00:42:28,814 --> 00:42:30,640
Dam, the big brother, is ugly.

592
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,200
Chuen, the little brother, is handsome.

593
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:35,760
He's as capable as expected of Muen Haw's son.

594
00:42:36,526 --> 00:42:38,040
Who is Muen Haw?

595
00:42:39,368 --> 00:42:42,080
The Vietnamese acrobat at Tha Tien.

596
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:46,720
Chuen!

597
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:47,961
What are you doing with this?

598
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:50,760
You need to fix my roof now.

599
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:59,320
If I can't open my brothel tonight,

600
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:01,800
your father is going to pay me for the loss.

601
00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:10,440
Mister...

602
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,400
Are you alright?

603
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,400
You sure collapse easily.

604
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,640
How did you even get him to carry you back here?

605
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,240
She didn't collapse for real, Aunt.

606
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,920
She just gets weak legs when she sees men.

607
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:52,640
You're despe...

608
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:53,960
Pudsorn!

609
00:43:54,288 --> 00:43:55,880
Are you trying to pick a fight?

610
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:57,600
Who's picking a fight?

611
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,320
I was telling the truth.

612
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,720
I know about the Luang

613
00:44:01,888 --> 00:44:04,360
and that young man you were eyeing.

614
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,159
You pulled those tricks,

615
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,080
and yet they got away.

616
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,200
Perhaps your attractiveness

617
00:44:13,432 --> 00:44:14,960
is fading.

618
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:22,080
Look, Lamjeak told us because she wanted us to warn you.

619
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,400
If you want to stay here, take it easy.

620
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,320
It's true we're courtesans, but we have our pride.

621
00:44:28,528 --> 00:44:32,240
Don't be too shameless. Think about Mother.

622
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,160
One thing's for sure.

623
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,720
You could use more "calcium."

624
00:44:38,088 --> 00:44:39,960
So your legs won't get weak again.

625
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,720
I'm not lecturing you or anything, Little Nok.

626
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:48,974
This is not an era for a weak-legged damsel in distress.

627
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,680
If you want to win over a man,

628
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:54,600
you need strong legs.

629
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:01,520
You can talk big for now.

630
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,760
Luang isn't interested in me,

631
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:06,960
but there are more handsome men in the capital.

632
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,360
You should worry about yourself.

633
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,520
Do you really think he's going to buy your freedom?

634
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:14,400
You saw it.

635
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:16,880
You saw just how his mother despised you.

636
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:19,040
Forget the ten chang.

637
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,080
She won't even allow one feung to be paid for you.

638
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,720
I'm going to slap the taste right out of your mouth!

639
00:45:24,817 --> 00:45:27,240
- Just bring it! Come on! - Pudsorn! Calm down!

640
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,080
Hey! Just stop!

641
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,240
They're going to say you bully a kid.

642
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,080
Forget it.

643
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:42,160
What Noknoi said is right.

644
00:45:42,264 --> 00:45:43,400
What?

645
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:47,160
Are you giving up?

646
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,880
He put a ring on me.

647
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,080
I'd be crazy if I gave up.

648
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,040
If she can hate me, she can stop hating me too.

649
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:58,800
We'll see if

650
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,040
Boonta can win over Chaai's mother or not.

651
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,480
Yeah! That's more like it!

652
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:08,880
We don't have to worry now.

653
00:46:15,447 --> 00:46:17,200
You're buying Boonta's freedom?

654
00:46:18,223 --> 00:46:21,120
Luang doesn't want to waste any more time to spend with Boonta.

655
00:46:21,494 --> 00:46:22,920
And he doesn't want to be bothered

656
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,960
to stop a fight in a market again.

657
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:30,680
I can tell from the look on your face.

658
00:46:30,912 --> 00:46:33,000
You really have been through a lot.

659
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,200
If Mother

660
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:37,600
still keeps her prejudice against Boonta,

661
00:46:38,016 --> 00:46:39,520
a fight, out of home or at home,

662
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,440
would be equally troublesome.

663
00:46:43,327 --> 00:46:44,960
I don't object.

664
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,640
It's true that ten chang

665
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,920
is not much compared to your worth.

666
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,440
But it's a lot of money

667
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,583
for the freedom of a courtesan.

668
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,600
I have thought this through.

669
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:02,760
Even if it costs more money to buy her freedom,

670
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,840
I'm still willing to pay.

671
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,880
But I'm not willing to pay!

672
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,360
Chaai, have you lost your mind?

673
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:14,040
How are you willing to pay that much?

674
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:16,000
No matter what,

675
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,800
I won't allow you to spend ten chang

676
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,760
to buy a Sampheng woman to become your wife!

677
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:25,832
But I've made up my mind.

678
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,760
Kerd, I'm going to faint.

679
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,400
Mother.

680
00:47:35,503 --> 00:47:37,159
- Mother. - I'm going to faint!

681
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,880
- I can't breathe. - Mother.

682
00:47:38,961 --> 00:47:40,480
Hang on, Mother.

683
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:43,839
Chang...

684
00:47:43,936 --> 00:47:46,280
Chang, look at Chaai.

685
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:50,320
How dare he break my heart like that?

686
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,480
No matter what you say,

687
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,560
I won't change my mind, Mother.

688
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,960
Fine! Do what you want!

689
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,680
If you want me to die of heartbreak,

690
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,840
do it!

691
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:07,921
Take your father's inheritance

692
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:09,639
and buy her freedom right now!

693
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,440
Just go! Go!

694
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,040
Mother, aren't you going to faint?

695
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,600
Chang, I'm going to faint. I can't breathe.

696
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:23,800
- Okay. - I can't breathe!

697
00:48:24,355 --> 00:48:25,360
Kerd!

698
00:48:25,448 --> 00:48:27,429
- Kerd! - Yes, ma'am.

699
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,880
Take me upstairs. I can't take it anymore.

700
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:31,960
Let's go, master.

701
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,600
Come on, master.

702
00:48:33,735 --> 00:48:35,080
Let's go.

703
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:42,200
Mother.

704
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,400
You're walking faster than when you came.

705
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,120
I'm so troubled I don't know what to do.

706
00:48:56,286 --> 00:48:57,520
That's why I came here.

707
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,480
Pikul and Dokgaew,

708
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,080
what would be your solution for this?

709
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,960
The only thing you can do is probably cope.

710
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,440
Pikul, how could you say that?

711
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:11,320
What would you have me do then?

712
00:49:11,576 --> 00:49:13,767
We tried matching him with Dokgaew.

713
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:15,879
We tried insulting Boonta right to her face.

714
00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:17,612
Chaai won't leave her alone.

715
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:21,000
Yet he's so attracted to her he's going to buy her freedom.

716
00:49:22,728 --> 00:49:25,280
Perhaps Chaai and I

717
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:28,080
are destined to be friends in this life.

718
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,520
Don't say that!

719
00:49:29,601 --> 00:49:33,209
You will become my daughter-in-law no matter what!

720
00:49:33,342 --> 00:49:35,080
There must be a way!

721
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,120
How can we possibly make a stubborn Luang give in?

722
00:49:42,536 --> 00:49:44,920
We have tried everything.

723
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,080
The only thing left to do would involve life and death.

724
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,720
Death?

725
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,960
I got it!

726
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,840
But for this, you're taking on a big role, Aunt.

727
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:24,480
She was fine this morning.

728
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,160
Why did she suddenly

729
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:28,480
fall bedridden?

730
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,280
Aunt

731
00:50:35,528 --> 00:50:38,840
is heartbroken about Chaai and Boonta.

732
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:43,360
Have you called a doctor?

733
00:50:45,287 --> 00:50:48,040
No doctor can cure me.

734
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,800
I'm going to die of heartbreak,

735
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:52,880
surely.

736
00:50:55,816 --> 00:50:57,080
Mother.

737
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:01,240
Please don't do this.

738
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,720
Don't care about me.

739
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:08,080
Just let me die.

740
00:51:09,056 --> 00:51:12,240
I care about you, but please don't use it to leverage against me.

741
00:51:14,016 --> 00:51:15,320
I told you.

742
00:51:15,808 --> 00:51:18,320
Dokgaew is just a little sister to me.

743
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:21,551
We both understand

744
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,320
that it will never happen.

745
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:26,880
Please don't force me and Dokgaew into a conflict

746
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:28,760
where we can't even see each other.

747
00:51:30,863 --> 00:51:32,863
Chaai has made up his mind.

748
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,680
Please don't force him anymore, Mother.

749
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,560
Chaai, Chim.

750
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:41,600
You should think about Mother too.

751
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,480
If you lie on your side for too long,

752
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:51,879
you're going to get cramps.

753
00:51:53,385 --> 00:51:54,440
Chang!

754
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,760
Do you think this is a joke?

755
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,720
Chim and Chang,

756
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:00,400
you're taking Chaai's side

757
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:03,400
and letting him marry a Sampheng woman

758
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,762
and shatter my heart into pieces, right?

759
00:52:07,903 --> 00:52:09,100
Aunt...

760
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:17,280
Does my opinion not matter?

761
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,240
Is that why you would embarrass me?

762
00:52:20,496 --> 00:52:22,120
That was never my intention.

763
00:52:22,847 --> 00:52:25,160
I love and respect you, always.

764
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:27,440
But you still want such a woman

765
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,960
when you know I despise her.

766
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,480
Boonta is actually not a woman of unknown origin.

767
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:38,360
She is Bua's daughter.

768
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:41,480
Chaai used to visit her often.

769
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:43,560
When Boonta's mother was arrested,

770
00:52:43,695 --> 00:52:45,695
they stopped seeing each other.

771
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,680
She is Bua's daughter?

772
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,640
Well, she lost her wealth and class.

773
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:55,680
She is a courtesan now.

774
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,480
Chaai, how can you marry such an obnoxious woman?

775
00:53:01,872 --> 00:53:03,280
That's only a change in class

776
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,040
and a change in occupation.

777
00:53:05,377 --> 00:53:07,280
Does that make one worthless?

778
00:53:08,536 --> 00:53:10,240
What if one day I become a slave?

779
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:12,983
Would you stop loving me then?

780
00:53:13,071 --> 00:53:14,520
It's not the same!

781
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,760
Chaai, are you comparing your mother's love to that woman?

782
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,880
Fine.

783
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,480
She literally makes me sick.

784
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,920
Yet you chose her over me.

785
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:28,600
I give in.

786
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,760
Aunt!

787
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,320
I'll allow her to be your wife.

788
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,160
But you have to marry Dokgaew first.

789
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,160
She will be your main wife.

790
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:45,640
Boonta can only be your slave wife.

791
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:47,880
Mother!

792
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:50,600
If you do that, you're forcing him

793
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,800
when he does not consent.

794
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,120
If you get married without love,

795
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:56,360
even if you remain together,

796
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,200
how can you be happy?

797
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,920
It's your choice, Chaai. I'm meeting you halfway.

798
00:54:02,232 --> 00:54:03,840
Or you can be an ungrateful son

799
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:05,960
who chooses a woman over his mother

800
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,960
and breaks his mother's heart. The choice is yours.

801
00:54:25,815 --> 00:54:27,320
I understand

802
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,480
that you love Boonta.

803
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,240
I only agreed to get married

804
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,360
so that you can stay a grateful son to your mother.

805
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,840
Even if we're not in love,

806
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:38,944
you still adore me.

807
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,400
I believe we can live together.

808
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,880
I will be kind to Boonta.

809
00:54:44,495 --> 00:54:48,040
I'll never cause you any trouble.

810
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:53,880
Puek.

811
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,880
Today is our day off, so I came to invite you for a drink.

812
00:54:58,423 --> 00:54:59,600
But

813
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,720
I don't think you can come.

814
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,720
Chang and I will take care of things here.

815
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:09,240
Chaai and Puek, you can enjoy your day off.

816
00:55:13,495 --> 00:55:14,720
Let's go.

817
00:55:15,047 --> 00:55:16,600
I could use a drink right now.

818
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,440
Mrs. Tubtim arranged your wedding with Luang.

819
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,920
What else are you worried about, Young Miss?

820
00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:42,760
He keeps ignoring me.

821
00:55:42,841 --> 00:55:44,360
What am I to him?

822
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,080
Why does he keep avoiding me?

823
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:48,480
You mean Luang Thukkarat?

824
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,240
I mean Luang Vasuthep.

825
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:53,280
Luang Vasuthep?

826
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:55,519
Why would you care about him?

827
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:58,232
He heard the news with his own ears. Why didn't...

828
00:56:01,272 --> 00:56:03,360
Why didn't he say congratulations?

829
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,680
He will say that on the wedding day, Young Miss.

830
00:56:07,761 --> 00:56:10,640
Don't trouble your mind with Luang Vasuthep.

831
00:56:10,752 --> 00:56:14,000
You should think about your wedding with Luang Thukkarat.

832
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,960
We will deal with Boonta later.

833
00:57:44,818 --> 00:57:46,200
There you are.

834
00:57:46,455 --> 00:57:48,160
- Thanks, Boonta. - Right.

835
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:08,320
What's going on?

836
00:58:09,648 --> 00:58:12,680
Nothing. Here. It's the booze your guest ordered.

837
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,680
- Thank you. - Yeah.

838
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,920
Two ones are two. Two twos are four. Two threes are six.

839
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:32,600
- Two fours are eight. - Uh-uh. Shh.

840
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,640
Young Miss Kleeb, let's recite it inside.

841
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,160
Otherwise, Mother would be mad at me. Come on.

842
00:58:39,176 --> 00:58:40,440
Let's go.

843
00:58:55,334 --> 00:58:57,520
In here.

844
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,560
Young Miss Kleeb.

845
00:59:05,704 --> 00:59:07,225
Please stay quiet for now.

846
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:09,320
I saw someone following us.

847
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:10,960
I'll be back.

848
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:45,640
All you do is cause trouble.

849
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,360
You're making our household hell.

850
00:59:47,479 --> 00:59:49,240
If you can't stand me, just divorce me!

851
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,680
I'll never do that.

852
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:54,640
I'll never shame myself by becoming a divorced woman!

853
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:56,760
I know I'm asking for a lot,

854
00:59:57,207 --> 00:59:58,840
but I really have nowhere to go.

855
00:59:59,127 --> 01:00:01,400
San sent for you. He said he was dying.

856
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:04,680
Nual! Are you trying to kill your own husband?

857
01:00:04,816 --> 01:00:06,200
That's less than what you deserve!

858
01:00:06,415 --> 01:00:07,880
If something happens to Boonta,

859
01:00:07,992 --> 01:00:10,240
you won't survive Luang Thukkarat's wrath!

860
01:00:25,103 --> 01:00:26,800
The victim's face is messed up with cuts.

861
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:28,098
She's unrecognizable.

862
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:30,001
Judging from the color of her sash and robe,

863
01:00:30,096 --> 01:00:32,000
likely this woman was

864
01:00:32,112 --> 01:00:34,160
a courtesan. There's no doubt, sir.
