1
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,280
You got extra money from last night's guest?

2
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:30,293
A bland-looking woman like you

3
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:32,944
will never get to be his regular.

4
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,920
Then let's find out once and for all.

5
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm going to make an "event" where you compete for guests.

6
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:41,336
Please come to Fang's brothel, sirs.

7
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,200
If you're interested in what we're doing,

8
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:46,734
please come and find out, sirs.

9
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:49,975
As a peacekeeper in this town,

10
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:51,320
I have concluded

11
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,120
that this event shall not be ignored.

12
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:59,320
Are you drinking without a companion?

13
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:02,080
If you will take care of me, I'll consider the offer.

14
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:05,880
- This is for you. - Boonta is seducing him! I'm going to slap her!

15
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,760
Your cover will be blown!

16
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:10,280
If you come and flirt with me,

17
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:12,960
I'll pay you more than this.

18
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:15,840
What if Gaysorn finds out?

19
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,440
Just don't tell Gaysorn then!

20
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,360
If she finds out,

21
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
I'll know it's you, Come!

22
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,760
It's here, sir.

23
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,600
Just now,

24
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:49,520
Luang Thukkarat

25
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,080
paid you how much?

26
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:57,000
He paid me

27
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,280
one chang, sir.

28
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:05,320
You said you would pay more than he did, right?

29
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:08,480
If you could pay me two or three,

30
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,360
that would show him your superiority, sir.

31
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:14,160
Boonta.

32
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:17,271
You sure are playful.

33
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,520
I'm not playing, sir.

34
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,760
If it's too much, then that's fine.

35
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,080
If you don't want to pay me that much,

36
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
it's really fine.

37
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:31,920
It's better to keep your money for your family.

38
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm the breadwinner.

39
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,520
Gaysorn wouldn't dare to say a word!

40
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:47,160
Your Gaysorn is really kind.

41
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,160
She's such a good match for a wealthy man like you, Magnate Thong.

42
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,720
Let's just stop

43
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,360
talking about everyone else. Let's talk about us.

44
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's start with

45
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,200
a drink,

46
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,560
just like you did with Luang Thukkarat. Would that suit you?

47
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:19,000
Are you interested in me or Luang Thukkarat, sir?

48
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:21,680
You keep mentioning his name.

49
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,960
Come on.

50
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,320
Do this.

51
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:33,360
Will you drink with me now?

52
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,160
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:48,120
- What did you do? No, thank you, sir. - I'll wipe you.

54
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,320
- I'll wipe you. - No, thanks!

55
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:03,200
-Hey! No! - Let me wipe.

56
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:06,120
Sorry.

57
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,200
I just tripped on something.

58
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:12,280
Luang? Are you bullying me on purpose?

59
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:15,520
The bully here is you.

60
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:19,400
You've been trying to one-up me since you showed up.

61
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm not so upset as to take revenge.

62
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,960
I just don't like

63
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,340
how you're being inappropriate with Boonta.

64
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:32,080
You paid to drink with her. That's all you're supposed to do.

65
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,120
Don't make a situation and try to take advantage of her.

66
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,800
Police officers are conspiring to accuse me?

67
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you have evidence to back your accusation?

68
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,120
You know what you're doing.

69
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,160
If you won't admit it,

70
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:53,920
you can file a complaint with the Police Force.

71
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,647
We're willing to go to court to prove it.

72
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,600
If you're afraid Gaysorn would find out,

73
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:06,240
or if you're afraid for your reputation,

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,560
I think you should go home, sir.

75
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,480
- Come, go home! - Wait, sir!

76
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:21,560
Where's my money?

77
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,720
You're still asking for it?

78
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:28,440
Leave!

79
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,960
Magnate, sir!

80
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,440
Luang.

81
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:43,760
Thank you so much for your help.

82
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:47,120
Both with the money and that Magnate.

83
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,840
From now on, you should call me

84
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:54,720
Chaai.

85
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:58,080
Why, sir?

86
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,240
So I won't get confused

87
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,800
if you call me

88
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:04,080
or someone else.

89
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:09,920
Of course, sir.

90
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,480
It's nice and short.

91
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,840
- Chaai, why are you... - Dokgaew?

92
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,520
Young Miss?

93
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:36,192
- What happened? A drunkard throwing a tantrum? - Where's my Young Miss?

94
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:37,600
It's nothing, Fang.

95
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:41,040
It's just a drunk man. I got him under control.

96
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:45,000
- Young Miss, where are you? - Don't worry, Fang.

97
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:46,631
- I'll take care of this. - Young Miss?

98
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:48,520
You're a guest of my place too.

99
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,320
I can't possibly bother you now.

100
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,880
Let Ming handle him, sir.

101
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,560
It's alright, Fang.

102
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm willing to. I'll take care of this. I'm happy to.

103
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:02,880
Come on!

104
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,120
I told you not to drink too much, didn't I?

105
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:17,160
(Episode 8: The Ace Courtesan... The Top Girl at Fang's)

106
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:27,709
How much?

107
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:35,880
You're winning, Chor.

108
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:47,320
Am I

109
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,480
not too late to join the fun?

110
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,760
I was thinking this event wouldn't be complete without you.

111
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:04,520
It looks like Pudsorn is winning today after all.

112
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:09,800
I get to sleep with her, right?

113
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:12,240
I have never bedded with her before.

114
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,800
Maybe today is your day.

115
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:17,880
You little woman.

116
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes, sir. You pay Pudsorn the most money, making her the winner.

117
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:27,360
Ming.

118
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:29,720
Take Captain upstairs to wait.

119
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:31,160
Yes, Mother.

120
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:35,960
Upstairs please, sir.

121
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,159
Mother.

122
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:50,240
I don't want to service him. Last time, he beat up Nual half to death.

123
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,920
They said he also beat Oeb at Hob's brothel and gave her bruises all over.

124
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,782
She had to take several days off, Mother!

125
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,520
It's your competition.

126
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,680
You won. How can you withdraw?

127
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,120
Just bear with it for a bit. When he's done, he pays you anyway.

128
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:06,850
I don't want his money, Mother,

129
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:08,336
if it means I have to risk my life.

130
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:09,600
Pudsorn.

131
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,720
Just because you're the draw of my place

132
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,471
doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.

133
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:14,943
It's my order. You have to do it.

134
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:25,240
Or you can

135
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,840
kill the lights and send someone else in.

136
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:31,040
It's dark. He won't be able to tell you apart.

137
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,400
Who do I send in, Mother?

138
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,640
Come on.

139
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,160
What's wrong with your master?

140
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:28,160
Why is she doing such a reckless thing?

141
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:33,800
If she gets caught,

142
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:37,040
how would she face anyone ever again?

143
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:42,095
How can you go home like this anyway?

144
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,240
I know another of your secrets,

145
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:58,320
yet I have to help you keep it.

146
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,640
I'd rather not know.

147
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:13,560
Dokgaew.

148
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,880
Dokgaew.

149
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:27,600
It's really late.

150
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:29,240
Please go to bed, ma'am.

151
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,368
Magnate is probably busy with work.

152
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:38,480
Dear.

153
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,760
Were you drinking?

154
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,680
Where did you drink? Who did you go with?

155
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:44,880
What now?

156
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
What's with all the questions?

157
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,480
I'm so tired.

158
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:06,640
Magnate was drinking at Fang's, ma'am.

159
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:12,800
Boonta.

160
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:16,480
Did he sleep with her?

161
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,600
No, ma'am.

162
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,200
It's a real shame you lost.

163
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,520
I wanted to see Pudsorn taken down from her pedestal!

164
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,640
It's fine, Aunt.

165
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:52,040
I felt like I won just being able to keep up.

166
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,560
I felt like I'd overcome myself.

167
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:58,080
Now I know I'm good and I'm worthy.

168
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,880
Thank you so much, Boonta.

169
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,840
Because of you, I'm way more confident in myself.

170
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,360
It's not because of me.

171
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,520
If you had refused to fight, I couldn't have done anything.

172
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,320
It's because you were willing to fight and change yourself for the better.

173
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,480
You're really amazing.

174
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,520
I'm sorry for underestimating you.

175
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,660
Last night, you proved to me that

176
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:28,160
you can be a great rival for me.

177
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:35,160
It's true I'm still number one now,

178
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,560
but I can't underestimate you anymore.

179
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:41,800
I never wanted to compete against you, Pudsorn.

180
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:44,840
I just try to do my job the best I can.

181
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm glad that's your attitude.

182
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:50,320
We can stay friends then.

183
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:52,800
I don't want to consider you an enemy.

184
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,440
Calm down, girl.

185
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:56,824
Does the word "friend" to you mean the same thing to us?

186
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,000
Friends must be genuine, and support each other.

187
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:03,680
Don't be jealous. Don't backstab. And most importantly,

188
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:05,880
we're not your servant.

189
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:08,600
I know!

190
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:11,160
I'll try not to be the same as I've been.

191
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:14,440
I know you're not really a bad person.

192
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:16,583
You just like to act like you're above everyone else.

193
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:19,920
You're obsessed with being number one because you want attention.

194
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:25,040
It's because it wasn't easy for me to come this far.

195
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:27,711
Servicing guests with my body isn't the only thing I do.

196
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:30,440
I take care of them

197
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:33,607
both physically and mentally.

198
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:37,280
I sing and dance. I pour their drinks. I satisfy them.

199
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:39,760
I keep them company.

200
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:45,400
Some guests don't even want to sleep with me.

201
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,304
They just want a shoulder to cry on.

202
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:50,880
Do you think you can

203
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,720
just go ahead and do these things?

204
00:17:55,064 --> 00:17:56,640
I had to train

205
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:57,880
and endure.

206
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,280
So was I wrong

207
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,480
for wanting to be number one?

208
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,200
You're not wrong.

209
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,320
I see everything you do, Pudsorn,

210
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:12,000
so I've never doubted why you're number one.

211
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:15,982
You're not a stupid beauty like people say.

212
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:20,160
You're just selfish and you lack sympathy.

213
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,360
But you can be both a capable and a good person.

214
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,120
You're better now.

215
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,496
Keep up the good work.

216
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:29,080
Thanks.

217
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:34,664
Wait.

218
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,920
Hey. Let me see.

219
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:42,240
Why haven't you got any bruises at all?

220
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:46,040
You spent last night with Captain Jam, didn't you?

221
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:54,960
Or you didn't enter the room?

222
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,400
So who took your place?

223
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:21,520
Lamjeak!

224
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:24,440
Lamjeak!

225
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:42,456
That Captain hurt you this badly?

226
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,480
Lamjeak, please help me.

227
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm really scared of that Captain.

228
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:59,680
If you take my place, I'll pay you more.

229
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:06,520
Please help me. I beg you.

230
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,880
I'll tell Aunt Mian to cook some rice porridge. Then I'll feed you.

231
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,240
I'll get some Bengal roots in the banana bush to heal your bruises.

232
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,720
Lie here and wait for me.

233
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,440
I'll get a Chinese Doctor.

234
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:33,920
No!

235
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:39,720
I'm not hurt that much.

236
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,160
I'll be fine after a few days of rice porridge.

237
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,320
Just see a doctor.

238
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:47,920
I'll pay.

239
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:51,320
Pudsorn!

240
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,415
- Boonta! - Boonta!

241
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:01,200
Boonta, where are you going?

242
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
Mother.

243
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,080
Are you so happy?

244
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,600
What are you talking about?

245
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,320
You don't have to do anything.

246
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:23,240
You can sit pretty and count the money we make!

247
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:24,508
Hey!

248
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,200
You say we're like your family.

249
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,920
You claim to be our mother. You say we're your children.

250
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:34,040
What kind of mother makes a living out of her child's blood and suffering?

251
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:37,480
- You dare call me out? - Dare or not, I am calling you out.

252
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:41,040
You keep getting rich. You're the only one living the easy life.

253
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,720
But us, your fake children? We lie down in pain half to death.

254
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:46,440
Tell me, Mother.

255
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:49,400
Don't you feel embarrassed or ashamed of these words?

256
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:51,040
- You! - Slap me, Mother.

257
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,960
After you slap me, check on one of your children.

258
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:58,480
Lamjeak almost died at the hands and feet of that sick Captain.

259
00:21:58,855 --> 00:22:00,080
You know why?

260
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,040
Because you never say no to a guest.

261
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:04,480
You're stingy.

262
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:05,800
You're hungry for money.

263
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:08,400
You don't even think of protecting your own people.

264
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,240
Can you sit up?

265
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:33,640
- It's not hot anymore. - Easy.

266
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,560
That's enough for me, Aunt.

267
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:44,280
Thank you.

268
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:47,679
She got hurt so badly that she could only drink porridge water.

269
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:50,520
Is Captain Jam even a human?

270
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:55,580
If all you can do is drink porridge water,

271
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,120
how can you have any strength?

272
00:22:57,568 --> 00:22:59,520
Want some more, Lamjeak?

273
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:01,160
Thanks, Aunt but no.

274
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:02,800
If she can't eat, just stop.

275
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,480
I'll dress your wounds.

276
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,760
Come on.

277
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,960
Get up slowly.

278
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:14,320
Come here.

279
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,440
Come on, Lamjeak.

280
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:33,680
So this is what they call "yellow chin."

281
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:40,400
A Chinese doctor is here.

282
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:43,440
This way, please.

283
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,040
You'll be fine in no time.

284
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:57,920
Chor, I'll be back.

285
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,240
Where are you going this time, Boonta?

286
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:04,575
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

287
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,640
This is medicine for your internal injuries.

288
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:12,992
Boil and drink this medicine three times.

289
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,240
You'll feel better soon.

290
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:16,880
Thank you.

291
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,160
Thank you.

292
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,960
No, just lie down.

293
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:46,727
You can take off work until you recover.

294
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,600
Mother.

295
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,360
A courtesan like us

296
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,280
can't choose the guest.

297
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,560
But you're in charge of this place.

298
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:13,840
You can choose, can't you?

299
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,560
You can choose what to do.

300
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,558
Why do you like to come to this place?

301
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:43,520
I didn't really want to come, sir,

302
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,280
unless something happened.

303
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:47,920
So what happened?

304
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,399
My friend was assaulted.

305
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,920
I'm here to report a crime.

306
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:58,800
I understand you're furious for your friend,

307
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:02,280
but no courtesan has ever reported such a crime.

308
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm here, sir. I'm the first.

309
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,880
I sympathize with you and your friend,

310
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:13,280
but I'll be truthful with you.

311
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:16,760
While being a courtesan is not illegal,

312
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:19,432
you're under no protection by the law.

313
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,720
It's a job you do willingly.

314
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,760
You accept violation for money.

315
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:26,960
Hey, Luang.

316
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:29,658
Are you saying that we

317
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:32,600
have to accept the risks just because we do prostitution?

318
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:35,840
- Please calm down. - Luang, sir.

319
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,480
Is it because we're courtesans?

320
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:40,928
Is that why we have to tolerate an exploitative employer?

321
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,360
And a piece of trash guest's abuse?

322
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,680
We can't complain anywhere.

323
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:48,600
We have no safety in our lives.

324
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,440
We have no place in the world. We don't exist.

325
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:57,880
We don't deserve to be protected by the law.

326
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,280
We don't have the same rights as those of other occupations. Is that right?

327
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,320
We work to make a living too.

328
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,000
We provide for our families just like everyone does.

329
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,120
How can I answer your questions?

330
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,160
I'm not the one who wrote the law.

331
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:19,320
I was speaking as a police officer,

332
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:23,296
but as a man,

333
00:27:24,024 --> 00:27:26,200
I understand and agree with you.

334
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,600
I want your friends

335
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:30,840
to have equal rights like everyone.

336
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,256
So I hope

337
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:39,240
one day, courtesans as an occupation

338
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:42,560
will be genuinely accepted, sir.

339
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,880
Captain Jam.

340
00:28:11,312 --> 00:28:12,840
Oh, Fang.

341
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,760
What's so important

342
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,256
that brought you all the way here?

343
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm here for payback.

344
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
For what?

345
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,920
For hurting my child half to death and making her take days off!

346
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,720
- You dare slap me! - Yeah!

347
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:31,560
In the past, I've always kept one eye closed.

348
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,440
But this time it's too much.

349
00:28:33,687 --> 00:28:35,800
If you still keep doing this,

350
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,271
don't step foot at my place again.

351
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,000
You're not welcome!

352
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:46,311
"Wench!"

353
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:52,920
Did you report this to the police?

354
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:57,040
No matter what era,

355
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:59,600
the police never help the people.

356
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,781
The law doesn't protect us.

357
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:04,960
And that Captain is a foreigner!

358
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,480
It's hard to get any kind of justice at all!

359
00:29:08,423 --> 00:29:09,840
I came to terms with that long ago.

360
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,440
We were never accepted.

361
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,750
Whether it's the police,

362
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:15,503
the people, or the Luangs, they never see our pride.

363
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,640
All they do is look down on us.

364
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:19,880
Nobody would take our side.

365
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:23,335
So we take our side.

366
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:26,800
- Help her up. - Hey.

367
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:28,680
- Everyone! - What?

368
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,960
I think we should form a Courtesan Union.

369
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:36,440
- What's that? - It's about this, Aunt.

370
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:38,800
We'll receive fair pay.

371
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:41,340
We'll receive health insurance.

372
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,440
And more importantly, we can take days off like in "Gangubai!"

373
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,040
What's that?

374
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:50,523
Aunt, we work so hard.

375
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,000
We deserve good fringe benefits.

376
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,600
My voice alone won't be loud enough. We have to join forces.

377
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:03,807
Mother will believe us.

378
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:08,884
So are you asking us to go against Mother?

379
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:14,360
It's not like that. We're just calling out what's unfair.

380
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:16,880
Don't let anyone take advantage of you.

381
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,720
And don't let anyone hurt you.

382
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,680
Even if we sleep with men

383
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:26,240
out of necessity or pressure,

384
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:29,880
we have our pride. We're humans just like everyone.

385
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,440
Boonta.

386
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:36,400
Mother won't give in.

387
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,920
Aunt! If she truly loves us, she would understand and do what she can.

388
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:44,120
That's easy for you to say.

389
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,120
What are you girls doing together?

390
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,040
You startled me.

391
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,160
How are you, Lamjeak?

392
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
I'm feeling better, Mother.

393
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:02,000
Spend this money on some medicine.

394
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:04,560
Come back to work when you recover.

395
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:08,080
That Captain won't step foot here again.

396
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:13,040
Yes, Mother.

397
00:31:18,607 --> 00:31:19,840
Wait, Mother.

398
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:21,680
- Mother! -Hmm?

399
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:26,640
So did you deal with that Captain Jam?

400
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:29,863
You think I'm so heartless

401
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,520
that I don't care about my children?

402
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,760
After all,

403
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,720
I'm a woman like you all.

404
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,840
I know how you girls feel.

405
00:31:39,087 --> 00:31:40,440
But as the boss of this place,

406
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:42,840
it's hard for me to openly protect you.

407
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,560
You have to understand that too.

408
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:46,099
Okay.

409
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:49,400
I'm sorry, Mother,

410
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,920
for saying bad things to you.

411
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:53,960
I...

412
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,040
I was mad.

413
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:59,103
From now on, I'll

414
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:01,120
think more before I speak.

415
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:06,120
So what you said back there...

416
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:09,400
Did you hear all that?

417
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,560
So can you do that for us?

418
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:20,440
I'll sleep on it.

419
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:24,760
Thank you.

420
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:29,560
Good fringe benefits?

421
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:31,880
Boonta!

422
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:36,760
- I don't understand a word but it seems to be good. - It's good.

423
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:40,160
We're getting fringe benefits, insurance,

424
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:41,760
What's that "Bai" something?

425
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:43,600
Oh! We'll be like "Gangubai."

426
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:11,616
Dang!

427
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,080
Dang, is that you?

428
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:24,600
It's me, Young Miss.

429
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:28,800
How did I get back home?

430
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,160
Luang Vasuthep took you home.

431
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:37,960
When we arrived at the gate, I told the servants to carry you up here.

432
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,280
My mother didn't find out, right?

433
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:43,520
I dealt with that and silenced everyone, Young Miss.

434
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,640
If Madam Pikul finds out you got drunk,

435
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,040
I'll personally take care of them all!

436
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,840
Did you change my clothes?

437
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,480
Thank you for your help.

438
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,400
Please keep this a secret.

439
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:24,240
Nobody must know.

440
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,480
What kind of woman is she? All she does is make trouble.

441
00:34:40,723 --> 00:34:42,129
Young Miss.

442
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:45,680
Luang Vasuthep won't tell anyone of this.

443
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:49,000
Otherwise, he wouldn't have helped you this much.

444
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:53,864
Don't talk yourself out of this! I won't believe a word you say again!

445
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:56,640
Get the hell out of here. Go!

446
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,847
I'm going, Young Miss.

447
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:18,950
Lamjeak!

448
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:20,160
Choi?

449
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,080
What are you doing here?

450
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:25,080
I'm here for you.

451
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,760
Our mother is dying.

452
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,981
Lamjeak.

453
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,760
Mother?

454
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:55,487
Are you worried your family would see your bruises?

455
00:36:00,755 --> 00:36:04,120
Choi was crying so much she didn't notice. I sent her back.

456
00:36:08,056 --> 00:36:10,520
Let me put on your make-up. Here.

457
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:14,831
What is this?

458
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,800
Powder mixed with curcuma.

459
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:19,280
With a little bit of water.

460
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:22,240
This should work as a foundation.

461
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,880
Your powder is too white.

462
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,320
It's going to make your face look pale.

463
00:36:28,448 --> 00:36:30,520
And it can't cover your bruises.

464
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,000
Come on.

465
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,775
Let's get the bruise here.

466
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,320
This shouldn't hurt, right?

467
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:49,000
It's working great.

468
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:51,808
It's gone!

469
00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:55,040
- Really? - Yeah. Look.

470
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:01,080
One on your neck.

471
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:06,680
- Does it hurt? - No.

472
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,520
Why am I so good at this?

473
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:14,960
- It works? - Yeah.

474
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:20,520
Yeah. Let's get this too.

475
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,120
Oh!

476
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,113
Lamjeak, where is your home?

477
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:34,400
- Ban Dokmai. - Ban Dokmai?

478
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:38,320
I still don't know where it is.

479
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,320
I need to hire a boat.

480
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:43,615
- How would you know... - Where are you going?

481
00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:47,976
Lamjeak is visiting her mother.

482
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,240
We're here to hire a boat.

483
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,040
Are you going with her?

484
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:55,760
Yes, sir. I'm going with her.

485
00:37:57,623 --> 00:37:59,183
Then let me give you a ride in my boat.

486
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,880
Is that okay, sir?

487
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,680
You shouldn't have to.

488
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,840
It's just a short trip. It won't affect my work.

489
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,960
Let's ride with Chaai. It's for the best.

490
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,560
It's better than hiring a boat and swimming.

491
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,200
Have you lost your mind?

492
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,040
How could you call him by name?

493
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
Why not?

494
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:22,120
Chaai told me to do so.

495
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,160
They don't do that here?

496
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:27,280
Apart from his family,

497
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,880
nobody would dare.

498
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,320
Yeah.

499
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:35,040
- So... - I gave you permission.

500
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,080
I'm not revoking it.

501
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:53,760
We're almost there.

502
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,720
You said your family sold flowers. Shouldn't we go to Pak Khlong Talad?

503
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,640
I don't see a flower here.

504
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:09,080
What exactly did you mean?

505
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:12,720
I said my home is Ban Dokmai.

506
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,680
That doesn't mean we sell flowers. My family makes fireworks.

507
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:19,513
So your "Dokmai" means fireworks?

508
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:20,832
- Yeah. - So...

509
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:23,304
You must have a lot of fireworks at home, right?

510
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:26,880
We do. My father was the best "Fai Phaniang" maker.

511
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,360
But I prefer pretty stuff, like "Ped," "Pla Duk," and "Pla Chon."

512
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:34,760
Those are fish, aren't they?

513
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,480
So you don't know what those are?

514
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,840
Thank you.

515
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:49,680
Come on. Let's go.

516
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,840
Sorry, sir. I was caught up in the conversation.

517
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,480
Thank you so much for the ride.

518
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,040
We'll be on our way.

519
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,880
Have a safe trip back, sir.

520
00:40:05,192 --> 00:40:07,360
Lamjeak!

521
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:09,160
Lamjeak! Help!

522
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,640
Mother is getting worse!

523
00:40:12,095 --> 00:40:14,360
Mother? Let's go! Quick!

524
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,040
She has been throwing up and had watery diarrhea since last night.

525
00:40:29,295 --> 00:40:31,000
Have you called a doctor?

526
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:33,575
I don't have money left. I spent everything on Chinese potion.

527
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,280
But it didn't help.

528
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:39,320
Here.

529
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:42,720
I have money. Go get a doctor. I'll watch her.

530
00:40:42,895 --> 00:40:44,040
- Yes. - Go!

531
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,040
You should stay with your mother and sister.

532
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,920
Yod and I will go get you a doctor.

533
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:50,288
- Let's go, Yod. - Yes, sir.

534
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,760
Mother.

535
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:56,760
Would she be okay? Would she die?

536
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,335
Your mother will be fine.

537
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,600
Luang is going to get a doctor.

538
00:41:05,623 --> 00:41:07,600
Choi, get the remaining potion.

539
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,560
I'll wipe her and feed her potion while we wait.

540
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,320
- Okay. - Go.

541
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,080
Lamjeak, let me help. I know how

542
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,880
to do first aid. Come on.

543
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,800
I used to care for patients.

544
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:28,215
- "Patient..." - Sick people.

545
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,904
I used to care for sick people.

546
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,400
- Let's wipe her. - Please help my mother.

547
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,720
Mother.

548
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,280
We'll give you a wipe.

549
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:44,520
It's not a deadly diarrhea as you feared.

550
00:41:44,696 --> 00:41:46,696
It's just food poisoning.

551
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:51,040
If you take my medicine continuously, she will recover.

552
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,040
Here, sir.

553
00:42:05,368 --> 00:42:07,760
Is this not enough for the medicine, sir?

554
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:10,520
It's not that.

555
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:12,480
My Luang already paid for the doctor's fee

556
00:42:12,624 --> 00:42:15,240
and your mother's medicine.

557
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:30,440
Yod.

558
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,080
Escort the doctor to his home.

559
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,360
Yes, sir.

560
00:42:41,384 --> 00:42:43,160
Thank you so much for your help.

561
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:46,523
I didn't do anything. Luang did.

562
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,440
He helped you non-stop.

563
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:53,400
If it weren't for you, would I be this lucky?

564
00:42:55,231 --> 00:42:57,320
You are a generous man, sir.

565
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
You are a kind woman too.

566
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:04,120
I'm glad you were there for me.

567
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:06,440
Yeah.

568
00:43:14,763 --> 00:43:16,600
My life has been bad.

569
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,640
My father died in a firework explosion.

570
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:24,000
My mother is never in good health.

571
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,800
She and my sister are the only people in my life.

572
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,920
You have to provide for your family.

573
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:38,400
Is that why you have to work at Fang's?

574
00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:43,720
Boonta.

575
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,760
A poor person like me doesn't have many choices.

576
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:53,120
I only hope that

577
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:56,360
my loved ones can live in peace.

578
00:44:00,935 --> 00:44:04,880
Do you know? When Ming brought Choi in to see me,

579
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:07,855
I got so deeply scared.

580
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:10,920
I was scared she was sold into the place.

581
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
I'd rather work hard alone

582
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,400
than let my sister join me.

583
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,120
Lamjeak.

584
00:44:23,232 --> 00:44:24,672
Your sister will never do this work.

585
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,100
I'll be there for you.

586
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,480
If you need my help, let me know.

587
00:44:30,903 --> 00:44:32,240
But

588
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,400
I don't have much money.

589
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,200
If you're in trouble,

590
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,200
I'm willing to give you all I have though.

591
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,920
Thank you, Boonta.

592
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:49,760
Don't cry.

593
00:45:07,135 --> 00:45:08,440
What's wrong?

594
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,920
You seem quiet.

595
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,800
Are you ill?

596
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:15,800
Lamjeak's story reminded me of myself, sir.

597
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:19,040
You're thinking of your family?

598
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,985
Some things are

599
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:25,520
not worth thinking of.

600
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:29,440
Lamjeak's family and mine

601
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,160
are similarly suffering.

602
00:45:31,368 --> 00:45:33,368
I have been working hard since I was young

603
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,320
because I wanted my loved ones who love me

604
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:37,720
to have a good life.

605
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,200
Food delivery, sir.

606
00:45:56,575 --> 00:45:58,640
- Mr. Eff? - That's me.

607
00:45:58,928 --> 00:46:00,480
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

608
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:02,504
Goodbye.

609
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:10,600
Hello, Grandma?

610
00:46:10,983 --> 00:46:13,160
(Jeed, have you had lunch?)

611
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:15,847
I'm working. What about you?

612
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:17,560
Don't forget your lunch.

613
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,560
(Take care of yourself, sweetie.)

614
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:22,160
Yeah. Love you.

615
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:27,640
- This is for Yao, and this is for Bank. - Thanks.

616
00:46:31,943 --> 00:46:34,440
- What would you like? - One black coffee.

617
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:37,120
Want some sugar?

618
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,580
You shouldn't be working in concession with that face of yours.

619
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:45,080
Would you like to be an actress?

620
00:46:46,966 --> 00:46:48,966
What are you talking about?

621
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:56,200
Boom, do I have anything on my schedule tomorrow?

622
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,400
What's the matter?

623
00:46:58,575 --> 00:47:02,920
Tomorrow is my grandma's death anniversary. I want to visit a temple.

624
00:47:03,032 --> 00:47:05,424
Okay. I'll take care of that.

625
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,400
(Mom)

626
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,800
Mom?

627
00:47:10,191 --> 00:47:11,880
Give it to me. Let me talk.

628
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,280
Hello, ma'am?

629
00:47:16,983 --> 00:47:18,983
She's working.

630
00:47:19,663 --> 00:47:21,120
Oh, ma'am?

631
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,280
Are you still trying?

632
00:47:23,544 --> 00:47:25,544
When she was working hard,

633
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:27,478
she had no one at all.

634
00:47:27,576 --> 00:47:30,440
The only one who struggled for her was her grandma.

635
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:33,000
Now that she's a star,

636
00:47:33,104 --> 00:47:37,200
you and her father keep trying to reach her.

637
00:47:39,032 --> 00:47:41,560
At least Lamjeak still has someone.

638
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,400
I have no one now.

639
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:45,880
The one who I wanted to have

640
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,160
is already gone.

641
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,400
That's why I work hard just to spend on myself.

642
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:55,480
I'm sorry.

643
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,880
Sorry for what, sir?

644
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm sorry I made your family turn out this way.

645
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,520
I used to wonder what I did wrong.

646
00:48:32,234 --> 00:48:33,560
Someone reported

647
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,920
that you sold sugar to the Europeans without permission.

648
00:48:36,695 --> 00:48:37,880
Search the place!

649
00:48:38,129 --> 00:48:39,220
Yes, sir.

650
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,080
Boonta.

651
00:50:33,242 --> 00:50:34,680
I brought you medicine.

652
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:37,760
I'm trying to find a way to help.

653
00:50:45,961 --> 00:50:48,103
Thank you, sir.

654
00:50:58,831 --> 00:51:00,880
Please be patient for a bit longer, Bua.

655
00:51:03,424 --> 00:51:04,720
Yes, sir.

656
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,880
I know you were just doing your job,

657
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,000
but I don't want to see you ever again.

658
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:38,920
I was too honest.

659
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,680
I was too obsessed with duty.

660
00:51:43,295 --> 00:51:44,880
Had I been more flexible,

661
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:47,040
more lenient,

662
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:48,760
and less egoistic,

663
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,175
you probably wouldn't have ended up this way.

664
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,440
But from what I've heard,

665
00:51:54,672 --> 00:51:57,000
Boonta herself has some ego too.

666
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,200
And...

667
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,360
It turned out this way because you and Boonta

668
00:52:02,535 --> 00:52:04,160
were in love, right?

669
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:08,280
How could you just say the word "love"

670
00:52:08,623 --> 00:52:10,240
without feeling anything?

671
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,960
I wasn't talking about myself, sir.

672
00:52:13,104 --> 00:52:14,880
It was about you

673
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,600
and the old Boonta.

674
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:19,880
I'm New Boonta.

675
00:52:21,336 --> 00:52:22,680
What does that mean?

676
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:30,000
I am the new Boonta who has no memory of the past.

677
00:52:30,264 --> 00:52:34,120
Whatever happened, just let it go.

678
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,880
Let's "move on," sir.

679
00:52:38,704 --> 00:52:40,560
"Moop on?"

680
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:43,800
"Move on" means

681
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:46,000
to move forward

682
00:52:46,447 --> 00:52:48,040
and not dwell on the past, sir.

683
00:52:51,903 --> 00:52:53,280
What about us?

684
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,600
Just "set zero," sir.

685
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:58,880
Start over.

686
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:00,720
We can

687
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:03,240
stay friends for now.

688
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,600
Why is Boonta taking so long?

689
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,160
She said she would see Lamjeak first. I don't know what's going on.

690
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,080
Sir.

691
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,480
Luang, sir!

692
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,360
I have something to show you.

693
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,680
Come on.

694
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:42,680
- We'll be back. - Yes, sir.

695
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,800
- Where are you taking me? - This way, quick.

696
00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:22,680
Do you like it, sir?

697
00:54:25,215 --> 00:54:26,760
Did you ask Lamjeak to do this?

698
00:54:27,144 --> 00:54:28,240
Yes, sir.

699
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:29,800
I wanted to see it.

700
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,176
I thought if you saw it,

701
00:54:32,543 --> 00:54:34,400
you would feel better.

702
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,240
Do you care about my feelings?

703
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:41,440
Yes, sir.

704
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:45,880
Friends can care about each other.

705
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:51,960
I think I'm starting to feel bad again.

706
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,200
Then let's see the next one.

707
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:26,120
(I'm sorry I took her place, )

708
00:55:26,854 --> 00:55:28,854
(and I can't accept your feelings now, )

709
00:55:29,879 --> 00:55:34,000
(when you've always been there for me since I woke up in this era.)

710
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,560
It's just a temporary joy.

711
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:14,480
Suffering doesn't last either.

712
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:17,360
It will pass, sir.

713
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:19,760
No matter what it is,

714
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,200
you and I will get through it.

715
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,720
Please do something, Mother.

716
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,560
Otherwise, I'm going to lose Chaai to Boonta.

717
00:57:58,681 --> 00:58:01,211
Hurry up. I need to make merit!

718
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
Push them off.

719
00:58:03,328 --> 00:58:05,080
The police have received a report

720
00:58:05,168 --> 00:58:07,880
that opium was smuggled onto Chim's ship, sir.

721
00:58:08,134 --> 00:58:11,000
From now on, Kleeb will be living here.

722
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,480
So Mother thinks I don't have enough work to do?

723
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,200
Is that why she's making me babysit?

724
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:17,880
I told you I'm New Boonta.

725
00:58:18,087 --> 00:58:20,240
I'm not the same old Boonta you know.

726
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,560
I like the new Boonta too.

727
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,280
Luang may love you

728
00:58:27,391 --> 00:58:30,680
but do you think his mother would approve?

729
00:58:36,135 --> 00:58:38,600
Someone save my daughter!
