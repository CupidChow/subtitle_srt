1
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:27,639
What year is this?

2
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,895
Minor Era 1187.

3
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:32,840
So, I've come back to King Rama III's era?

4
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:36,160
Other people come back in time as nobles.

5
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:38,807
Of all things, why does heaven make me a whore?

6
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,160
Five tamleung.

7
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,520
Boonta belongs to Captain Jam.

8
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:45,080
Even if she's a courtesan,

9
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:46,576
you shouldn't force yourself on her.

10
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,280
Luang Thukkarat has feelings for Boonta,

11
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,480
even before he arrested Bua, the one who sold you sugar.

12
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,720
The one responsible for me being a prostitute

13
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
was the one who saved my life?

14
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,160
Boonta was paid for at five tamleung, is that right?

15
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:01,640
It's ten tamleung now.

16
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,118
Would you let her be?

17
00:03:03,257 --> 00:03:04,880
I tried negotiating for her

18
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:06,360
and got disrespected in return.

19
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,080
Tonight, you will bed with Captain Jam.

20
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:13,120
I heard that your ship carries forbidden items.

21
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,880
Luang Thukkarat sent you to stall me, did he not?

22
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:56,680
This is way too late. Where is Captain Jam?

23
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,720
If he doesn't come, I'll sell Boonta to someone else.

24
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:38,360
I'm Jeed Nittra.

25
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,600
I make seven figures for a bikini photoshoot.

26
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:44,000
Why would I sleep with a farang for free?

27
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:50,920
I'm still single. My job is going well.

28
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,840
And I'm gorgeous.

29
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:55,960
I won't let my life end in a brothel.

30
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,600
Someone bought Boonta?

31
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:35,142
Yes, sir.

32
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,560
You're too late, sir.

33
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:49,480
"You, wait. Calm down."

34
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:51,120
Whoa.

35
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:01,880
"Wait, you. I told you... Calm down."

36
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:06,360
- Let me go! - If you don't want to get hurt, stay still!

37
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,960
Why would I stay still? You're screwing me!

38
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,768
Whoa!

39
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,400
You speak Thai?

40
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:16,640
A little. Like how you can speak my language.

41
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,560
What now?

42
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:22,664
What's time out in English?

43
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:25,760
"Time up? Time up!"

44
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,000
"Time's up?"

45
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:29,000
How can this be over already?

46
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,800
I haven't done anything.

47
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:34,440
"Time out?"

48
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,240
"Time out. Please."

49
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:43,840
What do you want?

50
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,440
"I have water..."

51
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,800
"I need some drink."

52
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:57,895
- "Drink?" - "Yeah."

53
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:17,448
Just let her go, Chaai.

54
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,800
You're not meant to be together.

55
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:23,904
Fate is too cruel to him.

56
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,600
My Luang asked a favor of Luang Vasuthep,

57
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,400
but he was too late himself!

58
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,200
Are you trying to rub it in, Yod?

59
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:33,775
No, sir. I'm just trying to comfort you.

60
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,920
Don't comfort me!

61
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,560
Just find out who bought Boonta.

62
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:50,440
Once you find out, what could you do?

64
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:54,040
Boonta is a courtesan, remember?

65
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,920
It won't be easy for you and Boonta.

66
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:06,639
Let's drink, Chaai.

67
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:08,480
Don't think about it too much.

68
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,600
"Cheers," sir.

69
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,160
"Cheers."

70
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:31,520
"Cheers." Touch the glasses first. "Yeah."

71
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,840
Drink.

72
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:41,080
Yes, sir.

73
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,120
I didn't expect

74
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,360
you to know how to drink wine.

75
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:56,880
I shouldn't tell you this.

76
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,040
But wine can't get me hammered.

77
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:01,320
Hammered?

78
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:05,880
Hammered? Did you get hit by a hammer?

79
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No, sir.

80
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:11,000
I mean,

81
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
I've tried all these things.

82
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:16,560
Whether it's Mouton Cadet Bordeaux Rouge,

83
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,840
Royal DeMaria,

84
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:21,596
Chateau d'Yquem 1787,

85
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,677
and even Pinot Noir.

86
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:26,000
This is nothing.

87
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,880
Come on. Let's drink more.

88
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,920
- "Cheers," sir. "Cheers." - "Cheers."

89
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,360
What is your name, sir?

90
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:43,496
- "I'm Johnson." - Johnson?

91
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:45,743
What country are you from?

92
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:47,000
"From Great Britain."

93
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:50,440
- "From Great Britain." - "From Daverton?"

94
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,640
So...

95
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,320
- Are you a trader? - "Of course, yes."

96
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:57,960
What do you sell, sir?

97
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,400
Is your business going well?

98
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:01,520
- Sugar. - Sugar?

99
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:04,200
I once bought it at your mother's.

100
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:06,360
Don't you remember me?

101
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah.

102
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:19,569
"Cheers."

103
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:25,920
"Thank you."

104
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:29,360
"Cheers."

105
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:40,880
So you...

106
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,480
Why don't you go to bed, sir?

107
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:48,800
Are you ready to bed?

108
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
Oh? "Cheers."

109
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:07,080
"Cheers."

110
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,240
You can just drink with me tonight.

111
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:32,280
(Episode 2: To a Whore's World... Don't Give Up, Jeed!)

112
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,120
Goodness?

113
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,000
Luang Thukkarat went that far?

114
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,000
They say he's obsessed with her at the market.

115
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:13,040
He keeps visiting Fang's brothel.

116
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:15,720
All the people there saw him.

117
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:21,488
Tell me everything that happened!

118
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,520
I heard our servants talking about

119
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:40,080
you bringing a woman home. Was that true?

120
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,960
It's not someone important, Mother.

121
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,680
Don't play it down.

122
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:50,920
If Dokgaew hears of this,

123
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,560
she'll be upset.

124
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:57,160
I told you I loved Dokgaew like a sister.

125
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,680
I don't like her as a lover.

126
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:04,000
So, who are you in love with?

127
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:06,520
We would ask for her parents' blessing.

128
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,920
You're old enough to get married.

129
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,920
I want to see you settled down.

130
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Mother.

131
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,960
Let's not pressure Chaai.

132
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,280
He's busy with work.

133
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:21,840
Marriage is probably not on his mind.

134
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,360
I'm so glad you took over Father's business, Chim.

135
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,080
Otherwise,

136
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,920
you'd be working hard like Chaai.

137
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,748
Your father was a merchant all his life.

138
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,360
When Chaai got recruited,

139
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,640
he was very proud.

140
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,560
I remember.

141
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:46,600
Father bragged about it all over town.

142
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:50,440
You're our family's pride, Chaai.

143
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,920
Let's eat.

144
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,000
The food's getting cold.

145
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:59,960
Tomorrow is a Buddhist sabbath. I want to visit Monk Chang.

146
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,040
Come to the temple with me, Chaai.

147
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,200
Yes, Mother.

148
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,520
My head hurts.

149
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
The soup is ready.

150
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
Come on.

151
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,040
Two ladles, please.

152
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,320
How is Lamduan?

153
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:14,120
She's fine.

154
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,320
Watch her.

155
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,080
Oh, you're walking side to side.

156
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,080
Is this all for "breakfast?"

157
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:26,976
What are you saying? I don't understand.

158
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,000
The morning meal, is this all? I want rice.

159
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:35,480
Before you eat rice, drink that soup.

160
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,240
Here's yours. It's ready.

161
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,400
What's this soup?

162
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:49,680
It smells like booze!

163
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,359
I boiled persimmon stems

164
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:55,360
with booze from fermented rice.

165
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,080
Last night, you bedded with Captain Jam.

166
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:00,560
Drink this so you don't get pregnant.

167
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,360
What's wrong?

168
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:05,760
- What? - Hey.

169
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:08,200
Last night, I...

170
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Oh! It's hot! Ouch!

171
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,760
Oh! You spilt it!

172
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,400
What's wrong?

173
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,440
- Captain Jam didn't smack you? - Oh yeah.

174
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:23,784
I didn't bed with him.

175
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:26,351
Who did you bed with?

176
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:28,880
What's his name?

177
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,640
Oh, it's Johnson.

178
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:34,200
Captain Jon?

179
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
He's more of a gentleman than I expected.

180
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:43,200
We only drank wine together last night.

181
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,656
He didn't sleep with me.

182
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,800
Are you sure?

183
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:52,160
Hey, I know what happened.

184
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:55,000
This is real life, not a Thai TV series.

185
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:59,080
You're really born lucky, Boonta.

186
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,840
People are attached to you.

187
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,400
You have Captain Jon and Luang Thukkarat too.

188
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:08,880
What does Luang Thukkarat have to do with this?

189
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,560
Last night, he came and asked for Boonta.

190
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,480
But he was too late, so he went home disappointed.

191
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:19,560
I don't care who asked for whom. I'm asking for rice.

192
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,160
Aunt, can I have rice now?

193
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,480
You were barely eating earlier. Now you're enjoying it.

194
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,520
Earlier is earlier.

195
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:54,200
Now is now.

196
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,560
(From my years of experience in acting, )

197
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,040
(if this were a TV series, )

198
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,840
(this girl is surely the villainess.)

199
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,920
(She's the top girl in this place.)

200
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,240
(People are spoiling her.)

201
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,040
Hey.

202
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:30,240
Hey.

203
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,200
Let go!

204
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,320
Don't eat if you're going to play tug-o-war.

205
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:39,582
What's wrong with you girls?

206
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:41,560
Can't you just eat normally?

207
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,680
Lamduan is a handful too.

208
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,080
Hey, would it kill you to eat normally?

209
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:54,920
See? Your sister has to feed you.

210
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,920
Look, Boonta. This Lamduan girl,

211
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,975
she's just like you. She fights a lot.

212
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,759
She tries to run away every chance she gets.

213
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,486
But she always ends up getting caught and brought back.

214
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,327
She doesn't learn.

215
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:18,920
(Lamduan)

216
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,320
(There's another handful one.)

217
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,599
(A stubborn and brave girl, )

218
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,160
(who doesn't let fate control her.)

219
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,440
Get me some more curry, Chor.

220
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,840
(And this girl?)

221
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,040
(She's the villainess' sidekick.)

222
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:42,880
(She's kind, but she's afraid. She loves her friends and sister.)

223
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,840
You should eat too, Chor.

224
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:51,944
Don't get sick like your sister.

225
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:56,080
Worry about yourself first, Nual.

226
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,720
Do you know? As of now,

227
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,360
Mother told Ming to keep an eye on you.

228
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:04,360
Don't even think of running back to your husband.

229
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:07,802
He brought you here and sold you out.

230
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:10,160
He's probably enjoying the money.

231
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,040
Don't even think of going back to him.

232
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,000
(The sweet girl of Fang's brothel.)

233
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,960
(The sad beauty who's mild-mannered and gentle.)

234
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,440
(She cherishes love.)

235
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,548
(Nual)

236
00:20:27,415 --> 00:20:28,720
Wait, Aunt.

237
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,880
Can your husband sell you?

238
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,440
Of course. Her husband did.

239
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,720
Those girls sitting over there?

240
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,120
Their parents sold them.

241
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,374
It's typical.

242
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:42,903
You and Lamjeak too.

243
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:45,120
Your creditors sold you two.

244
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:50,800
How many women would walk in and sell themselves to a courtesan house?

245
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:59,760
(Of course, she's the strong one. Tough, resilient, and hard-working.)

246
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:02,360
(And she has music in her heart.)

247
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:06,360
Okay. You girls keep on eating.

248
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:10,200
If it's not enough, tell me. I'll make more.

249
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,000
(This last one?)

250
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:15,720
(The senior, Mother's right-hand woman.)

251
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:18,090
(She complains and gossips a lot.)

252
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:19,696
(She can be kind.)

253
00:21:20,031 --> 00:21:23,960
(She seems to know a few people's secrets in this brothel.)

254
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,040
Am I adapting too quickly?

255
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,080
I have to run away

256
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,480
before getting a third work.

257
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,920
(All dressed up, get your moves up.)

258
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:55,980
(Want to have fun, just come at once.)

259
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:59,160
(If you want to play, dance this way.)

260
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:00,520
Lamjeak.

261
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:04,240
If I want to stop working,

262
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:06,352
I have to buy my own freedom, right?

263
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,240
So how much is it?

264
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,960
You get a feung for a guest.

265
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:17,600
By the time you make a chang, you'd be dead.

266
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,680
Is it that expensive?

267
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:26,080
I told you to accept reality.

268
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,040
It's probably hard at first,

269
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:30,200
but you'll get used to it.

270
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:33,720
It's not that bad here, Boonta.

271
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:36,080
If you don't fight and obey Mother,

272
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:37,880
she won't be cruel to you.

273
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,520
Boonta!

274
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,080
Mother! Don't hurt me!

275
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:49,880
Boonta!

276
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,480
What's wrong with you?

277
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,280
Are you fine with this place now?

278
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm fine now. I won't run anymore.

279
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:04,000
Good. I'm glad you came to your senses.

280
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,400
I don't want scars on your body.

281
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:09,440
You're a product. I don't want to ruin your price.

282
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,960
Yeah.

283
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,720
Mian.

284
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:15,400
What is it, Mother?

285
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,840
I'm visiting the temple tomorrow.

286
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:18,000
Go to the market.

287
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:22,000
Take Lamjeak with you. She'll help carry things.

288
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,520
I'm coming too. Let me come with you.

289
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,680
You have to keep an eye on her.

290
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,080
- If she runs away, we're both in trouble. - Yes, Aunt.

291
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:43,880
- Hey, Jamleak. - It's Lamjeak.

292
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:47,640
Lamjeak, I want to know how much it is for a spot here.

293
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Like this.

294
00:23:49,383 --> 00:23:50,560
What are you saying?

295
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:52,664
How much is it for one spot?

296
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,720
How many hours can you open?

297
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:00,240
What are you saying?

298
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:02,160
Why would you want to know that?

299
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,880
Well, working in a brothel alone won't be enough.

300
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:08,920
I have to get a few more side gigs, right?

301
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,400
So I can save money and buy my freedom.

302
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:13,520
You wanted to come...

303
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,120
because you wanted to see ways to make money?

304
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
That's right.

305
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,320
- She's going to be a merchant! - What should I sell?

306
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:23,160
I have never been a merchant before.

307
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:28,800
I should've joined the celebrity marketplace. I would've had experience.

308
00:24:30,894 --> 00:24:32,000
- Aunt... - Forget it.

309
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,880
Look, you can stop fantasizing.

310
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:40,600
Mother won't let you stop working to join this market.

311
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:42,800
And with the price you were sold,

312
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,120
you'll be an old woman and still won't make enough.

313
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:53,160
I can't go back. I'll get killed if I run. I don't want to work.

314
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:55,400
And I don't know how to sell things.

315
00:24:56,936 --> 00:24:58,720
I'm so stressed!

316
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:03,640
Hey, Lamjeak.

317
00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:08,200
I want a new sash.

318
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:11,280
Didn't you say you'd save money for your mother's potion?

319
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,640
But they say

320
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,600
fine feathers make a fine bird.

321
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,360
If you buy a new sash, you'll probably get more guests.

322
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:24,645
I want new clothes too.

323
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,000
Hey!

324
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:28,560
Wait...

325
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:32,040
Look, Lamjeak. I want clothes like the ones I wore on my auction night.

326
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,240
Whoa!

327
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,680
You have a high taste!

328
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:38,279
Nobody wears those clothes outside of their auction night.

329
00:25:38,383 --> 00:25:41,480
It's way beyond you. If you wear them, police will arrest and flog you.

330
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,120
You get arrested?

331
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:48,840
Yeah. Commoners are forbidden to dress like royalties.

332
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:52,800
So those complicated rules last through the ages, huh?

333
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:57,320
It's fine. If I can't do that, I'll get one of these.

334
00:25:57,481 --> 00:26:00,200
I'll go back, take a shower, and change.

335
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:02,840
I'm stinking so bad.

336
00:26:04,056 --> 00:26:05,280
This one looks good.

337
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:08,080
- Well... - Do you have money?

338
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:21,000
You have sashes and robes in your belongings. Let's check them out.

339
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:25,800
Oh, hey.

340
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:31,440
I'm Jeed Nittra, a rising star actress.

341
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,840
Yet I don't even have money to buy my clothes.

342
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:47,186
Aunt.

343
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,800
Having money sure is good.

344
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:07,136
We'll take these two.

345
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:08,880
She's rich.

346
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:11,280
Here you are.

347
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,080
Here. It's for you.

348
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,080
Really?

349
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,000
Thank you.

350
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:28,760
Shopping's done. Let's go.

351
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,760
Let's get the things we're supposed to get. Don't slack off.

352
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:35,680
Come on. Tie your hair on the way.

353
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:39,520
- Mother would love this. - This is pretty, Aunt.

354
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,960
But it's expensive.

355
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,480
There are sweets too.

356
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,280
Are these freshly made?

357
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,640
I see you were setting up shop.

358
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:53,760
Boonta, walk faster.

359
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,200
My feet hurt.

360
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,440
Why do you have to walk with your feet sideways?

361
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,440
It won't surprise me if those at the house hate you.

362
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,160
- Come on. - Such a crybaby.

363
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:09,614
Look.

364
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:12,280
Don't even try something funny.

365
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,800
If you run away and get caught, I

366
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:17,720
will get a knife from Mother

367
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:20,800
and cut you into pieces myself.

368
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,280
Try if you dare.

369
00:28:22,642 --> 00:28:24,760
This brothel is cruel.

370
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,760
Come on.

371
00:28:31,237 --> 00:28:33,576
Wow. These are freshly made.

372
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,983
- Wow. - Ouch.

373
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:41,520
Sandals.

374
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:42,920
Boonta.

375
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:44,600
Pick a pair.

376
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,000
I don't have money.

377
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:50,720
I'll buy you a pair.

378
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,400
Really?

379
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,160
Just don't pick expensive ones.

380
00:28:57,423 --> 00:28:59,183
Why are you so kind?

381
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,600
Try them on.

382
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:03,040
These ones.

383
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,280
- Here. - You like them?

384
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,640
How much for these?

385
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,440
One feung.

386
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,640
Put it back.

387
00:29:15,774 --> 00:29:17,040
Too expensive.

388
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,880
These, then. They're in black. "Classic."

389
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
- What about these? - Two phai.

390
00:29:29,912 --> 00:29:31,520
Two phai for these?

391
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:35,960
These are too expensive too.

392
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:38,560
Two phai is expensive?

393
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I'll pick another pair then.

394
00:29:43,255 --> 00:29:44,632
You can have this pair.

395
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,240
I'll buy them for you.

396
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:07,960
Hey, Luang, sir.

397
00:30:09,383 --> 00:30:11,000
I'd rather not impose.

398
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,000
Lamjeak, my friend, is buying anyway.

399
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:17,600
She doesn't have enough money, right?

400
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:21,920
Do you have cheaper ones?

401
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,240
Why won't you accept them from me?

402
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,176
So...

403
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:40,543
How are we related? Why would you buy things for me?

404
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,640
He's your husband, isn't he?

405
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:44,120
No!

406
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:45,840
What are you talking about?

407
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:50,640
Well, you slept with him at his house.

408
00:30:50,721 --> 00:30:53,386
Don't even try to pretend.

409
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:56,680
Aunt, wait. He and I

410
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,120
didn't sleep together.

411
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:02,880
And I have never shared a bed with anyone.

412
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:07,040
That must mean she didn't sleep with Captain Jon last night.

413
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:14,470
Luang, what are you smiling for? Say something.

414
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:17,640
Tell them we're not husband and wife.

415
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:22,240
What are you smiling for?

416
00:31:31,163 --> 00:31:32,760
Hey! Won't you take your sandals...

417
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:34,488
- Boonta! - I don't want them anymore!

418
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,320
What is it, sir?

419
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:25,440
I just wanted to say

420
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,920
I'm happy you haven't shared a bed with anyone.

421
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,991
Sarung! You again!

422
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,000
I didn't. That wasn't me.

423
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,440
I was framed!

424
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:51,720
How dare you smuggle opium into my ship?

425
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:56,960
No, sir.

426
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:58,600
I didn't do it.

427
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:00,440
I was framed.

428
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,120
Someone else in your crew did it.

429
00:33:02,495 --> 00:33:04,920
I caught you red-handed.

430
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,160
Yet you still say you were framed?

431
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,640
Captain Sut, please forgive me.

432
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,600
What I did was wrong.

433
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,080
Here comes Luang Thukkarat.

434
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:21,880
Please interrogate Sarung for me.

435
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,640
Luang, sir.

436
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:27,680
I heard a while ago

437
00:33:28,192 --> 00:33:30,192
that someone smuggled opium into ships.

438
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,680
So it was you.

439
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:35,918
Please don't punish me, sir.

440
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,640
I was wrong.

441
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,280
I want you in jail

442
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,080
and punish you hard.

443
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,920
Make it worth the trouble you caused.

444
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:47,800
But you're a European's subordinate.

445
00:33:48,264 --> 00:33:50,200
All I can do is confiscate your opium.

446
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,480
Is that all?

447
00:33:54,543 --> 00:33:55,960
Usually, a crime related to opium

448
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,528
is punishable by fining eight times the opium's weight of silver

449
00:33:58,552 --> 00:34:00,552
or confiscating all wealth of the criminal.

450
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,436
But for a European's subordinate,

451
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,000
they're under protection.

452
00:34:05,537 --> 00:34:06,880
You have my gratitude.

453
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,162
Luang, sir.

454
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,680
Don't cause trouble again.

455
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:13,488
Next time, you won't be so lucky.

456
00:34:14,326 --> 00:34:17,080
- Thank you, sir. - That drunkard sailor,

457
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,120
I always saw him begging for Chinese booze at Sampheng.

458
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:23,360
When he's drunk, he likes to brag like the Europeans.

459
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:26,080
You all inspect Captain Sut's ship once again.

460
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:28,760
See if there are any more illegal items.

461
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Yes, sir.

462
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,280
What would you like to do with him?

463
00:34:38,948 --> 00:34:40,320
Leave!

464
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Don't come back to my ship again!

465
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,440
Yes, sir.

466
00:34:59,543 --> 00:35:00,800
Well.

467
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:05,040
You're not his wife, but you got all dreamy-eyed. Should I believe you?

468
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,520
Luang's eyes look no different when he looks at you.

469
00:35:11,887 --> 00:35:15,640
I think he'll buy your freedom soon.

470
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:34,080
I would like to purchase Boonta.

471
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:36,520
Of course.

472
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,160
Her price is

473
00:35:38,895 --> 00:35:40,400
five chang.

474
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,000
I once heard that

475
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,400
when Luang Thukkarat asked to free her,

476
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,280
you told him one chang.

477
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,080
The price has gone up.

478
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,160
Siamese are all cunning.

479
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,252
If you're not okay with this price, it's fine.

480
00:35:59,415 --> 00:36:01,175
She's got other interested buyers.

481
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:15,680
I'll pay a deposit of one chang.

482
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:17,400
When I come back from Singapore,

483
00:36:17,528 --> 00:36:19,528
I'll pay the rest.

484
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,800
You got a deal.

485
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:28,800
I'll send you a contract for the deal.

486
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:34,280
Don't bully her while I'm away. I hope you understand.

487
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:39,920
Yes, sir. I will have her stay in a guest room until you come for her.

488
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:42,480
Consider it a favor from me.

489
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,000
If Luang Thukkarat knows you paid a deposit on Boonta,

490
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,617
he'd surely be furious.

491
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,720
How do they look? My new sandals. How about this?

492
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:08,840
Let's flaunt it.

493
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:13,560
Lamjeak, thank you so much.

494
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,720
I'll keep them well.

495
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:18,080
I promised you anyway.

496
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,280
I just gave money to my mother and sister, so I didn't have much.

497
00:37:22,297 --> 00:37:25,040
It's fine. I love these ones.

498
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:29,163
- Hey, don't! - Don't raise your sandal too high!

499
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,720
Put it down.

500
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:37,720
"See you soon."

501
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,240
"See you."

502
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,880
"What?"

503
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,640
What's with him?

504
00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:01,560
Look at her go. It's too loud.

505
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,560
Did you get everything, Mian?

506
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:05,440
I did, Mother.

507
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:09,360
Who would you like to accompany you tomorrow?

508
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:11,640
I'm coming too.

509
00:38:12,215 --> 00:38:13,920
You just went to the market, right?

510
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:16,240
You like walking around and hanging out?

511
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:18,967
If she wants to come, she can come.

512
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,520
She just got here, and she's your favorite?

513
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,880
If you want to be my favorite,

514
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,200
learn to behave, Lamduan.

515
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,720
If Boonta stayed, she would have nothing to do.

516
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,720
I'd rather have her with me so I can watch her.

517
00:38:58,856 --> 00:38:59,960
Lamduan!

518
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:03,920
Lamduan.

519
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,640
What's wrong with you, Lamduan?

520
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,880
I don't like how Mother is biased.

521
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:13,120
She never lets up on me like she does Boonta.

522
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,240
So stop trying to run away.

523
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,440
She'll favor you more that way.

524
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,720
I know you don't want to work,

525
00:39:23,055 --> 00:39:24,800
but do you want to die here?

526
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:27,200
The more you try to run,

527
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:29,304
the more Mother punishes you.

528
00:39:30,343 --> 00:39:33,320
I'm trying to work and save up to buy your freedom.

529
00:39:33,728 --> 00:39:35,400
Please be patient.

530
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:38,320
You don't have to comfort me.

531
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:41,000
I can't see it ever happening.

532
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:19,600
Pikul, Gaysorn, Dokgaew.

533
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:30,560
Good morning.

534
00:40:31,383 --> 00:40:32,600
Dokgaew.

535
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,960
Say good morning to your man.

536
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:45,440
They meet at the temple again. This is looking like destiny.

537
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,280
Gaysorn wants to make merits, so I invited her.

538
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,600
Let's get inside the hall, then.

539
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,600
If we're late, it could be hard to find seating.

540
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:01,720
Yes.

541
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,640
Chaai, please take care of your woman.

542
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,920
- Come on, Pikul, Gaysorn. - Come on.

543
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,360
Is that true?

544
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,440
Boonta, arrange the sweets carefully.

545
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:54,560
Do it again.

546
00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:00,200
Fang's brothel.

547
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:18,335
Sorry. I was looking elsewhere.

548
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:20,200
It's fine.

549
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,120
I was careless.

550
00:42:24,784 --> 00:42:26,520
It's crowded today.

551
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:05,543
Boonta.

552
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,280
Do you see your favorite guest?

553
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:14,031
Who's with Luang Thukkarat?

554
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,480
She's pretty.

555
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,240
She's definitely his lover.

556
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,200
They look so good together.

557
00:43:23,823 --> 00:43:25,000
Boonta.

558
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,120
Don't be sad.

559
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:29,280
Who's sad?

560
00:43:30,104 --> 00:43:32,280
He and I are not a couple.

561
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,560
Those women

562
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:00,672
usually go to Wat Sampleum, right?

563
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,960
Why are they here today?

564
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,000
They think making merits all around town

565
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,120
would make people forget they're vile women.

566
00:44:11,104 --> 00:44:13,360
Come on, Pikul, Gaysorn.

567
00:44:13,535 --> 00:44:16,480
You're here to make merits and clear your mind.

568
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,920
Don't let your emotions cloud you so early.

569
00:44:20,496 --> 00:44:21,656
Yes.

570
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:11,968
What's wrong with you? Stay still.

571
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:15,240
It's nothing.

572
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,960
I just noticed Mother likes to make merits.

573
00:45:22,783 --> 00:45:24,040
She always does.

574
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:26,959
She bought robes for the monks so often that I got used to dying them.

575
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,720
Making merits to make up for the sins of human trafficking?

576
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,200
Boonta, you're saying nonsense!

577
00:45:37,304 --> 00:45:38,720
You're accusing Mother.

578
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:42,920
It's true. She does human trafficking where they don't consent.

579
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:45,143
Of course she fears hell.

580
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,320
Hey, we're in a temple!

581
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,720
Chor.

582
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,320
Chor.

583
00:46:01,832 --> 00:46:03,160
Are you alright?

584
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:08,080
I'm just worried about Lamduan.

585
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,960
She suddenly got too sick to come.

586
00:46:11,592 --> 00:46:14,280
Let her rest for a day. She'll get better.

587
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,120
Don't worry.

588
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,200
You girls should be quiet.

589
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:19,760
The monks are coming.

590
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,240
Monk Chang is doing well.

591
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:44,520
I'm relieved.

592
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:47,280
Today, I'm here to make merits.

593
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:54,520
They said

594
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,560
those who give lanterns to monks

595
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,583
receive a great merit.

596
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,400
Lights will guide them.

597
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:02,919
Whatever trouble they face,

598
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:05,127
they will make it through.

599
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,800
Let me join your merit.

600
00:47:15,944 --> 00:47:18,920
They said giving robes to monks

601
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:22,040
would make you rich with clothing and accessories.

602
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,200
You will be respected wherever you go.

603
00:47:25,328 --> 00:47:27,328
People will acknowledge you.

604
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,280
So, she's making up for her sins.

605
00:47:35,511 --> 00:47:37,160
It is as she says.

606
00:47:37,248 --> 00:47:39,560
You're making merits for popularity.

607
00:47:51,144 --> 00:47:54,120
They said giving fans to monks

608
00:47:54,462 --> 00:47:57,360
will help blow away bad things.

609
00:47:58,248 --> 00:48:00,480
There will be no trouble in your life.

610
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:05,280
Your children will not cause you any suffering.

611
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:14,280
They said giving umbrellas to monks

612
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,840
will make your life peaceful

613
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,520
even in "hard times of bad luck,"

614
00:48:19,632 --> 00:48:22,760
miracles will happen and turn your fortune around.

615
00:48:34,983 --> 00:48:37,680
That's enough, Mother. That's enough, Miss Fang.

616
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,480
Giving a lot doesn't mean a higher merit.

617
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,680
It's about your intentions.

618
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,400
If you have good intentions,

619
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,320
you mean no harm, you don't expect results, then you will get merits.

620
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,600
You girls wait outside.

621
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,560
I'll talk to the Abbot.

622
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,720
Let's hit the bell in the pagoda.

623
00:49:18,072 --> 00:49:19,200
Let's go.

624
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,320
Let the angels know we're here today.

625
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,279
You hit the bell to tell the angels?

626
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,720
I thought it was just for luck and noise.

627
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,360
Let's go.

628
00:49:40,158 --> 00:49:41,280
Come on.

629
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,600
Chaai.

630
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:50,607
Stay and talk to your brother.

631
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:54,280
I would like to discuss what to do for your father's death anniversary.

632
00:50:05,767 --> 00:50:07,280
Miss Gaysorn.

633
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:08,880
Did you see her?

634
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,520
She didn't even take one look at you.

635
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:16,720
I need to teach her a lesson.

636
00:50:30,503 --> 00:50:31,800
Boonta.

637
00:50:32,175 --> 00:50:33,680
My master is leaving.

638
00:50:33,975 --> 00:50:36,480
Wipe her feet and put on her shoes.

639
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:40,600
Why don't you do it yourself?

640
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,920
You're her servant, aren't you?

641
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:47,600
Smart mouth! You've been a courtesan for a few days, yet you got cocky!

642
00:50:47,727 --> 00:50:51,520
- Take off your sash and wipe her feet with it! - That hurts!

643
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,560
Let go of my girl!

644
00:50:57,856 --> 00:50:59,856
Boonta, stand up.

645
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:02,143
You're not her servant anymore.

646
00:51:03,007 --> 00:51:05,200
The Mother herself is protecting this girl.

647
00:51:06,455 --> 00:51:08,455
She made you a lot of money, huh?

648
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,360
No wonder.

649
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:13,360
You're too old to work yourself.

650
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,640
That's why you need a replacement.

651
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,640
Muean.

652
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:21,840
What were the temple kids singing?

653
00:51:22,968 --> 00:51:24,720
They were singing...

654
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,610
"Fak sells curry, and Fang sells..."

655
00:51:26,743 --> 00:51:29,360
She sells whatever she wants, right?

656
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
Is she selling them in your front yard or what?

657
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,040
She's working an honest job.

658
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,000
Some women don't have a choice.

659
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,080
If they choose this work, it's their right.

660
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,120
They have their honor and pride, and they're humans.

661
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:47,879
What's going on, Gaysorn?

662
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:49,480
What is this vile woman

663
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,800
doing to my sister?

664
00:51:50,904 --> 00:51:52,360
Hey, old hag!

665
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,305
Don't play a victim here.

666
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,640
We're the ones getting harassed.

667
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,560
"Me too," you know?

668
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,640
I'll tell you something.

669
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,520
You are just born lucky to live a good life, unlike us.

670
00:52:06,664 --> 00:52:08,880
You should have sympathy for fellow women.

671
00:52:08,968 --> 00:52:10,880
Instead, you looked down on us.

672
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,040
If you call yourself a noble with that behavior

673
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,600
and that kind of manners,

674
00:52:15,728 --> 00:52:17,120
I'd rather be a whore.

675
00:52:19,032 --> 00:52:20,800
Let's go, Mother.

676
00:52:28,192 --> 00:52:29,800
Watch your steps, Mother.

677
00:52:40,895 --> 00:52:42,280
What's wrong?

678
00:52:42,736 --> 00:52:46,320
How did you come up with that? Your brain worked like a noble there.

679
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:48,360
That's thanks to my manager.

680
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:51,160
She wants to create my image of a good, smart girl.

681
00:52:51,295 --> 00:52:52,880
She's afraid I'd screw things up.

682
00:52:52,976 --> 00:52:54,047
What are you talking about?

683
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:57,680
Forget it. At least you're a way better person than them.

684
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:02,040
Too bad you're a courtesan. You would've been a good match for Luang.

685
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,560
- Really? - Yeah.

686
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,520
Preach.

687
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,880
Those women

688
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,320
are so vile. They harass people even in a temple.

689
00:53:13,615 --> 00:53:16,200
She dared to do that in front of you, Chaai.

690
00:53:16,687 --> 00:53:19,800
Your servant started the fight.

691
00:53:20,215 --> 00:53:22,520
Chaai, are you taking their side?

692
00:53:23,192 --> 00:53:24,800
I speak of what I saw.

693
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,480
I think she was right.

694
00:53:27,863 --> 00:53:29,280
Rich or poor,

695
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,295
any occupation doesn't matter. They're humans too.

696
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:32,720
We shouldn't look down on anyone.

697
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,240
Please take care of yourself, Gaysorn.

698
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:55,479
You're giving birth soon.

699
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,775
Keep your mind at peace.

700
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,040
If the mother is in a good state of mind,

701
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,600
the child will be healthy and obedient.

702
00:54:04,296 --> 00:54:07,080
Forget about what happened today.

703
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,280
Yes.

704
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,160
I'll try to think that

705
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,800
she and I live in a different world now.

706
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,320
I'll take my leave. See you later.

707
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,680
What happened with Boonta today,

708
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:48,720
my husband must never know.

709
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,400
Yes, ma'am.

710
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,360
Mother.

711
00:54:53,568 --> 00:54:56,160
Who was it that Aunt spoke of?

712
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,520
She seemed to hate that person so much.

713
00:54:59,111 --> 00:55:01,560
It's Boonta, the defiant one.

714
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,640
You don't remember her.

715
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,769
During the incident, you were with His Majesty.

716
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:12,200
It was this girl.

717
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,560
She poisoned your Aunt Gaysorn and almost gave her a miscarriage.

718
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,720
Thank you so much, Mother,

719
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,280
for taking her off me.

720
00:55:29,623 --> 00:55:32,480
You're one of my girls. Of course, I'd save you.

721
00:55:33,046 --> 00:55:34,680
You were so calm.

722
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,280
They were "bullying" us.

723
00:55:37,985 --> 00:55:40,160
They were insulting us.

724
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,480
I wasn't calm.

725
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:43,480
You just spoke my mind.

726
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,175
I couldn't stand it.

727
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:46,639
The way they insulted us

728
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,800
without knowing anything about us.

729
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:51,240
I may not have been here for long,

730
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:55,720
but I think every one of us here is not a bad person.

731
00:55:56,711 --> 00:55:58,680
Does that include me?

732
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,600
Well, Mother. You're cruel

733
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:07,720
and scary. But I think you have your reasons for that.

734
00:56:12,431 --> 00:56:14,280
I have good news for you.

735
00:56:14,768 --> 00:56:17,560
You don't have to service our guests anymore.

736
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,280
Really?

737
00:56:20,614 --> 00:56:22,720
All I did was stand up for myself,

738
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,080
and you rewarded me, Mother?

739
00:56:26,118 --> 00:56:28,400
Don't get too excited.

740
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:32,240
You don't have to work because someone bought your freedom.

741
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,000
Who bought my freedom?

742
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:41,480
Don't tell me it was James.

743
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:55,840
Why did you buy my freedom?

744
00:56:56,865 --> 00:56:58,120
Because

745
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,480
I like you.

746
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,320
I want to marry you.

747
00:57:09,445 --> 00:57:10,960
Wait, sir.

748
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:12,280
Well...

749
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:14,560
I know

750
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,640
I'm cute and sexy, and I can rap.

751
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,480
But isn't it too soon, sir?

752
00:57:21,975 --> 00:57:24,320
This is a marriage we're talking about.

753
00:57:26,592 --> 00:57:28,240
If you think it's too soon,

754
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,960
you can give me your answer later.

755
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:36,520
I'm traveling to Singapore.

756
00:57:37,312 --> 00:57:39,120
While I'm away,

757
00:57:39,968 --> 00:57:42,840
I would like you to consider

758
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,080
if you can open up your heart for me.

759
00:57:47,696 --> 00:57:49,696
If we get married,

760
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,280
you don't have to stay here.

761
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:11,240
What? Captain Jon bought your freedom?

762
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,600
Not yet. He just paid one chang as deposit.

763
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:17,881
He will pay the rest once he comes back from Singapore.

764
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,520
I'm really happy for you, Boonta.

765
00:58:22,871 --> 00:58:24,871
Not having to work is great.

766
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,160
But

767
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,240
how much can I trust him?

768
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,160
From what I've seen, I think he's a good man.

769
00:58:32,295 --> 00:58:35,120
When he comes, he never asks us to serve him.

770
00:58:35,776 --> 00:58:38,520
He spent one night with you and decided to buy your freedom.

771
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:46,000
When will San buy my freedom too?

772
00:58:48,569 --> 00:58:50,920
He was the one who sold you to this place.

773
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,720
Why would he buy your freedom?

774
00:58:54,112 --> 00:58:58,440
Pudsorn! It's you and your mouth! That's why you'll never be anyone's wife!

775
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,640
Such a smart mouth, Lamjeak!

776
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,024
Not just my mouth! My hands and feet are good too! Do you want to try it?

777
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:04,791
Bring it on! Come on!

778
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:08,520
- What are you standing there for? Bring it! - Everyone!

779
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:10,400
Has anyone seen Lamduan?

780
00:59:10,512 --> 00:59:11,720
What?

781
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:14,023
It's Lamduan.

782
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,960
What's your answer?

783
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,000
I don't think you can trust a European.

784
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,560
All they think about is trading and exploiting us.

785
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,640
If he buys you, he becomes your master.

786
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,520
Are you asking me or asking yourself?

787
00:59:39,816 --> 00:59:41,840
Are you still working at Fang's brothel?

788
00:59:46,575 --> 00:59:47,960
How did I know him?

789
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,080
You once lived in his house.

790
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:52,280
Why won't she just die?

791
00:59:52,377 --> 00:59:54,520
Let me go!

792
00:59:55,752 --> 00:59:57,200
Let me go!

793
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:01,840
Lamduan!

794
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:03,240
Lamduan!

795
01:00:03,344 --> 01:00:05,080
Are you suspecting Fang?

796
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:06,880
She threatened to kill me.

797
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,399
I'll find the evidence

798
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,680
to prove that Fang had Lamduan killed.
