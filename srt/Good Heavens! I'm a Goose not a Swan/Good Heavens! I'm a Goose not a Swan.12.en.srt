1
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,045
They had history, yet Mrs. Gaysorn

2
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,040
still hired Boonta to her house.

3
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,640
She even allowed her to search

4
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,319
for a chest that contained gold.

5
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:38,880
Could it be that what happened was what this courtesan described?

6
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,033
I did it because I felt angry on my master's behalf.

7
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:44,800
I couldn't stand seeing Boonta stealing my master's husband, Your Honor.

8
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:46,840
What would be her punishment, Your Honor?

9
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,840
Fifty flogging with a leather whip!

10
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,040
Where is this solar eclipse taking you?

11
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:53,520
Wherever it is,

12
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,938
I have to go on my own way.

13
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,160
But you're going your way without me.

14
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,800
How would I live then?

15
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,240
Boonta!

16
00:03:08,194 --> 00:03:11,000
If you would do anything to kill her,

17
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:13,680
I'll do anything to save her myself!

18
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Muean.

19
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:43,200
Thank you so much for saving me.

20
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,688
This is nothing to me, Master.

21
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:50,920
It's a shame Boonta was acquitted.

22
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,720
It's her.

23
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
She's the reason you got hurt.

24
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,280
You did that to yourself.

25
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:02,320
Yet you still dare to blame someone else?

26
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,120
You couldn't just sit still.

27
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:14,760
You just had to go and embarrass yourself.

28
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,600
Are you really

29
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,600
the wife that I'm supposed to honor?

30
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,480
You're the reason behind everything.

31
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:24,960
I did all of this because of you!

32
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,480
What did I do?

33
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,480
You think I don't know?

34
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:34,023
You do your business.

35
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,040
You got rich and became a magnate.

36
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,903
Yet you have no ranks or titles.

37
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,560
You married me for my status, didn't you?

38
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:51,840
Ever since I got married to you,

39
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:55,360
I have always let you have your ways.

40
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:01,680
But you had to take Boonta in and trample all over my heart!

41
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,720
You are saying that I owe you.

42
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:15,760
I don't dare say that, dear.

43
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,760
I just want to warn you.

44
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,200
Don't be too shameless with these things.

45
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,400
You still need me, after all.

46
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,440
If I'm still here,

47
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,560
- Boonta will never step foot... - Fine! Try it!

48
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,800
We'll see what happens.

49
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,888
(If you're willing to outbid him, )

50
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,720
(I'll sell you to her.)

51
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,640
How much?

52
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,200
Ten chang, sir.

53
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:47,640
You greedy pimp.

54
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,440
You're trying to extort me.

55
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:55,560
You think someone will always protect you?

56
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:08,512
Oh, Boon...

57
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:10,960
How long have you been here?

58
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:13,720
Since last night.

59
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,160
Don't tell me you all slept here?

60
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:18,760
Well...

61
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,520
You slept like a baby.

62
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,120
I think you should sleep a bit more.

63
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:24,560
Yeah. Sleep a bit more.

64
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:27,160
You woke up so late.

65
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,720
I think you're good now.

66
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:37,400
I said I'm fine. Don't worry.

67
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm fine.

68
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,640
Don't worry.

69
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm taking a bath.

70
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,840
A bath?

71
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Hey.

72
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,360
Are we all taking a bath together?

73
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:13,960
It's hot.

74
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,560
Making beds made me sweat all over. I need a bath.

75
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:19,800
I want to wash my body.

76
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,680
I want to wash my hair.

77
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
Let's take a bath together.

78
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:33,400
What's wrong with them?

79
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,656
Is the water cool?

80
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:46,160
Come on.

81
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:48,680
You see? Those girls

82
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,840
were afraid you'd drown yourself again if you were left alone.

83
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:54,400
I know they're worried,

84
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,920
but I'm not drowning myself again.

85
00:09:57,024 --> 00:09:59,783
Drowning myself at this point won't do a thing anyway.

86
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,560
That's why I have to stay in this body.

87
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:04,160
I need to survive.

88
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,440
Good. You finally realized that.

89
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:09,600
Oh, my death!

90
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm going to die because of you.

91
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,440
Why did you brake so suddenly?

92
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:19,240
Are you still thinking about killing yourself?

93
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,520
- No. - What do you mean "no?"

94
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:25,022
You were talking about dying just now.

95
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:29,080
Luang, sir. It's good to see you.

96
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:31,600
Please help me convince her.

97
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:35,840
- What's wrong, Aunt? - What about you?

98
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,400
Just go and see your man.

99
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,280
Maybe you can stop being sad

100
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:44,640
and stop thinking about dying.

101
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
Please help convince her, sir.

102
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,360
Mr. Husband.

103
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,540
Aunt!

104
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:56,200
Wait, Aunt.

105
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,895
I already said my farewell.

106
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,440
How am I supposed to act now?

107
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,920
What's that, sir?

108
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,440
Pay me back for your hairpin

109
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,600
and pay for my shirt that you took and sewn.

110
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:30,632
Wait, sir.

111
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,920
Are you collecting debt?

112
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,640
That's why

113
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:38,920
you can't run and disappear from me again

114
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:41,895
until you pay your debt off.

115
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,560
What's that? You're supposed to give flowers or a gift to a sad person.

116
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:51,840
But what did you do? Who collects debt in this situation?

117
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,360
I don't want you to leave me again.

118
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,280
Even if I want to, I can't leave now, sir.

119
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,720
So that's a promise.

120
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,391
These are geese.

121
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,600
You said you were a goose, didn't you?

122
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:31,720
I knew you'd like this.

123
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:35,200
I may not know where your home is.

124
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:37,192
But here,

125
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll be your home.

126
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,280
I can't go home anyway, so

127
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,960
I'll stay here

128
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:54,880
and be happy in my new home.

129
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,200
What did you do?

130
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,400
Thank you for being there for me.

131
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:12,320
After all the trouble I put you through,

132
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:14,960
you still

133
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,200
won't give up.

134
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,120
Now you've won me over.

135
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,080
Let's start over together.

136
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,480
You love me?

137
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:34,520
So we're finally lovers.

138
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,880
Wait a minute, sir.

139
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,880
We're in a "chatting" phase.

140
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:41,480
"Chatting?"

141
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:46,200
You mean when you're chatting with me like this?

142
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:52,440
It's not just about the weather

143
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:54,800
or saying hello or those kind of things.

144
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,400
We need to chat about

145
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:58,017
what we have in common and what we like

146
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,280
and learn about each other.

147
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:03,240
It feels a bit complicated, but

148
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,535
it's quite special.

149
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,840
So am I your special one or not?

150
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:19,800
A special one can kiss, right?

151
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:24,280
Yes, sir.

152
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:27,440
So I can do the same thing you did.

153
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,200
Hey...

154
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:48,240
This side too.

155
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,216
Here too.

156
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:27,640
(Episode 12: This World is Harsh... But With "BBQ," We're Fine)

157
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,663
As a thank you to all guests

158
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,000
who visit Fang's Courtesan House again tonight,

159
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:03,560
I'm happy to give you free booze

160
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,600
on the house!

161
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,640
Fab, fab, fab!

162
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh, Luang.

163
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:40,240
You're not in disguise tonight?

164
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,895
I don't think he's here to hang out.

165
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:44,240
He came in uniform.

166
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,120
I think he's here for an arrest.

167
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:49,880
The whole unit's here.

168
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:52,062
We've received an anonymous report

169
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:54,152
that you sell illegal liquor here.

170
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,880
I'm here to investigate.

171
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:12,207
Over there.

172
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,647
Get in.

173
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:33,760
These jars of liquor

174
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,720
were bought from my frequent brewery.

175
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,320
But last time, you used to serve

176
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,120
a strange-looking liquor, right?

177
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,320
Screw me!

178
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:45,689
Aunt, did I get us in trouble?

179
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:52,800
If that's the case, feel free to search, sir.

180
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,551
These jars are from Heng's Brewery.

181
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,228
But these look like fake copies, sir.

182
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,320
Take Fang in for questioning.

183
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:37,440
Mother?

184
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:54,017
- Mother. - Ming?

185
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:58,160
How did it go, Ming?

186
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,064
I tried to reach out to the officers

187
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,840
who promised to have your back, as you said.

188
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:06,040
No one is willing to help, Mother.

189
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:08,280
Jerks.

190
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:10,544
They only treated me well when they wanted my money.

191
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:13,280
Yet when I'm in trouble, they never help.

192
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:15,160
Please don't worry, Mother.

193
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:18,440
Boonta volunteered to help with Luang Thukkarat.

194
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,731
Rumors spread fast.

195
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,840
The whole Sampheng knows now

196
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:33,480
that Fang's serves counterfeit booze.

197
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
That's right.

198
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
Mother is in custody.

199
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:39,680
Guests are flocking to other brothels.

200
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:43,680
What should we do to fix this?

201
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:45,960
What can we do

202
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:47,520
except wait?

203
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:49,280
Wait?

204
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,400
If we want to win this cleanly,

205
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:56,560
we have to wait for the investigation to show that Mother is innocent.

206
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,932
Fang's is known as the best courtesan house in town.

207
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:04,520
Its reputation has been flawless.

208
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:08,400
Could it be that it's a setup?

209
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:11,080
Right? I'm thinking the same thing.

210
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:14,240
Someone definitely sets Mother Fang up to frame her.

211
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,000
Who do you suspect?

212
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,040
Magnate Thong, sir.

213
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,800
It's because of Magnate Thong

214
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,120
that I'm in here.

215
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,400
Magnate Thong?

216
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:37,056
He found out my father was going to win the bid for bird nest tax.

217
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,680
So he asked the Liquor Taxmaster

218
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:43,040
to tell the police my father brewed illegal booze.

219
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,520
My family's entire wealth was seized.

220
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:49,960
My parents and I got in jail.

221
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,120
This "case"

222
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,040
is exactly the same as Orn's family's "case."

223
00:20:57,455 --> 00:21:01,000
It's also the same as when Bua was caught selling sugar.

224
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,880
There's no doubt. It's Magnate Thong, sir.

225
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,720
I visited Mother Fang. When I was leaving,

226
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,440
I saw Magnate Thong

227
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,200
approaching her in jail, sir.

228
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,760
Magnate Thong?

229
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,320
I never thought

230
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:57,680
the owner of a courtesan house like you would be in this predicament.

231
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:01,880
You came all the way to visit me.

232
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:05,280
I don't think you're here just to see me.

233
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm just here to tell you something.

234
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:11,920
After you got arrested,

235
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:14,440
your brothel went quiet.

236
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:21,312
If you don't get acquitted soon,

237
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:23,440
if this drags on,

238
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:27,160
I'm afraid your brothel will have to close down soon.

239
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:30,320
You're telling me this

240
00:22:30,463 --> 00:22:31,960
for what, sir?

241
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:37,600
I just want to help, seeing as we're well acquainted.

242
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:42,120
If you agree

243
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,640
to sell Boonta to me for a cheaper price,

244
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:49,551
I would be happy to be your witness.

245
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:55,360
How dare he use such a dirty trick?

246
00:22:55,481 --> 00:22:56,680
I won't let this go.

247
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,960
I'll find evidence to acquit Fang myself.

248
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,000
Luang.

249
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,080
I'll help too.

250
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,960
You can trust me.

251
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:09,120
A lead, diva, and main character like me

252
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:11,840
have made a lot of money.

253
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:14,440
I'll make Fang's brothel popular again

254
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,800
without spending a single cent of Magnate Thong's money.

255
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,432
You said we had to wait?

256
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:31,000
Let the police work the case, but we have to deal with this crisis.

257
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,040
We have to seize our customers back.

258
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:39,240
If we can't sell booze,

259
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,280
we will sell something else.

260
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:44,200
Something else?

261
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:48,680
Something new and unusual.

262
00:23:58,752 --> 00:24:01,680
- You mean... - Are we going to do a harem?

263
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:05,480
Not that!

264
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:10,240
I mean, we have to do something better.

265
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,200
This is "soft power."

266
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:15,200
This is our national dish.

267
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,440
Thank you, ma'am.

268
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:43,920
Take it back.

269
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,640
Will Mother be angry

270
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:06,440
if she finds out?

271
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,040
She won't be mad

272
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,800
if I make this

273
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,400
become ten times more.

274
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:24,291
Here.

275
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,949
What are you going to do with these things?

276
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:35,023
If Karaked can do it,

277
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:38,640
I, Boonta, can do it too.

278
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,040
Yeah. I hope so.

279
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:44,066
If you can't make that money back, Mother's going to kill you.

280
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:47,400
Okay!

281
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,960
Thank you.

282
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:07,920
Is it done?

283
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,240
This is a "buffet."

284
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,920
This is the menu we proudly present.

285
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:15,600
It's all-you-can-eat.

286
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,640
Everything on the menu for one price.

287
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,120
Wait.

288
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,000
What are you so proud of?

289
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:24,760
I haven't seen a single guest.

290
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,024
Are you sure this will sell?

291
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,520
You know only the Chinese like to eat pork.

292
00:28:29,672 --> 00:28:31,160
Rest easy, girls.

293
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,160
Before the "grand opening,"

294
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,720
we need a "soft opening."

295
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,920
Please come in.

296
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:46,560
- There they are! - Oh? It's the Luangs.

297
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,400
- We've got guests. - Yes, sirs.

298
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:52,080
But one's got a wife. One's just left monkhood.

299
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:54,480
What a group of guests we have.

300
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:58,199
Music on.

301
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:13,320
Have you heard of this "buppay?"

302
00:29:14,856 --> 00:29:18,920
- It's a "buffet." - "Buffet."

303
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:22,000
Grilled meat?

304
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,080
Are we going to grill meat

305
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:26,800
on this thing?

306
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:28,280
Yes, sir.

307
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,680
We have carefully selected the ingredients.

308
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,160
It's good and clean. It's all-you-can-eat.

309
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:37,200
So...

310
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,880
How...

311
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:43,960
How do we eat this?

312
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,400
You can grill the meat with nothing,

313
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:49,760
or with Mala, or with cheese and butter.

314
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:52,600
If you can't find cheese and butter, it's fine.

315
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,800
Our specially marinated pork will do.

316
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:58,280
But before you start,

317
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:00,680
you have to grease the grill.

318
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,920
So the meat won't stick.

319
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,400
Wait until the pork is cooked.

320
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,800
This is our special soup, sirs.

321
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:30,480
We have vegetables too.

322
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,880
Dip it in our special sauce.

323
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,160
That's Fang's specialty.

324
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,200
Come on.

325
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:49,320
Blow on it. It's still hot.

326
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,096
Say "ah," sir.

327
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:01,840
How is it, sirs? Oh yeah. Follow it with kimchi, sirs.

328
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,400
Or any other side dishes.

329
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,040
That's not raw pork, right?

330
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:10,880
- Follow it up, sir. - "Ah."

331
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:19,360
You barely have to do anything.

332
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:24,640
Just sit and eat. We've got you taken care of, sirs.

333
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:15,671
Boonta.

334
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:19,851
Your plan to draw guests in is working!

335
00:32:19,932 --> 00:32:24,240
Doesn't it? For Thais, the only thing better than superstition

336
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:25,720
is "Moo

337
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,240
Kata."

338
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,710
Let me tell you. If I were richer,

339
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:32,560
I would serve it on a belt.

340
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:35,040
That's going to draw even more guests.

341
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,600
We can do that! You wrap it in a leather belt, right?

342
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,120
Not a leather belt.

343
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,040
It's a conveyor belt. It goes like "swoosh."

344
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:49,202
It will arrive at the table without anyone moving. You see?

345
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:50,960
Oh? Boonta.

346
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:53,720
I think I should get some more soup.

347
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:55,720
- Hey. - She's crazy.

348
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:01,920
Get rich. This is it.

349
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:07,120
That thing is popular?

350
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:09,800
The girls at Fang's won't last more than a few days.

351
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:12,680
Fang will have to accept my offer.

352
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:14,960
Are you sure, Master?

353
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:17,840
I see people keep going in and out of Fang's.

354
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,240
Of course I am!

355
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:22,800
I did it twice against Ard and Tan.

356
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,000
She's just a courtesan house owner.

357
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:27,880
She has no protection. How would she make it out?

358
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,000
What's the matter, Luang?

359
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:46,351
We've received a report

360
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,480
that Fang's brothel sells illegal booze.

361
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,960
The booze that was sent to her place

362
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:52,360
was from your brewery.

363
00:33:53,544 --> 00:33:54,960
You're definitely mistaken.

364
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,320
I have my license.

365
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:58,840
I pay taxes and do everything by the book.

366
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,440
If that's the case,

367
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:02,320
let us search your brewery.

368
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:32,800
Thai people and booze are inseparable.

369
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:36,960
They were not drunkards back in the day.

370
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:40,680
So, what did they drink back in the day?

371
00:34:41,495 --> 00:34:43,495
Water and tea, of course.

372
00:34:44,872 --> 00:34:46,440
It wasn't until the Chinese came.

373
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:47,959
They built breweries.

374
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,480
They monopolized liquor and became taxmasters themselves.

375
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,640
That's how booze becomes widespread.

376
00:34:57,287 --> 00:34:58,320
So, does that mean

377
00:34:58,503 --> 00:35:00,960
monopoly started in this era?

378
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,640
Well, things are tempting.

379
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,779
Everyone knows that if you're the Liquor Taxmaster,

380
00:35:06,914 --> 00:35:09,680
you can monopoly everything from building a brewery

381
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:12,800
to all the trade in your own areas.

382
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,680
They're set for life!

383
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:19,520
So small-time brewers have no chance then.

384
00:35:19,672 --> 00:35:21,360
Who would dare?

385
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:24,920
Everyone knows that the Liquor Taxmaster

386
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,960
has the authority to punish illegal brewers.

387
00:35:27,184 --> 00:35:29,440
If you're caught brewing illegally,

388
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,440
you're sent to the police.

389
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,680
It's a punishable crime, and they can fine you.

390
00:35:35,205 --> 00:35:36,640
So that's why!

391
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,200
Magnate Thong used the crime of non-existent booze

392
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:43,040
- and took down Orn's family like it was nothing! - Really?

393
00:35:44,248 --> 00:35:45,960
I knew it.

394
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,120
What did you say they brew?

395
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:50,040
Non-existent booze?

396
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,640
What brewery does it?

397
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:02,240
We searched all over. There is no liquor described in the report, sirs.

398
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:08,640
However, Ming and Mian

399
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,640
said they had received liquor from Heng's staff.

400
00:36:12,408 --> 00:36:13,880
If it didn't come from here,

401
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:15,760
where could it have come from?

402
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:21,680
Could it be that the jars were swapped on the way?

403
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,680
Who was the staff who delivered to Fang's that night?

404
00:36:28,615 --> 00:36:30,000
It was Sang, sir.

405
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,040
Where is he?

406
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,680
He's been gone for days.

407
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,520
All I know is he lives around Khlong Rong Mai, sir.

408
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,640
- Take him in. - Yes, sir.

409
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:50,240
Stop!

410
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,464
After him!

411
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,600
Yod, come on!

412
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,280
Stop!

413
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:19,640
Stop!

414
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:47,760
Tell me the truth. Did you deliver fake booze to Fang's?

415
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:59,588
What brought you here so early, Luang?

416
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:06,680
This won't take long.

417
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,807
We just need you to come in to give your statement

418
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:13,320
about the report that Fang's serve illegal booze.

419
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:18,960
You'd better not be accusing me.

420
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:23,575
I have no involvement or conflict with anyone there.

421
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,360
Why would I do that?

422
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:27,760
If that's the case,

423
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:31,000
what about this gambler?

424
00:38:35,952 --> 00:38:37,600
Are you involved with him in any way?

425
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:45,840
Who is this?

426
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,120
I don't know him.

427
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:51,120
He named your household in his statement.

428
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,960
What did my staff do?

429
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:04,600
Your staff

430
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:06,960
asked to buy Heng's liquor

431
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,560
from Sang that night.

432
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,760
What do you want?

433
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,720
Come.

434
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,520
Why are you standing in my way?

435
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,160
Move it.

436
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:37,240
I can't be late for Fang's delivery.

437
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
I don't want to miss the casino tonight.

438
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:42,000
Then sell this delivery to me

439
00:39:45,328 --> 00:39:46,560
and go gambling.

440
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,040
I'll deliver this batch for you.

441
00:39:55,328 --> 00:39:57,760
Is that him? There he is, Ming.

442
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,239
I'm here, Aunt.

443
00:39:59,503 --> 00:40:00,920
Come on.

444
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:08,640
See?

445
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,680
This is all.

446
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:17,640
Ming.

447
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:19,120
Take it to the back.

448
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,400
Yes, Aunt.

449
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,880
You two, follow me.

450
00:40:56,265 --> 00:40:58,920
(Fang's Brothel in Sampheng is serving illegal liquor)

451
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:02,080
(and opium in secret, please investigate soon.)

452
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:04,176
Your staff swapped out the liquor

453
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:06,840
and left an anonymous report

454
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,080
to the police himself.

455
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,553
Do you still deny

456
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,520
your involvement in this matter?

457
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,200
Luang, sir?

458
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:37,560
What about Mother?

459
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:41,440
Mother!

460
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:43,120
Mother.

461
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:48,519
- Mother! - Young Miss Kleeb.

462
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:49,840
Kleeb, sweetie.

463
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:52,720
I miss you so much, Mother.

464
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,160
I miss you more than anything, sweetie.

465
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,600
Thank you so much for helping me, sir.

466
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,200
We're just doing our job.

467
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,240
I owe you anyway, sir.

468
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:09,120
If you're biased against me as other officers,

469
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:11,375
I would have never been acquitted.

470
00:42:15,056 --> 00:42:19,960
Thank all of you too, for taking care of my place.

471
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:21,560
Yes, Mother.

472
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:24,960
I'm just trying to repay you for helping me.

473
00:42:25,648 --> 00:42:27,440
When I was in jail,

474
00:42:27,863 --> 00:42:31,120
I genuinely felt jail was truly hell for us.

475
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:35,040
Now, do you realize

476
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,720
why Mother agreed to buy you off of them?

477
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:43,600
Look, you were either going to jail or getting sold to another brothel.

478
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,640
There is no happier place for us, Boonta.

479
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Agreed.

480
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:51,160
But I think

481
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,200
Mother bought you for profit.

482
00:42:56,246 --> 00:42:59,040
Would someone like Mother let a chance to make money slip?

483
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,040
Are you accusing me of being greedy?

484
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,200
You're getting it.

485
00:43:10,063 --> 00:43:12,840
What were you doing with these grills?

486
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:17,640
Boonta borrowed your money and started a BBQ business, Mother.

487
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:22,360
Boonta! You turned my brothel into a grill place?

488
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,200
But I made your money back, Mother, with profit too!

489
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:29,400
Here. Take a look, Mother.

490
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:36,960
What exactly have you done?

491
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:39,000
How did you make so much?

492
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:43,960
You need this too, Mother.

493
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,920
- Thanks, Aunt. - It's our soup.

494
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:49,200
Let's eat. Get this piece.

495
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:53,060
Is mine done?

496
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:56,480
It sure looks strange but tempting.

497
00:43:57,111 --> 00:44:00,440
So this is what Chang and Chim praised so much.

498
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,920
It doesn't just look good, sir.

499
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,017
It tastes so good your mouth lights up. It's the best in town.

500
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,320
If you get a taste, you're going to want more.

501
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:17,240
For you, Mother. Have this piece. It's done.

502
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,520
Eat it with kimchi.

503
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,760
Dip it in this, Mother.

504
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:29,080
Young Miss, this is for you.

505
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:30,648
Wow.

506
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:41,840
How is it, Mother?

507
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:45,720
It's... not bad.

508
00:44:46,896 --> 00:44:48,440
Keeping your cool, huh?

509
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:55,320
Oh!

510
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,040
It's so good my mouth lights up!

511
00:44:58,016 --> 00:45:00,280
It surely is the best in town!

512
00:45:00,776 --> 00:45:02,360
Is that right?

513
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,400
Mother.

514
00:45:04,824 --> 00:45:08,400
We have two Luangs from the police force who "guarantee" it's good.

515
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,320
- I think it's time for the second branch. - Yeah.

516
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:15,440
Don't take it too far, Boonta.

517
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,360
Have you asked us at all?

518
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:19,880
We're working hard enough to serve the guests.

519
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,280
Do I still have to carry these heavy grills around?

520
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,160
Pudsorn can speak for herself,

521
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,880
but I'll do anything if it makes money.

522
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:30,487
- Me too. - Me too.

523
00:45:31,215 --> 00:45:33,480
Me too. I have a family to provide for.

524
00:45:34,496 --> 00:45:36,000
That's almost unanimous.

525
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,640
Perhaps it's time to hang up your boobs and work these grills, Pudsorn.

526
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:41,080
Aunt!

527
00:45:42,922 --> 00:45:44,160
That's great.

528
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,680
Stop smiling and eat something.

529
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,200
If you don't stop smiling,

530
00:45:56,368 --> 00:45:58,160
Chaai will be too distracted

531
00:45:58,336 --> 00:45:59,920
to eat anything.

532
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,480
I'm happy, sir,

533
00:46:03,568 --> 00:46:05,920
that you and Chaai saved our Mother.

534
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,400
Otherwise, Fang's Brothel would never have been this lively.

535
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:14,880
Agreed. By now, the suspect is probably getting what he deserves, right?

536
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,240
He will

537
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,400
because he's not just facing your case

538
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,520
but other cases as well.

539
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:31,360
With evidence this solid,

540
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,200
do you still deny it, Magnate?

541
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:40,000
So it is now confirmed that

542
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,600
Magnate Thong and his slave

543
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:44,160
set up Fang and accused her

544
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,080
of serving illegal liquor, which is false.

545
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,240
You also forged a false report to Tralakarn.

546
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:53,200
With this false accusation,

547
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:55,799
you're punishable by up to 50 flogging with a leather whip

548
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,840
and up to four times fine.

549
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:00,840
Write a report to the jury

550
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:02,952
and confirm their punishment.

551
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:05,831
I did not intend to cause chaos.

552
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:08,224
I just wanted to teach the brothel owner a lesson.

553
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,840
That is all, Your Honor.

554
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:13,000
Moreover, this is my first offense.

555
00:47:13,383 --> 00:47:15,024
Please have mercy.

556
00:47:15,744 --> 00:47:18,440
First offense, you say?

557
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,440
This is not the only case you're facing.

558
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,040
What do you mean?

559
00:47:41,835 --> 00:47:43,440
Master...

560
00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:12,080
Master.

561
00:48:57,616 --> 00:48:58,960
Watch your steps, ma'am.

562
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,520
Thank you so much for helping me out.

563
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,480
I won't bring trouble to you and our family again.

564
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,800
Then stop trying to take Boonta in as a wife.

565
00:49:41,536 --> 00:49:43,760
What does Boonta have to do with this?

566
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:49,960
You think I'm so stupid I couldn't see?

567
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,640
That you're doing all you're doing

568
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:54,608
because you want her!

569
00:49:56,457 --> 00:49:58,800
You ended up in the jail she went to.

570
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,760
Isn't that what you wanted?

571
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,760
I know I made a mistake.

572
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,560
Just don't exaggerate, please.

573
00:50:06,824 --> 00:50:08,680
If you don't care about your honor,

574
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,464
please care about your child's,

575
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:14,680
and my honor when I went to the jail pregnant!

576
00:50:19,743 --> 00:50:21,960
The people are going to talk

577
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:25,640
about how a Magnate became so helpless

578
00:50:25,975 --> 00:50:28,640
- that he needed his wife to protect him! - Gaysorn!

579
00:50:33,134 --> 00:50:34,320
Muean?

580
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:42,560
I've helped you for the last time.

581
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,400
If you cross the line for Boonta again,

582
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,800
I'll let you deal with the consequences of your own actions.

583
00:51:11,687 --> 00:51:13,224
It's all because of you, Chaai.

584
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:17,360
I'll make your life a living hell!

585
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:22,360
You made me fight Captain Jam.

586
00:51:22,575 --> 00:51:25,040
Yet you dare ask me to hire you?

587
00:51:25,943 --> 00:51:27,320
It was all my fault.

588
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:29,120
I did it because I was greedy.

589
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:31,920
I promise I'll never do it again.

590
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,220
What about how Captain Sut fired you

591
00:51:34,464 --> 00:51:36,560
for smuggling opium in his ship?

592
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:39,960
You expect me to hire you to bring me troubles?

593
00:51:41,176 --> 00:51:42,440
Magnate!

594
00:51:42,655 --> 00:51:44,280
I'm done with that.

595
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,560
I swear I'd never do it again.

596
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:51,175
Navigating is not the only thing I can do.

597
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:54,720
I'm capable

598
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,800
of news hunting too.

599
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,160
Is that so?

600
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,672
If your news proves interesting,

601
00:52:15,025 --> 00:52:16,320
I'll hire you.

602
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:33,160
Someone give me more booze!

603
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:34,880
Make it quick.

604
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:38,720
Why are you drinking so much today?

605
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:42,240
I have money!

606
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,200
I'm going to drink all the booze in this place.

607
00:52:45,759 --> 00:52:47,560
I'll also visit Fang's.

608
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:52,239
How did you get so much money?

609
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,280
By working, of course.

610
00:52:57,935 --> 00:52:59,520
A drunkard like you?

611
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,400
You don't have the strength to work.

612
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:05,000
My job

613
00:53:05,112 --> 00:53:06,971
does not require strength

614
00:53:07,112 --> 00:53:08,960
like you manual laborers.

615
00:53:09,598 --> 00:53:12,800
All I do is trade secrets for money.

616
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,040
What secret?

617
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,400
Are you sure you weren't so drunk you heard things?

618
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,800
I wasn't drunk.

619
00:53:27,526 --> 00:53:30,800
I heard Sarang saying that with my own ears.

620
00:53:31,638 --> 00:53:33,400
Didn't they say Captain Henry

621
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:35,880
came to do business in trade?

622
00:53:36,248 --> 00:53:38,080
Why would he bring a battleship?

623
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,800
But that Sarang guy

624
00:53:40,881 --> 00:53:43,360
used to work on the ship Guardian.

625
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:46,000
His news is solid.

626
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:50,160
The Europeans invaded Inn-wa before.

627
00:53:51,488 --> 00:53:53,000
They can take their fleet

628
00:53:53,176 --> 00:53:54,560
to invade us too.

629
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:56,232
What are you talking about?

630
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,600
The people have been saying the Europeans are invading us with battleships.

631
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:06,840
Those captains used their businesses as a front.

632
00:54:07,303 --> 00:54:09,400
They were actually here for intel?

633
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,920
Yes, sir.

634
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,640
The whole market has heard this rumor.

635
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,320
The people are panicking.

636
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:21,040
Could it be

637
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:23,280
that what we heard is true?

638
00:54:26,814 --> 00:54:31,920
At this time, the Europeans are close to conquering Inn-wa's Amarapura.

639
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:35,760
If they do beat Inn-wa,

640
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:39,680
the European threat is something we should watch out for.

641
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,520
Perhaps

642
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,680
this is just one of Sarang's lies.

643
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:51,240
Luang, sir.

644
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,120
What are we going to do?

645
00:55:37,527 --> 00:55:38,720
What's wrong?

646
00:55:38,983 --> 00:55:40,983
Can't I get a little touch?

647
00:55:42,975 --> 00:55:44,160
Come here.

648
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:46,640
- What are you doing? - Let go!

649
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,680
I have money!

650
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:51,800
Can't I hang out at the best Courtesan House?

651
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:55,760
- Take him out. - Wait.

652
00:55:58,412 --> 00:56:00,880
Maybe you need a special service.

653
00:56:00,976 --> 00:56:02,720
- I'll get you a girl. - No!

654
00:56:03,415 --> 00:56:06,800
I'm going to sleep with the prettiest courtesan in this place.

655
00:56:11,514 --> 00:56:13,200
I want to sleep with Boonta.

656
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:18,200
If you're here to pick a fight, go back to where you came from, Sarang.

657
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,880
- You... - Wait, sir.

658
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,880
Boonta doesn't accept guests.

659
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,200
Then Pudsorn.

660
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:33,520
Pudsorn is already taken.

661
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:34,840
But...

662
00:56:36,872 --> 00:56:38,280
Lamjeak, sir.

663
00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:41,000
- Lamjeak. - Yes, Mother?

664
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,000
Yes, sir.

665
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:49,120
Come on. I'll take care of you, sir.

666
00:56:49,216 --> 00:56:50,480
Let's go.

667
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,960
Watch your steps. I'll show you to your table.

668
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,800
Boonta. Walk slowly, sir. Let's go.

669
00:56:56,896 --> 00:56:59,840
- What are you looking at? - Sorry, sir.

670
00:57:00,576 --> 00:57:03,680
Keep an eye on him. If anything happens, let me know.

671
00:57:04,023 --> 00:57:05,280
Yes, Mother.

672
00:57:17,152 --> 00:57:19,912
Why did you hire Sarang and pay him a lot

673
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:22,136
to spread the rumor, Master?

674
00:57:23,755 --> 00:57:26,520
Let's give Chaai some work to do.

675
00:57:46,193 --> 00:57:47,520
Drink it! Drink!

676
00:57:48,847 --> 00:57:50,360
I'll teach you a lesson today.

677
00:57:53,582 --> 00:57:55,960
Mother saw you teaching Kleeb to read.

678
00:57:56,056 --> 00:58:00,369
I failed my Thai exam but I know the letters to the T!

679
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,720
What did you write? It looks strange.

680
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:05,800
Help!

681
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:17,080
Whoa!

682
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:24,944
Should we take her to a doctor?

683
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,980
- No. - Madam Gaysorn is giving birth!

684
00:58:29,888 --> 00:58:31,160
The baby's here.
