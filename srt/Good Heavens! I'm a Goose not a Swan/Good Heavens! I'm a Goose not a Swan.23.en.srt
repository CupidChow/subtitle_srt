1
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:27,919
My name is Jeed, or Nittra.

2
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,560
No matter who you are,

3
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:32,120
what your name is, or where you came from,

4
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,869
I'm already in love with you,

5
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,680
and I'll love you forever.

6
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:38,440
When will you accept her, Mother?

7
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:40,680
If the male and female lead get together too easily,

8
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,600
the play won't be exciting.

9
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:44,681
But if there are too many obstacles,

10
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,480
the play can get a bad reception.

11
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,439
The male and female lead

12
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,200
don't always end up together.

13
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,920
You won't be home for days?

14
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
I hope this negotiation

15
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,236
ends well, my dear.

16
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:01,520
It's to remind you of me when you miss me.

17
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
I'll leave Boonta in your care.

18
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
She has been unwell for a few days.

19
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,760
You can go on your mission.

20
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:10,880
No one in this house would be so cruel

21
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:13,080
as to let something happen to Boonta.

22
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:21,387
(Episode 23: Encounter And Farewell)

23
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,280
Take care of yourself.

24
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,960
I'll be home soon.

25
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:34,480
Right.

26
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:37,160
You take care of yourself too.

27
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,760
Has anyone checked on Boonta at the small house?

28
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,040
No, ma'am. Everyone's busy with kitchen work.

29
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:55,240
Then why are you here doing a floral wreath?

30
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:58,200
Go and check on her. See if she's had her meal.

31
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,120
If she has had something, bring her here.

32
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:02,040
Don't let her lie still all day long.

33
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,977
She won't get better that way. Go!

34
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,480
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:11,560
You seem to care about Boonta more than I expected.

36
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,080
Well, Chaai left her in my care.

37
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,440
I've been your son for 23 years.

38
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,040
I know what you think.

39
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,600
If you really despise Boonta,

40
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,863
she wouldn't have been serving you by your side

41
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
from dusk till dawn.

42
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,480
You also refer to her as

43
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,800
Chaai's wife now too.

44
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:47,160
Mother.

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
This play is about to end,

46
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,120
and you still won't let the lead male and female settle down?

47
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,880
If Boonta successfully pulls this off,

48
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,360
I'll accept her as my daughter-in-law.

49
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,720
Are chicken and duck eggs not enough?

50
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,480
Why are we getting lizard eggs?

51
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,360
Are these even good? Ew.

52
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,680
Have you never tried them?

53
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,808
They don't taste like chicken or duck eggs.

54
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,400
Monitor lizard eggs look like jelly when boiled.

55
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,800
Poke a hole in them and soak them in salt water.

56
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,320
And then grill them.

57
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:31,255
And put them in a spicy salad with mangosteen. That's a killer dish.

58
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:32,840
It's Madam Tubtim's favorite.

59
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:34,560
Really? Ew.

60
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,320
Are we done?

61
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:40,360
Why does she want it today?

62
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,520
We even have to take a boat here

63
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:44,960
just to find these lizards' nests and eggs.

64
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,280
It's the season for their eggs.

65
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
But you've been unwell.

66
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,120
Madam Tubtim shouldn't have asked you to come out today.

67
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,600
Usually, several staff would spread out to find some.

68
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:57,240
This time, it's just the two of us.

69
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:59,600
This feels like a setup.

70
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:01,640
I know.

71
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:04,640
This is probably a test for me.

72
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:06,720
If I fail,

73
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,440
she'll use this as an excuse to get Chaai a new wife.

74
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:14,960
I think these should be enough.

75
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:17,471
It's fine even if we don't fill the basket as she ordered.

76
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,960
Really?

77
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:24,239
But since we're here anyway, should we check over there?

78
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:28,824
There, Yam!

79
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:30,480
Give it to me. I got this.

80
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:34,680
Be careful.

81
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,800
Watch out!

82
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:46,200
Boonta!

83
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,960
Boonta!

84
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,280
She's pregnant?

85
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,680
But the child

86
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:27,320
probably won't survive.

87
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:30,280
Mother.

88
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:32,560
Yam, prepare some cordial! Quick!

89
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,920
Don't be sad.

90
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,840
She's still young. She can recover.

91
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:41,720
She can still have another child.

92
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:45,600
I'll give her a haemagogue.

93
00:08:45,976 --> 00:08:47,240
Finish it,

94
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,760
and she will be better.

95
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:56,000
For now,

96
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,040
she needs to rest.

97
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:01,320
Don't let her work too hard.

98
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,080
Thank you so much, doctor.

99
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,520
Chim will be escorting you back.

100
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:11,920
Please.

101
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,200
This way, sir.

102
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:31,880
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,000
I didn't do enough to protect you

104
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:37,960
despite Chaai's request

105
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:39,680
when he left you with us.

106
00:09:44,272 --> 00:09:46,320
This is for the best.

107
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:50,560
If my child had survived,

108
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,160
they would have had to live their life

109
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,440
with a mother who's a courtesan

110
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,640
with an elite grandmother who won't accept them

111
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,200
and always bullies us.

112
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:08,080
If they had to be born into that life,

113
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,400
they shouldn't be born.

114
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:20,040
Easy.

115
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,240
Chang.

116
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:32,840
Please ensure our staff take care of Boonta.

117
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:36,240
She needs proper food to regain strength.

118
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,600
Yes, Mother.

119
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,320
Don't forget to remind Yam

120
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,880
to give Boonta medicine as the doctor instructed.

121
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,320
If she doesn't get better, tell me.

122
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:52,600
I'll get Pra Apairaksa to see her again.

123
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,720
Please don't worry, Mother.

124
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:58,760
You should get some rest too.

125
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,120
I don't want you to get sick too.

126
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:04,680
Do you think I can sleep?

127
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,520
Mother.

128
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,400
Please don't think about it too much.

129
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
If you had known that Boonta

130
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,760
was pregnant with your grandchild,

131
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,080
you wouldn't have let her go out in the weather

132
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:23,960
to get lizard eggs.

133
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,360
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:32,720
I didn't think it'd be this serious.

135
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,680
So why don't you

136
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,944
tell Boonta this?

137
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,400
Tell her you're sorry.

138
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,440
You haven't said a word to her.

139
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
Chang.

140
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,080
Do you expect me to apologize to her in front of the doctor?

141
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:57,240
- She's just... - A courtesan.

142
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:58,840
A slave wife.

143
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:02,560
She's the daughter-in-law you disapprove.

144
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,400
Is she so lowly that she doesn't deserve

145
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
even an apology from you?

146
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,560
After all,

147
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,440
she's the one Chaai loves.

148
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,320
I knew all along

149
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,040
that you don't really despise her anymore.

150
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,680
Please say it to her.

151
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,720
Tell her you're sorry

152
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:40,440
before it's too late to fix anything.

153
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,480
Mother!

154
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,400
This is bad!

155
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:58,120
What's wrong with you? What happened?

156
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,208
We heard from the servants from Luang's house that

157
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,400
Boonta miscarried her child.

158
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:04,680
Really?

159
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:11,991
What are you doing here?

160
00:13:12,263 --> 00:13:13,920
We're here to see Boonta.

161
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:18,720
Mrs. Tubtim, there you are.

162
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,600
Is it true that you tortured my girl into miscarriage?

163
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,718
Nonsense! Madam Tubtim might not adore Boonta,

164
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,720
but she would never do that.

165
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:37,240
She just made her work a bit too hard.

166
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
So she really had a miscarriage!

167
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:43,191
It was an accident. Nobody wanted it to happen.

168
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,400
That's enough!

169
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,583
You deliberately asked her to do risky things,

170
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:51,200
knowing that she's pregnant. It's obvious

171
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,840
that you don't want her child.

172
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:57,760
You were probably afraid his child would get in the way of a new wife.

173
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,640
Madam Tubtim is not that cruel, ma'am.

174
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:03,560
She brought a Royal Doctor to see her

175
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,480
and asked for top-notch medication.

176
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:07,608
Boonta is doing a lot better.

177
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,840
She doesn't have a fever or stomach pain anymore.

178
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:12,920
I didn't do anything you said.

179
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:14,920
I'm truly sorry.

180
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,314
If you want to see Boonta,

181
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,200
Yam will take you to her.

182
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:23,320
If she sees some close friends, she might feel better.

183
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,280
Is she really doing better?

184
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:36,840
Why does she look so pale and depressed?

185
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,400
Boonta.

186
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:46,360
Oh, she's awake.

187
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:50,400
How long have you been here?

188
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:53,440
Are you alright?

189
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:00,080
We just got here.

190
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,640
We heard about what happened.

191
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,040
How are you feeling?

192
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,280
Well...

193
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm fine now,

194
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:12,480
but I'm still

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,360
a bit sad.

196
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:17,400
Boonta.

197
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,390
Don't worry about it too much.

198
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,421
You're still young.

199
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
And so is Luang.

200
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:27,000
You and him can still have many children.

201
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:29,160
Aunt.

202
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,040
We're humans, not dogs and cats.

203
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,520
Yeah, it's the same thing.

204
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,735
With the condition you're in,

205
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,480
will your mother-in-law still let you live here?

206
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,280
I thought you would move to the main house after the wedding.

207
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,240
I'm a slave wife.

208
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:47,495
What can I expect?

209
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:51,400
What about Luang? Where is he?

210
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,160
Why does he let you lie here alone?

211
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,000
Perhaps he doesn't love you anymore?

212
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:58,959
- Is that why he left you alone? - Hey!

213
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,480
What's wrong with you two?

214
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,219
Boonta is still sick.

215
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,295
Why would you keep asking such sensitive things?

216
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:07,560
Aunt.

217
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:10,360
Chaai went on a mission.

218
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,280
He doesn't know what happened.

219
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,080
It will be a while before he comes home.

220
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:15,920
Before this,

221
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,440
has he been taking good care of you?

222
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,800
He has been great to me.

223
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
He...

224
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,360
He gives me whatever I want.

225
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,640
He never raises his voice at me.

226
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
And...

227
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,120
About Mrs. Tubtim,

228
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:39,400
he has been trying everything to convince her.

229
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,960
I told you, didn't I?

230
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,720
I told you to expect this.

231
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,160
Even if the man loves you,

232
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,440
sometimes, he can't protect you,

233
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,288
especially from his own mother.

234
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,640
Boonta.

235
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,920
If you want to cry,

236
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:05,160
just cry your heart out.

237
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,396
Cry and think about it.

238
00:17:08,513 --> 00:17:10,513
Figure out what to do with your life.

239
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:15,720
Look. You survived my punishments multiple times.

240
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,720
If you die to this cruel mother-in-law,

241
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:20,240
I'll take that as an insult!

242
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,680
Boonta.

243
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
If his mother is cruel to you,

244
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,040
you can always come back to Mother Fang's.

245
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:34,720
Don't be afraid to get bullied.

246
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:36,680
You're legally a free woman.

247
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,000
Nobody has the right to bully you.

248
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,400
(You will be my one and only beloved wife.)

249
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:52,632
(I promise.)

250
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm in charge of this house!

251
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,920
If I disapprove, none of you

252
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,200
can ever live in this house!

253
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,280
I can protect the people,

254
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,760
but if I can't protect my wife from my own mother,

255
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,520
how can I protect anyone else again?

256
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,960
(If his mother is cruel to you, )

257
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
you can always come back to Mother Fang's.

258
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,520
Don't be afraid to get bullied.

259
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
You're legally a free woman.

260
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:23,880
Nobody has the right to bully you.

261
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:03,600
Her expression doesn't look good.

262
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,760
She finally got married and lived a comfortable life.

263
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:08,520
What karma brought her to this?

264
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:09,680
It's alright.

265
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,760
We can visit her again.

266
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:15,080
She has survived dozens of things.

267
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:17,360
She will survive this too.

268
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:20,960
Now that we're here let's make merit for Boonta.

269
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,640
Let's hope the merit inspires her mother-in-law to stop bullying her.

270
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:27,040
Yes, Mother. Let's go.

271
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,760
Ubasika Fang.

272
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,160
Yes?

273
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,360
I forgot that

274
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:42,512
both of your names are Fang.

275
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,760
You share the same name and preference for making merit.

276
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,880
What are you two doing here today?

277
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:53,280
I would like to discuss building a temple.

278
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,800
You have the same idea, don't you?

279
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,200
What's wrong?

280
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:04,520
Well, I too would like to build a temple.

281
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:06,320
However...

282
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,840
You told me if I needed help,

283
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,680
I could always come to you.

284
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,040
I'm glad

285
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,720
you thought of me.

286
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:25,160
I didn't want to go to Fang's.

287
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,520
I'm afraid everyone would be worried.

288
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:31,200
In a few days,

289
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,560
I'm going to sail to Singapore.

290
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:35,440
I'll return

291
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:36,960
next month.

292
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:39,720
You can use this place as you please,

293
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:45,600
but I don't think you would hide forever, right?

294
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:05,600
Chaai.

295
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:12,892
(To my dear Chaai, I need to take a short break.)

296
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,800
(I'll come back when I feel better.)

297
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,720
It was an accident.

298
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,000
Mother is genuinely feeling guilty.

299
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:34,120
Please don't blame her.

300
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:40,120
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:42,520
I didn't mean it.

302
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:46,856
I asked our servants to look for her

303
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:48,800
in places I thought she would go to.

304
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:50,480
She isn't at Fang's,

305
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,680
Dokgaew's,

306
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,400
or Puek's house.

307
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,360
We couldn't find her.

308
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:04,920
Chaai.

309
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
Please calm your mind.

310
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:09,624
Boonta doesn't have anywhere to go.

311
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:12,040
Once she feels better,

312
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,400
she will come back.

313
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,040
She will come back?

314
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:24,200
Boonta, who sold herself as a slave

315
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,350
but wouldn't escape slavery by becoming Magnate Thong's wife

316
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:36,304
and, wouldn't accept my help.

317
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,840
She'd rather be a courtesan.

318
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:46,600
The strong and resolute Boonta

319
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:50,680
will never come back to this place.

320
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:00,360
You know it well, Mother,

321
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:06,720
that Boonta is my one and only beloved wife.

322
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:13,400
She doesn't have anywhere to go.

323
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,400
Yet you were still cruel to her

324
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:27,080
and to my child.

325
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:32,480
You made me lose both my child

326
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:35,720
and my wife.

327
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,120
Are you satisfied now?

328
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,840
I've seen European women

329
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:15,960
who suffered miscarriages.

330
00:25:17,143 --> 00:25:19,800
They have a hard time coping too.

331
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:26,320
I don't intend to drive you away,

332
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,920
but if you stay here until you feel better

333
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:33,895
and you still love your Luang,

334
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,400
please talk to him and figure it out.

335
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:44,840
Even if I love him,

336
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,320
I'd still be despised and bullied every day.

337
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:53,520
I never even heard an apology from her.

338
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,320
It's hard, sir,

339
00:25:57,584 --> 00:25:59,320
to stay there without

340
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,664
feeling anything.

341
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:05,880
So you won't regret it

342
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,800
if this is your decision?

343
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,208
I don't know either.

344
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:16,760
I don't want to think about anything right now.

345
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,320
I'll decide later, sir.

346
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:21,080
If so,

347
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:24,320
please don't dwell on it.

348
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:26,520
On this side is a Portuguese community.

349
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,160
There are lots of European products in the market here.

350
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,560
If you want to take your mind off of things,

351
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:37,040
I will take you there.

352
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,480
Chinese cane from Bang Yai! Thai cane from Bang Khuwat!

353
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,160
Wat Rakhang's sticky rice cake.

354
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,160
We have European snacks from Kudi Chin too!

355
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,249
Here.

356
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:11,600
Do you like it?

357
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:13,640
I do, sir. It's good.

358
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:17,480
So, would you like to bring some back to Luang?

359
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,120
I don't think you would stay here for long.

360
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,791
You and he just got married.

361
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:26,120
You're newlyweds.

362
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:28,520
You can't stand being away from him too long.

363
00:27:30,224 --> 00:27:34,640
But I think you should give some to Pudsorn, my friend.

364
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,520
You'll be in Singapore for a month, right?

365
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,800
Give her something to remind her of you.

366
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,440
That's a good idea.

367
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,440
I think Pudsorn will like it too.

368
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:49,520
Would you like snacks? Thai and European! Fresh and hot!

369
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,520
How did it go?

370
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,719
Luang went looking for Boonta everywhere.

371
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,800
He crossed to the other side

372
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,560
but didn't find her.

373
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,640
I'm sorry.

374
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,840
I kept my bias against Boonta.

375
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:40,200
That's why such a terrible thing happened.

376
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,440
I actually found her lovely,

377
00:28:44,712 --> 00:28:47,160
just as you and everyone else said.

378
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:49,520
But I...

379
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
I still asked her to go out

380
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,760
and cost you your child.

381
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,200
You lost your wife.

382
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,120
Now, I

383
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:05,080
am about to lose my beloved son.

384
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,840
I can't sleep because of guilt.

385
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:15,280
My apology

386
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,320
will never make up for it.

387
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,200
And I

388
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:23,160
don't know how to make it up to Boonta.

389
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:29,160
I'll give her this now.

390
00:29:31,863 --> 00:29:33,280
I've prepared this

391
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,920
for the day I approve her as my daughter-in-law.

392
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
If you find her,

393
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,640
please give it to her for me.

394
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:00,855
Thank you so much, Mother.

395
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,760
I used to think

396
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,800
about that day.

397
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,600
Had I not purchased sugar from your mother,

398
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,320
how would your life have turned out?

399
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,560
If it weren't for me back then,

400
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:29,680
you wouldn't be sitting here.

401
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:34,840
But if you hadn't negotiated for my freedom

402
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:38,200
and given me this temporary shelter,

403
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,680
I wouldn't have been alive today either.

404
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,560
So it's not Pudsorn.

405
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,680
You're with Boonta?

406
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:53,160
You took Luang Thukkarat's beloved wife and hid her here.

407
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,080
Does that mean you intend never to set foot in Siam again?

408
00:30:57,668 --> 00:31:02,040
Who would have thought? People saw you take one of Fang's courtesan here.

409
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:04,200
That's why I came to see for myself.

410
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
I didn't expect to find Boonta here.

411
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,840
Boonta only came here to stay for a while.

412
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:14,447
You're such a gentleman.

413
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,920
If I were you,

414
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,000
I'd have made love with her.

415
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,320
I don't have feelings for Boonta anymore.

416
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,280
We are friends.

417
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,240
Of course!

418
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:28,120
Now you're infatuated with Pudsorn instead.

419
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,080
Luang Thukkarat is probably going crazy thinking of his wife.

420
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:36,800
Just you wait. Once that Luang finds out about this,

421
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:38,920
he's going to take you to jail.

422
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:40,440
If you don't tell him,

423
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,320
how would he know?

424
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:48,480
Don't worry, sir.

425
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,320
Boonta didn't say she left for good.

426
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:53,560
She said she needed a break.

427
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,960
Wherever her heart is,

428
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:58,940
she will come back to that place.

429
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:06,480
I hope so.

430
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:07,840
Yes, sir.

431
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,600
A fight right in the market? Don't you respect the law at all?

432
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,337
He took my products without paying!

433
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,117
Would you expect me to let him go?

434
00:32:24,198 --> 00:32:25,320
Stop!

435
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:27,727
You have no right to assault him.

436
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:30,760
If you want your money, you can complain to the police.

437
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:33,289
That's too complicated!

438
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,640
What is so complicated?

439
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,800
We have a deal in place.

440
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:38,280
You must keep up your end.

441
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:41,080
If this merchant commits a breach of contract,

442
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:42,920
he will pay you both for the products

443
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:44,280
and fine.

444
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:46,960
What about him assaulting me, sir?

445
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,680
He will be fined by the law too.

446
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,440
- But I don't... - If you don't abide by the law

447
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:53,838
and our tradition

448
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,400
as your people agreed,

449
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,160
the treaty means nothing.

450
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:00,376
Isn't that right, Captain?

451
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:10,800
I know you're an honest man,

452
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,400
but if you let me off just this once,

453
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,240
I have something important to tell you too.

454
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:18,880
I heard you lost your own heart.

455
00:33:19,304 --> 00:33:20,960
Don't you want it back?

456
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,160
Do you mean Boonta?

457
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,840
Where have you seen her?

458
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,120
Seeing as you agreed to help me,

459
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:37,600
I'll tell you.

460
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,880
Try hanging out around Kudi Chin,

461
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:44,320
you might find her.

462
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:47,191
Luang!

463
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:53,103
Luang Thukkarat is too busy to take care of you,

464
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:56,200
but Luang Vasuthep isn't, sir.

465
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,040
Please come and pay your fine, Captain.

466
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:21,168
Captain Jon, are you here

467
00:34:21,864 --> 00:34:23,864
to take your place back?

468
00:34:29,552 --> 00:34:31,440
I'm here to take you back.

469
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:02,520
I heard about you and our child.

470
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,600
It almost killed me.

471
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:08,440
When I came home, and you weren't there, my heart was broken.

472
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:14,560
I'm also sad

473
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:16,680
about our child.

474
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:22,440
I know nobody wanted it to happen.

475
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:27,328
But it wasn't easy to cope.

476
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:45,800
I understand.

477
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,640
I'm sad our child wouldn't get to live with us,

478
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,840
but don't take too long to grieve.

479
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,360
I believe

480
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,560
that if they're destined for us,

481
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:08,520
they will be reborn as our children.

482
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:16,560
I think

483
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:20,800
that day would never come.

484
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,480
I think it will.

485
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:35,231
This ring...

486
00:36:35,384 --> 00:36:38,680
My mother wanted to give you this when she approves of you.

487
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:41,280
She didn't get the chance to.

488
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,000
She said she was sorry for everything.

489
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,280
She promised to never stand in our way again

490
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,240
if you come back.

491
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:03,480
Please come back with me.

492
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,640
My dear Boonta.

493
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:19,440
Siamese

494
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:21,687
might believe in reincarnation.

495
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,680
But I don't.

496
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:26,400
When this life ends,

497
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,120
everything ends.

498
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,720
Why don't you live this life

499
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:34,440
and enjoy it?

500
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:37,440
The person you're waiting for

501
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:39,480
is standing right in front of you.

502
00:37:40,783 --> 00:37:42,600
Don't hesitate anymore.

503
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,240
Thank you for everything, sir.

504
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:54,120
Have a safe trip, Captain. See you again.

505
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,360
Someone once told me that

506
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,200
our lives

507
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:01,520
are like the wind

508
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:03,240
and not the water.

509
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:07,800
Someday, we will meet again.

510
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,252
Let's go.

511
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,314
- "Bye-bye." - "Bye-bye."

512
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:25,720
- "See you." - "Take care."

513
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:26,880
"You too."

514
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,015
"Bye."

515
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,840
Dear, if you didn't find me,

516
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:48,880
what would you do?

517
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:52,960
We're meant to be together. We will end up together.

518
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:56,440
If I don't find you in this life, I'll find you in the next.

519
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,200
Wow. Next life, really?

520
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:02,951
Won't it be too long to wait?

521
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't care how long I have to wait.

522
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:10,487
I will never love anyone

523
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,320
but you.

524
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,640
I'm like this goose.

525
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,640
He will only have one mate.

526
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:25,200
If he loses his mate,

527
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,440
he will stay single forever.

528
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:32,920
That won't do, my dear.

529
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:35,749
I won't let you live your whole life in regret.

530
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,480
Then don't run from me again.

531
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,960
I don't want to die of heartbreak at a young age.

532
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:37,800
Boonta!

533
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,320
She's awake.

534
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,840
Doctor! The patient is awake!

535
00:43:13,903 --> 00:43:15,920
How is Jeed, Doctor?

536
00:43:17,248 --> 00:43:18,808
The patient has regained consciousness.

537
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,840
She responded well. There is no brain damage.

538
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:23,680
She might be a little confused.

539
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,560
If she adapts and recovers,

540
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:27,656
there's a good chance she can go back to her normal life.

541
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,520
Yes. Thank you, doctor.

542
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:34,440
Jeed.

543
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
You're really lucky, Jeed.

544
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,640
When you fell into the water,

545
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,800
it took several minutes to get you out.

546
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,480
I thought you would die, you know?

547
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,280
I remember

548
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,240
I was in a boat, and I fell off.

549
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:07,200
That was the day of fitting, right?

550
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:08,720
That's right.

551
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,866
But by the time they found you and took you back out,

552
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:13,640
you had stopped breathing.

553
00:44:14,248 --> 00:44:16,960
My breath almost stopped with yours.

554
00:44:17,185 --> 00:44:18,960
They did CPR,

555
00:44:19,112 --> 00:44:21,552
and you were breathing again.

556
00:44:21,656 --> 00:44:24,200
And then you were transported here.

557
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:26,680
I feel like

558
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,120
I slept for longer than that.

559
00:44:30,783 --> 00:44:31,960
Slept?

560
00:44:33,144 --> 00:44:35,520
Let's take your blood sample and BP.

561
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:42,248
Chor, Nual?

562
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,640
Who are you calling for, Jeed?

563
00:44:51,879 --> 00:44:53,879
Why do you seem confused?

564
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,440
It's normal for a patient who just woke up.

565
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,360
Aunt Mian?

566
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,040
That's not me.

567
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:09,760
This is expected.

568
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:12,480
She's still dizzy and confused.

569
00:45:14,207 --> 00:45:15,760
Thank you.

570
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,520
Jeed!

571
00:45:22,824 --> 00:45:24,280
What's wrong?

572
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,160
I don't know what's wrong with me.

573
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:31,000
I see images flashing in my head.

574
00:45:31,664 --> 00:45:33,200
What images?

575
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:37,600
Images of

576
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:40,263
me wearing a traditional costume.

577
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,880
It felt so real.

578
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,041
So real that it frightens me.

579
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:48,240
It's like

580
00:45:48,855 --> 00:45:51,880
I really traveled back in time.

581
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,256
Jeed.

582
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,960
You had these things. The staff said

583
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,760
these weren't their props.

584
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,610
I don't know how you got these.

585
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:11,600
You took these things out of the water with you.

586
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,720
I kept it for you.

587
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:29,200
(We're meant to be together. We will end up together.)

588
00:46:29,439 --> 00:46:32,320
(If I don't find you in this life, I'll find you in the next.)

589
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:34,600
(Next life, really?)

590
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:37,320
(Won't it be too long to wait?)

591
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:39,320
(I don't care how long I have to wait.)

592
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:41,600
I will never love anyone

593
00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:43,240
but you.

594
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:14,720
You were planning to buy a new house.

595
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,520
You worked hard to save up to buy a house, didn't you?

596
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:22,720
Why did you change your mind and choose this place?

597
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,800
I don't know either.

598
00:47:27,495 --> 00:47:30,200
I suddenly wanted to live by the river.

599
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,400
Perhaps my home in my past life was around here.

600
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,920
Jeed.

601
00:47:36,424 --> 00:47:38,120
Ever since you woke up,

602
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:40,680
I think you've changed.

603
00:47:45,135 --> 00:47:48,440
I guess I'm "New Jeed" now.

604
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:54,520
You're probably right, "New Jeed."

605
00:47:56,061 --> 00:47:58,640
You're doing your homework and research.

606
00:48:01,928 --> 00:48:03,840
The remake of "Love Destiny"

607
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,320
is set in the Ayutthaya Era, doesn't it?

608
00:48:06,464 --> 00:48:08,600
What does it have to do with King Rama III's era?

609
00:48:09,617 --> 00:48:13,000
Boom, you have something urgent, don't you? You need to beat the traffic.

610
00:48:13,097 --> 00:48:14,496
Oh, this...

611
00:48:14,888 --> 00:48:16,800
- You have to go. - That's right.

612
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:19,360
Look, don't forget to read your script.

613
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,880
I'm going to get a thank-you gift for the one who saved you.

614
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,040
"On the 23rd, I found out about Sarang

615
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,440
who worked on a ship called the Guardian. He's a drunkard thug.

616
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,360
He committed a crime and left the ship."

617
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:42,040
Sarang?

618
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,940
"On the 31st of March, a government officer and Pra Thukkarat

619
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,280
visited me and informed me that

620
00:49:02,487 --> 00:49:05,360
Pra Thukkarat was about to make the trip

621
00:49:05,503 --> 00:49:08,240
back to the little river tomorrow morning.

622
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,160
He was also assigned to hold my book."

623
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,320
Pra Thukkarat?

624
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:18,800
Is it someone else with the same name?

625
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,400
(They forced us to do cockfighting.)

626
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:31,640
The next-door neighbor

627
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,520
is blasting their TV too loud.

628
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,200
I'm dealing with it.

629
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,720
(These cocks are aggressive.)

630
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,240
(That's a lot of sins.)

631
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,120
(Make merit sometimes.)

632
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,480
Coming...

633
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:52,080
Is there anything wrong?

634
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,040
I don't really want a problem,

635
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:57,760
but we're neighbors, and I've tolerated it for hours.

636
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,360
I know you have a TV.

637
00:50:00,616 --> 00:50:02,920
You're probably a good person. Good at heart.

638
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,001
But don't be generous with your TV shows.

639
00:50:10,312 --> 00:50:11,760
That sounds familiar.

640
00:50:12,628 --> 00:50:14,440
What are you watching?

641
00:50:15,864 --> 00:50:17,024
Hey!

642
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,680
Hey!

643
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:21,520
- (Hello?) - Whoa!

644
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,160
(I'll be there. Wait for me.)

645
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:32,040
Are you one of my fans?

646
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,350
Then just blast it out loud, or

647
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,194
you can get a soundbar.

648
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,839
This show is good. The actress is cute. We won lots of awards.

649
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,480
You have to share this with everyone.

650
00:50:42,856 --> 00:50:44,200
What's wrong, Chad?

651
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,280
A celebrity?

652
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:50,720
It's nothing.

653
00:50:50,856 --> 00:50:53,280
I blasted it too loud, so she was annoyed.

654
00:51:07,863 --> 00:51:09,640
Sorry again, Miss Jeed.

655
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:21,320
That's the one who saved you!

656
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:24,640
Jeed, he's the man!

657
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,640
I bought this gift basket for you to give him.

658
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,120
Now that he's here

659
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,920
let's say thank you to him now. Give it to him.

660
00:51:33,311 --> 00:51:34,480
Okay.

661
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,400
Wait. Let me take a photo.

662
00:51:41,151 --> 00:51:42,880
I'm taking it now.

663
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,720
Boy, please move.

664
00:51:49,456 --> 00:51:51,680
- Do you mean me? - Yeah.

665
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,000
Okay.

666
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:55,640
That's the shot.

667
00:51:55,752 --> 00:51:57,680
Closer together.

668
00:52:00,648 --> 00:52:03,880
One, two, cheese!

669
00:52:05,855 --> 00:52:08,560
Your real life is even better than TV shows!

670
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,840
Ever since you saved her, you've been in love.

671
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:13,640
You have been her fan.

672
00:52:14,623 --> 00:52:16,520
You watch her every show.

673
00:52:16,919 --> 00:52:18,720
You watch every program she's on.

674
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,640
I think you could have memorized her interviews by now.

675
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,720
And now what? She became our neighbor?

676
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,000
It seems like my friend is winning big!

677
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:32,080
What are you babbling about?

678
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:35,680
Don't try to play it cool, Chad.

679
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,520
Hey, how does it feel?

680
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:40,720
To meet the girl of your dream again.

681
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,520
I'll be waiting

682
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,744
to see the day a fan like you

683
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:48,640
becomes her boyfriend, right?

684
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:54,000
What are you imagining?

685
00:52:54,328 --> 00:52:55,648
You're getting your own ideas now.

686
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,640
I haven't figured out anything yet.

687
00:52:58,487 --> 00:53:00,400
Then figure it out.

688
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:02,680
What are you waiting for?

689
00:53:03,784 --> 00:53:05,664
Are you waiting for your mom to cut the ribbon?

690
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,400
This is your chance. There's only a wall between you.

691
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,400
If you don't make a move on her now,

692
00:53:11,453 --> 00:53:13,360
you're going to see her with a rich boy.

693
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,840
Do I have to teach you this?

694
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,600
Let me formally introduce myself.

695
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,720
My name is Chad.

696
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,840
I'm a detective in the Department of Special Investigation.

697
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:34,520
(You were a police in your past life.)

698
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:36,080
(And you're in DSI in this life.)

699
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,920
(He looks the same and does the same job.)

700
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,240
(This is surely him, right?)

701
00:53:41,439 --> 00:53:44,560
I previously contacted you, Ms. Nittra Boonyajirakul,

702
00:53:44,944 --> 00:53:47,280
for information on a Ponzi scheme case.

703
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,120
You had an accident before we had the chance.

704
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:51,920
That's why you're here today.

705
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:53,696
Right.

706
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,640
What is your relationship with him?

707
00:54:02,078 --> 00:54:06,440
Well, we're just friends in the business.

708
00:54:06,552 --> 00:54:10,840
I took a picture with him because I was promoting his restaurant.

709
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:12,760
I'm not his partner.

710
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,360
As for my status,

711
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,240
I'm totally single, sir.

712
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:23,800
- Jeed. - Yes?

713
00:54:23,991 --> 00:54:26,840
You treated the staff to Moo Krata on the first day on set?

714
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:30,040
- You're too generous! - Come on, Boom.

715
00:54:30,264 --> 00:54:33,280
We don't do much on the first day. It's the best time, right?

716
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:35,600
- Yes! - That's right!

717
00:54:35,681 --> 00:54:37,040
Exactly!

718
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,040
Who's calling?

719
00:54:41,176 --> 00:54:42,640
You can't hide your smile now.

720
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,720
Your boyfriend? Is it the one in the rumors?

721
00:54:47,935 --> 00:54:51,120
I'm in the chatting phase. Soon, I'll be her boyfriend.

722
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:56,160
- What a reveal! - What are you doing?

723
00:54:57,876 --> 00:55:02,240
We're at the chatting phase now, but it won't take long.

724
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:08,240
Boom, I have to go.

725
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:09,360
See you over there.

726
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,760
- Leaving already? What about the BBQ? - Yeah. Bye.

727
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:15,222
- Goodbye. Bye, guys! - See you!

728
00:55:15,303 --> 00:55:17,999
You look good together!

729
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,880
This pork is great!

730
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,360
I noticed you like bubble milk tea.

731
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,520
I think you haven't tried this place yet.

732
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,800
You know me well.

733
00:55:30,144 --> 00:55:32,144
Good afternoon! For today,

734
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,698
we have a recommended item!

735
00:55:33,779 --> 00:55:36,520
It's our signature!

736
00:55:44,479 --> 00:55:45,800
What would you like?

737
00:55:48,663 --> 00:55:49,840
What would you like?

738
00:55:51,269 --> 00:55:52,480
Anything.

739
00:55:52,576 --> 00:55:54,576
Give us everything that's great!

740
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,720
- Of course! - Okay. Coming right up.

742
00:56:21,342 --> 00:56:23,607
Mrs. Feungrat, good afternoon.

743
00:56:23,705 --> 00:56:24,864
Good afternoon.

744
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,240
Good afternoon, Ms. Jeed.

745
00:56:41,504 --> 00:56:42,840
Good afternoon, Mother.

746
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,160
Good afternoon.

747
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,360
Right.

748
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,680
Mrs. Feungrat is the head of the For Friends Foundation.

749
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,960
She arranged this exhibition.

750
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:58,000
Our foundation helps sex workers.

751
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,080
We're fighting for equal rights and the same protection as other jobs.

752
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:06,960
They're laborers too. They're humans like everyone in the society.

753
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,400
In the past,

754
00:57:11,576 --> 00:57:13,720
they did this job because they didn't have a choice.

755
00:57:13,801 --> 00:57:15,400
But now,

756
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:17,583
they do it out of necessity, right?

757
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,880
"My body, my choice."

758
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,160
Right. That's why we try to legalize it.

759
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,600
So they can work safely.

760
00:57:29,768 --> 00:57:32,880
We might not be able to form a labor union like other countries,

761
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:34,680
but we're pushing it.

762
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,600
There is no union for the film set crews.

763
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,360
It would be weird if there were one for this job.

764
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,880
I don't know if we can make it happen in this lifetime.

765
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,960
But we're trying.

766
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,640
At least, it can only get better, right?

767
00:57:51,432 --> 00:57:53,080
Thank you so much

768
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,720
for helping them.

769
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,200
I just do what I want and what I can do.

770
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:02,920
So,

771
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,560
I'll do what I can too.

772
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:08,440
I'll ask the writer

773
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:10,640
to add these stories to my shows.

774
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,720
I think it should help a little.

775
00:58:14,768 --> 00:58:16,440
Thank you so much.

776
00:58:17,344 --> 00:58:20,000
When Boom told me Ms. Jeed was coming,

777
00:58:20,328 --> 00:58:22,822
I really wanted to meet you.

778
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:24,640
I don't know why.

779
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:29,360
You're every bit as great as I hoped.

780
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,640
I'm glad to meet you.

781
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,800
I'm glad to meet you again too.

782
00:58:57,464 --> 00:58:59,560
Is this your ring?

783
00:59:02,984 --> 00:59:04,400
Where did you get this ring?

784
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:09,360
It's passed down in my family.

785
00:59:10,415 --> 00:59:13,120
I don't know who it belonged to. My mother just gave me this.

786
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:17,600
It's Luang Thukkarat's.

787
00:59:19,175 --> 00:59:20,600
How do you know?

788
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:23,160
I met him.

789
00:59:23,696 --> 00:59:24,960
You met him?

790
00:59:28,374 --> 00:59:30,560
I mean, I read about him in a book.

791
00:59:33,214 --> 00:59:34,720
I didn't know

792
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:36,824
that my family's history

793
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,880
was written in a book.

794
00:59:39,654 --> 00:59:43,039
There are many stories in this world that we don't know.

795
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,520
Honestly,

796
00:59:48,158 --> 00:59:51,120
I feel strangely attached to this ring.

797
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:54,439
That's why I want to keep it on my finger.

798
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,160
If you hold my hand like this,

799
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,520
I'm not letting go.

800
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,800
Can we move on from the chatting phase

801
01:00:13,271 --> 01:00:14,480
to dating now?

802
01:00:17,856 --> 01:00:19,280
What's that?

803
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:22,040
We're in a temple, you know?

804
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,400
Would you be willing to listen

805
01:00:30,095 --> 01:00:32,080
if I say something cheesy?

806
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,760
I fell in love the moment I saw you.

807
01:00:40,023 --> 01:00:42,000
I felt familiar with you.

808
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,160
It's like we've met before.

809
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,240
I felt the same way too.

810
01:00:49,223 --> 01:00:51,640
You've been on my mind since

811
01:00:51,832 --> 01:00:53,192
the moment I opened my eyes.

812
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:55,680
That's a lie.

813
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,680
You were unconscious when I saved you.

814
01:00:59,471 --> 01:01:00,471
Well...

815
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,520
I saw you in my dream.

816
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,880
Maybe we were together in a past life.

817
01:01:07,248 --> 01:01:08,960
I think you do too many period dramas.

818
01:01:09,072 --> 01:01:10,200
Hey, look.

819
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,320
Real life is more unpredictable than TV shows.

820
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:16,360
(I used to think)

821
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:20,360
(that being thrown through time without knowing anything)

822
01:01:21,088 --> 01:01:23,080
(meant I was being sent to hell.)

823
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,920
(Actually, )

824
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:28,120
(it was probably heaven.)

825
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,441
(Fate brought me back to the past.)

826
01:01:31,615 --> 01:01:33,120
(I learned about life back then.)

827
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:36,440
(I fell in love with Chaai)

828
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,200
(and returned to fall in love with Chad in this life.)

829
01:01:39,919 --> 01:01:42,080
(My karma score is probably really good.)

830
01:01:42,952 --> 01:01:45,960
(I don't believe anybody else gets to be in love with the same man)

831
01:01:46,295 --> 01:01:49,280
(twice in two lifetimes.)

832
