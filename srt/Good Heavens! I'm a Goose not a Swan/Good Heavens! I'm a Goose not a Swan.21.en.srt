1
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm in charge of this house!

2
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:30,560
If I disapprove, none of you

3
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:33,600
can ever live in this house!

4
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,840
This place might be small. Can you live in this?

5
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:37,400
Why can't I, my dear?

6
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:41,120
That's why I would like Dokgaew to claim what's rightfully hers.

7
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:44,160
If she's bold enough to stay, then so be it.

8
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,760
I think you know the answer now.

9
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,320
You don't like me.

10
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,120
Luang.

11
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,960
You also think Puek and Dokgaew

12
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:54,800
have feelings for one another?

13
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,600
If you want to be sure,

14
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,440
we have to play along with their games.

15
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:00,381
You have to make Luang Vasuthep

16
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,080
admit his feelings.

17
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:04,239
I'll do the same with Dokgaew.

18
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,040
You said you love Boonta so much.

19
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:09,040
After all, you're happy to marry Dokgaew, right?

20
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:10,840
Now that I found her,

21
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:13,680
would you help me with something?

22
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:21,392
(Episode 21: It's Time... For A Goose's Wedding)

23
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:51,280
Do you have one even better than this?

24
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:55,280
I intend to buy one for Dokgaew when her man comes to ask for my blessing.

25
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:59,840
She needs something worthy of being Luang Thukkarat's wife.

26
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,440
Who are you?

27
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:14,960
What's wrong with you?

28
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:19,360
Luang Vasuthep wants to see you.

29
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,200
Come to the back of the market.

30
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:31,547
Who are you?

31
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,960
Boonta?

32
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,108
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

33
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,104
Yeah! I can see now!

34
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,080
What's wrong with those girls?

35
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,720
They're too chaotic!

36
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:19,440
I lost the mood to shop for jewelry.

37
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,960
Let's go to the Indian clothing store, Dokgaew.

38
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:25,920
Hey! You're Dang!

39
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,880
Where is Dokgaew, my daughter?

40
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:30,360
Young Miss?

41
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,400
Dokgaew?

42
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,680
Who are you looking for, Miss Dokgaew?

43
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:38,976
Lua...

44
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm not looking for anyone.

45
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
I just happened to walk by.

46
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
Really? Didn't you

47
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,640
expect to see Luang Vasuthep here?

48
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,000
What are you doing?

49
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:55,800
Did you use those people to lure me out to assault me?

50
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:58,440
Miss Dokgaew.

51
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,800
I'm not a villain in a TV show.

52
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,200
I'll act like one, though.

53
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,800
Pilai.

54
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:11,160
I know that you

55
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,040
like my husband very much.

56
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,480
Who's Pilai?

57
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,360
It's you.

58
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:21,680
You're like Pilai in "Repercussion."

59
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Look.

60
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:27,280
Whether it's my dear Chaai or Mr. Chai,

61
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:30,200
you can't just think you'll fall in love after living together.

62
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:31,600
It doesn't work that way.

63
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
Let me tell you something.

64
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,480
If you're not in love at the beginning, you won't end up in love.

65
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:39,520
Boonta! You're thick-skinned!

66
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,760
It's you who's thick-skinned!

67
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,560
You know Chaai doesn't love you.

68
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,400
Yet you allow his family to force him into marriage

69
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:50,480
because you want to cover up the shame of what you did, right?

70
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,080
- Boonta! - Slap me! Slap me right here!

71
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,120
I'll scream so loud the whole market can hear.

72
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,720
Let everyone know

73
00:06:57,816 --> 00:06:59,440
that a man is not your only scandal,

74
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,800
and you assault people too.

75
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:05,320
Tell me what you want.

76
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm so sick of you.

77
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:10,160
I don't really like you either, girl.

78
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:14,160
Your eyebrows are way too pointy.

79
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,920
And you drew your eyebrows unevenly.

80
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:19,120
Though no matter how much I criticize you,

81
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,920
Luang Vasuthep still likes you.

82
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:28,920
There! Surprise, surprise!

83
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,360
Look, Dokgaew.

84
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,840
You two were giving each other that lovey-dovey look.

85
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:36,760
Anyone can tell.

86
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,320
Oh! And the man you were making out with in the rumor

87
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,280
was Luang Vasuthep, wasn't it?

88
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,280
What are you talking about? I don't know anything.

89
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:50,320
That's not convincing.

90
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,640
You know everything, Miss Dokgaew.

91
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:54,911
Listen carefully.

92
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,360
You don't love Chaai.

93
00:07:57,704 --> 00:08:00,040
You're tricking yourself into thinking you do.

94
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:05,080
You are so fixated on him because your mother and my mother-in-law

95
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
kept telling in your ears that

96
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:10,640
you're the best match for Chaai.

97
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,360
Tell me honestly.

98
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:18,560
Are you really going to marry Chaai when you love Luang Vasuthep?

99
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,200
Your life is yours.

100
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,120
Why don't you fight for your own heart?

101
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:30,320
Look at me.

102
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,880
I was almost sold to the man I didn't love,

103
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
but I fought until I got to be with Chaai.

104
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:39,880
You have everything I didn't have.

105
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:42,800
Why don't you follow your own heart?

106
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,560
Bye!

107
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,760
Thank you all so much for your help.

108
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:04,080
There.

109
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,720
We did our best.

110
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,240
I hope that elite girl is convinced by what you said.

111
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,000
I hope so too.

112
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,063
That's Captain Jon!

113
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,200
So you're getting your wish, Pudsorn.

114
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:22,560
Go on.

115
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,680
How are you, Boonta?

116
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
Have you been well?

117
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,000
I have been well, sir.

118
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,280
Have you been well, Captain?

119
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,560
Would you like someone to accompany you?

120
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:40,520
If you have time,

121
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,960
you can come.

122
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:43,902
I have, sir.

123
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:45,985
- Then let's go. - Yes, sir.

124
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,920
Oh.

125
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,840
If you need any help,

126
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,720
you can come to me anytime.

127
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:58,480
After all,

128
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,160
we're still good friends.

129
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,200
I'd be happy to help.

130
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,160
Thank you, sir.

131
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,800
- Let's go, sir. - Let's go.

132
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:19,570
She's getting cutesy.

133
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:22,320
Look. I kind of feel sorry for you.

134
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:24,800
Instead of a good man like Captain Jon,

135
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:26,280
you fell in love with a Luang,

136
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:28,029
whose life is full of headaches.

137
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
He's got his mother and fiancée.

138
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:33,688
Well, what can I do?

139
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:37,040
I already fell for him.

140
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,320
You must be happy

141
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,040
that I'm settling down.

142
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:59,120
Is that why you're drinking a lot to celebrate me?

143
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,520
You only ask me out for a drink once in a blue moon.

144
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,520
I should have my fill.

145
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,800
You seem happier than I expected about the upcoming wedding.

146
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,960
You bought clothes.

147
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:22,400
You're drinking.

148
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,320
You're acting weird.

149
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,920
People change every day.

150
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:32,840
So does one's heart.

151
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,080
Friends can change into lovers.

152
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,120
It seems

153
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,720
we don't have to get him drunk as planned.

154
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:07,114
You want me to get Puek drunk?

155
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,760
That's right.

156
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,680
If we play their games,

157
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,919
we could be on the back foot.

158
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,480
Sometimes, we have to use dirty tricks.

159
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,560
Let me tell you. This is a "classic" trick.

160
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
I've seen it in a lot of TV shows.

161
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,800
Once he gets drunk,

162
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:26,400
he will pour his heart out!

163
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:33,463
Seeing as we're friends

164
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,960
and close relatives,

165
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:37,960
let me ask you directly.

166
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,200
That man who was with Dokgaew at my house's dock

167
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,320
was you, wasn't it?

168
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,280
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,920
I've caused you trouble.

170
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:12,440
Now, you had to take responsibility for what I did.

171
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:16,648
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

172
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,320
You can blame me.

173
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:24,000
I couldn't tell you

174
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:29,720
because Dokgaew is your fiancée after all.

175
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,840
Besides, she never said she loved or liked me.

176
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,640
When I came to my senses

177
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,360
and realized it,

178
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,200
everything had gotten way out of hand.

179
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,280
I don't blame you for that.

180
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,520
Is that because you're willing to marry Dokgaew?

181
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,440
I pretended to be willing

182
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:13,000
because I wanted to find out your feelings.

183
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,720
How else would I know

184
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,120
that you and Dokgaew have feelings for one another?

185
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,415
If she truly had feelings for me,

186
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:29,792
she would have refused the wedding with you.

187
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:34,440
Luang, sir.

188
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:36,440
Don't be a fool.

189
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,360
I mean, don't pretend to be ignorant.

190
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,120
You know Dokgaew

191
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,440
better than her fiancé does.

192
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:50,680
Yod is right.

193
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
You should know Dokgaew is tight-lipped.

194
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:56,120
She isn't one to disobey Aunt Pikul.

195
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,200
If what happened that day

196
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,415
was in her consent,

197
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,367
that means you and her

198
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,560
feel the same way, does it not?

199
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,960
You're telling me this now.

200
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,688
What do you think I can do?

201
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,360
If you don't try anything,

202
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,160
you can let Dokgaew be my wife

203
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,880
and watch as she lives with resentment in my house.

204
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
If Dokgaew becomes my main wife,

205
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,240
I'll still love

206
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:38,720
and cherish only Boonta, even as a slave wife.

207
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,400
If you don't try to fight for your own love,

208
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:49,464
then accept your fate.

209
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:15,440
(Tell me, Dokgaew!)

210
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,760
(Who was the man who did the indecent things to you?)

211
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:20,841
I can't, Mother.

212
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:22,367
Are you too afraid?

213
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:25,200
So that means that man doesn't deserve you!

214
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:28,520
You have to marry Chaai.

215
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:35,960
Are you really going to marry Chaai when you love Luang Vasuthep?

216
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:40,800
(Your life is yours.)

217
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:43,600
(Why don't you fight for your own heart?)

218
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,200
(If what happened that day)

219
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,240
(was in her consent, )

220
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
that means you and her

221
00:16:59,527 --> 00:17:01,176
feel the same way, does it not?

222
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,480
If you don't try anything,

223
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,560
you can let Dokgaew be my wife

224
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,040
and watch as she lives with resentment in my house.

225
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,250
(I've chosen what's best for you.)

226
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:39,920
You will be happy like I once was.

227
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:41,840
Trust me.

228
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,040
If you don't try to fight for your own love,

229
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:00,680
then accept your fate.

230
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:21,360
My dear.

231
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:24,160
What if Dokgaew doesn't change her mind on the big day?

232
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:28,480
I'll never change my mind either.

233
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,000
No matter what happens on that day,

234
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:35,120
I would never let go of your hands.

235
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:42,280
I still stand by my word.

236
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,600
You will be my one and only beloved wife.

237
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,440
I love you, my dear.

238
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,000
I love you too.

239
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,680
We will be together til death do us part.

240
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,640
They say this household has some beautiful vegetables.

241
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:28,400
We would like a seed to grow some of our own.

242
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:38,200
This year, Puek is turning 26.

243
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,560
He has a respected and secure career.

244
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,840
I've seen that he loves

245
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:46,080
and cherishes Dokgaew.

246
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:48,400
So we would...

247
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:51,840
Chim, you said the wrong name.

248
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,040
I did not, Mother.

249
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,760
Today, the one who's asking for your blessing

250
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,320
is not Chaai.

251
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:01,880
It's Puek.

252
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,960
Are you worried about Chaai?

253
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,640
I am.

254
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,320
It will be a while before he comes home.

255
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:26,851
Let's not worry about it.

256
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,839
It's already happening.

257
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:39,440
In this era,

258
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,120
how do you ask for a blessing?

259
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:43,720
You just talk normally.

260
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:46,520
There should be a previous agreement.

261
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,800
The woman's parents will see if the couple's fortune is compatible.

262
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
If the woman's parents refuse,

263
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,200
they usually use incompatibility as an excuse.

264
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,680
What if they accept?

265
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,920
If they accept, they will ask for a dowry

266
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,841
and set the date the man's family officially asks for their blessing.

267
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:14,800
If there is a twist,

268
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:16,768
what do they do?

269
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,432
What's the meaning of this?

270
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:20,520
Chaai, Puek!

271
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,775
I'm sorry I surprised you.

272
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,895
This is all my fault.

273
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:37,784
Dokgaew and I are in love.

274
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,520
The man who was with Dokgaew at Chaai's house that day

275
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,480
was me.

276
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,080
Is that true, Dokgaew?

277
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,976
It is.

278
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth earlier.

279
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,320
I was still confused.

280
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,200
I just figured it out a few days ago.

281
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:25,160
Luang?

282
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:27,480
What are you doing here?

283
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,160
If somebody sees us,

284
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:33,280
the gossip about me will never end.

285
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,520
Why don't you wait until dawn, sir?

286
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:40,847
I'm thinking of visiting you too.

287
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
If so,

288
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:48,720
you and I

289
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,840
feel the same way, do we not?

290
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:56,800
I can't take it anymore.

291
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,840
I want to let you know.

292
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:09,680
I love you, Dokgaew.

293
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,600
I

294
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:19,680
Love you too, sir.

295
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:24,040
I don't know when it began,

296
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:26,280
but my eyes

297
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:28,920
and my heart

298
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:31,480
have been following you

299
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:34,840
instead of Chaai.

300
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm sorry

301
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:49,120
for being a coward before.

302
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:52,440
I didn't step up to fight for my love

303
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,600
and caused you trouble.

304
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,920
I was a coward too.

305
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,080
All I did was overthink.

306
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,720
I didn't tell everyone how I felt.

307
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,240
I let it drag on this far.

308
00:24:13,143 --> 00:24:14,880
Now that we're in love,

309
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
I'll tell Chaai everything

310
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:22,000
and ask for Mrs. Pikul's blessing.

311
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,280
I want our love

312
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,280
to go well with no obstacles.

313
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,080
It's been settled

314
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,663
that Chaai will come to ask for my mother's blessing.

315
00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:42,640
Let's do a switch-up, shall we?

316
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,280
Everything was my fault.

317
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,320
I'm sorry, Mother

318
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:52,840
and Aunt Tubtim,

319
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:56,080
for surprising and disappointing you.

320
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,920
However, I don't regret it

321
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:03,080
because this is the first time I follow my own heart.

322
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:06,320
All my life,

323
00:25:06,863 --> 00:25:09,240
I've been doing everything as you say.

324
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,240
But love

325
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,920
is something you can't force.

326
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:18,680
My heart doesn't race,

327
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,920
and I don't feel as light as air

328
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:23,429
when I'm with Chaai.

329
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,040
The man who makes me feel that way

330
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,911
is Luang Vasuthep.

331
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,880
I feel the same way as she does.

332
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:40,760
The more time I spend with her,

333
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:42,960
the more nervous I feel.

334
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,080
I knew that Mrs. Pikul

335
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:48,600
and Dokgaew were fixated on Chaai.

336
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,080
Yet I couldn't stop my own heart.

337
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:56,560
I regret

338
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,640
letting Dokgaew become a topic of gossip.

339
00:26:01,015 --> 00:26:03,360
I would like to fix this as soon as possible.

340
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:05,760
So, I asked Chaai

341
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,560
to come here today as planned.

342
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:09,840
Chaai!

343
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,400
So you conspired with him?

344
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:13,800
Now that

345
00:26:14,023 --> 00:26:16,023
Dokgaew and I both have someone we love,

346
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:19,480
why would we force ourselves to get married?

347
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,160
I, Puek,

348
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,760
and Dokgaew might be at fault

349
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,480
for using somewhat of a trick.

350
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,240
But we all did it

351
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:32,640
to settle down with the one we love.

352
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:35,120
Even so, this is inappropriate!

353
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:37,640
Don't you all have respect for your parents?

354
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:39,160
So, do our parents

355
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,460
not care about our happiness?

356
00:26:41,588 --> 00:26:42,760
Chaai!

357
00:26:43,462 --> 00:26:46,160
Mother, please calm down.

358
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,720
I think if Puek and Dokgaew

359
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:53,600
hadn't respected you and Aunt Pikul,

360
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:56,272
they would have eloped some time ago.

361
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:57,880
Chang!

362
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:01,143
I just wanted to lighten the mood.

363
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,600
After all,

364
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,080
we're here to ask for your blessing.

365
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,560
I hope you don't refuse because of a swap

366
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:10,400
from the man her parent would like

367
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:11,920
to the man

368
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:13,440
that the woman loves.

369
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,680
I actually would like my parents to come themselves,

370
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,200
but they both have some work out of town.

371
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:30,000
I sent them a letter.

372
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,160
They will visit you at a later date.

373
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:37,640
Seeing as Puek

374
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:40,080
is our relative and considered family,

375
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
I thought our big brother, Chim,

376
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:45,640
could be the one to ask for your blessing.

377
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,440
Puek himself

378
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:51,048
doesn't want to waste any more time

379
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,600
because Dokgaew would continue to be a topic of gossip.

380
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:58,680
I agreed to do this myself.

381
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:00,760
I would like you

382
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,120
and Aunt Pikul

383
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
to consider this proposal.

384
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:07,960
Will you insist on getting what you want?

385
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,760
Or will you let go

386
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,920
for your children's happiness sake?

387
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,960
I'm not trying

388
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:20,400
to prevent my daughter's happiness.

389
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,880
But if Puek's fortune

390
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,520
and Dokgaew's

391
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,360
are incompatible...

392
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:29,000
They are compatible, Aunt.

393
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,000
The other day,

394
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:34,081
Puek gave me information about the girl he likes

395
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,920
and asked me to take it to my monk master.

396
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,640
I didn't know she would turn out to be Dokgaew.

397
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,560
My master checked their fortunes.

398
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,280
He confirmed that they both

399
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:46,120
will support and elevate each other.

400
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:49,240
They will have lots of children!

401
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,440
Aunt Pikul, if you don't have an excuse...

402
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:56,720
I mean a problem.

403
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,000
If so,

404
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,080
I would like to ask for your blessing on Dokgaew and Puek.

405
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
This is an auspicious time.

406
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,360
Puek

407
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:11,280
and Dokgaew have been in love

408
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,120
and taken a liking to one another.

409
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,720
They have learned a good deal about one another.

410
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:19,960
I, as the highest senior,

411
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:23,071
agree that this is the right time.

412
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:25,960
I would like to ask for your blessing

413
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:29,160
to join our two families together.

414
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,240
Aunt Pikul,

415
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,080
would you agree?

416
00:29:56,496 --> 00:29:58,280
If the man's senior

417
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,800
sees this as appropriate,

418
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:03,160
I won't object.

419
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,840
I'm happy to place

420
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,160
my daughter in Puek's care

421
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,880
from this moment on.

422
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,360
Pikul!

423
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,080
Well...

424
00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:01,980
I need to check on Pad, but Chaai,

425
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,200
take it easy on Mother.

426
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:07,616
Chim should be the one to talk to her.

427
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,344
Chaai won't get a turn to speak.

428
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,080
Mother might stay quiet,

429
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:14,640
but she won't give in this time.

430
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,120
Good luck, Brother.

431
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,480
Are you still angry, Mother?

432
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:48,360
How can I not be angry?

433
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:50,920
You did that without caring about me losing face!

434
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,920
You think that scheme of yours

435
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,560
will allow you to live happily with that Sampheng woman?

436
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,720
I didn't do that for my happiness alone.

437
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,360
I did it for Dokgaew

438
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,160
and for Puek so they don't regret it for the rest of their lives.

439
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,520
Now, everything is as perfect as it should be.

440
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,560
All we need is for you to let go, as Chim said.

441
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
But I can't!

442
00:32:17,263 --> 00:32:18,400
No matter what,

443
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,560
I can't accept that kind of woman as a daughter-in-law!

444
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,080
Then that is up to you.

445
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,040
However, I will insist

446
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,960
on refusing whoever replaces Dokgaew.

447
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,040
You will never have it your way

448
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:39,600
because the only woman I will marry

449
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,840
is Boonta.

450
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,960
I didn't expect everything to go so well.

451
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,920
Right.

452
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:05,040
Puek and Dokgaew will find a date for the wedding

453
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,440
and arrange the ceremony.

454
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:09,400
Right.

455
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:16,760
I'm thinking of my own ceremony too.

456
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,440
I'll have it before Puek and Dokgaew's.

457
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:22,800
Right.

458
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,880
I said I'm having a wedding.

459
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:31,600
Won't you congratulate me or something?

460
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,280
Wedding?

461
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,440
To whom, my dear?

462
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:42,720
To Yod, perhaps.

463
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:46,880
I knew it! Yod follows you like a shadow.

464
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,040
He was acting sus.

465
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:50,760
So he's trying to steal you from me?

466
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:53,840
I need to slap him and teach him a lesson. That darn Yod!

467
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,800
Stop kidding.

468
00:33:58,584 --> 00:33:59,800
You should go to bed.

469
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:02,560
I want to cuddle with you.

470
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Not yet, my dear.

471
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:09,694
I have to finish Chang's account.

472
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,312
It's almost done.

473
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:24,800
I forgot where I was at.

474
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,280
It's really hot tonight.

475
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,800
Don't you think?

476
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,840
I think it's...

477
00:34:55,815 --> 00:34:57,200
Don't you feel hot?

478
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,960
Maybe it was the heat of impatience to cuddle.

479
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,759
It made my body heat up.

480
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:07,960
"Okay."

481
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,520
I'm not doing Chang's account anymore.

482
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,120
I'm going to punish you like you deserve.

483
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,406
Come on!

484
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,720
Do you want to cuddle now?

485
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,280
My dear, you're being even hotter than the weather.

486
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,400
Who can resist you like this?

487
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,960
From now on,

488
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,160
your work is forbidden in the bedroom.

489
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,400
If you disobey, I'll punish you.

490
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,800
I'll also teach Chang a lesson.

491
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:47,760
Right.

492
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,480
I'm ready to take my punishment,

493
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:51,400
and I'm ready to get married.

494
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,240
I'll have our wedding at the small house.

495
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:08,040
We can have it anywhere.

496
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:12,000
If you can't have it here, you can have it at Fang's.

497
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:14,200
But whether there will be guests or not,

498
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,960
I don't know.

499
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,120
I won't invite too many guests.

500
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,840
There will just be close acquaintances.

501
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,920
About the feast,

502
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,880
what dish do you want in particular?

503
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,560
Can I make what I want to have?

504
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,560
Of course.

505
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:37,880
I'll ask Pad to help you out.

506
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,600
It's alright.

507
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,320
What I want to have

508
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,360
must be made by myself.

509
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,040
What are you doing here?

510
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:53,440
What?

511
00:36:57,356 --> 00:37:00,000
You haven't got married yet.

512
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:02,136
And you're already asserting your power?

513
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:04,560
Mother! Please be polite.

514
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,280
Boonta is Luang's wife after all.

515
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,800
Nobody shows respect to a slave wife.

516
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:13,560
I don't know about that.

517
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,968
What I do know is that Chaai does.

518
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:18,680
Should I ask him to confirm that to you?

519
00:37:19,944 --> 00:37:21,944
I can confirm that for him.

520
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:28,280
Otherwise, he wouldn't have asked me to get some milk for his wife.

521
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,320
It's not easy to find some.

522
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,120
It's not popular.

523
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,880
I had to go to the fortress where the Indians

524
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,920
keep their cows for milking.

525
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,000
Thank you.

526
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,200
That's not a complaint. You're welcome.

527
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:47,120
My sister-in-law is making tea for her wedding guests herself.

528
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,640
I'm happy to help.

529
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:50,680
Thanks.

530
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:55,440
If any of you try to interfere,

531
00:37:56,288 --> 00:37:58,288
I'll take that as an effort to halt the wedding.

532
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,200
Chaai won't let it slide.

533
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,600
If you understand, go and do what Boonta asks.

534
00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:10,240
Yes, sir.

535
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,640
With Chaai's backing,

536
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:43,094
Boonta is getting arrogant,

537
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,400
and she's doing such weird things.

538
00:38:46,505 --> 00:38:49,240
Master Chang plays along with them too.

539
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:51,760
That woman's charm is something else.

540
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,631
What kind of tea is she making?

541
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:07,000
It sure smells good.

542
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:15,400
It's bubble milk tea, Chang.

543
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,920
Is it done?

544
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,480
My dear Chaai! It's done!

545
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:22,376
I'm done making bubble milk tea.

546
00:39:22,504 --> 00:39:24,320
You're the first one who gets to taste it.

547
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:31,560
Is it good?

548
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:41,840
With bubble milk tea, you need big straws such as this.

549
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,120
Are these sago?

550
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,340
They're similar.

551
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,840
But they're made from

552
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:07,440
sticky rice flour and sugar.

553
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:14,120
Chang!

554
00:40:14,543 --> 00:40:16,240
Please try one.

555
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,840
Here, sir.

556
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,760
Not bad.

557
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:32,760
It tastes unusual.

558
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:39,800
It's good.

559
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:44,200
Want some, Yod?

560
00:40:45,103 --> 00:40:47,160
Here you go. You get a big cup.

561
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,480
Everyone, please try some.

562
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,080
Thank you.

563
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:55,312
Here.

564
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,439
Kerd.

565
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,280
Go and ask Pad to read me "Chaiyachet."

566
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,280
You usually force...

567
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,720
I mean, ask Master Chang to read to you, right?

568
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:30,760
I don't want to see him!

569
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,960
He's busy helping Boonta. He won't care about me!

570
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,120
I know Pad is pregnant,

571
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:38,360
but just reading

572
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:39,920
won't do any harm.

573
00:41:41,304 --> 00:41:42,960
But this book, "Chaiyachet,"

574
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,760
has been read several times. Don't you get bored?

575
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:48,080
Don't argue with me! Just do as I say!

576
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,580
- Yes, ma'am. - Go!

577
00:41:49,697 --> 00:41:50,897
- Yes, ma'am. - What a drag.

578
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,640
I brought you milk tea to drink while listening to the play.

579
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:09,840
I won't drink it. What kind of drink is this? It's strange.

580
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,880
It might look strange,

581
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,880
but it's good, Mother.

582
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:18,080
I believe you'll love it.

583
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,720
If you open your heart to Boonta,

584
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,400
you will find her a lovely person.

585
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,400
She's witty.

586
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,880
She's kind.

587
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,640
She gets along with everyone.

588
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,400
She's also patient and perseverant.

589
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,760
At first,

590
00:42:41,944 --> 00:42:43,280
I thought you would

591
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:44,760
take her in as one of your wives

592
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,280
because you felt guilty for putting her mother in jail.

593
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,200
But at this point,

594
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,360
you've become obsessed with her.

595
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:57,200
Boonta has no flaw that makes her unworthy as your daughter-in-law,

596
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:01,200
aside from the fact that she was once a courtesan.

597
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:05,520
And that was only because Magnate Thong desired her.

598
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:09,680
That was the reason she and her family went through everything.

599
00:43:11,111 --> 00:43:12,797
Don't make excuses for her!

600
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:14,320
I don't want to hear them!

601
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,760
It's fine if you don't want to hear me.

602
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:24,440
I just wanted to ask you to let go of your bias

603
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:27,520
and look at Boonta with your kindness for once.

604
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:32,120
You will find her lovable as much as I do.

605
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:14,640
Take it back. I won't drink it.

606
00:44:19,942 --> 00:44:21,200
Mother.

607
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,200
You and people in this era might think bubble milk tea is weird and nasty.

608
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:29,040
But if you open your mind

609
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,160
and think of it as just a kind of tea,

610
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,720
you will get to taste something so delicious

611
00:44:35,912 --> 00:44:39,000
that you never expected to taste in your life.

612
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:42,880
What are you trying to say? Don't beat around the bush!

613
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:44,440
You're giving me a headache!

614
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:49,800
I thought I would try to be a "life coach."

615
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:56,960
Well, I wanted to tell you that

616
00:44:57,744 --> 00:45:00,640
bubble milk tea and I are similar.

617
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,480
We're strange and unique,

618
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:06,120
but if you open up,

619
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,640
you'll find I'm just a different type of person.

620
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:10,480
My diversity

621
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:12,880
and uniqueness, which you don't usually find,

622
00:45:13,495 --> 00:45:16,080
will make you know me better

623
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,280
and perhaps accept me

624
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,840
as Chaai's wife.

625
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,640
Mother.

626
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:15,480
Mother.

627
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:18,808
Aren't you going?

628
00:46:18,991 --> 00:46:21,280
Today is Chaai's big day.

629
00:46:26,472 --> 00:46:28,320
Chaai shows me no respect.

630
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:29,800
Why would I go?

631
00:46:31,984 --> 00:46:33,520
If he doesn't respect you,

632
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,120
he wouldn't be giving you bubble milk tea every day.

633
00:46:39,048 --> 00:46:42,040
Boonta works hard to make it for you every day.

634
00:46:44,824 --> 00:46:46,200
You all are taking her side.

635
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
Just leave me alone.

636
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:50,120
Don't care about me.

637
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:54,320
Mother.

638
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,080
All of us care about you.

639
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,440
But are you sure

640
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:01,520
you will stay this way?

641
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:05,207
The one who is unhappy

642
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:06,880
is you.

643
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,360
And my brother, Chaai,

644
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:11,320
probably can't be happy either.

645
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,360
Chaai's life is his own.

646
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:19,800
Now that he's made his decision,

647
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:24,480
won't you at least consider his happiness?

648
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,840
(Buddhist Prayers)

649
00:47:27,921 --> 00:47:33,360
(Buddhist Prayers)

650
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:29,000
Yam.

651
00:48:29,904 --> 00:48:31,160
What's wrong with you?

652
00:48:31,296 --> 00:48:32,880
You keep looking out.

653
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,800
I want to attend Luang and Boonta's wedding.

654
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,200
I want some bubble milk tea.

655
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:43,160
You switch sides so easily.

656
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,320
Just a cup of strange tea

657
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:47,760
can turn you upside down.

658
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,240
Boonta actually is not a bad person.

659
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,120
She's nice and kind to us.

660
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,320
I notice that when she's with Luang,

661
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,840
he smiles all the time when

662
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:01,800
he usually doesn't smile a lot. Ouch!

663
00:49:03,064 --> 00:49:04,080
Shut up!

664
00:49:04,919 --> 00:49:06,520
Madam Tubtim is not attending.

665
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,040
How could you go?

666
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,520
Master Chim, Master Chang, and Madam Pad are all there!

667
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,400
If you sneak out, I'll flog you to death.

668
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,680
(That's only a change in class)

669
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,360
(and a change in occupation.)

670
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,600
(Does that make one worthless?)

671
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,960
(For me, )

672
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,720
a courtesan is not a lowly woman.

673
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,880
I love Boonta for who she is and for her personality.

674
00:49:43,487 --> 00:49:46,320
I don't care about ranks or classes.

675
00:49:49,592 --> 00:49:51,400
I have been in love with her for a long time.

676
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,880
I love her even more now.

677
00:49:57,567 --> 00:49:59,240
Boonta will be my only love.

678
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:00,960
My everlasting love.

679
00:50:02,023 --> 00:50:03,360
Even if you disapprove,

680
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,940
I won't stop loving her.

681
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:07,541
I will marry Boonta no matter what.

682
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:12,680
Please come in, Mother.

683
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,920
What took you so long, ma'am?

684
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:26,071
Were you afraid of losing your importance

685
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:28,184
and that nobody would care about you?

686
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:30,880
Who would come rushing in like you lot?

687
00:51:31,503 --> 00:51:33,840
Were you afraid of missing out on her dowry?

688
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,400
The price you got paid for her freedom is not enough?

689
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:39,560
All you wealthy elites

690
00:51:39,735 --> 00:51:41,880
think about is money, right?

691
00:51:42,455 --> 00:51:45,840
Oh yeah. I guess you didn't talk to your son.

692
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:47,400
That's why you don't know

693
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,320
that I didn't charge a dime for her freedom,

694
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,320
and I didn't ask for her dowry.

695
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:53,920
Your son

696
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:57,143
got my girl without paying anything.

697
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,560
I might have made money off of Boonta,

698
00:52:12,775 --> 00:52:14,647
but I love her like a child of my own.

699
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:17,880
I'm doing this because I care about her happiness.

700
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,303
You should do the same.

701
00:52:20,495 --> 00:52:21,960
It's gotten this far.

702
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,720
Just accept it already.

703
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,240
At your age, you'll probably die soon,

704
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:28,439
and you're still the roadblock

705
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:30,599
that gets in the way of your son's happiness.

706
00:52:42,856 --> 00:52:44,880
If you don't respect me.

707
00:52:44,992 --> 00:52:46,440
I have no problem.

708
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:48,880
But Boonta is Luang's wife now.

709
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,680
She belongs in your household now.

710
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:52,776
You should accept her

711
00:52:53,024 --> 00:52:55,480
for the sake of your own son.

712
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:16,560
For you.

713
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:24,480
For you.

714
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,640
You're attending our wedding.

715
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,240
Please drink this.

716
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,720
It's not going to make you lose face.

717
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,360
Let me try it first, ma'am.

718
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,600
In case Boonta tries to poison you,

719
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,960
I'm willing to sacrifice my life, ma'am.

720
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,480
Kerd!

721
00:54:57,647 --> 00:54:59,232
Did you really try to poison me?

722
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:04,000
I think she just can't put it down, Mother.

723
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:08,861
There's no poison, ma'am. It's really good.

724
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:12,040
Keep your cool.

725
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,760
Here, Mother.

726
00:55:48,656 --> 00:55:50,120
It's good, isn't it?

727
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:03,040
It's just alright.

728
00:56:22,815 --> 00:56:23,895
At last,

729
00:56:24,056 --> 00:56:25,680
we got married.

730
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,800
I'm sorry

731
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,840
I can't get you into the main house yet.

732
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,200
It's fine, dear.

733
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,480
I can be anywhere as long as you're there.

734
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:43,040
Still, you'll be more comfortable in the main house.

735
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:45,160
You'll be with my mother.

736
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,320
Chim and Pad.

737
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,240
And our entire staff.

738
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:51,240
You won't be lonely.

739
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:54,280
Honestly,

740
00:56:54,423 --> 00:56:55,960
ever since I got here,

741
00:56:56,183 --> 00:56:58,560
I have never felt lonely, not once.

742
00:56:59,023 --> 00:57:01,688
All I got was a headache every day.

743
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,360
And I think it's not going to stop.

744
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:11,760
If you get another headache,

745
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,480
but it's good for your heart,

746
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,800
is that alright?

747
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,840
I think we should have a child.

748
00:57:23,624 --> 00:57:25,200
When I go out of town on a mission,

749
00:57:25,392 --> 00:57:27,160
you can hold our child in my stead.

750
00:57:29,856 --> 00:57:32,840
So would you like

751
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,280
a son or a daughter?

752
00:57:56,927 --> 00:57:58,200
I'll be back soon.

753
00:57:58,912 --> 00:58:00,520
I'll be waiting.

754
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,960
Madam Tubtim sent for Boonta, sir.

755
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:32,120
If you want to be his wife,

756
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,560
you have to be an expert at household chores.

757
00:58:35,736 --> 00:58:39,640
Just make her work more. She'll show Chaai her old habits soon.

758
00:58:39,768 --> 00:58:42,337
Roasted sour chili paste with wild boar meat and zalacca for Chaai,

759
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:46,240
assorted salad for Mrs. Tubtim, and pork curry with morning glory for Chim.

760
00:58:46,408 --> 00:58:48,800
Why does their meal have to be so extravagant?

761
00:58:50,072 --> 00:58:52,480
It's good. This is as good as your cooking, Mother.

762
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,000
How is this possible?

763
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,480
I don't know either, ma'am.

764
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,936
Thank you for caring about me and understanding my mother.

765
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,560
I love her son, right?

766
00:59:04,735 --> 00:59:06,735
Renu is pregnant!

767
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,441
When will you accept her, Mother?

768
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:11,720
If the male and female lead get together too easily,

769
00:59:11,856 --> 00:59:13,598
the play won't be exciting.

770
00:59:13,712 --> 00:59:15,712
But if there are too many obstacles,

771
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:17,280
the play can get a bad reception.

772
00:59:17,415 --> 00:59:18,910
The male and female lead

773
00:59:18,991 --> 00:59:20,560
don't always end up together.
