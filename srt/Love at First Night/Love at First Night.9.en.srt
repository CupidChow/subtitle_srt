1
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,885
I finally caught the liar in the act.

2
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,045
From now on,

3
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,846
you can't use your status as Apo's aunt

4
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:08,846
to control her life anymore.

5
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,046
From now on, we're strangers!

6
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:15,406
I don't want an ungrateful niece like you.

7
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:20,446
(I forgot that the one she wants beside her)

8
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,206
(isn't me.)

9
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,686
She's here to see you.

10
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:26,966
She told me to tell her when you're back.

11
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,886
Don't tell her. I don't want to see her face now.

12
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:32,358
(Mueang, where are you?)

13
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:33,797
(Are you alright?)

14
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:36,286
It's the last time I'll be kind to her.

15
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,046
From now on, I won't feel bad for her again.

16
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:49,326
Good morning! Welcome to TinTin Garden. We have a lot of plants today.

17
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,766
If you're new, don't forget to like and share.

18
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:55,965
Today, guys, I've got this one for you.

19
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:58,445
It's a huge one with nice leaves.

20
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:00,446
It's a Monstera Thaicon.

21
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:02,022
For a huge one like this,

22
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:06,126
the opening bid is only 10,00 baht, going up 500 baht each bid.

23
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:10,234
Are you ready? If you are, type C followed by your price.

24
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,507
Are you ready? If you are, let's go!

25
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:14,166
Come on! Fist bid...

26
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:17,406
It's from Cee, 10,500 baht.

27
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,646
From Earn, 11,000 baht.

28
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:21,797
From Koi, 11,500 baht.

29
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,566
Come on. Keep it coming. This one's got nice leaves.

30
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:27,372
We have 12,000 from Nui. It's 12,000 now!

31
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:28,861
Twelve thousand

32
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,806
and five hundred from Cee!

33
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:33,788
Let's look at the comments now.

34
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:37,246
"I'll pay 500 baht for your friend's smile."

35
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:42,126
Forget it. That's not happening.

36
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:43,926
Let's continue with our plant.

37
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,846
"I want to buy your friend. I don't want no trees."

38
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,752
- Would you sell?  - Leave me alone.

39
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:54,206
He said to leave him alone, guys.

40
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,485
Just pretend he doesn't exist.

41
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:59,526
Okay, the plant! Let's pick up where we left off.

42
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:07,806
Come on, Nut. Well...

43
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,702
Make sure you pack the right ones for the buyers.

44
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,046
Pack them up nicely for shipping. I'm counting on you.

45
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:13,366
Yes, Mr. Tin.

46
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:27,326
Is it your day off?

47
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:28,726
Why did you ask?

48
00:04:28,988 --> 00:04:32,166
You've never come to my store before.

49
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:34,526
Don't tell me

50
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,086
you're trying to hide from someone.

51
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:39,166
You're avoiding someone. Surely. Who is it?

52
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:41,500
You're a coward, aren't you?

53
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,806
Hey, calm down, bro.

54
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,526
This is one of my children.

55
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,246
I'm just here to help you.

56
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:51,486
If you don't need me, fine.

57
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,126
Bye.

58
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:55,766
Mueang.

59
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:57,246
Are you leaving?

60
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:59,006
What's wrong with you?

61
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,726
This is why people don't buy things from you.

62
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:04,326
You hurt one of my children.

63
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,326
So, Mueang really leaves you alone?

64
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:13,326
I don't know. I can't tell.

65
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:15,926
He just left.

66
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,446
Well. So

67
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,686
my talk worked, didn't it?

68
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,046
- What talk?   - Nothing.

69
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:24,406
It's nothing.

70
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:28,406
You can rest easy now, right?

71
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:34,886
I have to go, Om.

72
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,446
Okay.

73
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,086
Yes!

74
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,886
(I should feel at ease.)

75
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:50,566
(Why does it feel strange?)

76
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:09,526
You suck.

77
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,246
(One more strange thing is...)

78
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,046
That's gone bad.

79
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,366
I think it's good.

80
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:31,726
Too slow.

81
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,446
Get away from me.

82
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:41,926
(I started to miss his insults.)

83
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:05,006
Mueang!

84
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:14,366
Mueang!

85
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:19,366
Wait, Mueang!

86
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,726
Wait for me!

87
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:23,126
I need to talk to you, Mueang!

88
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:25,086
Mueang!

89
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:37,446
Mueang!

90
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:43,526
Where have you been?

91
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:46,246
What do you want?

92
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:49,046
Have you been avoiding me?

93
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:01,286
No.

94
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,686
(Yes, I have been avoiding you.)

95
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:08,915
(15 minutes earlier)

96
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:12,086
- Is Apo here?   - She's not. She went to her office.

97
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:22,526
(At that moment, I wanted to kill Aum.)

98
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,326
(I couldn't blame him, though.)

99
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:26,366
(These past three days,)

100
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,006
(I've learned that...)

101
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:37,046
Okay. Please send me your quotation.

102
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:40,606
By Wednesday.

103
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:43,366
Okay. Send it to the email address I sent.

104
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:45,877
Okay. Thank you.

105
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:48,126
(Avoiding someone)

106
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,886
(is not easy at all.)

107
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:15,846
(The more I want to avoid her,)

108
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,886
(the more I see her.)

109
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:48,526
(I don't mean to avoid her forever.)

110
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:50,886
(We still have things to figure out.)

111
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,326
(I just need some time.)

112
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,526
(I just need a while.)

113
00:09:56,926 --> 00:09:59,006
(I think it's the only way I can)

114
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:03,566
(give up.)

115
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,166
If there's nothing else,

116
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:09,726
I'll get going now.

117
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:54,126
Let me go.

118
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,286
Let me go.

119
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:54,526
Let me go.

120
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:59,206
Let me go.

121
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:26,886
Got you!

122
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:32,526
- Ms. Ing.   - No. You can't bail on me.

123
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,126
You're mine all day long, Ms. Apo.

124
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:42,566
I don't think we have anything to clear up.

125
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:44,646
If what you said was true,

126
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,206
that meant Game lied to both of us.

127
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,646
So you don't hate me, right?

128
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,086
Why would I hate you?

129
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:59,086
You might think I stole your boyfriend.

130
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:03,606
I never ever blamed you for that.

131
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:08,086
You really understand things.

132
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:11,486
Let me give you a round of applause!

133
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:18,446
Okay. Thank you.

134
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:22,022
Ms. Apo.

135
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:23,646
I'm here today

136
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:26,566
to help you escape.

137
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:30,206
It's up to you if you need my help or not.

138
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:36,806
Tell me about Apo's family.

139
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:38,726
I wonder what's wrong with them.

140
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:40,486
Maybe I can help.

141
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,046
What do you want to know?

142
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:48,486
Start by explaining why Apo is marrying Uncle Din.

143
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,526
I won't tell you!

144
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:02,846
- I'm leaving.   - Hey! Tell me first.

145
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,726
(Sherlock Holmes)

146
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:08,966
How did it go? Did you find out?

147
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,246
You did well.

148
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,686
What help?

149
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:20,693
Please break up with Uncle Din and date me instead.

150
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:23,846
Do you want to date me?

151
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:25,206
Yeah!

152
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:28,526
Date me, which means you're my girlfriend.

153
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:35,046
I'm sure Uncle Din will understand and approve the two of us.

154
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:37,854
Then, you can work for my friend's company.

155
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:40,806
I'll pay off your debt.

156
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:42,806
Why do we need to date?

157
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,806
It's to make our story believable.

158
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,406
Is it really believable?

159
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:51,246
Do you have a problem with me being a woman?

160
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:52,726
No.

161
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,045
I just wonder why you're suddenly trying to help me.

162
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:57,926
We're not friends or anything.

163
00:14:58,318 --> 00:14:59,606
Ms. Apo.

164
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:02,966
When I found out you'd been working to pay off your debt,

165
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:05,860
the fire in me

166
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,406
was lit up.

167
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,566
Girl power is strong!

168
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,686
I don't want to see you marry someone you don't love.

169
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:19,126
Thank you for your kindness, but

170
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:21,886
no thank you.

171
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,646
You can fold this plan up and throw it away.

172
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,406
Please.

173
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:31,886
Are you not interested?

174
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:41,326
Thank you again, but really, I'm fine.

175
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:44,606
If you change your mind, you can call me.

176
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:46,306
Sorry.

177
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:47,726
Whoa!

178
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:00,366
Hey! It's done.

179
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,526
Call me, okay?

180
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,206
Ms. Apo, are you hungry?

181
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:10,246
I am!

182
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:12,166
Great! Then let's eat!

183
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:15,150
I stopped at a market on the way and bought a lot of yummy food.

184
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:16,966
Okay. Thank you.

185
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:18,926
- Let's go.   - Cheap food?

186
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:22,526
I think you should thank her.

187
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,486
She asked me to buy some food.

188
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:28,526
Ms. Ing really cares about you.

189
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:32,166
She wants you to eat well and feel better.

190
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,006
I do.

191
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:39,486
Please have something. I paid for these. Please.

192
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:45,326
Then please eat with us, Ms. Ing.

193
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,806
Okay. I'm happy to.

194
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:49,022
Okay.

195
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:51,806
I'll set up the table.

196
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:53,686
- Thank you. It's heavy.   - Thank you.

197
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:55,166
You're welcome.

198
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:56,886
Eat whatever you like.

199
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:01,566
Let's go.

200
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:09,846
I finally got Apo's number.

201
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:16,486
Was I right to help you?

202
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:20,366
Why did you?

203
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:22,925
I felt sorry for you.

204
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:25,206
I can tell you have zero socializing skills.

205
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:26,726
Who's a zero?

206
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,686
I offered to help her pay off her debt,

207
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,046
but she's grateful for cheap food.

208
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,286
Listen.

209
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,972
If you want to approach someone,

210
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,268
study them first

211
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:37,646
and see what they're like.

212
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:42,166
Sometimes, a little favor goes a long way.

213
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,310
Got it?

214
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,286
You're annoying.

215
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,206
By the way, let me ask you this.

216
00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:56,486
Why do you want to get close to Ms. Apo?

217
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:00,246
I like her.

218
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:03,166
Got it?

219
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,766
Like her?

220
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,886
Like her in what way?

221
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:08,918
In "that" way.

222
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:47,486
(Why did you grab and stop me?)

223
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:02,966
Hey, man!

224
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:04,846
It looks like you have competition.

225
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:06,686
What competition?

226
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:09,686
It's not just Uncle Din now.

227
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:13,886
There's another person who likes Ms. Apo.

228
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,086
Who?

229
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,166
- I'm not sure if...   - No. Don't tell me.

230
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,934
Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

231
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,085
Good. You don't have to know.

232
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:28,558
It's impossible, anyway. Ms. Apo's already with Uncle Din.

233
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:30,973
Tin!

234
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:32,726
Get your butt out of here!

235
00:19:32,886 --> 00:19:36,006
I ran away from you, and you're here to rub salt in my wound.

236
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:41,306
I caught it.

237
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:46,926
I'm here to tell you the news.

238
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:57,397
Mueang sure is a tricky one.

239
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:59,526
We're starting construction soon,

240
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,206
and he hasn't moved his workers out yet!

241
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:03,606
What should I do?

242
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:05,446
Hey, Apo.

243
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:07,926
Hey.

244
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,926
Are you listening to me? Are you?

245
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,046
I am.

246
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:15,846
How should I deal with my son?

247
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:20,086
Mr. Phudin.

248
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:23,526
Why would you turn Bo Phloi into a café and a garden?

249
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:25,406
Because it has no value.

250
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:27,886
I'm trying to increase its value.

251
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,846
There should be a way to keep Bo Phloi

252
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:32,934
and do something else to increase its value.

253
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:35,326
There's no way. I've thought about this.

254
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:40,166
I just thought if you and Mueang meet halfway,

255
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:41,966
there should be a good solution.

256
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,526
Never!

257
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,326
I've been letting him have his way all this time.

258
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:48,926
This time, it's his turn to let me have my way.

259
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:51,286
You need to deal with him. Got it?

260
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:56,966
Okay.

261
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:05,966
What do I do?

262
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:10,046
- Mango with sweet fish sauce?   - This is awesome.

263
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:12,046
I told the directors

264
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:17,046
I was going to tell Din to make this our park's souvenir.

265
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:20,766
You're working hard these days.

266
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,686
Are you trying to win him over?

267
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,246
I'm tired from work.

268
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:32,726
You're right to come to the two of us.

269
00:21:33,061 --> 00:21:36,726
That's right. Nobody knows Mr. Phudin and Mr. Mueang better than we do.

270
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,966
- Why are you leaning against each other?   - Split.

271
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:46,126
Tell me what you want.

272
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:50,286
I think the best way to find a solution

273
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:53,286
is for Mr. Phudin and Mueang to sit down and talk.

274
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:55,006
Who do you think you are?

275
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:57,606
I've been trying that all my life with no luck.

276
00:21:58,406 --> 00:21:59,766
You need to understand.

277
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,246
Those two are polar opposites.

278
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,246
How are they different?

279
00:22:04,566 --> 00:22:06,566
Din is progressive.

280
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:09,206
Mueang is conservative.

281
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:11,846
Mueang is conservative?

282
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:13,646
He is.

283
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,566
I don't think so.

284
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:20,374
Who are you to know better than I do?

285
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:24,326
You're right.

286
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,830
It's because of these differences

287
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:29,846
that their views on business are nothing alike.

288
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:35,126
That's why those two can never talk nicely.

289
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,509
The only way is...

290
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:46,206
Deal with it.

291
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:56,726
From now on,

292
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,726
I'm on Team Ms. Stepmother.

293
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:02,286
- Me too.   - Fab.

294
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:05,366
Hey, when did Ms. Stepmother win you over?

295
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:11,046
Whoa! When Mr. Phudin asked us to disguise and kidnap her aunt!

296
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:13,766
I really feel sorry for her.

297
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,926
She's really like Cinderella, you think?

298
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:19,526
I agree. I think we should support Ms. Stepmother.

299
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:21,926
- That's right! Come here!   - That's right.

300
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:24,406
Okay, you good people.

301
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:28,406
Do that if you want Young Master to eat you alive.

302
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:30,726
Yeah. She's right.

303
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:32,446
Have you seen Mueang?

304
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:47,278
Why didn't they close the doors?

305
00:23:59,581 --> 00:24:00,766
Did someone break in?

306
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:12,446
Is the light still on too?

307
00:24:13,942 --> 00:24:15,366
Do I need to turn it off myself?

308
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:28,166
Why are you here?

309
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:30,686
Poe said I could find you here.

310
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:33,766
Go back.

311
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,126
Wait.

312
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:38,406
I'm here to talk about Bo Phloi.

313
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:40,966
What is it? Do you want to kick me out too?

314
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:46,366
Mueang, you need to evacuate your workers by tomorrow.

315
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,646
I won't.

316
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:51,126
Please don't be stubborn.

317
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:53,045
The project has to proceed.

318
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:54,686
I won't let it proceed.

319
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,783
Listen, I was being a bit nice to you. It doesn't mean we're good now.

320
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:03,166
We're still on opposing sides.

321
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,966
Please tell my old man

322
00:25:07,142 --> 00:25:09,166
no one is going anywhere.

323
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:15,726
Who turned off the lights?

324
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,203
- Open up!   - Mueang.

325
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:32,326
- It won't open?   - No.

326
00:25:32,886 --> 00:25:34,846
(1 minute earlier)

327
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:52,366
Is someone outside? Open up!

328
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:56,566
Son!

329
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,606
Call someone, please.

330
00:26:23,286 --> 00:26:24,686
My phone's dead.

331
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:28,206
Why does it always die at times like this?

332
00:26:34,745 --> 00:26:36,446
What should we do now?

333
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,686
If we keep shouting, someone might come.

334
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:45,606
Is someone outside?

335
00:26:46,726 --> 00:26:49,366
- Hello? Can you hear me?   - Open up!

336
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:53,286
- Help!   - Help me!

337
00:26:53,438 --> 00:26:56,046
Is someone outside?

338
00:26:56,326 --> 00:26:58,709
Is someone there?

339
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:01,526
- Is there nobody at all?   - Hello!

340
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:05,646
- Hello!   - Whoa.

341
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:12,486
Look, Mueang.

342
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:15,366
The workers' shelter is nearby, isn't it?

343
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:18,006
Why can't they hear us?

344
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:21,206
Today is payday. They're all drunk.

345
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:26,086
What do we do?

346
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:30,286
Aum? There's Aum.

347
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:33,046
If you're lost, he'll look for you!

348
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,406
Young Master?

349
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:40,486
Young Master?

350
00:27:41,357 --> 00:27:42,766
Why did you go to bed early?

351
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:44,766
I should go and binge-watch some shows.

352
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:49,966
Aum?

353
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:51,846
He won't come looking for me.

354
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:54,526
He won't?

355
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:58,486
My old man will probably look for you.

356
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:01,726
If he notices you're gone, he'll come.

357
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,566
Social detox.

358
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,406
It's our time, Bunny.

359
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,726
Come on.

360
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,126
I don't think Mr. Phudin will come looking for me.

361
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:27,686
We're not that close.

362
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,846
Then we have to wait until someone comes by.

363
00:28:30,966 --> 00:28:33,446
- Really?   - It's all we can do.

364
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,406
What are you doing?

365
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:53,526
Hello?

366
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,766
Do you know how to survive?

367
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:03,446
Hey, wait!

368
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:05,966
Why would you take your shirt off?

369
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:08,166
It's hot.

370
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,686
Put it back on.

371
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,646
Mueang, I'm wearing a tank top.

372
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,566
Are you really that conservative?

373
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:20,086
I'm not conservative.

374
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:24,246
We're not a couple. You shouldn't let me see you naked.

375
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:26,206
Naked?

376
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:47,310
Mueang, is this your mom?

377
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,126
You're like your mom.

378
00:29:55,478 --> 00:29:56,606
Move.

379
00:29:58,326 --> 00:29:59,526
Don't touch these.

380
00:30:01,221 --> 00:30:02,926
Why are these photos here?

381
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,606
They used to be hung outside when I was a kid.

382
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:13,326
Go and stay there!

383
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:30,446
Mueang, what are you doing?

384
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,326
Don't cross this line.

385
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:33,846
Sit down.

386
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:36,086
Sit.

387
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:41,966
Sit... I don't really want to cross it.

388
00:31:13,718 --> 00:31:14,926
Mueang.

389
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:18,566
I understand.

390
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,726
You want to keep Bo Phloi because it was your mom's business.

391
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:26,526
It's not just that.

392
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:30,462
You said I was conservative.

393
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,366
Let me ask you this.

394
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:35,966
Has someone like my dad done anything good for the world?

395
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,406
All they do is destroy.

396
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,086
Our world will end because of people like them.

397
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:44,886
Why don't you say that to Mr. Phudin?

398
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:46,526
Do you think I never did?

399
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:49,206
I did. He never listened.

400
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:52,705
What if I say

401
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:55,366
I can help you reach an agreement with Mr. Phudin?

402
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,166
You can't.

403
00:31:58,477 --> 00:32:00,726
I know you think I'm an outsider.

404
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:02,686
But it's because I'm an outsider

405
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:05,126
that I see all your problems

406
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:07,966
- can easily end when you and Mr. Phudin talk...   - Get out!

407
00:32:12,086 --> 00:32:13,286
Stay away!

408
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:16,406
- Mueang.   - Go away!

409
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:19,446
- Mueang!   - Don't!

410
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:46,606
Take it away!

411
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:48,126
Take it away!

412
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:53,605
What's wrong with you? Why would you be scared? It's so little.

413
00:32:53,686 --> 00:32:55,326
Take it away!

414
00:32:55,486 --> 00:32:56,806
Aren't you scared?

415
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:13,166
- Is it gone?   - It's gone.

416
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:14,646
Make sure it's gone!

417
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:16,086
Don't let it come back!

418
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:18,606
It's really gone.

419
00:33:23,565 --> 00:33:24,926
Look, Mueang.

420
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:27,743
I didn't know you were afraid of tarantulas.

421
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:29,446
Everyone is.

422
00:33:29,614 --> 00:33:31,446
It's a phobia, you know?

423
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,926
I know.

424
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:37,166
I was surprised by your scream.

425
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:38,726
It was high-pitched.

426
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,646
Are you making fun of me?

427
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,806
I'm not.

428
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:48,286
I can tell you are.

429
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,566
Okay. I won't tell anyone.

430
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:55,246
Like I believe you.

431
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:04,246
Look, Mueang. You said I couldn't help you.

432
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:06,926
Actually, I probably can.

433
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:11,046
You just need to open up.

434
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,726
Go back to your space.

435
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,646
Why don't you go back to yours?

436
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,326
I'll be here.

437
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:11,646
If you're tired, you can sleep.

438
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:13,846
We're stuck until morning.

439
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:20,566
Why aren't you sleeping?

440
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:22,566
I don't like to sleep with strangers.

441
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:24,046
Shut your mouth.

442
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:25,566
I don't want to talk.

443
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,726
Young Master? Ms. Stepmother?

444
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:31,566
Young Master? Ms. Stepmother?

445
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:33,846
Can you hear me? Wake up!

446
00:36:44,726 --> 00:36:46,446
Wait! You?

447
00:36:46,527 --> 00:36:47,806
How did you get here?

448
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,766
I'm the one that needs to ask. How did you get here?

449
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:52,326
- Answer me!   - Answer me!

450
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:57,654
I think you should stop arguing and think. Think slowly

451
00:36:57,741 --> 00:36:59,366
about what happened.

452
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:24,366
It's you. You rolled over to me first.

453
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,819
Are you nuts? You rolled over to me first.

454
00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:30,989
Wait! So, who rolled first?

455
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:55,726
I'm 100% sure. You rolled over to me first.

456
00:37:56,238 --> 00:37:57,846
You're lying.

457
00:37:58,046 --> 00:37:59,686
I was sleeping still right here.

458
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,687
You weren't sleeping still. You rolled around everywhere.

459
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:03,687
- You...   - Wait!

460
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:06,366
I think we should look at the CCTV.

461
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:07,846
- There's no CCTV!   - There's no CCTV!

462
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:12,438
So, how did you two end up here?

463
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:14,566
- Because of you!   - Because of you!

464
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:17,286
Me? What did I do?

465
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:19,446
- Did you lock the doors last night?   - I did.

466
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:22,288
Yeah! Apo and I got stuck in here because of you!

467
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,686
Really? I thought no one was inside here.

468
00:38:26,798 --> 00:38:27,917
But there were!

469
00:38:28,046 --> 00:38:31,746
Next time, check carefully. Mueang and I were talking about work.

470
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,509
I'm sorry. I really am.

471
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,846
I won't make the same mistake. Forgive me.

472
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:39,527
- I won't forgive you!   - I won't forgive you!

473
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:49,766
What's wrong?

474
00:38:50,446 --> 00:38:53,646
Calm down. Stop arguing!

475
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:57,606
Slowly. You can leave one by one!

476
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:01,503
Why are they in such a hurry?

477
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,797
Apo!

478
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,646
Did you go to bed late last night and wake up late?

479
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:39,726
I knocked on your door this morning, but you didn't answer.

480
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:43,366
Look at you.

481
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:45,486
You haven't taken a shower,

482
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:47,614
and you're wearing yesterday's outfit.

483
00:39:47,878 --> 00:39:49,166
So does that mean

484
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:52,326
you fell asleep on your desk while working?

485
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,006
Yes, I did.

486
00:39:55,341 --> 00:39:57,526
Go take a shower. Quick.

487
00:39:57,717 --> 00:39:59,486
Everyone's waiting for you for breakfast.

488
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:02,686
- Okay.   - Let's go, Din. Let's eat.

489
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,766
No one noticed I was gone?

490
00:40:28,686 --> 00:40:30,686
You binge-watched some shows all night long, didn't you?

491
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:32,806
I did.

492
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:35,197
If I died, my body would have rotted by now.

493
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:37,686
I thought you went to bed early.

494
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:39,406
Have I ever?

495
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:42,846
I thought you took some sleeping pills.

496
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:45,966
Couldn't you just take a peek inside?

497
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,166
Hey, that's enough.

498
00:40:48,686 --> 00:40:50,886
Why would you blame him? What's done is done.

499
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,926
You can say that. You didn't have to sleep on a hard floor.

500
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:58,926
Why didn't you carry your phone with you, you silly?

501
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,766
You couldn't reach anyone, and you blamed everyone else. It's your fault.

502
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:07,846
When you were stuck in that room, did you see a ghost?

503
00:41:07,975 --> 00:41:09,406
That place is haunted!

504
00:41:09,526 --> 00:41:10,846
I didn't.

505
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:12,541
I saw a witch.

506
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:18,646
A witch? Who?

507
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:20,926
Why would I know?

508
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:28,566
What are you looking at? Get out!

509
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:33,206
It looks like the witch cursed him.

510
00:41:33,478 --> 00:41:34,926
Or he got possessed.

511
00:41:42,821 --> 00:41:45,046
Mueang will not evacuate his workers.

512
00:41:46,646 --> 00:41:48,006
I'm not surprised.

513
00:41:49,446 --> 00:41:51,886
I think he has other reasons.

514
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:53,646
It's not just about his mom.

515
00:41:53,798 --> 00:41:55,086
Thanks.

516
00:41:55,286 --> 00:41:56,806
I'll handle the rest myself.

517
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:13,206
You didn't come back to your bedroom last night, did you?

518
00:42:18,213 --> 00:42:21,126
I won't tell Mr. Phudin. Don't worry.

519
00:42:22,614 --> 00:42:24,206
You can tell him.

520
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:26,046
I didn't mean to hide anything.

521
00:42:26,158 --> 00:42:27,966
Let me warn you.

522
00:42:28,486 --> 00:42:31,366
Whatever you're trying to do, it won't work.

523
00:42:31,597 --> 00:42:33,046
You're an outsider.

524
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:36,806
I understand you don't trust me.

525
00:42:36,926 --> 00:42:38,318
I'm glad you know that.

526
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:40,406
I might not have been honest,

527
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,246
but I think it's time for me to speak up.

528
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:47,206
Don't try to reconcile Mr. Phudin and Mr. Mueang.

529
00:42:47,605 --> 00:42:49,246
It's not your job.

530
00:42:50,973 --> 00:42:52,446
Mrs. Sita.

531
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,766
Everything that I'm trying to do,

532
00:42:55,046 --> 00:42:56,766
I mean no harm.

533
00:42:57,765 --> 00:42:59,926
You don't have to believe me now.

534
00:43:00,086 --> 00:43:02,966
All I ask is that you remember what I said.

535
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:05,806
Someday, you will understand.

536
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:17,486
Mom! I really can't make it tomorrow.

537
00:43:17,686 --> 00:43:20,366
(TinTin, why are you so busy?)

538
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:23,486
Your dad and I came all the way to your store, and you're not here!

539
00:43:23,646 --> 00:43:26,006
Are you trying to avoid us?

540
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:28,557
Mom, this is me.

541
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:31,726
It's me, TinTin. I'm a real one. I don't avoid anyone.

542
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:35,886
You're a real one? Then, come and meet Kwang, my friend's daughter.

543
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:40,726
She's your type. She looks just like Lisa.

544
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,166
Next time, Mom.

545
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:45,326
A lot of customers are coming to the store tomorrow.

546
00:43:45,438 --> 00:43:47,446
See? You're avoiding us!

547
00:43:47,597 --> 00:43:49,446
(I'm so stressed out.)

548
00:43:49,606 --> 00:43:51,481
You're almost 30, and you still don't have a girlfriend.

549
00:43:51,614 --> 00:43:53,086
Mueang is single too, Mom.

550
00:43:53,206 --> 00:43:54,566
Just date each other already!

551
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:57,526
(That way, you both have someone. I don't want to match you anymore.)

552
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,807
- Mom.  -  I don't care.

553
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:01,566
You must come next time,

554
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:03,046
or I'll really be mad.

555
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:05,366
Okay. Next time it is, Mom.

556
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:07,846
See you at home. I have to go.

557
00:44:08,086 --> 00:44:10,606
Love you, Mom. Kisses!

558
00:44:15,326 --> 00:44:17,326
TinTin is still stubborn.

559
00:44:17,477 --> 00:44:20,086
At this rate, when are we getting grandchildren?

560
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:21,486
Don't complain!

561
00:44:21,646 --> 00:44:24,486
Who was the one that spoiled him too much?

562
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:25,966
It's you!

563
00:44:29,094 --> 00:44:30,726
Why is that my fault?

564
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:49,446
(Are you nuts? You rolled over to me first.)

565
00:45:06,686 --> 00:45:09,717
(The following is not a real event.)

566
00:45:09,806 --> 00:45:14,462
(The characters are lying. Viewer discretion is advised.)

567
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:18,686
Why would I lie?

568
00:45:19,478 --> 00:45:22,046
That's not the truth!

569
00:45:22,379 --> 00:45:25,806
(Real event at 12.30 am)

570
00:46:30,422 --> 00:46:31,870
I shouldn't have.

571
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,806
I shouldn't have done that!

572
00:46:44,853 --> 00:46:46,526
(You rolled over to me first.)

573
00:47:07,446 --> 00:47:09,899
(The following is not a real event.)

574
00:47:09,979 --> 00:47:13,926
(The characters are lying. Viewer discretion is advised.)

575
00:47:16,797 --> 00:47:19,246
You can go to hell for lying, Apo!

576
00:47:20,157 --> 00:47:21,686
Why did I do that?

577
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:25,126
The truth is...

578
00:47:25,655 --> 00:47:31,606
(Real event at 12.45 am)

579
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:54,966
Did he know I wasn't asleep?

580
00:49:02,255 --> 00:49:03,542
Mueang!

581
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:05,166
What the heck have you done?

582
00:49:11,477 --> 00:49:14,566
Die! Just die already!

583
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:22,166
Hey, Mueang! I'm heading out to ship my plants.

584
00:49:25,518 --> 00:49:27,366
Why is your forehead so red?

585
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:29,526
- Tin!   - What?

586
00:49:31,286 --> 00:49:33,246
I think I can't co-exist with Apo anymore!

587
00:49:33,454 --> 00:49:34,806
What do you mean?

588
00:49:36,526 --> 00:49:39,806
Mueang! You can't do anything to Apo!

589
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:43,166
Mueang! You need to calm down!

590
00:49:43,286 --> 00:49:46,646
- I am calm. I won't stop.   - If you are, you must stop.

591
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:49,726
- This is not calm at all.   - I told you I am calm.

592
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,286
Listen to me. Think of BBQ.

593
00:49:52,374 --> 00:49:53,925
Hot BBQ on a grill.

594
00:49:54,022 --> 00:49:57,166
It's smelling so good. It's sizzling. You're having some sauce.

595
00:49:57,398 --> 00:50:01,166
Eat it. Yeah. Calm down.

596
00:50:03,077 --> 00:50:05,246
Come here. You need to come with me.

597
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,430
- What are you doing, Mueang? Let me go.   - We need to talk!

598
00:50:07,677 --> 00:50:09,677
- About what?   - Let Ms. Apo go!

599
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,798
- Tin, why are you holding me? I won't!   - Let Ms. Apo go!

600
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:13,126
- Let her go!   - You let me go!

601
00:50:13,229 --> 00:50:14,966
Let me go! Let go!

602
00:50:15,126 --> 00:50:17,366
- Mueang!   - Listen to me!

603
00:50:18,126 --> 00:50:19,446
- Let her go!   - What's this now?

604
00:50:21,637 --> 00:50:25,726
Ms. Apo has a date with me today. You're not taking her anywhere. Let go!

605
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,086
When did you come?

606
00:50:27,206 --> 00:50:29,365
I'll be anywhere Ms. Apo is. Let her go!

607
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:30,726
You let her go!

608
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:32,446
- I won't.   - Then I won't.

609
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,686
- You won't?   - She's coming with me.

610
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:36,579
- She's coming with me!   - You let me go!

611
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:37,726
Let me go now!

612
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:38,913
Apo's coming with me.

613
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:41,326
- She's coming with me!   - Stop!

614
00:50:42,326 --> 00:50:44,126
She's coming with me!

615
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:46,846
- Tin, let go!  - Stop!

616
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:48,366
Come here!

617
00:50:48,494 --> 00:50:52,086
Stop!

618
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:53,886
You're playing like kids.

619
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:55,846
Is Ms. Apo a toy to you guys?

620
00:50:57,486 --> 00:50:59,446
Let's go, Ms. Apo. Leave them here.

621
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,715
- Okay.   - Ms. Apo.

622
00:51:00,806 --> 00:51:03,391
Stay there! Calm yourselves!

623
00:51:03,472 --> 00:51:04,831
Stand together!

624
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:07,206
Go!

625
00:51:08,246 --> 00:51:10,206
If you don't stop, I'll tell Uncle Din.

626
00:51:10,781 --> 00:51:12,326
I'm going to tell your dad.

627
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:13,926
Your dad...

628
00:51:14,846 --> 00:51:17,606
- Let's go.   - Are you going to steal her just like that?

629
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:20,006
Yeah, Tin. You betrayed me!

630
00:51:20,126 --> 00:51:21,646
- He did!   - Yeah.

631
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:26,846
What? Why are you standing so close?

632
00:51:27,357 --> 00:51:28,766
As if I want to get close to you!

633
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:33,326
I said stay there and calm yourselves! Both of you!

634
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,246
Thank you for helping me, Tin.

635
00:51:51,726 --> 00:51:54,686
You're welcome. Those guys are zombies.

636
00:51:56,518 --> 00:51:58,926
I wonder what Mueang wanted to talk about.

637
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:00,926
Pay him no mind.

638
00:52:01,054 --> 00:52:02,566
He's been crazy these days.

639
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:04,766
You should stay away from him.

640
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:07,246
Okay.

641
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:10,166
Does Ms. Ing come here to see you every day?

642
00:52:10,366 --> 00:52:13,166
Yeah. She wants me to have lunch with her today.

643
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:17,166
That's bold of her. She must like you a lot.

644
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:18,686
What?

645
00:52:18,813 --> 00:52:20,926
You can't tell?

646
00:52:21,117 --> 00:52:22,726
Tell what?

647
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:26,286
Ms. Ing...

648
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:33,726
No! You got it wrong, Tin.

649
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:36,326
Ms. Ing doesn't like me in that way.

650
00:52:36,446 --> 00:52:38,726
I saw her hitting on you.

651
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:43,086
She just wants something from me.

652
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,206
It looks like you have competition.

653
00:52:56,789 --> 00:52:58,086
What competition?

654
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:00,926
It's not just Uncle Din now.

655
00:53:02,157 --> 00:53:03,157
What?

656
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:05,366
There's another person who likes Ms. Apo.

657
00:53:09,574 --> 00:53:11,006
(Was he talking about her?)

658
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:19,366
It's been a long time. Are you stunned by my beauty?

659
00:53:20,717 --> 00:53:22,166
Don't you have a mirror at home?

660
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,366
After all this time, you're still a jerk as ever.

661
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:29,126
Keep criticizing me.

662
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:30,869
As if you're an angel.

663
00:53:41,861 --> 00:53:43,926
Hi. My name is Ing.

664
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,686
I'm Mueang.

665
00:53:47,734 --> 00:53:50,206
What are you watching? May I watch with you?

666
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:05,766
Oh! I already saw this one. In the end, the girl dies.

667
00:54:07,686 --> 00:54:09,126
Why did you spoil it for me?

668
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,326
I'm leaving. It's old and boring.

669
00:54:13,592 --> 00:54:16,926
Why... Whoa!

670
00:54:17,126 --> 00:54:20,846
I'll keep taking snapshots, okay?

671
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:24,181
Let's go! Yeah! That's good.

672
00:54:24,486 --> 00:54:25,966
Peek a boo!

673
00:54:26,586 --> 00:54:29,892
Mueang! Get away! I'm taking photos of Ing.

674
00:54:29,973 --> 00:54:31,806
- Go. Come back later.   - Go!

675
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,606
Ready?

676
00:54:34,366 --> 00:54:35,606
Mueang!

677
00:54:36,886 --> 00:54:39,206
Mueang, go away!

678
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:40,726
Mueang!

679
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,406
- Whoa!   - What's that?

680
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:45,206
Serves you right. You bothered me first.

681
00:54:45,518 --> 00:54:47,006
Do you want to fight?

682
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:49,486
Do you want to fight?

683
00:54:51,598 --> 00:54:54,606
- Let her go! Don't fight!   - Let go!

684
00:54:54,772 --> 00:54:56,061
Don't interfere!

685
00:54:56,216 --> 00:54:57,926
It hurts. Ouch!

686
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:00,635
If you fight each other, you'll end up together!

687
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:02,766
- Ugh! I'm going to throw up!   - Ugh! I'm going to throw up!

688
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:06,006
- Let me go!   - Look at them.

689
00:55:09,846 --> 00:55:11,846
We're adults now.

690
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:14,126
Let's not twist each other's back like children.

691
00:55:14,246 --> 00:55:17,446
Agree. Listen to me and do as I say.

692
00:55:18,342 --> 00:55:20,006
Leave Apo alone.

693
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:23,286
Why would I?

694
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:25,486
Are you jealous of her, your stepmother?

695
00:55:27,834 --> 00:55:29,197
I'm not jealous!

696
00:55:29,313 --> 00:55:31,246
Do you want to go to hell or what?

697
00:55:31,406 --> 00:55:33,446
- You're hitting on someone's wife.   - What?

698
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,486
Who is someone's wife?

699
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:38,686
Are you delusional?

700
00:55:39,686 --> 00:55:42,926
Alright. I'll forget you said anything.

701
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,926
I'll let it go since

702
00:55:45,157 --> 00:55:46,726
it's just nonsense.

703
00:55:47,286 --> 00:55:49,208
Hey, are you pretending you don't know?

704
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:50,606
Who's pretending?

705
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,926
What's wrong? You seem to panic.

706
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:56,366
Oh, Ms. Apo!

707
00:55:57,045 --> 00:55:58,366
Ms. Apo!

708
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:05,406
Ms. Ing, I can't go with you today.

709
00:56:05,526 --> 00:56:07,206
Why not?

710
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:09,886
I need to talk to Mueang.

711
00:56:13,446 --> 00:56:14,766
Okay.

712
00:56:16,557 --> 00:56:17,886
Let's talk over there.

713
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:20,229
- Talk nicely, please.   - Yeah!

714
00:56:22,286 --> 00:56:23,446
Let's go.

715
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:24,958
Let's go.

716
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:36,246
Why are you standing in my way? Move!

717
00:56:36,406 --> 00:56:38,006
You approached the wrong person.

718
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:43,606
She just wants something from me.

719
00:56:44,117 --> 00:56:45,566
What something?

720
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:49,046
If I'm right,

721
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:52,326
she wants me to sell her Mueang's mom's necklace.

722
00:56:55,806 --> 00:56:57,806
Whatever it is you want from Apo,

723
00:56:58,046 --> 00:56:59,486
she can't give it to you.

724
00:57:00,029 --> 00:57:01,286
Don't waste your time.

725
00:57:02,015 --> 00:57:03,526
Do you know what I want?

726
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:04,966
I do!

727
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:07,526
Don't waste your time. Trust me.

728
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,566
Look.

729
00:57:18,452 --> 00:57:21,126
Is that Ing girl bothering you a lot?

730
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:23,726
Not much. Why?

731
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:26,926
So you wanted to talk about Ing?

732
00:57:28,677 --> 00:57:32,486
No. I just don't like her.

733
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:34,966
What does it have to do with me?

734
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:37,486
So, what do you want to talk about?

735
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:42,886
I want to talk about last night.

736
00:57:45,326 --> 00:57:46,646
What about last night?

737
00:57:48,374 --> 00:57:50,486
I think you know what I'm referring to.

738
00:57:52,062 --> 00:57:53,446
What is it?

739
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:55,566
Or...

740
00:57:57,246 --> 00:57:59,366
Did you do anything while I was asleep?

741
00:58:00,381 --> 00:58:01,526
You're mad.

742
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:03,926
I didn't do anything.

743
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:08,926
(Real event at 12.45 am)

744
01:00:11,214 --> 01:00:13,726
I mean the things you did to me.

745
01:00:16,606 --> 01:00:18,806
(Real event at 4.48 am)

746
01:00:29,086 --> 01:00:31,366
If you cross my line once again,

747
01:00:31,957 --> 01:00:33,606
I'll kick you out of here.

748
01:00:35,406 --> 01:00:38,446
If you thought I crossed the line, I apologize.

749
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:39,726
But...

750
01:00:40,486 --> 01:00:43,646
Last night, I really had to do that.

751
01:00:44,526 --> 01:00:45,886
Mueang. Well...

752
01:00:46,879 --> 01:00:48,286
You sleepwalked.

753
01:00:49,651 --> 01:00:50,846
I sleepwalked?

754
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:54,086
Did I do anything strange?

755
01:00:54,614 --> 01:00:57,246
It's not strange.

756
01:00:57,645 --> 01:00:59,806
I know there are people with this condition.

757
01:00:59,887 --> 01:01:03,566
I have read somewhere that it occurs when you're stressed.

758
01:01:04,966 --> 01:01:06,566
No. I wasn't stressed.

759
01:01:06,952 --> 01:01:09,526
It's just that it wasn't my bedroom. It's a normal reaction.

760
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:12,406
It's happened before.

761
01:01:13,598 --> 01:01:14,726
Not often.

762
01:01:14,886 --> 01:01:18,646
But if it happens when you're alone, it's dangerous.

763
01:01:18,773 --> 01:01:21,126
- You might have an accident...   - I'm fine.

764
01:01:22,606 --> 01:01:24,646
Don't tell anyone, okay?

765
01:01:31,277 --> 01:01:33,206
Aum!

766
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:36,966
Someone's here to see Young Master.

767
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:39,846
- Who?   - Let's go. Come with me.

768
01:01:39,973 --> 01:01:41,286
Who is it?

769
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:46,949
Look. You can never tell anyone.

770
01:01:47,561 --> 01:01:49,166
I won't.

771
01:01:49,286 --> 01:01:50,806
But look, Mueang.

772
01:01:51,646 --> 01:01:53,366
Can I say something?

773
01:01:55,309 --> 01:01:56,486
Go ahead.

774
01:01:57,686 --> 01:02:01,806
Well, last night...

775
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:07,366
You can take that call.

776
01:02:10,926 --> 01:02:12,806
- What is it?   - (Hello? Young Master?)

777
01:02:12,901 --> 01:02:14,726
(Please come to Bo Phloi right now.)

778
01:02:14,933 --> 01:02:16,726
Why? What's going on?

779
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:18,926
Someone is here to kick us out, Young Master.

780
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:22,446
You all will pack up and leave today.

781
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:24,926
How? We've been here all this time.

782
01:02:25,086 --> 01:02:27,846
I don't care. It's time. You have to leave!

783
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:30,766
Did my old man send them?

784
01:02:30,933 --> 01:02:33,446
They said Ms. Apo sent them.

785
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:38,966
What? What's going on?

786
01:02:39,086 --> 01:02:40,686
(What should we do? Young Master?)

787
01:02:42,006 --> 01:02:44,406
Tell them to go home if they don't want to be in trouble.

788
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:47,166
I'm with Apo right now. I'll talk to her.

789
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:51,534
Come with me.

790
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:53,886
What? Mueang? What's going on?

791
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:00,926
Mueang, what's going on?

792
01:03:01,302 --> 01:03:02,542
Where are you taking me?

793
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:05,029
I told you not to cross my line.

794
01:03:06,006 --> 01:03:07,526
What did I do to cross your line?

795
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:11,686
You sent someone to kick my workers out!

796
01:03:12,366 --> 01:03:13,766
I did not.

797
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:16,446
Are you saying my dad used your name?

798
01:03:16,712 --> 01:03:19,646
Mueang, I really don't have anything to do with this.

799
01:03:22,293 --> 01:03:25,646
Even if my dad used your name, you're on his side anyway.

800
01:03:26,701 --> 01:03:28,966
Mueang, listen to me.

801
01:03:29,293 --> 01:03:31,406
I did not agree with Mr. Phudin.

802
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:33,430
At first,

803
01:03:33,534 --> 01:03:35,486
I thought we could just leave each other alone.

804
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:38,526
Now I think one of us has to go!

805
01:03:43,206 --> 01:03:45,926
What does it take for you to leave?

806
01:03:46,606 --> 01:03:51,246
- What do you want?   - Mueang, can we pull over and talk nicely?

807
01:03:51,422 --> 01:03:53,086
What do I have to give you

808
01:03:53,254 --> 01:03:55,166
to make you leave my life?

809
01:04:00,886 --> 01:04:04,246
Mueang, pull over, please. You're going too fast.

810
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,606
Answer me!

811
01:04:30,063 --> 01:04:31,486
Mueang.

812
01:04:32,006 --> 01:04:34,566
I'll talk to Mr. Phudin.

813
01:04:35,086 --> 01:04:37,926
No one will go anywhere, okay?

814
01:04:39,574 --> 01:04:42,006
I was trying to tell you

815
01:04:42,526 --> 01:04:43,886
that

816
01:04:44,325 --> 01:04:47,086
I made a mistake by following Mr. Phudin's orders.

817
01:04:47,966 --> 01:04:49,486
From now on,

818
01:04:49,654 --> 01:04:52,526
I'll do what I think is the right thing, okay?

819
01:04:54,982 --> 01:04:56,286
Get out.

820
01:04:59,766 --> 01:05:01,006
Get out.

821
01:05:05,006 --> 01:05:06,526
I hope we never meet again.

822
01:06:29,244 --> 01:06:30,606
Ms. Apo?

823
01:06:31,198 --> 01:06:32,566
Would you like to get in?

824
01:07:04,236 --> 01:07:07,366
I need to drop off my shipment.

825
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:09,526
Then I'll take you home.

826
01:07:11,366 --> 01:07:12,886
You can take your time.

827
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:14,846
I don't want to bother you.

828
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:17,486
I'll deal with my jerk of a friend.

829
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,246
He dropped you off in the middle of nowhere.

830
01:07:21,606 --> 01:07:23,086
It's fine.

831
01:07:24,286 --> 01:07:26,446
Mueang has the right to do that.

832
01:07:27,781 --> 01:07:30,326
Aren't you angry at him?

833
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:33,246
I feel sorry for him.

834
01:07:35,277 --> 01:07:37,397
I really admire your views.

835
01:07:39,846 --> 01:07:41,166
It's nothing.

836
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:47,446
If you have something on your mind, you can talk to me.

837
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:51,566
If Mueang does something to you, tell me. I'll deal with him.

838
01:08:03,766 --> 01:08:04,966
If you can't stand this,

839
01:08:05,086 --> 01:08:06,686
leave my gang now!

840
01:08:06,846 --> 01:08:10,206
You told me last night that someone's threatening your young master.

841
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:12,686
- Is it true?   - It is.

842
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:14,086
Have you seen Young Master?

843
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:15,886
What do you want with him?

844
01:08:16,062 --> 01:08:17,206
Stop!

845
01:08:18,212 --> 01:08:21,846
Change your mind, or I'll disown you!

846
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:26,326
If you keep pushing this and keep forcing him, you won't get what you want.

847
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:29,606
What's wrong with Din? Why is he not here yet?

848
01:08:29,846 --> 01:08:31,246
He had a fight with Mr. Mueang again.

849
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,326
- (Hey, Mueang.)   - (Mueang!)

850
01:08:33,605 --> 01:08:35,646
(Give me a nice smile.)
