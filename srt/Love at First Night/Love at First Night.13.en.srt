1
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,846
Is that Mueang's girlfriend?

2
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,888
Probably. I've seen her come to see him several times.

3
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:07,206
- Are you dating her right now?   - Why did you ask me that?

4
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:09,342
I'll take note of it if you're dating.

5
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:11,646
Phing, I'm going back to Bangkok.

6
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,366
I just want to let you know I'm not dating Ing.

7
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:17,006
(All I know is from this moment on,)

8
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,046
(my heartbeat)

9
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,726
(will never be the same.)

10
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:26,646
Don't wait until he's gone to realize that you want to say you love him.

11
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:28,526
From now on,

12
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:31,126
please smile a lot, Mueang.

13
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,046
Dad.

14
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,486
You called me "Dad?"

15
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,566
We didn't really know each other back then.

16
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:40,486
And I like her.

17
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,766
It was one-sided, though.

18
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:45,046
When I saw her here after that,

19
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,966
I thought she was here to scam both of us.

20
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:50,926
I...

21
00:02:51,662 --> 00:02:53,662
I should have told her that day.

22
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,933
I shouldn't have let it drag on this far.

23
00:02:58,982 --> 00:03:02,466
We all have something we want to say.

24
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:04,806
We just can't say it.

25
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,686
But today, I will.

26
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:13,446
I'm sorry, Mueang.

27
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:16,766
I shouldn't have come up with that crazy plan.

28
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:19,086
If it weren't for that plan,

29
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:24,326
you would be having the best time of your life right now.

30
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,766
You were having a good time in your life,

31
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:30,166
and I took that from you.

32
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:34,166
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:45,726
If you feel guilty,

34
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:49,006
just don't come up with any more messed up plans.

35
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:55,037
Do you know why

36
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:56,966
Apo agreed to my deal?

37
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,926
Can I take some time to think about this?

38
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,566
Do you know

39
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:14,806
before we die,

40
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,726
as parents,

41
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,646
what we want the most?

42
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,166
We want to be sure

43
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,166
that when we're gone,

44
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,886
our children

45
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,486
will be fine,

46
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:28,726
will live a good life,

47
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:32,006
and will be happy.

48
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,486
Even if

49
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,006
my son

50
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,766
never forgives me in this life,

51
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,366
I still wish that my life work

52
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:45,726
would give him a stable life.

53
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:51,806
If your son knows how much you love him,

54
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,966
he will surely forgive you.

55
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:57,286
He doesn't know.

56
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,286
Maybe he does, but he doesn't show it.

57
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,486
Okay.

58
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:06,286
Take your time and think about it.

59
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:13,646
I agree.

60
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:16,326
As a kid,

61
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:19,806
I used to be so angry with my parents.

62
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:23,894
I was living a good and happy life.

63
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:28,166
Suddenly, they left me.

64
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:31,446
They left me with a huge debt.

65
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:35,486
I asked myself every day.

66
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,726
"Does the world hate me?"

67
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:43,246
"Why are there only bad things in my life?"

68
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:48,646
When I got no answer, I just thought

69
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,086
the world really hated me.

70
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,286
Do you still think so?

71
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:01,366
I don't.

72
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:05,366
When I grew up, I realized

73
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,406
my parents were just two people

74
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:11,126
who never intended to hurt me.

75
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:15,806
If they were here right now,

76
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,606
they would be trying to make me happy.

77
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:25,286
It's just they're not here to do that.

78
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,086
Before my parents died,

79
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,886
I never told them how much I loved them.

80
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,046
I never thanked them

81
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:45,806
for making those 12 years of my life a happy time.

82
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:52,006
If I could turn back time,

83
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:55,766
I would hold them tightly

84
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:59,014
and thank them

85
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,686
for always being a good family to me.

86
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:05,926
Mr. Phudin.

87
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:09,886
If you can still save your family,

88
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:13,886
you must not give up.

89
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,086
Paying off the debt is not all she wanted.

90
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:27,606
She wanted to help you and me too.

91
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:30,726
She's been good to us.

92
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:33,126
She's been really good to us.

93
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:35,206
She's so good that

94
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,806
I don't know how to thank her.

95
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:41,606
So where is she now?

96
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,966
She's heading back to Bangkok.

97
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,766
She can't go on.

98
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:50,926
She doesn't want to wait for you.

99
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:53,846
She doesn't want to hurt you.

100
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,446
She's afraid you'd be angry

101
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:01,846
and hate her so much that you'd never forgive her.

102
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:06,286
I felt so guilty,

103
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,886
so I let her go.

104
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,326
Mueang.

105
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:13,606
I'm really sorry for how things turned out.

106
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:39,326
Young Master? How is Boss?

107
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:41,326
He's fine.

108
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:43,206
Tell the guys I'm heading to Bangkok.

109
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:45,966
- Prepare my car. I'll pack up.   - Yes.

110
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,206
Mueang?

111
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,046
How is Mr. Phudin?

112
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,486
Mueang.

113
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,006
Are you okay?

114
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:40,686
I'm okay.

115
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,326
I'm more than okay.

116
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,366
I saw the photo on Twitter

117
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,686
at the bus terminal, but I couldn't reach Mr. Phudin.

118
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,366
When the truck crashed,

119
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,966
he wasn't in there, so he was safe.

120
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,886
He's all right.

121
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:15,486
That's a relief. I was

122
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,309
worried sick all the way here.

123
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:27,366
Good.

124
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:31,246
It's good you're back.

125
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:40,006
Did Mr. Phudin tell you I'm going back to Bangkok?

126
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:48,046
I know

127
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:49,766
your wedding with my old man was fake.

128
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,486
My old man knows

129
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:53,366
about how we met before.

130
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:58,166
So what did Mr. Phudin say?

131
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:00,846
If it troubles you,

132
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,646
you can go and talk to him.

133
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:04,606
He's in his office.

134
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:09,126
Okay.

135
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:34,726
Mueang, please wait for me here.

136
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:36,926
Don't go anywhere.

137
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,766
Which car are you taking?

138
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:53,206
I'm not going anymore.

139
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:09,806
Mr. Phudin.

140
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:14,406
Are you still here?

141
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:19,806
Mueang said you knew about how we met before.

142
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:23,766
I'm sorry. I'm really ashamed.

143
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,446
It's me who should be ashamed.

144
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:29,406
I didn't tell you because

145
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,046
I was selfish.

146
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:35,606
I didn't want the fact that I knew Mueang

147
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:37,966
to get me fired from my job.

148
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:39,886
I wanted to get this project done.

149
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:42,366
I wanted to pay off the debt and leave.

150
00:12:42,502 --> 00:12:43,806
Look.

151
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:45,806
You don't have to explain yourself.

152
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:48,006
I'll make it up to you.

153
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:58,806
Mueang.

154
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:00,646
Why are you still here?

155
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:03,006
Well, you told me to wait here.

156
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:05,966
Sorry.

157
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:12,046
How did it go with my old man?

158
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,526
Then let's talk.

159
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:28,846
Thank you.

160
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:32,126
If it weren't for your effort,

161
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:34,246
I would never have talked to my dad.

162
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,086
Are you not angry?

163
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:39,686
Angry for what?

164
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:43,566
I lied to you about getting married to Mr. Phudin.

165
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:50,126
The one who deserves the most sympathy

166
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,046
is the one who knew everything

167
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:54,486
but could say nothing at all.

168
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:02,046
I'm sorry.

169
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:04,206
I've always felt uncomfortable.

170
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:07,686
If I had told you, that would have meant breaking my promise to Mr. Phudin.

171
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,566
You don't have to explain. I understand.

172
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,326
I understand it all now.

173
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,806
We're actually like strangers.

174
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:17,686
If I were you,

175
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:20,166
I wouldn't have trusted a stranger with my secret.

176
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:26,621
I'm glad you're not dramatic about this.

177
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,606
I was dramatic about a lot.

178
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,366
I'm sick and tired.

179
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:32,726
Understand?

180
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:37,646
So,

181
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:39,726
what are you going to do?

182
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:44,526
Mr. Phudin has relieved me of all debt.

183
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:48,206
He also wants me to continue working,

184
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:52,326
but how can I face all of you?

185
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,006
Who wants to face you?

186
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,926
Nobody wants a confrontation.

187
00:14:58,302 --> 00:14:59,766
Thank you.

188
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:04,166
I'll still need time to think.

189
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:05,886
Why would you think?

190
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:06,794
Is your salary too low?

191
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:08,161
Do other jobs pay better?

192
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:09,726
I'll talk to my old man.

193
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:25,159
Well, it's up to you. If you want to stay, then stay.

194
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,566
If you don't want to, then leave.

195
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:30,406
It's up to you.

196
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:33,526
Do you want me to stay?

197
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:42,566
If you don't have a job and have nothing to do,

198
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:44,526
you can stay.

199
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,206
I don't mind.

200
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,006
Really?

201
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,766
Congratulations, bro! Congrats!

202
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:50,486
Whoa, man!

203
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:51,886
Congrats!

204
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,126
You finally talked to your dad and cleared the air with Ms. Apo.

205
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:00,886
I'm confused. Things end well too easily.

206
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:02,246
Isn't it good?

207
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:05,726
Tin, let me ask you.

208
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,686
Since Apo and my old man are not lovers,

209
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:11,606
I can proceed with her now, can't I?

210
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:12,926
You can.

211
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:14,326
I'll be rooting for you.

212
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:17,602
So, if I confess to her,

213
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:18,766
would she be okay?

214
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:20,126
Try it.

215
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,806
Don't give up.

216
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:25,526
Fight on! Don't give up.

217
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:29,166
Who's giving up?

218
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:34,438
Mueang, have you told Aum?

219
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:35,525
I haven't.

220
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:37,126
Tell him.

221
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:40,806
Aum, come here.

222
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:45,766
I got glitters all over me.

223
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,886
(Beach Trip)

224
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:01,553
(Are you sure you want to delete the file permanently?)

225
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:07,446
(Restore files from Recycle Bin?)

226
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:12,486
Do you remember this woman?

227
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:15,486
This is the one you were looking for.

228
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:16,806
She is.

229
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:25,326
- She's Apo!   - Well, well.

230
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:29,846
- Is today April Fool's Day?   - Well, well.

231
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:33,086
- It's not even April!   - It's not even April!

232
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:34,446
Really?

233
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,333
Apo!

234
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:41,090
You're finally free of your debt! I'm so happy for you!

235
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:43,846
You no longer have anything to fear, my girl!

236
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,286
Mr. Phudin wants me to continue working.

237
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,805
Don't take the job!

238
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:51,566
Do you still want to stay there?

239
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,269
(Just come back.)

240
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,446
Mr. Phudin is okay with you leaving. You've done all your jobs.

241
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:02,526
(Apo, what's wrong with you? Why don't you want to come back?)

242
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,046
Don't tell me...

243
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,726
What's the deal with you and Mueang?

244
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,846
Have you fallen for him?

245
00:19:09,726 --> 00:19:10,966
(Have you?)

246
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,926
Apo!

247
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:19,406
You can't stop your feelings, can you?

248
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:20,966
Apo!

249
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,806
This is your warning.

250
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:25,446
(You told me yourself)

251
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,326
(the Apo that Mueang liked)

252
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,773
(was the happy-go-lucky one at the beach)

253
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:33,051
That's not the real you!

254
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,837
The real Apo is dark, gloomy, and sad.

255
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,366
Mueang will never like someone like that.

256
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:40,806
You told me that yourself, remember?

257
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:45,526
It's already good enough that he doesn't hate me.

258
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:48,966
There's no way he'll like me.

259
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,006
That's why you need to hypnotize yourself.

260
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:54,926
Remember that! Put all of that into your brain!

261
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:26,126
So have you made your decision?

262
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:32,166
I won't be working here anymore.

263
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,206
Are you sure?

264
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,646
I have a job interview lined up.

265
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:45,686
When are you leaving?

266
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:48,206
I'll leave now.

267
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:49,526
Now?

268
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:52,606
How are you traveling?

269
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:55,566
By bus, like I planned.

270
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,566
Don't leave yet.

271
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,166
I agree!

272
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:09,606
Don't leave yet. My old man wants you to stay.

273
00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:12,566
It's really late now.

274
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,846
Just stay here for tonight.

275
00:21:17,606 --> 00:21:19,086
I'll arrange your transport tomorrow.

276
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:28,686
Why didn't you ask her to stay?

277
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:31,766
Oh? That's up to her to decide.

278
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:34,926
You suck! How could you have let her go?

279
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:37,486
She'd just return to those blood-sucking leeches she calls family.

280
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:40,126
The economy is bad. Jobs are hard to find.

281
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:41,806
What can she do? Think!

282
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:45,091
Look. You're asking me to force her against her will

283
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:48,126
while you remain a coward yourself?

284
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:50,222
You're not helping me!

285
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:54,510
I thought they made up. Why are they still fighting?

286
00:21:55,174 --> 00:21:56,806
They've been at odds for ten-plus years.

287
00:21:56,903 --> 00:22:00,542
It's impossible to make up in just a few hours.

288
00:22:03,814 --> 00:22:05,486
First of all,

289
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:07,446
I want to say congratulations

290
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:10,366
on being single once again, Din!

291
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:15,526
I'll say it one more time.

292
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:17,126
You and Ms. Apo,

293
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,366
the role of a couple you played,

294
00:22:19,446 --> 00:22:20,886
you didn't nail it at all.

295
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,005
Really?

296
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:23,926
I think a certain someone

297
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:26,086
was totally convinced.

298
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,246
Who? Who was that? Who?

299
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:31,006
Me?

300
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:34,366
I could tell!

301
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,686
Look. Guys!

302
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:40,086
If you guys felt guilty for having treated her badly,

303
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:43,006
you all need to help convince her to stay, got it?

304
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:50,726
Din?

305
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:55,126
Why is Mueang suddenly worried about Apo's well-being?

306
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,846
I'm confused.

307
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,726
I think you need to ask him yourself.

308
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:11,246
(Do you want me to stay?)

309
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:15,166
If you don't have a job and have nothing to do,

310
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:17,326
you can stay.

311
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:18,926
I don't mind.

312
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,686
Really?

313
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:32,966
When are you leaving?

314
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,566
I'll leave now.

315
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:37,646
Don't leave yet.

316
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,286
I agree!

317
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:43,446
Don't leave yet.

318
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:45,726
My old man wants you to stay.

319
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:52,846
That reaction...

320
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:55,886
Did he not want me to leave?

321
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:21,246
I shouldn't stay anyway.

322
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:29,926
Just tell her I don't want her to leave. That's all, isn't it?

323
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:33,126
If she doesn't want to stay,

324
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,806
that'd be embarrassing, wouldn't it?

325
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:45,686
Why am I hiding?

326
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:47,566
I said I wanted her to stay!

327
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:49,446
What's wrong with me?

328
00:24:57,736 --> 00:24:59,766
You've decided to leave.

329
00:25:00,438 --> 00:25:02,086
You have to leave, Apo.

330
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:07,166
If I don't want her to leave,

331
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:09,806
what can I do?

332
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:37,206
Is he asleep?

333
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:42,006
He followed me back!

334
00:25:50,397 --> 00:25:52,286
All you have is weird photos.

335
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:12,726
Mueang, why haven't you done anything yet?

336
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:15,366
I've been thinking hard.

337
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:18,406
It might be too late if you want Apo to stay.

338
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:19,926
I know!

339
00:26:20,262 --> 00:26:21,917
You suck!

340
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:23,477
That's uncalled for!

341
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:24,846
You know what?

342
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:27,166
I'll teach you a crash course.

(Hathaiyaporn as Lady Po)

346
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:56,966
Apo! Don't run from me!

347
00:26:57,294 --> 00:26:58,846
Where are you going?

348
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:00,686
- Apo, come on!   - No!

349
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:01,886
- Stop it!   - Don't resist.

350
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:03,406
Stop it!

351
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,846
- Oh! Ouch! Come on, baby.   - Ah! No!

352
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,326
Come with me, Apo.

353
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:11,766
Don't!

354
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:15,686
- Come with me!   - Stop!

355
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:21,166
What are you doing, Mueang?

356
00:27:21,532 --> 00:27:22,966
You've been running so fast,

357
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:24,846
you'll be tired to death.

358
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:28,886
Dying here is worth it. Do you know why?

359
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,349
I get to die in your arms.

360
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:35,206
Idiot!

361
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:37,806
Idiot!

362
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:39,366
What a crazy thing to say.

363
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,406
I'm crazy in love with you.

364
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:42,886
My Apo.

You're the most beautiful in town, you know?

366
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,086
Cut! Whoa! This won't cut it!

367
00:27:58,213 --> 00:27:59,886
Are you mad?

368
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:02,046
You want me to hold her? And kiss her?

369
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:03,846
She can call the cops on me!

370
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,366
What are you, a coward?

371
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:07,886
No! That doesn't work!

372
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:09,967
If you think you have a better plan,

373
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:11,886
tell me. What are you going to do?

374
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:14,886
What are you going to do?

375
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:20,686
Please forget what I did.

376
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:23,766
I really didn't know your plan with Din.

377
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,446
It's fine.

378
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:30,806
I told you I meant no harm to anyone.

379
00:28:31,197 --> 00:28:34,782
So you really won't take Mr. Phudin's job offer?

380
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:37,366
I won't.

381
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:39,966
I'm going to say goodbye to Mr. Phudin.

382
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:41,286
Okay.

383
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:43,806
Safe travel then.

384
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:45,286
Bye.

385
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:48,366
Bye.

386
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:50,086
Goodbye.

387
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:59,117
My rival is gone!

388
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:04,949
Din's mine to hit on, finally!

389
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:08,406
I'm really going to miss her singing.

390
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:13,406
Mrs. Sita.

391
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:17,526
Do you think it's wrong if the woman confesses first?

392
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,526
Not at all.

393
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:20,726
Right?

394
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:23,086
If you like someone, just tell them.

395
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:26,606

(How To Hit On a Boy - Mommy Version)

397
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:33,326
How did I get stuck in here with you?

398
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:35,526
It's late in the night.

399
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:37,206
Aren't you tired?

400
00:29:37,446 --> 00:29:39,966
I've let you have the soft bed.

401
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:43,806
How can I sleep

402
00:29:43,974 --> 00:29:46,566
when my body's aching all over?

403
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,966
I want to be "featuring" with you.

404
00:29:51,596 --> 00:29:55,006
"Featuring?" How can a woman say that?

405
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:56,646
Have you no shame?

406
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:01,566
When you get angry,

407
00:30:01,814 --> 00:30:03,646
you're even cooler!

408
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:04,966
Oops!

409
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:08,806
Oh, no!

410
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:14,726
Hey! What's that smirk on your face?

411
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:17,486
When I'm with you,

412
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,086
I'm filled with so much joy

413
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:20,726
it overflows from my heart

414
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:22,726
and gets into my brain.

415
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:27,060
I can't even lie down.

416
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:28,870
It's choking me up.

417
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:34,766
You're overacting.

418
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:37,606
You're making me want to pull your hair off.

419
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:46,382
You're crazy. What's so funny?

420
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,566
You're crazy.

421
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:54,646
I like that!

422
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:00,686
Is that too much?

423
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:11,637
- How are you?   - How am I?

424
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:13,606
Are you still stressed out about the other day?

425
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:16,766
Not really.

426
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:18,806
So where's Mueang?

427
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:20,086
Wait.

428
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:22,886
You can't leave until you receive the latest update.

429
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:25,406
You might have missed some news.

430
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:29,806
So Mueang likes Apo?

431
00:31:29,894 --> 00:31:32,966
He does. I told you because no matter how hard you try,

432
00:31:33,174 --> 00:31:34,566
he won't like you.

433
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:38,686
- Okay. I understand.   - Whoa!

434
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:41,006
Aren't you shocked?

435
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:44,726
No. They can like each other for all I care.

436
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:47,686
I just need to find a way to get that necklace.

437
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:48,926
Yeah.

438
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,526
You're simple.

439
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:54,246
If I can help Apo and Mueang get together,

440
00:31:54,861 --> 00:31:57,446
he will be so impressed that he will give me the necklace, right?

441
00:31:57,527 --> 00:31:58,726
That's a wishful thinking again.

442
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:00,766
Okay. Change of plan. Let's do that.

443
00:32:04,942 --> 00:32:06,166
Deal?

444
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:08,446
Okay.

445
00:32:22,126 --> 00:32:23,126

446
00:32:24,873 --> 00:32:28,926
(The number you dialed cannot be reached at the moment.)

447
00:32:31,211 --> 00:32:33,486
Where's Mr. Phudin?

448
00:32:33,814 --> 00:32:35,046
Young Master.

449
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,166
Would you like to try this?

450
00:32:37,366 --> 00:32:38,766
It's the best way.

She read it so fast!

456
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:21,726
(I didn't.)

457
00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:36,726
Mueang.

458
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:41,126
Why did you call me out here?

459
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:46,646
Sorry.

460
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:48,846
I know you're leaving,

461
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:51,926
but I can't let you leave yet.

462

What's the matter?

463
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:57,246
Well, I...

464
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:02,726
I...

465
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,326
I want to wish you luck.

Oh.

468

Is that all?

469
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:31,846
That's all.

470
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,126
Okay.

471
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:40,726
I'm glad we ended things this way.

472
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:48,349
Throughout my time here,

473
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,886
I have had so many emotions.

474
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:55,621
I used to think that

475
00:34:56,086 --> 00:34:58,126
we shouldn't have met at the beach.

476
00:34:58,726 --> 00:35:00,046
But right now,

477
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:04,166
I'm still glad that it happened.

478
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:12,046
The trouble I went through before I met you,

479
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:17,246
I think it was worth it.

480
00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:27,246

481

Where have you been? I couldn't reach you.

485

Take a walk with me before you go.

486
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:26,846
Okay.

487
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:33,446
So many things happened.

488
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:37,686
Yeah.

489
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:41,246
I keep thinking back to where it began.

490
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,286
What would I have done differently?

491
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:46,846
I realized there was only one way it could have turned out.

492
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:50,166
What way?

493
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,126
Everything that happened

494
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,646
might have been our destiny.

495
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:03,086
It's a weird destiny.

496
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,326
It is. It's really weird.

497
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:10,686

498
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:14,126
It's time I give it back to him.

499
00:37:15,563 --> 00:37:18,406
I want you to reconsider one more time

500
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:20,566
whether you stay

501
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,406
or go back home.

502
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:27,686
Find out your answer in there.

503
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:35,086
Go.

504
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:15,702
Mueang?

505
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,846
I haven't finished talking.

506
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:33,086
I was going to say

507
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:37,326
I never regret meeting you back at the beach.

508
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:02,126
Those seven days

509
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:05,806
were the happiest days of my life.

510
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:10,006
Even now,

511
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:13,101
I still feel the same.

512
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:23,366
Mueang.

513
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:28,126
The girl you met at the beach

514
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:33,606
was just the person I wanted to be.

515
00:39:36,253 --> 00:39:40,046
I wanted to smile and laugh and be free.

516
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,046
It wasn't me.

517
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:47,326
Both of you are you, right?

518
00:39:49,526 --> 00:39:50,966
Even if you're View

519
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:53,046
or Apo,

520
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:56,646
Kasalong and Songpeeb, Munin and Muta,

521
00:39:57,205 --> 00:39:58,446
or whoever you are,

522
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,766
it doesn't matter.

523
00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:02,966
I like all of them.

524
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,006
Are

525
00:40:24,126 --> 00:40:26,086
you honestly saying that?

526
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:30,486
Honestly.

527
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:42,726
You like me?

528
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:49,446
Why couldn't I tell?

529
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:54,486
Maybe I was too good at acting.

530
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,446
You were.

531
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:01,086
I

532
00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:03,806
always thought

533
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:05,926
you hated me.

534
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:09,806
I wanted to hate you.

535
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:14,366
I tried to.

536
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:18,246
I couldn't.

537
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,446
Why are you crying?

538
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,846
I didn't think...

539
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:04,366
I didn't think you'd feel the same way.

540
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:28,886
So

541
00:42:31,598 --> 00:42:33,046
do you like me too?

542
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,166
Do you remember what you said to me?

543
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:54,846
Stop living for others

544
00:42:55,486 --> 00:42:57,726
and start living for yourself.

545
00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:03,526
I just don't want to be selfish.

546
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:06,286
I'm not telling you to be selfish.

547
00:43:06,862 --> 00:43:09,126
I just want you to love yourself.

548
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,646
Do you know how to do that?

549
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,446
If you don't even know how to love yourself,

550
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,366
don't expect to find happiness in this life.

551
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:22,526
You made me want to love myself.

552
00:43:25,694 --> 00:43:28,566
Maybe I'm still learning how to do that, but

553
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,526
I'm trying.

554
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:35,926
So...

555
00:43:41,348 --> 00:43:43,566
So you like me?

556
00:43:47,778 --> 00:43:49,526
You like me?

557
00:43:54,805 --> 00:43:56,326
Is that true?

558
00:45:47,757 --> 00:45:49,326
Ms. Apo is leaving, isn't she?

559
00:45:50,326 --> 00:45:52,486
What are you standing there for?

560
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:54,366
What does this have to do with you?

561
00:45:54,454 --> 00:45:55,846
I have my skills.

562
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:57,006
What skills?

563
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:58,766
Skills of a bridesmaid.

564
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:01,526
I have helped so many couples get married.

565
00:46:02,806 --> 00:46:05,446
Do you want to tell Apo how you feel?

566
00:46:06,645 --> 00:46:09,126
Tin, did you tell this girl?

567
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:11,917
It's not a secret, is it?

568
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:14,486
Trust me.

569
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:21,806
Right here.

570
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:25,941
Pretend to take photos of the Fun Park like you're working.

571
00:46:26,646 --> 00:46:27,966
- Yeah.   - Here.

572
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,246
Okay. This is a good spot.

573
00:46:31,966 --> 00:46:33,126
Do your best, Mueang.

574
00:46:34,646 --> 00:46:36,446
- Let's go.   - Yeah.

575
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:53,846
Mueang!

576
00:46:54,502 --> 00:46:56,446
Why did you...

577
00:46:57,621 --> 00:46:58,766
Have you lost your mind?

578
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:00,486
Why did you say goodbye like that?

579
00:47:00,757 --> 00:47:02,084
Were you listening?

580
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:04,646
Yeah. We were hiding behind that tree.

581
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:06,806
It didn't even cover us. You didn't see us?

582
00:47:07,132 --> 00:47:08,246
I didn't.

583
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:12,206
See? I told you. When a person focuses on something,

584
00:47:12,486 --> 00:47:13,726
they lose sight of everything else.

585
00:47:13,807 --> 00:47:15,746
Okay, Mueang. It's okay. Let's try again.

586
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:22,366
Uncle Din.

587
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,886
Stop hiding.

588
00:47:23,997 --> 00:47:26,166
Please intercept Ms. Apo now!

589
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,726
Where should he lead Ms. Apo?

590
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:39,926
Oh!

591
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,486
My effort is worth that necklace.

592
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:48,366
You seem to be having fun.

593
00:47:49,094 --> 00:47:52,406
What fun? It's boring being an extra.

594
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:54,326
You're an extra in someone's story,

595
00:47:54,534 --> 00:47:56,046
but you're the lead in yours.

596
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:59,006
When your time comes, you'll get to shine.

597
00:48:00,566 --> 00:48:01,766
I hope so.

598
00:48:23,572 --> 00:48:24,886
Can I ask you something?

599
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,246
So, are we

600
00:48:29,518 --> 00:48:31,206
a couple now?

601
00:48:37,262 --> 00:48:41,126
I'm not rushing. I'm just asking.

602
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:25,686
We're in a relationship now.

603
00:51:12,758 --> 00:51:15,354
(One hour after being in a relationship)

604
00:51:33,286 --> 00:51:37,406
What was that? Just now?

605
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:43,486
What have I done?

606
00:51:43,686 --> 00:51:45,766
Why did I say yes so quickly?

607
00:51:45,926 --> 00:51:47,366
Am I that down bad?

608
00:51:50,094 --> 00:51:51,606
No!

609
00:51:51,797 --> 00:51:53,326
This is not right.

610
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:55,606
My consciousness, where are you?

611
00:51:55,926 --> 00:51:59,886
Is my brain still here? It's not. It's gone!

612
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:06,077
- This is too sudden, Apo!   - This is too sudden, Mueang!

613
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:24,646
Mueang.

614
00:52:25,806 --> 00:52:27,846
I want to talk about last night.

615
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:29,795
Me too.

616
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:31,686
Yeah. About last night,

617
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:33,806
I'm sorry.

618
00:52:34,557 --> 00:52:35,806
I rushed too soon.

619
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:39,606
Me too. You don't have to apologize.

620
00:52:40,254 --> 00:52:42,726
I rushed too. I was reckless.

621
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:45,526
We were caught in the moment, right?

622
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,086
So

623
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:53,926
we shouldn't start dating yet.

624
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,326
Let's just take it slow, okay?

625
00:52:57,398 --> 00:52:58,606
Of course!

626
00:52:59,035 --> 00:53:01,886
I don't want anything superficial.

627
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:04,646
Am I too conservative?

628
00:53:04,774 --> 00:53:07,726
I mean, I don't want it to seem

629
00:53:08,566 --> 00:53:10,526
easy and quick.

630
00:53:11,486 --> 00:53:13,606
I want it slow

631
00:53:14,014 --> 00:53:15,246
and steady.

632
00:53:18,806 --> 00:53:20,446
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

633
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:26,286
I'm thinking what you're thinking.

634
00:53:27,406 --> 00:53:31,126
From my experience, every time I do something without thinking,

635
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:33,046
it never ends well.

636
00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:36,526
I want to learn more about you.

637
00:53:37,532 --> 00:53:41,557
I don't want to jump in and ruin it like my past relationships.

638
00:53:42,941 --> 00:53:45,726
I understand. I really understand.

639
00:53:45,846 --> 00:53:48,046
Don't worry.

640
00:53:48,255 --> 00:53:50,206
I will never do that.

641
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,166
Okay.

642
00:53:58,717 --> 00:54:02,086
Since we agree, then...

643
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,582
- Let's break up for now.   - Let's break up for now.

644
00:54:31,781 --> 00:54:35,938
(RIP. It was one of the shortest relationships in TV history.)

645
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:38,408
(It ended way too soon.)

646
00:54:38,615 --> 00:54:41,566
Why do we have so many moments of silence this month?

647
00:54:51,326 --> 00:54:52,590
What's dead now?

648
00:54:52,813 --> 00:54:54,686
The love between you and Ms. Apo!

649
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:58,726
Hey! You guys, listen.

650
00:54:58,941 --> 00:55:00,366
Nothing's dead.

651
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:02,766
Everything is proceeding step by step.

652
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,686
She and I are not dating yet,

653
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:06,326
but I told her how I feel.

654
00:55:06,446 --> 00:55:08,526
I know she feels the same way.

655
00:55:08,622 --> 00:55:10,366
I'm already so happy!

656
00:55:10,638 --> 00:55:12,446
How are you happy?

657
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:16,286
If you don't start dating, someone might steal her.

658
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:20,286
I looked around here.

659
00:55:20,406 --> 00:55:22,126
Nobody can be my rival.

660
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,966
You're confident. I'm happy for you.

661
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:34,206
Of course! My young master

662
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,925
is the hottest around here.

663
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:39,566
What's with you?

664
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:41,206
It's because you always flatter him.

665
00:55:41,287 --> 00:55:43,573
He turned out this way because of you!

666
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:46,166
He's my young master. Of course, I flatter him.

667
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,646
Hello!

668
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:50,366
Hello! How did it go?

669
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:51,766
There she is.

670
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:54,766
Where is my reward?

671
00:55:58,173 --> 00:56:01,646
Finally, this meeting is happening

672
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:03,086
because of me

673
00:56:03,645 --> 00:56:06,446
and me. I think you should seal the deal already.

674
00:56:09,942 --> 00:56:12,766
Tin told me you didn't like me.

675
00:56:13,086 --> 00:56:15,606
You just want something from me.

676
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:20,486
Yes. I want your mom's Siamese ruby necklace.

677
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:23,086
I'm not selling.

678
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:24,886
See? I told you.

679
00:56:25,766 --> 00:56:27,726
Can you mine a new one for me then?

680
00:56:27,886 --> 00:56:29,722
There's no place left to mine.

681
00:56:29,837 --> 00:56:32,446
Didn't my dad tell you? Don't you get it?

682
00:56:32,646 --> 00:56:34,126
Dig deeper!

683
00:56:34,253 --> 00:56:36,214
- Just dig deeper!   - Whoa!

684
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:38,806
- You're not making sense.   - Sit down.

685
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:42,446
How is she not making sense? You're speaking the same language.

686
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,286
Talk nicely like civilized people.

687
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:46,686
I don't want to be your translator.

688
00:56:48,661 --> 00:56:50,006
Okay.

689
00:56:50,189 --> 00:56:52,486
You're lucky I'm in a good mood.

690
00:56:53,654 --> 00:56:55,646
We have a necklace similar to my mom's.

691
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:58,746
- You do?   - Yeah, but it's not exactly the same.

692
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:00,366
Then I want to see it.

693
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:02,060
Okay. I'll send you some photos.

694
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:03,686
And stop messing with me.

695
00:57:04,062 --> 00:57:06,726
Fine. I don't want to mess with you anyway.

696
00:57:09,782 --> 00:57:11,406
You can indeed talk nicely.

697
00:57:20,877 --> 00:57:22,206
You got what you wanted.

698
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:25,606
I need to see it first. If I like it, then okay.

699
00:57:26,646 --> 00:57:28,166
You sure are a whale.

700
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:29,966
I'll spare no expense.

701
00:57:33,926 --> 00:57:35,246
Thank you too.

702
00:57:35,846 --> 00:57:37,646
I'll finally leave you alone.

703
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,726
Mission accomplished.

704
00:57:40,101 --> 00:57:42,846
I'll be in Bangkok for a long time.

705
00:57:43,102 --> 00:57:44,446
Congrats.

706
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:15,366
"Do you have time today? Have lunch with me."

707
00:58:15,886 --> 00:58:18,406
- Phing.   - As I thought, you're attached to your man.

708
00:58:20,741 --> 00:58:23,366
How did you get here?

709
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,526
I got here by public van.

710
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:28,086
You were gone, so I came looking for you.

711
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:30,246
You respond to his texts quickly!

712
00:58:30,598 --> 00:58:33,246
What about mine? You didn't even read it.

713
00:58:34,581 --> 00:58:35,926
Sorry.

714
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:40,346
I'm lucky the maid recognized me and let me in.

715
00:58:45,053 --> 00:58:47,997
What level have you reached? Tell me.

716
00:58:53,983 --> 00:58:55,286
Well,

717
00:58:55,785 --> 00:58:57,446
this level.

718
00:58:59,965 --> 00:59:01,926
Apo! You know,

719
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:06,766
in your life so far, I think this is the best decision you've ever made.

720
00:59:07,696 --> 00:59:09,086
I'm about to cry!

721
00:59:09,342 --> 00:59:12,846
Good job not rushing into a relationship with Mueang!

722
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,246
You deserve a beauty queen sash from me!

723
00:59:17,486 --> 00:59:20,126
- That's too much.   - How?

724
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,086
Stop.

725
00:59:22,277 --> 00:59:25,326
Look. I'm really impressed.

726
00:59:25,806 --> 00:59:28,566
I don't want you to regret it like with Game.

727
00:59:28,646 --> 00:59:32,646
You have to learn about Mueang slowly and carefully.

728
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:34,166
No quick decision!

729
00:59:34,342 --> 00:59:35,446
You did the right thing.

730
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:39,606
You're smart. I'm proud of you. You finally grew up.

731
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:41,846
Thanks.

732
00:59:42,574 --> 00:59:44,726
It's rare for you to praise me.

733
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:48,166
Wait.

734
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:54,086
I'm still not sure about your taste in men.

735
00:59:56,246 --> 00:59:58,046
Let me scan him.

736
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:04,526
Hey! What are you doing?

737
01:00:04,607 --> 01:00:07,126
- Phing? What are you doing?   - Help!

738
01:00:07,246 --> 01:00:10,446
- Why are you following me?   - Apo, let me go!

739
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:12,918
Help me! Hey, you!

740
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,166
Why are you sniffing me?

741
01:00:17,716 --> 01:00:19,126
The smell of sweat.

742
01:00:20,022 --> 01:00:21,406
Yeah, it is.

743
01:00:21,566 --> 01:00:23,566
Stop sniffing. You're giving me the creeps.

744
01:00:26,637 --> 01:00:30,406
Sorry. Phing is a handful.

745
01:00:31,406 --> 01:00:34,063
That's enough, dear, okay?

746
01:00:37,246 --> 01:00:38,646
From now on,

747
01:00:38,862 --> 01:00:42,646
please know that I'm watching you.

748
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:47,886
Watch me all you want. Just don't sniff me.

749
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,466
Should we go?

750
01:00:58,924 --> 01:01:00,716
What a double standard!

751
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,446
- Let's go.   - Where?

752
01:01:04,606 --> 01:01:05,806
On a date!

753
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:07,286
Don't follow us!

754
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:10,726
Let's go.

755
01:01:16,413 --> 01:01:19,286
I don't like this at all!

756
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:34,926
Buy whatever you want, I'll pay.

757
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:37,726
Let's split the bill.

758
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,166
Okay.

759
01:01:39,518 --> 01:01:42,086
Then let's go.

760
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:50,926
Thank you.

761
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:53,286
- I hope your business is good.  - Thank you.

762
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:56,006
One, two, three.

763
01:02:02,229 --> 01:02:03,486
You're cute.

764
01:02:03,606 --> 01:02:05,046
Eat up.

765
01:02:11,517 --> 01:02:12,766
It's leaking.

766
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:21,566
One, two... So cute.

767
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:27,966
These look like you and me.

768
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,166
This is you. She's got a bandana too.

769
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:46,526
- One, two, three.   - Let me see.

770
01:02:47,102 --> 01:02:48,526
Let's see.

771
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,086
Nice.

772
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:55,046
Thanks.

773
01:02:57,189 --> 01:02:59,006
So cute.

774
01:02:59,368 --> 01:03:01,046
That's too much.

775
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:04,206
She's too cute to handle.

776
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:07,966
Mueang, come on.

777
01:03:08,086 --> 01:03:09,446
Yes, ma'am.

778
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:19,086
One, two, three.

779
01:03:23,806 --> 01:03:27,406
Come on. One, two, three!

780
01:03:29,197 --> 01:03:31,726
One, two, three!

781
01:03:35,822 --> 01:03:37,206
One, two, three!

782
01:04:07,637 --> 01:04:09,006
Are you not having fun?

783
01:04:13,294 --> 01:04:14,566
I am.

784
01:04:15,006 --> 01:04:17,806
So why don't you look happy?

785
01:04:22,813 --> 01:04:24,166
Seriously?

786
01:04:25,718 --> 01:04:27,166
I'm afraid.

787
01:04:27,886 --> 01:04:29,086
Of what?

788
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:35,269
I'm afraid my happiness won't last.

789
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:39,277
Every time I'm happy,

790
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:42,326
bad things always happen.

791
01:04:50,446 --> 01:04:51,766
Let's go over there.

792
01:05:04,286 --> 01:05:05,486
Apo!

793
01:05:15,046 --> 01:05:16,206
Don't come!

794
01:05:16,493 --> 01:05:17,646
Stop right there.

795
01:05:17,861 --> 01:05:19,046
I'm embarrassed.

796
01:05:21,086 --> 01:05:22,966
So why are you yelling?

797
01:05:28,773 --> 01:05:30,526
Before we officially date,

798
01:05:32,486 --> 01:05:35,886
can I be your first candidate for a boyfriend?

799
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,110
I want to make you happy.

800
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:43,926
From now on,

801
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:47,166
let's be happy together.

802
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:49,726
Don't be afraid of anything.

803
01:05:50,766 --> 01:05:52,126
Your happiness,

804
01:05:52,398 --> 01:05:53,966
I'll be the one who protects it.

805
01:06:28,934 --> 01:06:30,446
Okay!

806
01:06:33,286 --> 01:06:35,646
I'll be happy from now on.

807
01:06:36,437 --> 01:06:37,686
But...

808
01:06:38,581 --> 01:06:40,806
You're not my first candidate.

809
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:45,686
My first candidate is Gong Yoo.

810
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:50,686
Okay!

811
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:53,046
Next is Lee Min Ho,

812
01:06:54,902 --> 01:06:56,526
then Nam Joo Hyuk.

813
01:06:59,071 --> 01:07:00,286
Okay!

814
01:07:01,157 --> 01:07:02,686
I'm fine with being the fourth.

815
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,166
Thanks.

816
01:07:39,966 --> 01:07:44,366
Thank you for making it through your life until you met me. From now on,

817
01:07:44,484 --> 01:07:47,606
you won't have to suffer alone anymore. We'll grow together.

818
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:49,766
Let's grow together.

819
01:07:50,045 --> 01:07:51,286
Game?

820
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:57,326
- Is that man really Ms. Apo's ex?   - He is.

821
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,166
We used to be each other's happiness.

822
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,006
She can't forget me.

823
01:08:02,087 --> 01:08:03,526
Don't you know what they say, Young Master?

824
01:08:03,686 --> 01:08:06,046
Exes are the most dangerous sort of people.

825
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:07,726
Aren't you jealous at all?

826
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:09,206
I'm not!

827
01:08:15,206 --> 01:08:17,286
- Young Master!   - What is it?

828
01:08:17,413 --> 01:08:19,686
- There's a dead body over there!   - What?
