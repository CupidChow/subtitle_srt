1
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:02,406
If you think you can't take care of Ing,

2
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:04,246
I'll take care of her myself.

3
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:07,006
Don't try to come back then.

4
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:08,606
It has to be a big festival.

5
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:11,086
I can lose money, but I can't lose my face.

6
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,766
Is there any problem with your festival?

7
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:14,326
It's pretty smooth.

8
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:15,646
There's no problem.

9
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,966
(I remember you wanted to go to Canada.)

10
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,446
(Are you still interested?)

11
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:20,886
Are you sure

12
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,445
you'll use the last batch of money

13
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:25,966
to hold a festival, even if you don't know if it will succeed?

14
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:30,966
I'm afraid if this continues, you'll be bankrupt soon enough.

15
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,326
Right now,

16
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:34,886
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:37,206
I believe you can do it.

18
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,126
- Place a lot of kiosks so...   - Young Master!

19
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,806
A ride is broken over there.

20
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:46,406
Get a technician to fix it. Make sure it's safe.

21
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,686
Yes, sir. I will.

22
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:49,406
Technician Team, can you hear me?

23
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:50,603
Technician Team?

24
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,646
What are trendy themes right now? Be serious.

25
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,366
- What are trendy?   - Yeah.

26
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,366
Oh! Y2K, the 2000s!

27
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,206
I don't think I can do that theme.

28
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:00,591
The 90s is more my style.

29
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:03,606
The band Raptor used to dress and dance like this.

30
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,006
I think we should hire this one to do PR.

31
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,966
She has a wide range of audience. We can reach every group.

32
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,261
Okay. I'll make an offer.

33
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,342
I have two other candidates.

34
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:16,486
This one is famous on TikTok. His content is top-notch.

35
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:19,406
Young Master, the ride has been fixed.

36
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:21,566
Good. I have a food truck meeting.

37
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:23,926
- I'll leave this to you.   - Yes, sir.

38
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,927
(15 days before Phudin Park opens)

39
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:30,166
- Mueang.   - Hi!

40
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,806
Ing and I are here to help.

41
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:35,846
Thank you, Tin and Ing.

42
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:39,326
Look. I did what you suggested.

43
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,046
I told you it'd be good.

44
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:43,766
Young Master!

45
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:49,606
Young Master, I have a theme to pitch.

46
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:52,446
Let's go back to the 90s, our childhood.

47
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:55,726
The 2000s is better, Young Master. It's a fashion trend now.

48
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:57,966
Mueang, listen to me.

49
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:01,065
Let's go to the 80s. I can imagine the dress code in my mind.

50
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:04,486
The 80s is too old. The 90s is better.

51
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,828
Believe me, Young Master. The 2000s is the bomb.

52
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:09,924
- The 80s.   - The 2000s.

53
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:12,086
- Stop!   - Young Master.

54
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:14,006
I have a theme in mind.

55
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,846
Every decade is awesome. Stop arguing.

56
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,486
All your ideas are happening.

57
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:21,966
Young Master?

58
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,326
- Careful.   - Young Master.

59
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:26,326
The folks around here

60
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:29,190
would like to set up a booth at our festival.

61
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:30,646
Great!

62
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:33,926
We'll take everyone back through time!

63
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,566
- Yeah!   - Yeah!

64
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:55,566
No guest.

65
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:58,646
Why is there nobody here?

66
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:02,686
Looks like it's busted.

67
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,246
- Shut up!   - Shut up!

68
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:13,806
Mueang, don't worry.

69
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,646
I'll see what's going on in there.

70
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:27,606
Mueang, don't go!

71
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,286
People are coming!

72
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:30,686
Where are they?

73
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:33,566
Yeah, they are!

74
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,782
Mueang, congrats, bro!

75
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,446
Congrats!

76
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:38,755
Hey!

77
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:42,126
Let's go and welcome them! Go!

78
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,806
- Welcome!   - This way, please!

79
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:49,848
You just got here. Let's have some snacks.

80
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:52,930
- We have games over here.   - This way too.

81
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:54,686
- How about Darts on Balloons?   - This way.

82
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:59,166
- This way, please.   - We have food over here.

83
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:02,846
You can play Shoot the Prizes or Darts on Balloons.

84
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,096
- Come on, want to play darts, kids?   - They want to shoot guns!

85
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:10,846
We have awesome prizes! Who wants a challenge? Come on! Bang, bang, bang!

86
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:16,006
If you break ten balloons with darts, you'll get a free stuffed animal!

87
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:19,006
I'll lead you to the rides. They're over there.

88
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:22,766
Shoot the Prizes or Darts on Balloons? Play for prizes!

89
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:24,310
Let me, Ms. Apo.

90
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:26,406
I'll lead the guests myself.

91
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,766
I'll leave it to you then.

92
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:29,966
Okay. Come with me!

93
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:31,911
- Let's go!   - Have fun!

94
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:34,406
Let's go on a fun ride, baby!

95
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,646
One espresso. Make it strong.

96
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,406
May I take a selfie with you?

97
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:25,806
Thank you.

98
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:33,786
Hey!

99
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,166
So you're hiding here.

100
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:38,806
I'm not hiding.

101
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,686
Really?

102
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:47,110
I was just walking around, and I saw some girls. I was checking them out.

103
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:49,606
Din.

104
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:51,712
Do you really think

105
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:54,166
I'll reveal your secret?

106
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:02,246
Have you ever seen your sister-in-law in a good way?

107
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:04,573
I won't tell anyone.

108
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:07,326
Really?

109
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:08,926
Of course.

110
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:11,286
Look.

111
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:15,326
Please stop looking at me like I'm a bad person.

112
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,686
It might have been wrong to have a crush on my brother-in-law,

113
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:20,246
but

114
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,486
when you were with Nu,

115
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:25,966
I never interfered or did anything indecent.

116
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:29,046
I have always kept it to myself.

117
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:34,606
I'm sorry for being too harsh on you the other day.

118
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:38,926
I forgive you.

119
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,326
You can continue checking out the girls.

120
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,366
I'll go and check out the guys.

121
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:48,446
Wait.

122
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,126
Have you seen Mueang?

123
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,086
Mrs. Sita.

124
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:18,766
Yeah?

125
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:20,966
Are you really going to leave without saying goodbye?

126
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,146
Mrs. Sita, why did you quit without telling me?

127
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,406
I thought I would tell you guys today.

128
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:36,766
No!

129
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:40,046
I won't let you go. Please don't go.

130
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:43,166
Why are you guys being so dramatic?

131
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:45,846
You'll be fine without me.

132
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:48,606
We won't be.

133
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,126
When

134
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:53,966
Din, Mueang, and I fight,

135
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:57,246
who will be there to stop us?

136
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:00,566
Then don't fight.

137
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:04,886
Sita.

138
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:07,926
Please don't go. We need you.

139
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,206
He's right.

140
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,686
You will be alone if you go.

141
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,286
Please stay.

142
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,106
When you get old and weak, how can I take care of you?

143
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:23,406
Are you going to take care of me?

144
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:25,406
Of course.

145
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:28,181
You're my family too.

146
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:34,166
Well...

147
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,686
I didn't think you guys would need me this much.

148
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:42,446
We're not good at expressing our feelings.

149
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:44,846
So are you going to stay?

150
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:46,806
Please.

151
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,486
Don't quit, please.

152
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:55,206
Okay.

153
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:57,446
If you guys need me,

154
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,846
I'll stay.

155
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,766
From now on,

156
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:07,646
I'll tell you I love you every day!

157
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,046
I'll let you know

158
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,366
how much I love you.

159
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:16,646
Okay.

160
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,926
Don't cry.

161
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:24,806
- You're not leaving, right?   - I'm not. Thank you.

162
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,252
Sort your garbage here!

163
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,805
- Right here.   - Please choose the correct bin.

164
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:35,846
This will help with the flow of rainwater.

165
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:38,405
That's right. This also helps reduce global warming.

166
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:41,486
Just sort your garbage, everyone.

167
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,326
Do this here and at home too.

168
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,269
Common waste goes to the green bin.

169
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:48,326
Recyclable waste goes to the yellow bin.

170
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,806
- What's the red one for? For hazardous waste!   - For hazardous waste!

171
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:54,882
- Thank you.   - Thanks.

172
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,966
Make sure you do this at home too.

173
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,206
Thanks.

174
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:03,126
How are you, Ing? Are you exhausted?

175
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:05,942
I'm not. It's kind of fun.

176
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,646
Back when we first met,

177
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:11,086
I really couldn't imagine you doing this.

178
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:13,486
People change and get better, you know?

179
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:18,866
What's that?

180
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,886
This is a public place, Tin.

181
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,446
People change and get better, you know?

182
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,206
We never had a selfie together.

183
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,446
- Let's take one then!   - Take lots of selfies.

184
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,222
I used to sneak this in class as a kid.

185
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:57,966
Yeah, Paeng.

186
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:01,086
(Have you decided about Canada?)

187
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:09,886
Yeah, I have made a decision.

188
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:29,077
- Take this! Look at this.   - Whoa!

189
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:30,798
This one's going to hit!

190
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,046
Mueang.

191
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:40,046
I need to talk to you.

192
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:42,406
Yeah.

193
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:47,606
Let's go.

194
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:55,926
I hope it goes well.

195
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,366
Why did you say that?

196
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,526
Oh. It's nothing.

197
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,886
I'm really happy a lot of people showed up.

198
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,726
I'm planning our next step. We'll let out

199
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,246
store spaces for rent on weekends.

200
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:13,606
The community will benefit a lot.

201
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,286
That's good.

202
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:17,886
Look.

203
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,046
I came up with a lot of ideas because of you.

204
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:28,526
When you're with me,

205
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:30,605
I have the courage to do anything.

206
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,046
Mueang.

207
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:43,366
I have been offered a job in Canada.

208
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:45,886
What do you think?

209
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:55,126
What can I say?

210
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,206
I'm happy for you.

211
00:14:57,862 --> 00:14:59,326
Do you want to go?

212
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,966
I do.

213
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,446
Then go.

214
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,806
Are you really okay with this?

215
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:16,046
I am.

216
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:18,046
Deep down,

217
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,126
I don't want you to go.

218
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:22,646
But if I hold you back,

219
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:27,166
I'd be a really bad and selfish boyfriend.

220
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,726
You need to go.

221
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:37,846
I really want to support you.

222
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:41,966
When I miss you, I'll just fly out there.

223
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:46,686
Actually,

224
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:50,126
I already said no.

225
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:52,326
Why did you say no?

226
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:56,886
Don't tell me it's because of me.

227
00:15:58,006 --> 00:15:59,286
I'm just

228
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:01,166
not sure if

229
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:04,566
it's really the path I want to follow.

230
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:09,886
Right now, I want to live the life I never got to.

231
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:14,066
You know that I have always

232
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:17,166
been working to pay off the debt.

233
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:20,606
I haven't really lived my own life.

234
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:23,709
So what do you want to do?

235
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:27,606
I

236
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:31,326
want to travel with no stress.

237
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:35,166
I want to see the world. I want to see things I've never seen.

238
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:37,006
I don't know if

239
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:39,926
you can afford to do that in your life.

240
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,806
You have a lot of responsibilities.

241
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:47,206
I don't want to be selfish,

242
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:51,046
but I love you so much.

243
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:54,646
I know how much you love me too.

244
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:57,286
If I had to go anywhere,

245
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:00,686
I wouldn't want to go without you.

246
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:03,086
I want us to go together.

247
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,806
Is this what you

248
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,046
wanted to tell me?

249
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:21,566
Sorry. It's so silly.

250
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:31,206
It's not silly at all, Po.

251
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:33,886
When you said that,

252
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,766
it made me realize

253
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:38,486
how much you love me.

254
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:43,486
Let's go.

255
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:46,846
We'll just go where you want. We can go anywhere.

256
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:49,046
Really?

257
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:50,726
Of course.

258
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:52,246
Let's go around the world.

259
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,366
You don't have to go that far.

260
00:17:57,206 --> 00:18:00,686
Just a vacation once in a while is enough.

261
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:04,206
Of course. That's easy. Let's plan our trip.

262
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,046
Okay?

263
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:10,646
Okay.

264
00:18:11,198 --> 00:18:12,486
Oh.

265
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:16,046
Don't cry, okay?

266
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:26,846
I love you.

267
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,926
I love you too.

268
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,766
I love you so much.

269
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,886
I love you so much too.

270
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:12,166
Alright.

271
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:14,086
Let's go back to the festival.

272
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,846
Let's live our happiest lives!

273
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,886
Let's go, Tao.

274
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:25,406
Let's go...

275
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:27,518
Tata?

276
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:39,966
You're the event organizers, right?

277
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:44,246
They are. I recognize them from the interview.

278
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:46,646
Thank you for this amazing event.

279
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:48,446
Both kids and adults had fun.

280
00:19:48,638 --> 00:19:49,726
You're welcome.

281
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,566
Please do it again next year.

282
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:53,526
Of course. I'll do that for you next year.

283
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:55,526
- Yeah!   - Do it again, young man.

284
00:19:55,622 --> 00:19:58,405
Of course. You must come next year, Granny.

285
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:01,566
Of course, I'll come. It's fun!

286
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:04,860
- Thank you so much.   - Thank you too.

287
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:07,526
- Bye-bye.   - Let's go.

288
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:13,886
Congratulations, Mueang.

289
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:16,806
Everyone acknowledges your effort.

290
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,646
Thank you, Po.

291
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:26,566
I'll be back. Just a second. Wait here.

292
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:37,646
(I think)

293
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:40,926
(life is like an amusement park.)

294
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,326
(When you reach the starting point, you get a little excited.)

295
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:50,166
Why did you follow me?

296
00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:52,886
You look glowing today.

297
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,366
Did you just give me a compliment?

298
00:20:55,757 --> 00:20:58,126
No, I mean you're hogging the spotlight.

299
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,006
That's harsh.

300
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:05,006
Just be yourself. You're lovely.

301
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:09,966
If I'm lovely,

302
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:12,126
just love me already.

303
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:23,246
- Ah!   - We're going down.

304
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:25,652
Hold on tight! Ah!

305
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,446
(Then you hit a low point.)

306
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:41,646
This will be the last time I see you.

307
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:44,566
Why, Ri?

308
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:47,246
It's probably too late to realize it,

309
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:50,686
but I feel guilty because of Apo.

310
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:52,829
In the next life,

311
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,606
if I'm not born as Apo's cousin,

312
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:58,566
we can date again, okay?

313
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:04,646
Ging, marry me.

314
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:07,806
Oh! Yes!

315
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:09,686
Give me your hand.

316
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,446
(Then you get to a high point.)

317
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:18,726
You deserve this.

318
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:23,966
(Phudin Park - Employee of The Year)

319
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:26,566
Thank you, Young Master.

320
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,526
Thank you.

321
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:31,133
Let me put this on you.

322
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,846
Young Master, this is a dream come true for me.

323
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,446
Thank you.

324
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,166
Thank you.

325
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,526
Young Master!

326
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,006
The designer company that I applied to

327
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:59,846
said I could go and learn the job.

328
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:05,046
- Congrats, Boem!   - My dream is coming true!

329
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:08,086
- Congrats, Boem.   - Boem!

330
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:13,126
- That's more like it! I'm happy for you.   - Son!

331
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:18,326
(And of course, you get to the point where...)

332
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:23,566
Busted again!

333
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:26,486
- When will I get rich?   - (Gosh.)

334
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:28,486
(I'd rather not say.)

335
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,526
Po.

336
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:38,526
Let's go and have some fun.

337
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,166
(Leader)

338
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,722
(Visual)

339
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:58,486
(Main Dancer)

340
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,006
(Main Rapper)

341
00:24:26,446 --> 00:24:29,366
(This is the conclusion of our story.)

342
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:32,486
(For now, at least.)

343
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:35,046
(Because in our lives,)

344
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,166
(there are still a lot more to come.)

345
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:49,166
(Three years later)

346
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,606
Please sit down.

347
00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:06,286
Is the camera rolling?

348
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,366
Please introduce yourselves.

349
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:11,486
Hi. My name is Apo.

350
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:14,006
Hi. My name is Mueang.

351
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:17,206
What's your plan for this New Year's holiday?

352
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:19,686
New Year's? Nothing.

353
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,726
How many days away is it?

354
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:27,406
I think we'll be counting it down at home.

355
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:31,606
After this, if you don't want to answer any questions, just skip.

356
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,270
Okay.

357
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:36,325
Why did you decide to join our show?

358
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:39,206
(One week ago)

359
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:42,046
I think a good design

360
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:46,326
has to account for the surroundings and people in the area.

361
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:50,886
This has been my main objective throughout my company's first year.

362
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:52,366
That makes you, Ms. Apo,

363
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,406
perfect for my project.

364
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:56,246
Thank you for your trust, sir.

365
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:58,166
I have to thank you.

366
00:25:58,247 --> 00:26:00,247
You made a lot of good suggestions.

367
00:26:01,432 --> 00:26:02,726
It's nothing.

368
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:04,446
Your husband is lucky

369
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:06,926
to have a talented and beautiful wife.

370
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:37,286
I'm glad we took out these costumes, Young Master. We can distract the kid.

371
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:41,046
Now, you have become the children's favorite.

372
00:26:41,127 --> 00:26:42,366
Once they see you,

373
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:45,006
they smile and stop crying.

374
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:48,765
Young Master.

375
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,366
I approve of every idea that you pitched.

376
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,126
That's great. Thank you.

377
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:07,326
I need to take this call.

378
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:13,726
Yes? I'm in a meeting.

379
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:15,726
See you at five then.

380
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,366
See you at five.

381
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:18,566
Okay.

382
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,086
Sorry.

383
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:31,206
Where did you hear the news?

384
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:33,933
I'm not married yet.

385
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:35,726
All right. Tell me what your problem is.

386
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,606
Did you fight with Ing?

387
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:39,606
What else could it be?

388
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:41,886
Why are men so dumb?

389
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:44,766
We've been dating for two years, and he still can't tell when I'm mad.

390
00:27:44,902 --> 00:27:47,126
Who would have known? If you're mad, just say it.

391
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,286
She looked like she just got Botox.

392
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:50,566
Who would have known?

393
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:52,006
Girls are hard to understand.

394
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:54,406
Yeah. That's what guys are like.

395
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:56,680
Don't try to express it with your face. Just tell him.

396
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:59,566
That's right. You have to tell it like it is.

397
00:27:59,718 --> 00:28:01,366
Look at me and Phing.

398
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:03,926
We have a smooth relationship, no drama.

399
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:07,406
I envy you!

400
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,206
- What about you?   - What about you?

401
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:16,127
- How is your love life going?   - How is your love life going?

402
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:18,646
- I don't know.   - I don't know

403
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:20,806
where it went wrong.

404
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:23,452
(Could you help me figure out)

405
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,368
(where it went wrong?)

406
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:29,166
(Three years ago)

407
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:34,046
(Six months after we started dating,)

408
00:28:34,238 --> 00:28:36,566
(we decided to move in together.)

409
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,566
- Whoa!   - Get back.

410
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:46,086
(The first year was good.)

411
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,046
(We spent a lot of time together.)

412
00:28:49,293 --> 00:28:50,926
Darling.

413
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,126
Did you just call me darling?

414
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:56,286
Yeah, that's you.

415
00:28:57,118 --> 00:29:00,406
- Honey!   - My honey!

416
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:02,206
Darling?

417
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,566
My bae.

418
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:06,286
Sweetheart.

419
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:08,183
My love.

420
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:10,387
My everything.

421
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:14,366
What should we name them? Parrot?

422
00:29:14,494 --> 00:29:15,966
Parrot?

423
00:29:17,728 --> 00:29:20,286
What about Dog?

424
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:23,846
Oppa.

425
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:27,486
Unnie.

426
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:30,246
Whose girlfriend is this?

427
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,086
This is my girlfriend.

428
00:29:41,918 --> 00:29:43,126
See?

429
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,366
- See?    - See?

430
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:53,126
- So cute!   - So cute!

431
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,326
Good morning.

432
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:08,926
Morning.

433
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:24,566
It stinks!

434
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:27,126
You deserved that.

435
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:31,126
(Going into the second year...)

436
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:33,116
I told you I hated it when you did this.

437
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:34,845
(We started arguing sometimes.)

438
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:35,926
Po.

439
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:38,582
Po.

440
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,166
Po, stop.

441
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:46,006
Po, I'm sorry.

442
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:48,086
Sorry.

443
00:30:48,396 --> 00:30:50,086
I won't do it again.

444
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,846
Please don't be mad.

445
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:54,926
Please.

446
00:30:57,685 --> 00:30:59,326
(That didn't last.)

447
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:06,326
(Maybe)

448
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:09,206
(it went wrong on that day.)

449
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:20,126
You're back?

450
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:22,326
You're still up?

451
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,206
I've been waiting for you.

452
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:28,806
(The day I started losing my temper.)

453
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:30,486
Let's clear this up.

454
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,446
Po!

455
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,566
Po! Don't run!

456
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:38,326
(Going into the third year,)

457
00:31:39,286 --> 00:31:42,246
(silence has become a part of our lives.)

458
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:53,686
I guess there's no happy ending in real life.

459
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:57,366
Love can be bland sometimes. It's normal.

460
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:00,246
Is Mueang's honeymoon phase over?

461
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:02,086
My honeymoon phase is not over.

462
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:04,046
I still love her as if it's day one, but

463
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,046
it's her fault.

464
00:32:06,286 --> 00:32:08,526
Right now, the feeling is just

465
00:32:08,686 --> 00:32:09,926
bored.

466
00:32:10,486 --> 00:32:11,686
Bored?

467
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:13,366
You're bored?

468
00:32:15,277 --> 00:32:19,206
A boring person like me can get bored too, you know?

469
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:22,686
I think this is serious.

470
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:26,526
Po.

471
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,806
I know how to spice up your relationship with Mueang.

472
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:35,286
I don't know if you're interested,

473
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:37,966
but I think it's worth a try.

474
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:39,606
How do I do that?

475
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,726
You're still up?

476
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:52,006
I said you didn't have to wait for me.

477
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,606
I want to talk to you.

478
00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:11,486
Have you seen Phing and Aum's new show?

479
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:16,389
Phing offered me too.

480
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:19,766
I don't think we should do it. It won't work.

481
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,326
I think it's interesting.

482
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:26,326
I think we should keep the others out of this.

483
00:33:26,774 --> 00:33:29,286
Our relationship is a matter between us.

484
00:33:29,422 --> 00:33:30,806
We have to adjust it ourselves.

485
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,405
We can't.

486
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:35,046
If we could, you wouldn't come back this late.

487
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:36,646
Are you trying to pick a fight?

488
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:39,166
I'm not.

489
00:33:40,557 --> 00:33:43,366
I just miss the time when we were really happy.

490
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,606
I miss us back then.

491
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,766
Don't you?

492
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:51,606
I do.

493
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:53,206
I miss us a lot.

494
00:33:56,598 --> 00:33:58,846
Then we should try to start over.

495
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:03,846
Right now, I think we should try everything.

496
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:11,046
Phing said she'd film us four hours a day.

497
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:14,669
The contract said that

498
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,326
if we didn't like it, she wouldn't publish it.

499
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:35,246
Should we try again one more time?

500
00:34:42,718 --> 00:34:43,838
I just

501
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:48,086
don't know if it will make things better or worse.

502
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:49,966
I don't either.

503
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:53,246
It might remind us

504
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,790
of how much we used to be in love.

505
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:01,486
It might make us love each other more.

506
00:35:12,117 --> 00:35:13,486
Please, I beg you.

507
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:18,046
If you don't want to let go of my hand,

508
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,870
let's try again, okay?

509
00:35:31,054 --> 00:35:32,326
Okay.

510
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,606
We

511
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:38,686
will try this one more time.

512
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:41,606
Let's try this together.

513
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,446
Why did you decide to join our show?

514
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,526
Because I don't want to give up.

515
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:10,966
This is the show that will bring you closer than ever.

516
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:13,326
No matter how long you've been together.

517
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:15,606
No matter how sick you are of each other.

518
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:18,646
This is a problem every couple must deal with.

519
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:20,886
You're not suffering alone.

520
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,606
Look at your partner,

521
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:23,965
the one by your side.

522
00:36:24,046 --> 00:36:26,006
Hold their hand tightly.

523
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,646
This New Year, we will be even more in love on

524
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:32,886
"Until We Love Each Other!"

525
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:35,206
"Love at First Night!"

526
00:36:39,758 --> 00:36:42,446
Hi. My name is Ing. I'm a friend of Apo's.

527
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:44,733
Thank you so much, Ing,

528
00:36:44,814 --> 00:36:47,686
for welcoming us into your home. What a nice house.

529
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:48,966
You're welcome.

530
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:52,246
My mom fought for this house after divorcing my dad.

531
00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:53,926
I'm so proud of my mom.

532
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:58,206
Ing, what do you think is the problem

533
00:36:58,334 --> 00:36:59,606
between Apo and her boyfriend?

534
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:04,566
Apo, my lady friend, is a really nice person.

535
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:06,806
The problem is her boyfriend.

536
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:08,806
Apo's friend that gave you that interview,

537
00:37:08,902 --> 00:37:10,486
was it my wife?

538
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:12,126
It's a secret.

539
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:15,726
Yeah. It's her. That's why she's blaming Mueang for it all.

540
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:17,286
Let me tell you something.

541
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:19,486
When a couple fights,

542
00:37:19,582 --> 00:37:21,766
it's not one of them that's wrong.

543
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:23,246
Both of them are wrong.

544
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:27,766
So, what do you think this couple's problem is?

545
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:29,286
The problem is

546
00:37:29,686 --> 00:37:31,366
they love each other too much.

547
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:34,566
I'll explain.

548
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,086
Both Apo and Mueang

549
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:40,086
don't want to hurt one another's feelings.

550
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:43,086
When they get upset with little things,

551
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:44,686
they keep it to themselves.

552
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:46,486
They don't speak honestly.

553
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,986
What are you sick and tired of about your partner?

554
00:37:49,214 --> 00:37:51,646
What am I sick and tired of about Apo?

555
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:55,766
I'm not sick and tired of her at all.

556
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:57,981
I just don't like certain things that she does.

557
00:37:59,286 --> 00:38:02,206
I don't think Mueang is boring.

558
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,366
It's just that sometimes certain things happen like...

559
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,990
I don't like her taking too long in the bathroom.

560
00:38:12,997 --> 00:38:14,166
Po.

561
00:38:19,646 --> 00:38:22,406
I don't like him urinating without lifting the toilet seat up.

562
00:38:29,582 --> 00:38:30,717
Sorry.

563
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:32,846
I just applied some green herbal oil on my lips.

564
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,526
I don't like the smell of green herbal oil when we kiss.

565
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:38,446
Stop.

566
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:43,366
Mueang.

567
00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:45,566
You've been playing that for two hours.

568
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:49,126
It's addicting. I can't stop.

569
00:38:49,966 --> 00:38:51,806
I don't like how he gets addicted to games.

570
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,366
Po.

571
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,246
Today is your day off.

572
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:57,766
This is urgent.

573
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:01,557
I don't like her being a workaholic.

574
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:02,846
Po.

575
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:06,206
We talked about this. We're supposed to relax on our day off.

576
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:08,406
I said it was urgent.

577
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,086
How can we be a couple when you don't have time for me?

578
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:13,926
Again. Running away. You run away every time.

579
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:15,406
Why don't we figure this out?

580
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,726
I have things arranged already.

581
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:20,166
I don't like him nagging at me.

582
00:39:20,555 --> 00:39:22,886
Whoa! Are you just going to leave me here?

583
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:25,286
I don't like it when I have to repeat myself.

584
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,606
I don't like how he never understands me.

585
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,006
So, have you told your partner about any of this?

586
00:39:33,822 --> 00:39:34,846
I have.

587
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:37,086
We both have been suppressing it for so long.

588
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:39,686
There comes a time when neither of us can hold it in.

589
00:39:59,846 --> 00:40:01,326
Why are you late again?

590
00:40:02,606 --> 00:40:03,926
Again.

591
00:40:04,917 --> 00:40:06,606
We talked about this, didn't we?

592
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:12,526
I'm starting a new company.

593
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,846
It takes time to adapt.

594
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:17,126
I get that,

595
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,686
but I want you to have time for me.

596
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:23,766
I'm trying to.

597
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,566
This is you trying?

598
00:40:26,606 --> 00:40:28,086
I don't think it's enough.

599
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:36,686
- I had a long day today.   - So did I.

600
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:38,206
But after work,

601
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:40,286
it's supposed to be an "us" time, right?

602
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,166
I think you're tired.

603
00:40:44,806 --> 00:40:46,846
You should go to bed. Let's talk tomorrow.

604
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,046
No.

605
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:50,046
Let's clear this up.

606
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:53,846
- Po!   - No!

607
00:40:53,974 --> 00:40:55,966
Po!

608
00:40:56,523 --> 00:40:58,326
Po! Don't run!

609
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:03,086
Po! Come out and talk to me! Po!

610
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:09,326
How many times do I have to tell you?

611
00:41:09,406 --> 00:41:11,726
Lift the toilet seat up before you pee!

612
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:14,446
- Don't change the subject.   - I'm not changing the subject.

613
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,926
What's wrong? You can criticize me, but I can't criticize you?

614
00:41:19,725 --> 00:41:20,806
Yeah!

615
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:22,006
You can!

616
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,566
If you're upset about anything, say it!

617
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:26,206
Lift the toilet seat up before you pee!

618
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:28,646
Is that all?

619
00:41:29,366 --> 00:41:31,246
It's not just this!

620
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:35,326
Whoa! I've been enduring a lot of things as well.

621
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:46,686
Should we end it then?

622
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:50,086
Are you breaking up with me?

623
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:52,206
If you're that tired about it,

624
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:53,766
we should just break up.

625
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:58,646
Okay. Then let's break up.

626
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,646
If we air this,

627
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:14,806
will the viewers think we're silly?

628
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:20,566
Well, some of them might, but it's real.

629
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:22,606
Silly is the name of the game.

630
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,326
That was the only time we said we should break up,

631
00:42:25,638 --> 00:42:27,126
but it was in the heat of the moment.

632
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:29,406
We didn't really want to break up.

633
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:31,166
Apo.

634
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,566
Do you agree that

635
00:42:33,806 --> 00:42:37,486
everything started changing when you started your own company?

636
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:41,086
Yes.

637
00:42:41,366 --> 00:42:44,486
Mueang, do you agree that lately,

638
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:47,406
you've been a lot more sarcastic?

639
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:50,446
Why?

640
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,206
I started to feel unsure about things.

641
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:57,646
Actually, the reason why we have been at odds

642
00:42:58,061 --> 00:42:59,726
wasn't just because

643
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:01,806
Po started working harder.

644
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:11,846
Po.

645
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:15,526
Marry me.

646
00:43:21,446 --> 00:43:23,446
We have been told that

647
00:43:23,549 --> 00:43:26,366
one year after you started dating,

648
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:28,886
Mueang proposed to you,

649
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:31,086
but you said no, Apo.

650
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,046
I did.

651
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:38,846
I wasn't ready.

652
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:42,886
Now that it's been three years,

653
00:43:43,006 --> 00:43:44,566
are you ready?

654
00:43:53,806 --> 00:43:55,046
Hello?

655
00:43:55,622 --> 00:43:57,046
How are things going?

656
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:00,766
Well...

657
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,526
I get to explore my thoughts.

658
00:44:05,246 --> 00:44:07,806
Yeah, Po. I've been thinking.

659
00:44:07,887 --> 00:44:09,686
You and Mueang have become distant

660
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,126
because you don't get laid often, isn't it?

661
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:15,286
Does it matter?

662
00:44:15,582 --> 00:44:18,086
It does. When was the last time?

663
00:44:18,598 --> 00:44:20,326
Tell me.

664
00:44:20,645 --> 00:44:21,806
I won't.

665
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,811
- Tell me.   - What are you asking? No!

666
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:25,094
- Tell me.   - Nah.

667
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:29,646
Tell me, please.

668
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:31,006
When?

669
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,886
Six months ago.

670
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:38,046
What? Six months?

671
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:40,606
You're as dry as Sahara now, Po!

672
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,446
This is not good.

673
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:49,326
This will not stand. Unacceptable.

674
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,346
Come on. I'll teach you a trick.

675
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:58,166
Come here.

676
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:03,982
Try this.

677
00:45:07,557 --> 00:45:08,966
Push now!

678
00:45:21,398 --> 00:45:23,206
Hey, I have to go.

679
00:46:44,086 --> 00:46:46,286
Po, did you fall for real?

680
00:46:47,085 --> 00:46:48,486
Hey...

681
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:53,446
Po. Easy. Hey.

682
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:55,166
Are you okay?

683
00:46:57,646 --> 00:46:58,806
Help me.

684
00:46:59,158 --> 00:47:00,806
- I can't get up.   - Okay.

685
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,686
Is anything broken?

686
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:10,206
No.

687
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:13,166
I'm embarrassed.

688
00:47:14,118 --> 00:47:15,446
What are you playing?

689
00:47:17,086 --> 00:47:18,406
I'm not playing.

690
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,086
Did Ing teach you something?

691
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,206
Why would you believe her?

692
00:47:25,558 --> 00:47:27,606
Use your discretion.

693
00:47:28,526 --> 00:47:33,046
Well, she said you might like something like this.

694
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:39,166
You said I needed to try. I'm trying.

695
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:41,406
What are you trying to do?

696
00:47:42,286 --> 00:47:43,926
Trying to seduce you.

697
00:47:54,885 --> 00:47:56,366
If you want to seduce me,

698
00:47:56,726 --> 00:47:58,486
you don't have to go this far.

699
00:47:59,766 --> 00:48:01,446
Just seeing your face

700
00:48:01,758 --> 00:48:03,366
gets me in the mood.

701
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:10,997
Where are you going?

702
00:48:11,893 --> 00:48:13,060
To get changed.

703
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:16,966
Why?

704
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:18,926
You put these on for me, didn't you?

705
00:48:19,254 --> 00:48:20,766
You don't like this outfit.

706
00:48:21,142 --> 00:48:22,646
Who said that?

707
00:48:22,982 --> 00:48:24,846
I like it a lot.

708
00:48:25,493 --> 00:48:27,006
What about you?

709
00:48:27,567 --> 00:48:30,766
I don't want you to force yourself if you don't like it.

710
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,486
I kind of like it.

711
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:39,646
It's a nice change.

712
00:48:53,526 --> 00:48:55,526
I thought you didn't want to do this anymore.

713
00:48:57,206 --> 00:49:00,006
I do, but work is...

714
00:49:08,238 --> 00:49:09,846
Don't talk about work.

715
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,446
No green herbal oil tonight?

716
00:49:23,078 --> 00:49:24,686
I don't want to leave a bitter taste on you.

717
00:49:39,606 --> 00:49:42,006
Are we using sex to solve problems?

718
00:49:43,365 --> 00:49:45,006
Is it working?

719
00:49:47,853 --> 00:49:49,126
Is it?

720
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:08,606
Yes?

721
00:50:13,286 --> 00:50:16,646
Okay. Give me five minutes.

722
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,446
Again?

723
00:50:30,998 --> 00:50:32,230
Seriously?

724
00:50:40,773 --> 00:50:43,446
If you love your work so much, you can marry it. I don't mind.

725
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:48,846
Don't be sarcastic.

726
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:16,206
So tense.

727
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:24,966
The mood seems kind of foul. Did something happen?

728
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:26,726
Someone ruined the mood.

729
00:51:28,438 --> 00:51:30,926
Thanks for letting me know, though I didn't want to.

730
00:51:34,381 --> 00:51:39,006
You know what? From now on, we will have some simple rules for you both.

731
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:44,446
- What rules?   - Apo, you can't talk about work at home.

732
00:51:45,046 --> 00:51:47,726
Mueang, you can't be sarcastic.

733
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:50,966
These are simple?

734
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:54,544
That's right. If either of you break the rules,

735
00:51:54,638 --> 00:51:57,486
your punishment is to hold your ear and spin five times.

736
00:51:58,438 --> 00:52:00,926
Five times? Easy.

737
00:52:01,526 --> 00:52:04,246
Mueang, if you get upset,

738
00:52:04,365 --> 00:52:06,206
the only thing you can say is,

739
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:07,766
"Po, you look gorgeous."

740
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:12,126
Apo, if you're upset, you can only say, "Mueang, you look handsome."

741
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:14,086
- What?   - What?

742
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:15,686
- For what?   - For what?

743
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:18,926
So that you can only say nice things to each other.

744
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,166
Okay.

745
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,166
Okay.

746
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:36,206
I'll be back. Just a second.

747
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:37,726
Okay.

748
00:52:40,355 --> 00:52:41,766
Yes?

749
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:45,246
Young Master?

750
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:47,766
Whoa, can't you tell me in advance?

751
00:52:47,926 --> 00:52:49,766
I can't take him today. I'm filming.

752
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:52,166
Please watch John for three hours, please.

753
00:52:52,247 --> 00:52:55,766
- I can't.   - Please, just for three hours.

754
00:52:55,855 --> 00:52:59,486
Give me and Ging a chance to be lovey-dovey. Just a bit.

755
00:52:59,646 --> 00:53:01,366
I really can't take him today.

756
00:53:01,462 --> 00:53:03,206
There are cameras all over my house.

757
00:53:03,286 --> 00:53:05,366
Ask John if he wants to be filmed.

758
00:53:05,526 --> 00:53:07,846
- Do you?   - Do you? "I do."

759
00:53:08,462 --> 00:53:09,686
I do.

760
00:53:10,006 --> 00:53:11,646
- Please, Young Master.   - Please.

761
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:13,966
- Think of this as a practice.   - Yeah.

762
00:53:17,006 --> 00:53:19,486
While we wait for Mueang, let me

763
00:53:19,621 --> 00:53:22,286
continue where we left off yesterday.

764
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:24,605
Okay.

765
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,606
Actually, the reason you don't want to get married

766
00:53:28,766 --> 00:53:31,006
is because you don't want children, right?

767
00:53:31,726 --> 00:53:33,926
It's not that I don't want children.

768
00:53:34,062 --> 00:53:35,446
I do want children.

769
00:53:35,885 --> 00:53:39,446
I just can't picture myself with a child.

770
00:53:48,046 --> 00:53:49,286
Mueang.

771
00:53:49,661 --> 00:53:50,966
Whose kid is that?

772
00:53:51,445 --> 00:53:54,246
He's Ging and Poe's kid.

773
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:57,006
That's John?

774
00:53:57,966 --> 00:54:00,086
Wow, you've grown so much.

775
00:54:00,173 --> 00:54:03,606
When I saw you last time, you were this little.

776
00:54:03,766 --> 00:54:06,126
- Okay.   - Come to Aunty.

777
00:54:06,278 --> 00:54:08,046
Let me hold you.

778
00:54:08,206 --> 00:54:09,446
- Let me see you.   - Hold him.

779
00:54:10,326 --> 00:54:13,446
You're like a family.

780
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:17,206
- "Family."   - "Family."

781
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:20,806
Mueang.

782
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,446
Is it okay for you to be a babysitter?

783
00:54:24,126 --> 00:54:26,046
What if something happens to him?

784
00:54:27,374 --> 00:54:28,926
We got cameras, you know.

785
00:54:29,653 --> 00:54:31,126
Calm down, Apo.

786
00:54:31,286 --> 00:54:34,246
Ging and Poe left him with me last week too.

787
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:35,566
Really?

788
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:38,806
You didn't tell me.

789
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:42,646
You were so busy with work. I didn't want to bother you.

790
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:44,926
You're being sarcastic.

791
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,446
Spin.

792
00:54:46,893 --> 00:54:48,086
Five times.

793
00:54:49,183 --> 00:54:50,446
Fine.

794
00:55:00,845 --> 00:55:02,086
Five.

795
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:09,086
Easy. Oh my god!

796
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:18,526
- I'll be back.   - Where are you going?

797
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:21,086
- Urgent work.   - There you go.

798
00:55:21,381 --> 00:55:22,966
You talked about work.

799
00:55:23,366 --> 00:55:25,926
It's your turn now. Five times.

800
00:55:35,237 --> 00:55:37,766
Quick. Do it quicker.

801
00:55:38,476 --> 00:55:39,846
Quick!

802
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,622
Whoa!

803
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:55,726
It's your day off. Just relax.

804
00:55:56,294 --> 00:55:57,806
- Okay.   - Hungry.

805
00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:01,966
- Hungry.   - You're hungry?

806
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:10,966
Po! He needs kids' food!

807
00:56:11,128 --> 00:56:12,806
That's som tam!

808
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:15,046
Didn't you know? Pay attention. It's spicy.

809
00:56:15,142 --> 00:56:16,606
How can he eat that?

810
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:17,806
Are you upset?

811
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,446
Po, you look gorgeous.

812
00:56:20,606 --> 00:56:21,886
Mueang, you look handsome.

813
00:56:21,974 --> 00:56:25,246
Ging made some food for him. I'll heat it up. Watch him.

814
00:56:25,406 --> 00:56:28,246
- Okay. It's all right. There, there.   - It's fine. I'll be back.

815
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:32,286
- Whoa! Why did you get som tam?   - Just go!

816
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,446
Kiddo.

817
00:56:34,533 --> 00:56:37,286
Come here. Don't cry.

818
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:43,621
I'm here.

819
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:47,686
Oh! Here's your food, kiddo.

820
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:49,451
- Po, move.   - What?

821
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:52,366
Move it. Let me do this.

822
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:58,046
Let's eat, okay? Eat.

823
00:56:58,317 --> 00:56:59,317
Eat up.

824
00:56:59,446 --> 00:57:02,526
- Eat up.   - Come on.

825
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:04,170
- Water.   - What?

826
00:57:04,251 --> 00:57:05,406
Water.

827
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:08,486
- He said water.   - Water? Okay.

828
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,446
Here you go.

829
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:19,326
Whoa! Open your mouth.

830
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,726
Who are you texting?

831
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:24,886
It's Phing.

832
00:57:25,726 --> 00:57:27,006
Let me see.

833
00:57:27,766 --> 00:57:29,126
Come on.

834
00:57:29,463 --> 00:57:30,606
Let me see.

835
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,566
Quick. Come on.

836
00:57:37,342 --> 00:57:39,342
You've been talking about work this whole time?

837
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,246
Go and spin now.

838
00:57:41,406 --> 00:57:42,926
Times the number of texts you sent.

839
00:57:43,332 --> 00:57:44,332
No.

840
00:57:44,413 --> 00:57:46,686
Do it. Rules are rules.

841
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:56,246
Stay here. Your mom is not here. She's hanging out.

842
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,861
Mueang, who are you texting?

843
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,366
Who are you texting?

844
00:58:11,846 --> 00:58:13,046
I won't tell you.

845
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:16,086
Let me see.

846
00:58:21,325 --> 00:58:22,486
Mueang.

847
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:26,206
You have been talking about me to Tin the whole time?

848
00:58:28,814 --> 00:58:30,814
Go and spin now.

849
00:58:31,102 --> 00:58:33,191
Times the number of texts you sent. Go!

850
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:35,046
- You go first.   - No, you go first.

851
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,766
- You broke the rules first.   - It's your idea.

852
00:58:36,887 --> 00:58:39,046
What did you say? Times the number of texts you sent. Go!

853
00:58:39,143 --> 00:58:41,206
Let's do it together then.

854
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:44,446
- Let's go.   - One, two, three!

855
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:49,006
One.

856
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:51,886
- You go!   - No, you go!

857
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:03,006
Mueang, you look handsome.

858
00:59:03,647 --> 00:59:05,646
Po, you look gorgeous.

859
00:59:14,462 --> 00:59:16,126
Come and pick up your kid, Poe.

860
00:59:16,277 --> 00:59:17,886
We can't take it anymore!

861
00:59:22,878 --> 00:59:25,966
John wants only you and Ging. Where are you guys now?

862
00:59:27,758 --> 00:59:30,246
Yeah! Just be quick!

863
00:59:30,854 --> 00:59:33,126
Be quick! Yeah!

864
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:51,006
John, do you know what this tree is called?

865
00:59:51,686 --> 00:59:52,726
Do you know?

866
00:59:54,444 --> 00:59:59,646
Then Aunty will teach you about a lot of trees. Is that good?

867
00:59:59,782 --> 01:00:01,782
You can show your friends.

868
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:03,286
Okay?

869
01:00:03,621 --> 01:00:05,126
You know, John?

870
01:00:05,294 --> 01:00:06,726
Telling trees apart

871
01:00:06,878 --> 01:00:09,366
is one of my talents.

872
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:15,766
This one is called Madras thorn.

873
01:00:28,486 --> 01:00:29,806
What is it?

874
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,246
John.

875
01:00:33,103 --> 01:00:36,526
Try and throw this. Oh, no!

876
01:00:37,646 --> 01:00:41,446
- Well done! Throw it to Uncle Mueang now.   - Can you?

877
01:00:45,157 --> 01:00:47,846
- Catch this, okay? One, two, three.   - Catch!

878
01:00:48,037 --> 01:00:49,494
Oh, no!

879
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:36,461
I'm so really tired!

880
01:01:40,854 --> 01:01:43,286
Today, you did well, though.

881
01:01:45,086 --> 01:01:46,486
What did I do well?

882
01:01:46,805 --> 01:01:47,886
Well...

883
01:01:49,509 --> 01:01:50,966
Being a mother.

884
01:01:52,453 --> 01:01:56,686
Seeing you today made me want to see you as the mother of my child.

885
01:01:58,326 --> 01:01:59,446
Crazy.

886
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,726
I'm not crazy.

887
01:02:00,966 --> 01:02:02,246
I'm serious.

888
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:06,606
How was it?

889
01:02:07,638 --> 01:02:09,006
A day with a child.

890
01:02:09,623 --> 01:02:12,046
Do you want to have a child now?

891
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,006
I'm so tired. I need a nap, okay?

892
01:02:54,477 --> 01:02:58,326
Everybody! Cheers!

893
01:02:58,462 --> 01:03:01,086
Let's celebrate 100,000 views!

894
01:03:02,782 --> 01:03:04,206
- Sit down, guys.   - Come on.

895
01:03:05,269 --> 01:03:07,086
The episode of Young Master and Ms. Apo

896
01:03:07,221 --> 01:03:10,366
has the highest view counts, more than any couple.

897
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:12,686
This couple is the bomb!

898
01:03:12,877 --> 01:03:15,926
Wait. Am I supposed to be happy?

899
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:19,966
Yeah. I think we're just a normal couple, nothing special.

900
01:03:20,086 --> 01:03:21,686
Why do people like to watch us?

901
01:03:21,909 --> 01:03:24,548
Actually, your couple's story is really interesting.

902
01:03:24,629 --> 01:03:29,046
Viewers feel invested. They hope your relationship lasts.

903
01:03:34,345 --> 01:03:35,726
(My goal in life?)

904
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:38,966
(I want to get married and have a child.)

905
01:03:41,716 --> 01:03:42,966
Why are you watching it now?

906
01:03:43,948 --> 01:03:46,406
I need to catch up.

907
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:53,486
(My goal in life?)

908
01:03:53,717 --> 01:03:56,126
(I want my company to do well.)

909
01:03:56,574 --> 01:03:59,206
(I'm enjoying my work so much right now.)

910
01:04:00,413 --> 01:04:02,166
(I don't think of anything else.)

911
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:10,006
What, babe? I just want to show them this is our most viewed video.

912
01:04:10,158 --> 01:04:11,566
Turn it off.

913
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:14,646
Read the room.

914
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:18,926
Mueang, you look handsome.

915
01:04:19,638 --> 01:04:22,526
Po, you look gorgeous.

916
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,546
That sounds sarcastic.

917
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,206
- Aum.   - Yes?

918
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:33,286
- Pour me.   - Yes!

919
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:36,686
- Mueang.   - Aum!

920
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,286
- Yes?   - Me too!

921
01:04:38,886 --> 01:04:40,646
Yes, sir.

922
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:43,486
This is nothing.

923
01:04:43,558 --> 01:04:45,569
Hey, let's get BBQ. Who wants some BBQ?

924
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,006
- Me!   - I want BBQ!

925
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:50,233
- Let's eat some BBQ.   - Don't forget mine, honey.

926
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:52,526
Okay, honey.

927
01:05:58,095 --> 01:06:00,886
Is it my fault that I want to get married?

928
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:02,446
It's not.

929
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:04,246
Right?

930
01:06:04,606 --> 01:06:06,926
You got married before I did.

931
01:06:08,629 --> 01:06:11,686
Ing and I share the same views.

932
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:16,766
Good for you.

933
01:06:17,646 --> 01:06:19,606
You'll have a baby soon.

934
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:23,286
Well...

935
01:06:24,262 --> 01:06:25,526
We won't.

936
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,646
Ing and I are okay with

937
01:06:27,757 --> 01:06:29,726
just the two of us with no kids.

938
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:35,246
Not everyone wants children or marriage.

939
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:39,366
Therefore, it's not your fault, and it's not Apo's fault.

940
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:43,326
The two of you should talk it out.

941
01:06:43,678 --> 01:06:45,678
If you don't share the same goal,

942
01:06:45,846 --> 01:06:47,606
it's hard to keep going.

943
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:56,806
Is it my fault

944
01:06:57,077 --> 01:06:58,366
that I think

945
01:06:58,701 --> 01:07:01,006
it's good enough as it is?

946
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,406
It's not your fault.

947
01:07:04,908 --> 01:07:07,792
If you really don't want to get married, you need to talk to him.

948
01:07:07,873 --> 01:07:09,968
You guys need to meet halfway where you're both okay

949
01:07:10,056 --> 01:07:12,246
because you guys are a couple.

950
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:14,006
Couples communicate.

951
01:07:14,182 --> 01:07:18,646
Honestly, it seems like there's no halfway with this.

952
01:07:19,021 --> 01:07:21,166
You're not even trying.

953
01:07:21,286 --> 01:07:22,526
Po.

954
01:07:23,629 --> 01:07:25,486
There are good things that come with marriage.

955
01:07:25,646 --> 01:07:27,086
- Yeah.   - Actually,

956
01:07:27,198 --> 01:07:30,646
a married life is not that different. It's nothing to be afraid of.

957
01:07:30,806 --> 01:07:33,126
I think you want to get married and have kids like Mueang,

958
01:07:33,246 --> 01:07:35,326
but you seem afraid of something. What is it?

959
01:07:35,407 --> 01:07:38,126
- Deep down, you want it. I know, right?   - Right?

960
01:07:38,546 --> 01:07:41,046
I'm your best friend. Why would I not know? I know.

961
01:07:43,486 --> 01:07:44,966
You're afraid, Po.

962
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,766
What are you afraid of?

963
01:07:58,477 --> 01:08:00,806
Yeah. You can't come up with an answer.

964
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:04,166
Think about it. If you can't answer now, think again.

965
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:21,246
Whenever you guys have a conflict,

966
01:08:21,549 --> 01:08:25,446
just think of the first time you fell in love,

967
01:08:25,741 --> 01:08:27,566
and you will have your answer

968
01:08:27,909 --> 01:08:30,126
whether you want to be with her or not.

969
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:33,206
- How did you get here?   - How did you get here?

970
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:35,006
If it comes to that,

971
01:08:35,166 --> 01:08:36,966
I think it's time to admit that in this life,

972
01:08:37,142 --> 01:08:38,806
you and Mueang will never be apart.

973
01:08:38,887 --> 01:08:40,886
Let's take this time to decide

974
01:08:40,997 --> 01:08:43,246
whether or not we want to stop pursuing our dreams

975
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:45,206
to be with each other.

976
01:08:45,406 --> 01:08:46,806
If your answer is no,

977
01:08:47,054 --> 01:08:49,726
this will probably be our last trip.

978
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,966
Let's keep going on just like this.

979
01:08:56,461 --> 01:08:57,646
Po.

980
01:08:57,926 --> 01:08:58,926
Po.
