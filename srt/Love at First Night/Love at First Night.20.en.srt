1
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:02,183
How is your love life going?

2
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:05,086
I don't know.

3
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,390
I don't know where it went wrong.

4
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:08,966
Let's get married.

5
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:15,806
We should keep the others out of this.

6
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,646
Our relationship is a matter between us.

7
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,486
We have to adjust it ourselves.

8
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:21,846
We can't.

9
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,886
I've been enduring a lot of things as well.

10
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:26,486
Should we end it then?

11
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:28,686
Are you breaking up with me?

12
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:30,526
If you're that tired about it,

13
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:32,046
we should just break up.

14
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:33,357
The two of you

15
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:34,606
should talk it out.

16
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:36,606
If you don't share the same goal,

17
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:38,566
it's hard to keep going.

18
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,446
Should we talk?

19
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,606
I already realize

20
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:51,606
that I talked about work too much.

21
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:56,406
Yeah.

22
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,606
And I always like to be sarcastic.

23
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,566
If we can fix that,

24
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,366
we'll probably fight less.

25
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:15,486
From now on,

26
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:18,371
we have to only say nice things to each other.

27
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:22,086
We can't pick a fight anymore, right?

28
00:04:24,926 --> 00:04:26,106
Understand?

29
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,926
You're so beautiful.

30
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:47,166
You're also handsome.

31
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,086
Why don't you marry me then?

32
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:21,306
When I said I didn't want to marry you,

33
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,486
it doesn't mean I don't love you.

34
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,246
I'm just afraid that...

35
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:35,806
Everything went so well when we were dating at first.

36
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,606
However, after two years,

37
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:42,806
we fight every day, Mueang.

38
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:46,846
I'm afraid that if we continue to the next step,

39
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,206
and suddenly,

40
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,566
you decide you want to break up with me,

41
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:54,726
how would I live?

42
00:05:57,726 --> 00:06:00,326
Forever really doesn't exist, does it?

43
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:08,846
It does exist.

44
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:15,526
Why would you believe words from other people?

45
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:20,006
If it doesn't exist,

46
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:23,686
we can make it ourselves.

47
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:26,446
Make it in our own way.

48
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:41,966
Why would you believe words from other people?

49
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:44,286
We are already good

50
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:45,966
at making stuff anyway.

51
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:18,286
Mueang.

52
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:22,006
Mueang.

53
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:26,166
Mueang.

54
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:30,046
Mueang.

55
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:33,486
Apo, what's wrong?

56
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:38,235
Mueang is dead.

57
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:39,966
- Huh?   - Huh?

58
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,686
Young Master is dead?

59
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:50,846
Aum.

60
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,246
Young Master is dead.

61
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:58,406
- Young Master is dead.   - Young Master is dead.

62
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,726
Aum, Young Master is dead.

63
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:05,366
Young Master is dead.

64
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,006
Young Master is dead.

65
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:12,486
- Stop! He's just sleeping. He's not dead.   - Young Master is dead.

66
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,326
Young Master is just sleeping, Ms. Apo.

67
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:21,690
- He's dead.   - Young Master is just sleeping.

68
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,286
He's dead.

69
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:25,166
I told you he's not dead.

70
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,486
Get a hold of yourself, Po.

71
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:29,892
He's just sleeping.

72
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:32,926
Why are you crying?

73
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:37,606
Ing, come here. Come here.

74
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:42,006
Mueang is dead.

75
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:45,486
Po, don't be sad.

76
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:48,646
I told you he's not dead!

77
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,058
- What should I do?   - It's alright.

78
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:58,246
You don't have to be sad. I'll take care of you.

79
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,646
It's so refreshing.

80
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:04,086
- Young Master is just sleeping.   - Mueang.

81
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:19,606
- Come here.   - I want to puke.

82
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,926
We're here. Watch out.

83
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,206
Tin.

84
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:39,406
Do you regret marrying me?

85
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:42,366
Why are you asking me that?

86
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:45,770
I can be fussy sometimes,

87
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,606
which makes you annoyed.

88
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,126
Listen, I've never regretted

89
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,806
marrying you on that day.

90
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:57,566
I also believe

91
00:09:57,814 --> 00:10:01,726
that it's the best decision in my entire life.

92
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:05,806
- Is that true?   - Yes.

93
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:08,086
Let's kiss.

94
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:24,646
Let's sleep.

95
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,966
Sure. Okay.

96
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,286
Good night.

97
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:06,846
(Forever really doesn't exist, does it?)

98
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,646
It does exist.

99
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:13,646
Why would you believe words from other people?

100
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,246
If it doesn't exist,

101
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,990
we can make it ourselves.

102
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,686
Make it in our own way.

103
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:29,206
Are you awake?

104
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,626
Phing.

105
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:38,741
Do you think I'm too afraid of the future?

106
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,326
Yes.

107
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:49,806
Po,

108
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:52,766
you can't know the future for certain.

109
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:57,486
I think if you don't want to regret it later,

110
00:12:57,766 --> 00:13:01,566
you should just make today decent enough for you.

111
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:09,246
That's true.

112
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:15,126
Thank you, my friend.

113
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,286
You're really...

114
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,126
Stop thinking about it.

115
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:36,566
Oh my, my nephew.

116
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:39,286
Are you waiting here to send me off?

117
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:42,046
Stop your acting.

118
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:43,406
That's too much.

119
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:46,006
Why can't you talk nicely?

120
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:48,966
Are you going?

121
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:50,806
No.

122
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:52,926
What's the matter?

123
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,046
Let me consult with you.

124
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:02,126
How is Phudin Park now?

125
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,806
It's good. It's the same.

126
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,926
What about Bo Phloi?

127
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:12,166
I have to admit

128
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:16,046
that since Game found the big Siamese ruby last year,

129
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,966
there have been a lot of tourists.

130
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,486
So,

131
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,526
your work is going well. You get a lot of money.

132
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:28,326
What about your love life?

133
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,726
Our lives are really weird.

134
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,766
When your work isn't good, your love life goes well.

135
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:40,126
When your work is good, your love life isn't.

136
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:49,890
Yeah. Why can't work, money, and love go well at the same time?

137
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,526
They can.

138
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,366
If you know how to reach a middle ground.

139
00:14:57,326 --> 00:15:01,486
Since Dad accepted you, you've been acting like an expert in love.

140
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:04,406
I'm cool now, aren't I?

141
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:07,286
You know,

142
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,606
I've failed in my love life for several years.

143
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:17,406
I just don't like to give up on something easily.

144
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:21,366
If you want me to give you some advice,

145
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:24,061
whenever you guys have a conflict,

146
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:28,126
just think of the first time you fell in love,

147
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,366
and you will have your answer

148
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,206
whether you want to be with her or not.

149
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:49,886
Aunt Wi, I'll help you.

150
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:52,006
Here.

151
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:53,846
I'll help you.

152
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:56,526
You can go.

153
00:15:56,948 --> 00:15:58,206
It's heavy.

154
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,646
- I can do it.   - Are you sure?

155
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:07,966
Thank you so much.

156
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:12,366
I packed up a lot of stuff with me

157
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,406
because I had to dress up to match the fashion there.

158
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,686
Is there anything you want from Japan?

159
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:24,806
You should enjoy your trip. I'm sorry that I can't go there as well.

160
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,526
Okay.

161
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:29,686
Din and I will video call you on the first day of the year.

162
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:31,566
Happy New Year.

163
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,406
Sure.

164
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,526
Look at your face.

165
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:39,366
You look sad again.

166
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:44,566
You fought with Mueang again, right?

167
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:51,086
Let me see.

168
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:56,726
It's pretty hard to act as a consultant for those two.

169
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,933
I'll try to be as neutral as possible.

170
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:05,646
Po,

171
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,926
find some time to be with yourself.

172
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:10,846
If you stay with him all the time,

173
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:13,726
it might blind you from seeing what's going on now.

174
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:16,006
Try to step back.

175
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:18,846
Everything will become clearer.

176
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:20,366
Trust me.

177
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,726
Enjoy your trip with Dad.

178
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:34,206
It's a shame that you two can't go.

179
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:37,446
We still have next time.

180
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:38,886
Sure.

181
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:43,006
Tell me where you'll celebrate the new year.

182
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,766
- I'll get going.   - Have a safe trip.

183
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,006
Yes.

184
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:55,886
Hello, Din.

185
00:17:56,262 --> 00:17:57,926
I'm going to the airport.

186
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:00,126
Really?

187
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,286
Yes. See you there.

188
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,486
Yes. Goodbye.

189
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:14,526
Listen, Mueang. Your dad really likes Japan now.

190
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:17,206
He said he still wanted to stay there after a month.

191
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,846
Drag him back to me.

192
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,966
If not, I'll cut him off from the inheritance.

193
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:26,806
Can you cut your father off from the inheritance?

194
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,486
You're crazy. I'm leaving. Come here.

195
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,846
I love both of you, alright?

196
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:42,806
Be nice.

197
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:54,246
I'm not used to it when those two are nice to each other.

198
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,726
It's good that they're nice to each other.

199
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,206
So, what should we do? There's no one else in this house.

200
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:04,646
What about Sita?

201
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,486
She's visiting her relatives.

202
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:11,366
Where do you want to

203
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:13,366
celebrate the new year?

204
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,766
Mueang.

205
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:27,046
So Apo and Mueang

206
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,006
want to use the time to do self-reflection.

207
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:30,486
Is that right?

208
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:33,246
Yes.

209
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,046
I'm the one who suggested this.

210
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,286
Does it mean you won't have a countdown together this year?

211
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:41,326
We think right now...

212
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:45,686
We should give each other time.

213
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,958
Where are you going, Apo?

214
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:56,526
I think I'll stay in Bangkok to celebrate with Aunt Da, Ri, and Om.

215
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:58,486
What about you, Mueang?

216
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,046
I might go North.

217
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,966
Okay. I hope you two have a safe trip.

218
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,670
(Whenever you guys have a conflict,)

219
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:38,846
(just think of the first time you fell in love.)

220
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,766
Hey!

221
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,046
How did you come here?

222
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:27,876
You said you would go to Chiang Mai.

223
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:29,406
You said you would go to Bangkok.

224
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:31,526
I have a change of plan.

225
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:33,366
I have a change of plan as well.

226
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:34,926
Wait...

227
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:36,926
Phing didn't do this, right?

228
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:38,526
No.

229
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:40,286
I'm here by myself.

230
00:22:40,613 --> 00:22:43,086
Phing just gave me a camera to record some video.

231
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:45,566
- It's too much of a coincidence.   - Yes.

232
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:48,726
We still see each other, although we've decided to split up for now.

233
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,446
What should we do? Are we going to stick to the same plan?

234
00:22:58,338 --> 00:23:01,686
Since we decided to do that,

235
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:04,006
we'll just do that. We'll travel separately.

236
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:05,446
Okay.

237
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:08,406
Are you sure you didn't follow me here?

238
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,206
I didn't follow you here.

239
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,046
Then, I'll get going.

240
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,006
Just go. I'll drink coffee here.

241
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:19,126
Okay.

242
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:24,966
Go.

243
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:26,613
I won't follow you.

244
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,446
What's going on?

245
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:42,206
Phing, is this your plan?

246
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,766
You met Mueang?

247
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:46,246
Yes.

248
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:48,606
Did you tell him I decided to come here instead?

249
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,260
I didn't tell him.

250
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:53,086
I didn't know he would go to the same place as you.

251
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:56,486
Ruined. It's all ruined.

252
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:58,741
It's not that ruined.

253
00:23:58,934 --> 00:24:00,406
I think it's really exciting.

254
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,086
Take a lot of videos for me, alright?

255
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:06,429
You only worry about your content.

256
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:08,926
Come on, Po.

257
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,901
Although you two go to the same beach,

258
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,086
I don't think you'll see him everywhere you go.

259
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:16,446
(If it comes to that,)

260
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:20,406
it's time to admit that in this life, you and Mueang will never be apart.

261
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:21,926
(I'll hang up now.)

262
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:24,806
Enjoy your adventure, my friend.

263
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:26,086
Bye.

264
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:39,766
What would you like?

265
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,406
Cold Americano.

266
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:44,246
- That'll be 95 baht.   - I'll transfer it to you.

267
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:45,566
Of course.

268
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,406
- Thank you.   - Thank you.

269
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,246
Please wait at the table.

270
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:07,846
Why? Are you afraid of losing?

271
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,246
Do you want to fight?

272
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:12,366
Excuse me.

273
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,286
- Yes?   - I'd like to play this.

274
00:25:15,654 --> 00:25:17,246
Oh, of course.

275
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:40,486
- Yeah!   - Woo!

276
00:25:48,153 --> 00:25:49,326
Here you are.

277
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:52,086
- It's a treat from us.   - Thank you.

278
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:55,606
- Thank you.   - Can I take a photo to be put up in the cafe?

279
00:25:57,901 --> 00:26:00,086
I don't mind. What about you?

280
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:03,726
- Sure. Do it.   - Please step closer.

281
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:06,846
Look at the camera.

282
00:26:09,726 --> 00:26:12,166
I'll count. One, two...

283
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:32,286
- Excuse me.   - Yes?

284
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:36,486
Can I take this photo?

285
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:38,166
This photo?

286
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:41,486
- The man in the photo also wanted this.   - Yes?

287
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:43,927
He came to the cafe yesterday,

288
00:26:44,008 --> 00:26:46,966
but the owner wasn't here, so I didn't dare to give it away.

289
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,006
That's why I told him to come today.

290
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,526
Oh, he's here. Sir,

291
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:53,246
this way, please.

292
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:02,206
I've asked permission from the owner.

293
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:05,166
But whom should I give this to?

294
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:30,566
I don't think we can escape each other.

295
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,326
Yeah.

296
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:38,846
Why did you choose to come here?

297
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:45,046
I haven't been to the beach in a long time.

298
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:48,630
What about you?

299
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:50,686
I'm here to think of my memories.

300
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,933
It's the place we first met each other.

301
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:00,286
I want to come here to reflect on my feelings.

302
00:28:11,214 --> 00:28:13,846
That's also the reason I came here.

303
00:28:15,886 --> 00:28:17,486
We think the same thing.

304
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:24,446
I feel like I still have hope.

305
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:28,526
Mueang.

306
00:28:30,646 --> 00:28:32,246
Our problem

307
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,526
won't just get better

308
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:37,326
if we can be sweet to each other again.

309
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:40,526
Our problem is far bigger than that.

310
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:43,326
What we want in our lives is different.

311
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:48,966
I know.

312
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,126
That's why we decided to think separately

313
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,446
to see how much we can adjust to each other.

314
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,806
But we accidentally came to the same place.

315
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:03,086
I'm afraid we might not be able to think about it.

316
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:06,446
We still might be able to think about it.

317
00:29:07,326 --> 00:29:09,286
Let's take this time to decide

318
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:12,726
whether or not we want to stop pursuing our dreams

319
00:29:13,694 --> 00:29:15,326
to be with each other.

320
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,126
If your answer is no,

321
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:22,446
this will probably be our last trip.

322
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:26,126
Do you know I don't want it to be like that?

323
00:29:28,814 --> 00:29:30,166
Me too.

324
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:41,926
Since we

325
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:44,926
are at the same place,

326
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,486
should we change the plan?

327
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:49,606
We'll go together.

328
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:51,526
Sure.

329
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:56,246
If it might be our last trip,

330
00:29:58,566 --> 00:30:00,886
we should just have as much fun as we can.

331
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:07,006
Okay.

332
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:18,766
The sea!

333
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:22,966
Mueang and Apo are here!

334
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,726
Tin and Ing, thank you.

335
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:44,286
It's fine. Tin and I aren't going anywhere this year.

336
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:47,526
So, what's going on? Why are you here to see us?

337
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:52,686
Ms. Apo and Young Master met each other at Phang Nga.

338
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,126
Ms. Apo also went to Phang Nga?

339
00:30:56,326 --> 00:30:58,726
Yes. That's why those two met each other.

340
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:03,446
That's why I want to interview you two as a special scoop.

341
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:07,046
To support Mueang and Apo. Something like that.

342
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:10,646
Sure. I'll specially make it more exciting.

343
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:13,115
You two sit over there.

344
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:15,646
- Yes.   - Say whatever is on your mind to them.

345
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:18,437
Make it so that this world is full of love.

346
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:19,606
Of course.

347
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:21,180
- Babe.   - Yes?

348
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:23,261
- Are you ready?   - I'm ready, baby.

349
00:31:23,374 --> 00:31:26,966
We'll begin. Three, two, one, action.

350
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:41,486
How are we so tired now? It hasn't been long since we started.

351
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:45,566
Yeah. Are we old now?

352
00:31:59,405 --> 00:32:00,526
Mueang.

353
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:03,726
What do you think has changed between us?

354
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:06,686
Our bodies.

355
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:09,893
I'm being serious.

356
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:12,206
Okay.

357
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:16,462
If I say it,

358
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:18,206
don't be mad.

359
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:21,926
I think you pay less attention to me.

360
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:28,766
I guess I'll admit it.

361
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:31,966
You guess?

362
00:32:32,756 --> 00:32:35,214
I really want to poke your eyes.

363
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:38,846
You're mean.

364
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:41,126
In the past,

365
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:44,326
we used to want to know more about each other.

366
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:46,366
We wanted to understand each other the best.

367
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:48,326
Right now,

368
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:51,006
those desires are already gone, right?

369
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,566
Because we know everything about each other.

370
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,046
That's not true.

371
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:03,286
Although we've been dating for a while and think we know each other well,

372
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:04,926
I think

373
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:08,766
there'll always be something new to learn about us.

374
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:13,526
Most couples who can stay with each other for a long time

375
00:33:13,918 --> 00:33:16,366
can do that because the desire of wanting to know each other

376
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,270
isn't gone.

377
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:23,566
It's difficult.

378
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,846
Who would have that much desire like we had when we first met?

379
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:33,766
It's impossible.

380
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:49,821
What's your name?

381
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:52,486
What's this?

382
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:54,326
I want to know more about you.

383
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:57,166
What's your name?

384
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:59,366
This is weird.

385
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:02,846
Just play along.

386
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:06,206
What's your name?

387
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:09,006
I'm Apo.

388
00:34:09,574 --> 00:34:11,286
What about you?

389
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:13,925
I'm Mueang.

390
00:34:14,806 --> 00:34:16,086
Are we role-playing?

391
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:17,966
Isn't this nice?

392
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:19,686
What's nice about it?

393
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:24,846
We can feel like we're just dating. We just knew each other.

394
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,286
We might be more interested in each other.

395
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,206
Nice to meet you.

396
00:34:45,854 --> 00:34:47,486
Nice to meet you.

397
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:12,166
Po.

398
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:13,886
Do you want a photo?

399
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:20,486
What's that camera?

400
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,286
You really haven't noticed it.

401
00:35:23,446 --> 00:35:25,886
- I've used this for a while.   - Really?

402
00:35:27,486 --> 00:35:29,486
I just saw it.

403
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:33,766
The film has been expensive recently, so I'm using an old digital camera.

404
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:36,726
Let's try it.

405
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:39,886
Okay? One, two...

406
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:44,726
Look at the color.

407
00:35:47,418 --> 00:35:48,926
It feels like Y2K's era.

408
00:35:50,702 --> 00:35:52,206
Let's do it again.

409
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:55,686
One, two...

410
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:58,286
One, two, three.

411
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:06,126
Give me that. I'll take a photo for you.

412
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,246
Let me see.

413
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,766
- It's decent.   - Decent?

414
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:25,166
Well then...

415
00:36:28,663 --> 00:36:30,526
Did you change your inhalant?

416
00:36:31,413 --> 00:36:32,966
I changed it a long time ago.

417
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,806
That's why the smell isn't the same.

418
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:39,246
You also haven't paid attention to me.

419
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,446
Are you sulking?

420
00:36:46,406 --> 00:36:47,686
- Let's continue.   - Are you sulking?

421
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:49,206
Let's go.

422
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,846
Don't go there. I can't go in time.

423
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:59,606
No. I can't heal you in time. No way.

424
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,166
Hold on.

425
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:06,886
- Oh, darn it. No!   - Are you playing Snake again?

426
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:10,446
There's no way I would get this excited over Snake.

427
00:37:10,557 --> 00:37:12,566
This is a new game that Om recommended to me.

428
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:14,326
New game?

429
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:19,166
I also

430
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:22,286
like this actor now, not Gong Yoo anymore.

431
00:37:29,006 --> 00:37:30,006
Here.

432
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:33,606
This is my new favorite idol.

433
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,766
I just attended her Hi-Touch event.

434
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:40,326
You don't know, right?

435
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:41,646
No, I don't know.

436
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:45,886
- Ouch.   - Who let you go to the Hi-Touch event?

437
00:37:46,713 --> 00:37:48,526
I'm sorry.

438
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:53,086
I'll let this slide for now.

439
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,046
There's a lot that I don't know about you.

440
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:01,686
There's a lot that I don't know about you as well.

441
00:38:02,886 --> 00:38:04,466
Your taste in men has changed.

442
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,286
Hi-Touch? You went to the Hi-Touch event?

443
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,566
Let me hit your hand for once. Let me.

444
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:18,326
Everyone,

445
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,510
Po said Mueang and her

446
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:22,126
- are traveling together.   - Huh?

447
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,646
- Let me see, baby.   - Here.

448
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,526
If they're traveling together...

449
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:28,286
There's hope.

450
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:33,086
They won't kill each other and hide the body in the sea, right?

451
00:38:33,886 --> 00:38:35,726
No way. That's too advanced for them.

452
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:37,286
They'll just stab each other.

453
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:42,166
Tin, why did you say that?

454
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:44,126
How are those two now?

455
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:50,126
Actually, Po had made a decision before she went on her trip.

456
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:53,726
- What?   - Baby, how could you keep us in the dark?

457
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:58,086
I'm afraid she'll change her mind after she sees Mueang.

458
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:00,086
What did she say then?

459
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:11,446
Hold on.

460
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,686
Why are we back here again?

461
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:17,286
There's a service that opens at four.

462
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:19,086
What service?

463
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:24,806
They let us write a letter to ourselves in 50 years.

464
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:28,446
Fifty years?

465
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:30,286
Wouldn't we already be dead?

466
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:33,086
I might have a long lifespan.

467
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:37,486
You can wait here if you don't want to go.

468
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:40,486
No.

469
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,126
I'll do it.

470
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:44,686
Okay.

471
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:57,086
Wait. Didn't you say we would write a letter?

472
00:39:58,006 --> 00:40:01,886
A letter is difficult to keep, so they let us record a video instead.

473
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:06,646
Mueang, can you step out for now?

474
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:08,806
I want to record it alone.

475
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,326
Sure.

476
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:12,126
Call me when you're done.

477
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:41,086
How are you, Grandma Po?

478
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:44,406
You're 80 years old. How is your knee?

479
00:41:08,406 --> 00:41:11,086
It's done. You can go in now.

480
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:13,286
Okay.

481
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,406
Let's go in together.

482
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:17,566
I want you to stay with me.

483
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:19,246
Would that be good?

484
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,966
Yes.

485
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,206
How are you, Mueang?

486
00:42:01,621 --> 00:42:02,926
You're 80 years old.

487
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:06,766
Are you still handsome?

488
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:14,326
In the next 50 years, no matter what happens,

489
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:19,046
just know that the decision you made today

490
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:21,866
is the best

491
00:42:22,614 --> 00:42:23,966
and right thing to do.

492
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:27,086
You know,

493
00:42:27,766 --> 00:42:29,166
three years ago,

494
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,286
before I recorded the video for you,

495
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,566
I met a woman.

496
00:42:38,086 --> 00:42:40,846
She made my gray world,

497
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,326
which means

498
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:45,566
your world,

499
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,086
has more colors.

500
00:42:52,413 --> 00:42:54,086
You're really lucky

501
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:55,966
that you get to date her.

502
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:00,806
Of course, there are problems when we're dating,

503
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:04,086
but nothing can change your feelings.

504
00:43:05,806 --> 00:43:07,126
This woman

505
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:11,366
is the one you want to stay with forever.

506
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:13,286
Do you know why?

507
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:15,366
Today,

508
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:17,726
when you only get to spend a little time with her,

509
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:21,766
you already fall in love with her once again.

510
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:25,246
It's that easy.

511
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,446
Therefore,

512
00:43:33,422 --> 00:43:35,422
you don't have to regret anything.

513
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:39,006
If someone has to

514
00:43:42,101 --> 00:43:43,646
throw away their dream,

515
00:43:46,886 --> 00:43:48,566
that person should be you,

516
00:43:49,446 --> 00:43:50,606
not her.

517
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:56,886
Po, if you don't want to marry,

518
00:43:57,957 --> 00:43:59,526
if you don't want to have a kid,

519
00:44:01,086 --> 00:44:02,366
it's okay.

520
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:04,806
Let's...

521
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:07,486
Let's keep going on just like this.

522
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,686
Po.

523
00:44:15,006 --> 00:44:16,206
Po.

524
00:44:43,576 --> 00:44:44,576
Po.

525
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:48,766
Why are you running away?

526
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:52,086
I feel guilty towards you.

527
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:56,366
I can't look at your face now.

528
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:00,326
It's fine.

529
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,886
It's okay.

530
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:06,686
No, it's not okay.

531
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:14,086
Po.

532
00:45:17,238 --> 00:45:18,526
It's okay.

533
00:45:19,846 --> 00:45:21,206
I'm okay, alright?

534
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,486
No.

535
00:45:23,526 --> 00:45:25,046
It's not okay, Mueang.

536
00:45:28,221 --> 00:45:30,886
I don't want you to feel like this.

537
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:36,686
I was going to tell you

538
00:45:36,852 --> 00:45:39,286
when we meet again at home, but...

539
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:41,926
Since you already said it,

540
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:46,766
I think we should just talk about it right now.

541
00:45:49,286 --> 00:45:50,526
I...

542
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,246
I already made a decision before coming here.

543
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:57,886
I already made a decision the night you told me this.

544
00:45:58,102 --> 00:46:00,486
If forever doesn't exist,

545
00:46:01,197 --> 00:46:03,846
we can make it in our own way.

546
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:07,646
But I want us to have some time for ourselves

547
00:46:08,372 --> 00:46:12,277
so that we can think and do everything more carefully.

548
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:15,646
Mueang.

549
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:18,166
I don't want to marry.

550
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:23,573
Marriage isn't my life goal anymore.

551
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:28,766
I know that. I understand.

552
00:46:30,726 --> 00:46:34,686
I admit that before I met you, when I was a child,

553
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,646
I wanted to marry.

554
00:46:38,518 --> 00:46:41,766
Right now, I don't have that kind of image in my head anymore.

555
00:46:42,606 --> 00:46:45,006
I can't see myself wearing a bridal dress.

556
00:46:45,638 --> 00:46:50,046
I can't see the value of holding a big wedding for someone else.

557
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,486
Mueang,

558
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,677
can we skip the wedding

559
00:46:56,051 --> 00:46:58,261
and have a child instead?

560
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:59,606
Huh?

561
00:47:01,158 --> 00:47:02,446
Well...

562
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,126
When you told me

563
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:08,886
I could be a mother,

564
00:47:10,214 --> 00:47:15,246
and you wanted to see me as a mother of your child,

565
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,846
I already realized

566
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:23,326
that I was ready to have a family with you.

567
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:30,286
I just want my company to be more stable.

568
00:47:31,373 --> 00:47:32,806
But I thought about it more.

569
00:47:32,966 --> 00:47:37,486
I think I'm ready to have a child with you at the end of next year.

570
00:47:37,686 --> 00:47:39,886
Is it too slow?

571
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:41,926
Wait, Po.

572
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,470
I'm so confused. Can you explain it more?

573
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:52,086
You said we could make "forever" in our own way.

574
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:54,926
I believe we can make it ourselves,

575
00:47:55,878 --> 00:47:58,446
but is it the kind of "forever" that you want?

576
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:08,206
Po, it's even better than what I asked for.

577
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:10,846
Is that true?

578
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:15,226
But you won't get to have a wedding.

579
00:48:16,332 --> 00:48:19,940
You always like to talk about our wedding and its theme...

580
00:48:20,077 --> 00:48:22,166
It won't happen like this, you know?

581
00:48:22,373 --> 00:48:23,766
Are you really okay with it?

582
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:29,246
What if there are only the two of us at the wedding?

583
00:48:30,966 --> 00:48:32,246
Are you okay with it?

584
00:48:33,126 --> 00:48:34,126
I...

585
00:48:34,486 --> 00:48:37,206
There won't be any ceremony. I just want to propose to you.

586
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,206
You only have to accept it.

587
00:48:40,286 --> 00:48:42,206
I only want that small moment

588
00:48:42,446 --> 00:48:44,486
before we go into the next step

589
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,750
as your husband.

590
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,886
Do you only

591
00:48:49,214 --> 00:48:50,566
want that?

592
00:48:51,956 --> 00:48:53,166
Yes.

593
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,506
Why didn't you tell me first?

594
00:48:59,446 --> 00:49:01,286
Why didn't we just talk about it first?

595
00:49:02,446 --> 00:49:04,806
Do you only want that at your wedding?

596
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:09,566
Two years ago,

597
00:49:10,006 --> 00:49:12,246
you rejected me. I'm still hurt about it.

598
00:49:14,606 --> 00:49:17,486
I just want to hear the word "I accept" from you.

599
00:49:17,734 --> 00:49:19,246
I want to hear you say yes.

600
00:49:28,534 --> 00:49:29,806
Can you do that for me?

601
00:49:33,194 --> 00:49:36,526
Of course. I can easily do that for you.

602
00:49:40,886 --> 00:49:42,406
I'll be back. Wait here.

603
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:44,646
Don't go anywhere. I'll be back. I won't take too long.

604
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:46,186
Mueang, where are you going?

605
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,286
Where have you been?

606
00:50:23,926 --> 00:50:25,326
I didn't have it last year,

607
00:50:25,614 --> 00:50:26,966
but I have it this year.

608
00:50:27,451 --> 00:50:30,446
Did you bring it with you?

609
00:50:31,181 --> 00:50:33,366
I bring it with me everywhere.

610
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,686
It was my mom's ring.

611
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:39,746
She said

612
00:50:40,188 --> 00:50:42,486
I should give it to the one I love.

613
00:50:43,046 --> 00:50:44,526
The one I want to marry.

614
00:50:51,286 --> 00:50:53,726
I probably have to say a cliche thing here

615
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:54,926
because

616
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:56,726
we're at the beach.

617
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,350
It's probably the most cliche spot you could have.

618
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:01,686
It's fine.

619
00:51:03,991 --> 00:51:06,166
Everywhere is special when I have you.

620
00:51:06,693 --> 00:51:07,933
Just say it.

621
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:10,286
I know

622
00:51:11,806 --> 00:51:13,606
that I have a lot of flaws,

623
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:17,206
but I'm ready to change them.

624
00:51:18,806 --> 00:51:20,246
I'm ready to adjust.

625
00:51:21,486 --> 00:51:23,686
I don't know if I'll do it well,

626
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:27,221
but I'll try my best

627
00:51:30,398 --> 00:51:31,766
because I realize now

628
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,726
that I want to only be with you

629
00:51:37,246 --> 00:51:38,366
and you alone.

630
00:51:52,726 --> 00:51:55,646
Let's make a legend...

631
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,086
Sorry.

632
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,006
We're going to make a legend?

633
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:01,566
Let me try it again.

634
00:52:01,766 --> 00:52:04,366
- My tongue just became weak.   - Calm down, Mueang.

635
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,326
Let's make a "forever"

636
00:52:13,462 --> 00:52:15,206
in our own way.

637
00:52:19,174 --> 00:52:20,806
Please marry me, Po.

638
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,806
Yes. I'll marry you.

639
00:52:25,086 --> 00:52:26,126
Yes.

640
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:28,526
Yes!

641
00:52:40,086 --> 00:52:41,486
Mueang.

642
00:52:42,342 --> 00:52:44,086
Sorry. I almost fell down.

643
00:52:45,046 --> 00:52:46,446
I was a little excited.

644
00:52:48,737 --> 00:52:50,086
Not a little, I think.

645
00:53:03,942 --> 00:53:06,166
So, we're married now, right?

646
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:07,566
Yes.

647
00:53:08,013 --> 00:53:09,606
It's that easy.

648
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,446
You're my wife now.

649
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:17,446
Okay.

650
00:53:18,326 --> 00:53:20,086
My husband.

651
00:53:55,776 --> 00:53:57,446
Everyone,

652
00:53:58,198 --> 00:54:01,686
Po and Mueang are married now.

653
00:54:09,085 --> 00:54:11,894
I'm happy for them. It's like I'm getting married again.

654
00:54:12,486 --> 00:54:13,886
You're exaggerating.

655
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:18,046
Baby, you're crying because you're happy, right?

656
00:54:19,094 --> 00:54:23,126
- I'm sad that my friend already has a husband.   - Baby?

657
00:54:23,902 --> 00:54:28,726
Just kidding. Of course, I'm happy. I'm so happy.

658
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:31,966
Hey, everyone.

659
00:54:32,086 --> 00:54:35,326
- Mueang is calling me.   - What? Let's go.

660
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:38,086
Mueang.

661
00:54:38,286 --> 00:54:40,006
We're married now.

662
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:46,078
My ears! Stop. Please stop.

663
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,886
Congratulations, Mueang.

664
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:53,246
Congratulations, both of you. Really.

665
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,006
I'm really happy for you two.

666
00:54:56,117 --> 00:54:58,686
I didn't think this day would come.

667
00:54:59,015 --> 00:55:01,686
I'm really happy for you, Young Master.

668
00:55:02,686 --> 00:55:04,366
Thank you, everyone.

669
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:06,606
Thank you, everyone.

670
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:08,526
I have to thank Phing and Aum's show.

671
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,486
Young Master.

672
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:14,166
You have to give credit to my baby.

673
00:55:14,302 --> 00:55:15,694
If you want to give credit,

674
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:19,413
you have to credit Aum, Tin, and Ing as well.

675
00:55:19,726 --> 00:55:22,366
(Mueang, Apo, I have to tell you this first.)

676
00:55:22,478 --> 00:55:27,046
(Well, this show is a plan between the four of us.)

677
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:30,606
How did Mueang and Apo become like this?

678
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:33,166
Their relationship went downhill.

679
00:55:33,278 --> 00:55:35,686
If this continues, it'll be over soon.

680
00:55:35,926 --> 00:55:38,686
We have to find something to help them.

681
00:55:39,757 --> 00:55:41,125
- How?   - How?

682
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:46,726
(We wanted you two to make up, so we came up with this show.)

683
00:55:47,326 --> 00:55:48,865
I'm sorry.

684
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:51,011
I know I'm being nosy,

685
00:55:51,107 --> 00:55:54,446
but you can just scold me. I can accept it.

686
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:56,046
Are you crazy?

687
00:55:56,952 --> 00:56:00,046
Why would I scold someone who has this much goodwill for me?

688
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:04,180
Please forgive this nosy woman who loves you, Apo.

689
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:05,846
Baby...

690
00:56:07,646 --> 00:56:10,326
Fine. Don't cry.

691
00:56:10,438 --> 00:56:12,438
I'll give you a lot of footage to choose from.

692
00:56:12,566 --> 00:56:15,886
I don't want any footage now. I'm glad that you two are happy.

693
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:18,566
Baby, I still want the footage. I still have to edit the video.

694
00:56:20,078 --> 00:56:22,446
Right, tomorrow is already the new year.

695
00:56:22,702 --> 00:56:25,526
I wish all of you a lot of happiness.

696
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:27,566
Bye.

697
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,821
- Bye.   - Bye, Young Master, Ms. Apo.

698
00:56:32,902 --> 00:56:34,406
Happy New Year.

699
00:56:45,629 --> 00:56:50,046
Look, Dad and Wi are still sending congratulatory messages.

700
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:52,966
My family is the same.

701
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:57,166
Ri wants us to hold a wedding because she wants a bridal bouquet.

702
00:56:58,726 --> 00:57:00,126
Are you changing your mind?

703
00:57:01,532 --> 00:57:03,886
No. I want it like this.

704
00:57:05,301 --> 00:57:08,606
Are you okay with us celebrating the new year

705
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,206
quietly like this?

706
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:12,366
I'm okay with it.

707
00:57:12,534 --> 00:57:14,846
I don't like crowds anyway.

708
00:57:15,126 --> 00:57:17,166
This spot is nice for watching fireworks.

709
00:57:19,846 --> 00:57:21,646
If you're surprised by the sound of it,

710
00:57:22,062 --> 00:57:23,606
I'll cover your ears.

711
00:57:24,766 --> 00:57:26,886
As expected of my Mueang.

712
00:57:36,926 --> 00:57:38,046
Po,

713
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:40,006
can I ask you something?

714
00:57:41,294 --> 00:57:43,046
I've never known

715
00:57:43,245 --> 00:57:45,245
when you fell in love with me.

716
00:57:49,075 --> 00:57:51,766
Why did you ask me that? It's embarrassing.

717
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:56,286
I'm curious. When was the first time your heart trembled for me?

718
00:58:00,672 --> 00:58:02,086
Honestly,

719
00:58:02,997 --> 00:58:04,326
I...

720
00:58:05,901 --> 00:58:09,006
I have felt that way since the first time we met here.

721
00:58:10,814 --> 00:58:12,646
I knew it.

722
00:58:12,877 --> 00:58:15,086
You must have felt something back then.

723
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:19,566
What's the exact moment?

724
00:58:23,246 --> 00:58:25,406
Since the first night we've been together.

725
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:31,126
When we flirted inside that van?

726
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:34,126
No.

727
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:37,766
That's the seventh night, not the first night.

728
00:58:40,366 --> 00:58:41,806
Do you remember?

729
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:45,846
That day was the first day we traveled together.

730
00:58:46,246 --> 00:58:48,246
I was still nervous.

731
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:51,886
That's why I talked about something strange with you.

732
00:58:52,197 --> 00:58:54,526
This tomato looks sad.

733
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:57,926
This one is just a slice, while others are still round.

734
00:59:00,926 --> 00:59:03,886
They probably made it in a hurry.

735
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,766
It looks sad.

736
00:59:10,966 --> 00:59:12,326
Wait.

737
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,046
It's not sad anymore.

738
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:23,566
Tomato with shrimp?

739
00:59:24,526 --> 00:59:25,646
Why?

740
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:27,006
Well,

741
00:59:27,206 --> 00:59:29,326
those two are from different species.

742
00:59:30,142 --> 00:59:31,906
It can still stick together.

743
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,406
Although it looks a little weird.

744
00:59:37,638 --> 00:59:39,286
That's the same with a couple.

745
00:59:39,469 --> 00:59:41,086
Two people who are different from each other

746
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,606
can still fulfill each other.

747
00:59:49,926 --> 00:59:52,326
You're not lonely anymore, Tomato.

748
00:59:52,836 --> 00:59:54,566
I have another slice for you.

749
01:00:04,877 --> 01:00:06,006
That's it.

750
01:00:06,157 --> 01:00:08,886
That's the first time my heart trembled for you.

751
01:00:15,326 --> 01:00:17,326
I also want to tell you a secret.

752
01:00:18,424 --> 01:00:19,886
What secret?

753
01:00:21,157 --> 01:00:24,166
When I told you I fell in love with you

754
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:26,886
when we were playing with rubber bands,

755
01:00:28,046 --> 01:00:29,406
actually,

756
01:00:29,998 --> 01:00:31,206
it's earlier than that.

757
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:36,446
I'm sorry for making you wait.

758
01:00:44,206 --> 01:00:45,366
It's fine.

759
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:55,646
You know,

760
01:00:55,766 --> 01:00:59,246
the image of you turning back to me is still in my head.

761
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:02,926
We fell for each other during our first night?

762
01:01:04,746 --> 01:01:06,086
Is this true?

763
01:01:06,878 --> 01:01:08,126
Probably.

764
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,462
It's almost time.

765
01:01:19,637 --> 01:01:20,726
Let's count it down.

766
01:01:20,933 --> 01:01:23,206
Ten, nine,

767
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:24,887
eight, seven,

768
01:01:24,998 --> 01:01:26,886
six, five,

769
01:01:27,071 --> 01:01:31,590
four, three, two, one.

770
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:37,646
- Happy New Year!   - Happy New Year!

771
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:51,286
I promise I'll be a good girl this year.

772
01:01:51,566 --> 01:01:52,606
Can I believe you?

773
01:01:52,695 --> 01:01:54,206
Of course.

774
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,798
Thank you for staying with me.

775
01:01:57,629 --> 01:01:59,006
Thank you

776
01:01:59,357 --> 01:02:02,526
for making my life wonderful.

777
01:02:03,238 --> 01:02:05,166
- I love you.   - I love you.

778
01:02:05,926 --> 01:02:07,606
Please stay with me for a long time.

779
01:02:14,341 --> 01:02:16,846
Happy New Year, darling.

780
01:02:17,456 --> 01:02:20,446
Darling, here.

781
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:24,286
We thought the same thing. Happy New Year, darling.

782
01:02:24,397 --> 01:02:27,086
You're so cute. Thank you.

783
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:32,086
Next year, I'll still have a New Year countdown with this woman.

784
01:02:32,237 --> 01:02:33,486
Me too.

785
01:02:44,054 --> 01:02:45,646
Happy New Year, Po.

786
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,846
Happy New Year, Mueang.

787
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:52,526
We'll celebrate this together until we're old.

788
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:03,286
(In the heat of the moment,)

789
01:03:03,525 --> 01:03:07,526
(we forgot ourselves. Our first baby came on that day.)

790
01:03:07,844 --> 01:03:10,366
(Our first son is Clayton.)

791
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,086
(It's from the word "Clay," which means soil.)

792
01:03:16,013 --> 01:03:17,726
You're so obsessed with him.

793
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,246
Should we have another one?

794
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:38,726
(Our second child is a daughter.)

795
01:03:38,807 --> 01:03:40,166
(She's River.)

796
01:03:40,413 --> 01:03:41,806
(It comes from my name "Apo,")

797
01:03:41,966 --> 01:03:43,806
(which means water.)

798
01:04:08,014 --> 01:04:10,406
Here you are. Good job.

799
01:04:13,366 --> 01:04:14,446
Po.

800
01:04:23,286 --> 01:04:24,726
My heart is still trembling.

801
01:04:27,487 --> 01:04:28,926
Whose wife is this?

802
01:04:29,508 --> 01:04:31,806
You're still beautiful even though you have had two kids.

803
01:04:31,887 --> 01:04:33,166
You're exaggerating.

804
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:37,166
That's the one habit you've never changed. You always like to exaggerate.

805
01:04:37,523 --> 01:04:38,886
I'm serious.

806
01:04:39,286 --> 01:04:41,726
Why are you this beautiful even though you're standing still?

807
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,446
You're too much.

808
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:47,686
When I get older,

809
01:04:47,806 --> 01:04:51,246
and my face has wrinkles, will you still call me beautiful?

810
01:04:51,422 --> 01:04:52,766
Of course.

811
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:55,846
You can say that now.

812
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:57,749
Just you wait, then.

813
01:05:08,078 --> 01:05:09,606
(Hello, everyone.)

814
01:05:10,134 --> 01:05:11,646
(Hello.)

815
01:05:13,084 --> 01:05:16,126
(This is probably the last time we'll get to talk.)

816
01:05:18,927 --> 01:05:20,126
(Thank you)

817
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,806
(for always watching over us.)

818
01:05:23,446 --> 01:05:27,246
(I don't think we have anything to consult with you anymore.)

819
01:05:29,886 --> 01:05:31,126
(But...)

820
01:05:31,278 --> 01:05:33,966
(We want to express our support to all of you.)

821
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:38,006
(If you believe in true love,)

822
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:42,486
(one day,)

823
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,966
(you'll find the one for you.)

824
01:05:54,661 --> 01:05:57,006
(The one who saves your life.)

825
01:05:59,926 --> 01:06:01,926
(The one who always hugs you.)

826
01:06:02,086 --> 01:06:04,646
(The one who makes you feel like you're not alone.)

827
01:06:11,846 --> 01:06:14,086
(The one who is always ready to be crazy with you.)

828
01:06:14,806 --> 01:06:17,606
If you want to do or say something,

829
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,086
please do it soon.

830
01:06:19,461 --> 01:06:22,086
Don't wait until he's gone to realize

831
01:06:22,406 --> 01:06:24,206
that you want to apologize to him,

832
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:26,646
that you want to thank him,

833
01:06:27,165 --> 01:06:28,966
or that you want to say you love him.

834
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:33,246
(The one who can be honest with you.)

835
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,965
From now on,

836
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,046
let's have happiness together.

837
01:06:37,646 --> 01:06:40,006
(The one who wants to see you happy.)

838
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:46,446
(The one who can accept you.)

839
01:06:52,886 --> 01:06:55,766
(The one who is always prepared to protect you.)

840
01:06:58,006 --> 01:06:59,466
(If you find them,)

841
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,766
(please do your best to protect them.)

842
01:07:04,326 --> 01:07:06,606
(Please love them like it's the first day.)

843
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:09,686
(If you still can't find them,)

844
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:12,086
(please continue to find them.)

845
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:14,626
(We'll be cheering you on.)

846
01:07:16,526 --> 01:07:19,806
(True love is waiting for you.)
