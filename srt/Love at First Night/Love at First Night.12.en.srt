1
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,446
I'd like to challenge you two

2
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:04,636
to swap your life with another for a month.

3
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:06,806
Mr. Phudin will live Mueang's life.

4
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:09,166
Mueang will live Mr. Phudin's life.

5
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,886
This is the best way to make you guys understand each other.

6
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:14,806
I've never blamed you for Mom's death.

7
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,686
However, after she passed away,

8
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:19,046
have you ever been a good father to me?

9
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:20,846
Where were you

10
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:22,366
when I needed you?

11
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:23,886
Why are you taking care of me?

12
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:26,966
Do you care about me?

13
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,766
How did it come to this?

14
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:34,406
- I'm here to let you know.   - Let me know what?

15
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,893
I'm hitting on you.

16
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:40,486
It's Apo.

17
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:43,926
Smeagol.

18
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,446
Who are you calling?

19
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:52,846
I'm calling you Smeagol.

20
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:56,086
You're like Gollum, a bald and short creature from Lord of the Rings.

21
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:58,446
The one obsessed with the ring so much that he's known for

22
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:00,954
"My precious..."

23
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,086
Am I a joke to you? Go do that somewhere else.

24
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,362
Listen, can I ask you something?

25
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:10,766
Do you want that necklace so much that you have to hit on Mueang?

26
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:13,206
Yeah. I can do everything

27
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:15,287
to get what I want.

28
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:17,446
Why do you want it that much?

29
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:19,086
I have my reasons.

30
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:20,326
What reasons?

31
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,206
Let's just say I'm in a hurry. I hope you won't get in my way.

32
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,926
My precious...

33
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,446
Please apply the ointment.

34
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:44,846
Thanks.

35
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:48,806
You haven't had urticaria for a while, Young Master.

36
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,686
You have to take better care of yourself from now on.

37
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:56,246
Yeah. I'm in pretty bad shape. I do have a lot of sickness.

38
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:59,486
See? That's why you shouldn't go wild outside for now.

39
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,206
Are you trying to warn me?

40
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:03,966
Aum.

41
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,766
Tin, did Ing already leave?

42
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:08,086
Yes.

43
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:11,326
Don't you think Ing is strange?

44
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:12,566
Yes.

45
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:14,517
I think I've been in this world for some time,

46
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,926
but I've never seen someone like her before.

47
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:21,486
Did something happen when I wasn't here?

48
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:23,126
Stop getting nosy.

49
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:26,166
I already forgive you for letting Apo in the house.

50
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:29,686
Well, I had to go buy medicine, Young Master.

51
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:31,886
You should go out for now.

52
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,526
The cool guys here need to talk.

53
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:38,246
Yes.

54
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:42,006
I was worried about you. You shouldn't have chased me away.

55
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:48,726
Tin.

56
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:53,686
Do you think Apo will feel anything when

57
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,726
there's a woman who likes me?

58
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:58,446
Yes.

59
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,526
I think I shouldn't have come here.

60
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:05,246
I think everyone else already knows.

61
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,366
There's only you who still don't know.

62
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:08,846
Know what?

63
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:13,766
Hey, Tin. Wait.

64
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:15,886
What do I have to know?

65
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:18,846
You have to think. Think! Use your brain.

66
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,126
What are you doing?

67
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:29,309
I'm here to let you know.

68
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,286
- Let me know what?   - I'm hitting on you.

69
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,526
It's too stiff. It's so fake.

70
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:38,606
Mueang probably noticed, right?

71
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:42,766
Hey.

72
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,014
Are you back, Mr. Phudin?

73
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:50,886
How is your swapped life today?

74
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,286
Do you have anything to tell me?

75
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,206
I don't.

76
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:14,086
What did you call me for, Mr. Phudin?

77
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,486
Follow me.

78
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,286
Mr. Phudin, what's the matter?

79
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:32,206
I want you to investigate something.

80
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:48,846
Don't scratch it. That's enough.

81
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:07,686
(Phing)

82
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,128
Hello?

83
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,846
(Hello, Po.)

84
00:07:11,986 --> 00:07:13,926
I had a really bad dream last night.

85
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:16,060
I dreamed that Mueang was surfing

86
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:17,486
and he was moving towards you.

87
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,006
(The big wave that Mueang was on)

88
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,006
came crashing down on you.

89
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:23,366
You disappeared into the sea.

90
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:26,886
That's probably an omen.

91
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:28,766
Huh? What do you mean?

92
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:31,406
Are you getting crushed by Mueang's waves?

93
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,206
Don't think too much about it. It's just a nightmare.

94
00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:37,926
Honestly,

95
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,005
I'm not sure if I can call it a nightmare

96
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:43,165
because there were some parts where you and Mueang

97
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:45,406
seemed really happy.

98
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,006
(That's why I've been thinking.)

99
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:49,830
What if you don't have to marry to pay off your debt?

100
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:51,446
What would happen between you and Mueang?

101
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:56,566
Well, we would probably go our separate ways.

102
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,486
(If it's really just a fleeting moment for you, it might end like that.)

103
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:01,806
(If not,)

104
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:03,366
you and Mueang

105
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:08,086
might be going on a date right now in another parallel world.

106
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:17,686
(I used to think about it.)

107
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,606
(What if I didn't go back)

108
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:21,646
(to Bangkok that morning?)

109
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,166
(Would anything change at all?)

110
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:34,486
(Aunt Da)

111
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:05,726
(Apo.)

112
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,606
(I'm sleepy. I'll go to bed again. Your life caused me to wake up.)

113
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:14,166
Don't appear in my dreams too often. You should rest, you know.

114
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:17,766
Wait. I'm still not dead.

115
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:20,046
You have to be careful.

116
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:21,886
I'll hang up now. Bye.

117
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,166
Bye.

118
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:33,686
You have to stay in reality, Apo.

119
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:07,669
Wait.

120
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,246
Come here.

121
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:30,646
What's the matter?

122
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:37,166
I'm glad for you. Your face isn't red anymore.

123
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:51,406
(This man isn't bad.)

124
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,486
Hey.

125
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:09,206
I asked you a question.

126
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,046
What was it again?

127
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:14,046
I asked you why you followed my Instagram account.

128
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:15,526
Follow your account?

129
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:38,726
You want to look at my account, right?

130
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:42,766
Dream on.

131
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,246
(Request Sent)

132
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:55,846
When did I do that?

133
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:06,646
Hello. Welcome to Phudin Park.

134
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:09,686
Everyone, please come down this way.

135
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:13,437
You can receive the balloons from the rabbit.

136
00:12:18,998 --> 00:12:20,926
- Young Master, hello.   - Hello.

137
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,501
Everything is alright here.

138
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,206
We have to greet him too.

139
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:35,286
- Hello, Young Master.   - Hello, Young Master.

140
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:53,366
You're really in my way.

141
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,086
Hold on.

142
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,406
Are you taking photos? Do you want a model?

143
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,686
I don't want it.

144
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,246
And this is serious.

145
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,606
I'm working.

146
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:08,326
What are you working on? Do you need my help?

147
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,646
No.

148
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,046
Mueang.

149
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:16,046
You dropped something.

150
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,766
Give it back.

151
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,566
Do you want to renovate this place?

152
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,206
It's not your business.

153
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:30,726
That's interesting. Let me help you.

154
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,406
No. Get away from here.

155
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:33,873
Do you think we don't know

156
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,981
that you come here for what?

157
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,709
What do I want?

158
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:40,886
You want to be close to me to make my heart tremble.

159
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,406
If your heart doesn't tremble, you don't have anything to be afraid of.

160
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,886
You can use me to your advantage.

161
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:50,566
I'm here to find inspiration for designing my new products.

162
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:55,046
We can just take a look around Phudin Park together.

163
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:59,406
I'll tell you what you should renovate, alright?

164
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:04,286
I'm a customer who has come here since I was a child.

165
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:06,886
Are you sure you won't cause trouble?

166
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:08,846
I'm sure.

167
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:10,526
Fine.

168
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:18,286
Is that Mueang's girlfriend?

169
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,446
Probably. I've seen her come to see him several times.

170
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:27,046
Who are you talking about?

171
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,446
The cute girl who owns a jewelry brand.

172
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,846
Apparently, she's having lunch with Mueang in the cafeteria.

173
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:38,646
They're probably dating. They might already be a couple.

174
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:50,286
- Num, can you look at this? I need to go to the toilet.   - Sure.

175
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,326
This is bad.

176
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,046
I'm starving.

177
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,126
- I'm really starving.   - I'll eat them all.

178
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,926
- I might steal some from you.   - I'll take a nap.

179
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:25,686
Young Master?

180
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:30,204
He's really holding her shoulder.

181
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:33,326
- Oh my.   - Something has to be going on.

182
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,686
Hey, go get your food. Go.

183
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:42,006
How is it?

184
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,210
Are you okay?

185
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:50,126
It's too bitter. My Adam's apple almost came out.

186
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:53,486
You can't die here. Our park would be on the news.

187
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,422
Have some water.

188
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:04,486
How is it now?

189
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:06,047
I'm full. We can continue.

190
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,366
- Let's go.   - Let's go. Come here.

191
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:10,966
- I'm starving.   - I'm here.

192
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,086
Take the tray with you.

193
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:19,086
Where are we going next?

194
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:20,604
Anywhere.

195
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:22,486
- Anywhere?   - You can take me anywhere.

196
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:26,366
Let's go.

197
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,246
- Is this real?   - Wow.

198
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:31,286
This is really important.

199
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,333
There's only grass again.

200
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:36,446
When there's only greenery, it doesn't look fun.

201
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,966
You should find some colorful booths to put here.

202
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:44,526
Yeah. This area only needs a little renovation.

203
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:48,606
You do say some beneficial things.

204
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:52,352
See? Didn't I tell you that you should have taken me with you?

205
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:54,206
You can invite me here in later days.

206
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:57,246
No way. A day is enough for me.

207
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,966
Why...

208
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:01,846
Wait.

209
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:05,406
I think I remember this area.

210
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,046
Didn't this place have a fortune-telling booth?

211
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,406
Uncle Din took me and you here when we were children.

212
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:11,646
Don't you remember?

213
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,326
This area.

214
00:17:13,806 --> 00:17:15,126
I can't remember.

215
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:17,606
It was when...

216
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:21,926
Excuse me for this, but the fortune teller said you wouldn't live long.

217
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,446
So, Uncle Din chased them away immediately.

218
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:27,566
- Are you joking?   - No.

219
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:30,126
My mom told me about it again when I grew up.

220
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:33,046
After that, Uncle Din stopped believing in that kind of thing.

221
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:36,326
Is it true?

222
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:38,806
Yeah. Can't you remember?

223
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:47,246
Did you learn anything?

224
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,486
I've contacted the surfing school around there.

225
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:51,886
They wouldn't reveal their customer's data.

226
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,542
That's why I have to find another way.

227
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:56,366
I'll leave it to you.

228
00:17:56,686 --> 00:18:00,046
Why don't you ask Mr. Mueang and Ms. Apo themselves?

229
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:02,031
If it's that simple,

230
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:04,486
they wouldn't have kept quiet until now.

231
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:05,966
That's true.

232
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:08,046
I think it's suspicious.

233
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:10,566
If Mr. Mueang and Ms. Apo have met each other before,

234
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:12,726
why would they have to act like they don't know each other?

235
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:18,086
It might be because they have a relationship they couldn't tell me about.

236
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,966
(One, two, three.)

237
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,486
(Turn around.)

238
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:07,806
What's wrong?

239
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,206
You've been absent-minded since this morning.

240
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,006
Did Ing already leave?

241
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,854
How did you know she was here?

242
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:22,406
I saw you at the cafeteria with her.

243
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:26,486
Are you dating her right now?

244
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:28,486
Why are you asking me that?

245
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:31,126
It's nothing.

246
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,726
I'll take note of it

247
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:35,486
if you're dating.

248
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:01,486
Excuse me.

249
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,086
Ms. Stepmother.

250
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:04,846
Is the Ferris wheel already closed?

251
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:06,166
It's still open.

252
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:07,965
I'd like to ride it.

253
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:09,326
Of course. You can get on.

254
00:20:14,574 --> 00:20:16,126
- Mueang.   - Close it.

255
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:19,526
Why are you here?

256
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:20,966
It's my Ferris wheel.

257
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:22,366
Why can't I ride it?

258
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:45,606
Why are you acting strange?

259
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:51,366
I think I'm being normal.

260
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:53,246
How is it normal?

261
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:56,246
You said you cared about me the other day.

262
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:57,966
When I talked to you,

263
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:00,966
you were absent-minded. It's weird.

264
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,086
What are you thinking?

265
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,446
I just have no concentration.

266
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,966
I have a lot to think about.

267
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:11,366
What are you thinking about?

268
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:15,606
About everything.

269
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:17,926
Like what?

270
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:21,566
Why do I have to tell you?

271
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:23,246
Okay.

272
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,246
I'll stop asking.

273
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:28,006
I'll get off.

274
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:32,406
Why did you ride this in the first place?

275
00:21:50,246 --> 00:21:51,846
When you asked me earlier

276
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:54,606
if I was dating Ing...

277
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,486
What's wrong?

278
00:21:58,206 --> 00:22:00,006
I just want to let you know I'm not dating Ing.

279
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,606
I like another woman.

280
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:15,366
(If it's really just a fleeting moment for you,)

281
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,606
(it might end like that.)

282
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,646
(If not,)

283
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:24,802
(you and Mueang)

284
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:28,686
(might be going on a date right now in another parallel world.)

285
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:42,726
(If we woke up)

286
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:45,086
(to each other on that day...)

287
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:48,446
Did you have a good sleep?

288
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:51,326
I haven't had a good sleep like this in a long time.

289
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:53,086
(I might)

290
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:55,926
(really go on a date with him.)

291
00:23:03,621 --> 00:23:05,046
(Honestly,)

292
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:07,566
(I don't know how it's going to be.)

293
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:23,166
(It might work.)

294
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,526
(Or it might not work.)

295
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:49,806
(But right now,)

296
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,486
(I don't think I can run away from this feeling anymore.)

297
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:39,406
(All I know is)

298
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:46,366
(from this moment on,)

299
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,166
(my heartbeat)

300
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:55,686
(will never be the same.)

301
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:34,046
Are you sleepy? Are you hungry?

302
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,246
You're back, Young Master.

303
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:49,686
That kind of gaze...

304
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,966
- What does it mean?   - Gigi.

305
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:58,446
You look so adorable.

306
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:00,726
You're too excited about it.

307
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:02,726
You only talk with fish all day long.

308
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:07,086
Don't you talk with plants all day long too, Young Master?

309
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,486
Take good care of it.

310
00:26:10,877 --> 00:26:12,126
Don't be like me.

311
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:14,366
I can't take care of anyone.

312
00:26:21,926 --> 00:26:23,126
Gigi.

313
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,966
Our Young Master isn't normal.

314
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:28,526
It seems like he's crazy, Gigi.

315
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:29,806
Next.

316
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:33,086
Next.

317
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,886
Next.

318
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:45,486
Next.

319
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:47,846
What photos are you choosing?

320
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,966
Do you want to see it?

321
00:26:51,286 --> 00:26:53,046
If you have some time,

322
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,166
you can help me with it.

323
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:57,686
What photos?

324
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:04,766
The photo for my funeral.

325
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,646
What's the deal here?

326
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:12,806
I just attended my friend's funeral.

327
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:17,406
Her photo didn't look great at all.

328
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,766
I'm scared I might be like her.

329
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:22,726
Mueang will surely choose a bad photo of me,

330
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:27,206
so I'll choose it first. Since it'll be my last day, it has to be good.

331
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:33,686
But this photo isn't that good. Don't you have others?

332
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:36,966
Is this one alright?

333
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:42,046
That one.

334
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,606
When Wi isn't here anymore,

335
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:46,326
everyone will remember her with this beautiful face.

336
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:48,166
I think so.

337
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:53,566
Our life is short.

338
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:56,286
It hasn't been long,

339
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:59,126
but some of my friends are starting to leave this world.

340
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:01,406
This year,

341
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:03,806
I've already attended two of my friend's funerals.

342
00:28:04,326 --> 00:28:06,966
If today is the last day of my life,

343
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:08,686
what should I do?

344
00:28:53,086 --> 00:28:54,086
Hello?

345
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:56,486
I heard you want to buy Nudi's necklace.

346
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:58,046
How did you know?

347
00:28:58,198 --> 00:29:01,046
Pui told me you're trying to find a way to buy it.

348
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,046
Did something happen?

349
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:04,926
(Is your creativity gone?)

350
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,646
Can't you do your job?

351
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,446
I don't see how it's wrong.

352
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:14,126
Those things really help me come up with ideas.

353
00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:16,246
Do you still have that kind of habit?

354
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,166
Do you still have to find a nice thing

355
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:20,846
for you to have inspiration for your work?

356
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,486
(They're just collections.)

357
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:26,206
A professional wouldn't need to wait for the mood.

358
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:27,646
They can do it immediately.

359
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:31,366
(I won't say anything if you want to spend your money on collections.)

360
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,926
However, when he and I left everything in Thailand in your care,

361
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:39,326
it was because we believed in you.

362
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:44,806
(We let you rebrand and did everything you want,)

363
00:29:44,974 --> 00:29:48,246
but your Jiratcha isn't that well-known.

364
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,806
(People here only wear the products from Ms. Saisamon's child.)

365
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:54,166
(So,)

366
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,726
if you can't do it, I think you should tell me.

367
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:58,326
I'll send people to help.

368
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,006
I can do it, Mom.

369
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:02,646
(You'll be 30 years old soon.)

370
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:04,606
I don't want to say this,

371
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:07,478
but others from your generation have already surpassed you.

372
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:10,046
(Well, Ing.)

373
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:11,766
(We'll talk later.)

374
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:14,086
I'll hang up now. I miss you.

375
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:29,686
Okay.

376
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:45,646
No.

377
00:30:46,822 --> 00:30:48,446
It'll take me too long.

378
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:52,326
Okay.

379
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,046
Our store is closed.

380
00:30:59,462 --> 00:31:02,006
Are you free? I don't want to drink alone.

381
00:31:13,966 --> 00:31:15,246
Is that your new recipe?

382
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:18,846
It's empty.

383
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:21,326
I just got Botox. I can't drink alcohol,

384
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,606
but I want the atmosphere.

385
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:26,766
That's great.

386
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,966
Did something bad happen?

387
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:46,846
Why did you come to see me?

388
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:50,326
My friends are busy, so I randomly chose you.

389
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,526
You're lucky.

390
00:31:54,822 --> 00:31:57,926
If you were just a little late, I would have already gone home.

391
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,326
Don't you think

392
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:04,397
our generation is unfortunate?

393
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:07,766
Everyone always uploads nice photos of them on social media,

394
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:10,326
claiming that their lives are good

395
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:13,286
when there's actually nothing good at all.

396
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,366
Well...

397
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:20,406
Who would want to show their bad parts on social media?

398
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:22,366
Stop using it for once.

399
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,646
You'll be better.

400
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:27,566
For me, I think I'm already doing well enough

401
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:29,686
considering my age,

402
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:32,086
but there's still someone who's doing better.

403
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:34,246
I don't know

404
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:36,846
what is considered good enough.

405
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:41,566
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

406
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:45,486
What's wrong with being 30 years old anyway?

407
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:48,486
Everyone says it like we'll die when we're 30.

408
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:51,166
What's wrong with being 30?

409
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,646
Can't I live anymore or what?

410
00:32:52,926 --> 00:32:55,726
Will my life end there?

411
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:04,613
I'll watch the view on this side.

412
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:09,606
The wind is blowing this way.

413
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:12,446
You can go close down your store first.

414
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,526
I'll stay here.

415
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,686
Ing.

416
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,526
It's not like our lives will end at a certain age.

417
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:37,366
You can continue.

418
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:43,846
I don't know who's looking down on you,

419
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,926
but it's easier to say anything than to do anything.

420
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:50,766
Don't pay too much attention to those words.

421
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:53,526
Don't lose your confidence.

422
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:55,966
Believe in yourself

423
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,606
and go forward.

424
00:34:05,646 --> 00:34:07,006
Thank you.

425
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,246
Gigi...

426
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:11,926
Gigi...

427
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:16,206
Aum.

428
00:35:17,646 --> 00:35:18,835
What's wrong with you?

429
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,686
Gigi is dead, Young Master.

430
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,766
Dead?

431
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:31,326
How?

432
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,806
Please rest in peace,

433
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:51,286
Gigi.

434
00:35:57,528 --> 00:35:59,086
I'm sorry.

435
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:04,246
Sorry for being late. I had a hangover.

436
00:36:05,237 --> 00:36:06,806
Didn't you say you wouldn't drink alcohol?

437
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:08,726
You wouldn't drink with me.

438
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:11,006
Who did you drink with?

439
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,886
It was a special occasion. I couldn't refuse it.

440
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:19,566
How did it die? Didn't he just buy it?

441
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:27,526
Aum told me he found it dead when he woke up.

442
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:29,766
We still saw it last night.

443
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,206
Our lives are really uncertain.

444
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,806
- Tin.   - Yes?

445
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:38,886
If I die before you,

446
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:40,989
you must come to see me later.

447
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:44,646
When we die,

448
00:36:45,461 --> 00:36:46,926
do you think we'll still be together?

449
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,806
There.

450
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:50,526
I'll be in heaven.

451
00:36:51,637 --> 00:36:54,286
Do you think you're that good of a person?

452
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:57,566
When you die, let's see each other in hell.

453
00:36:57,686 --> 00:36:59,046
I'll be in heaven.

454
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:04,526
It's done.

455
00:37:04,914 --> 00:37:06,006
Now,

456
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:08,286
let's mourn

457
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:10,766
for Gigi,

458
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:12,597
as we were once friends living in the same world.

459
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:14,126
Yes.

460
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:29,006
Rest in peace, Gigi.

461
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:45,206
I'm sorry for your loss.

462
00:37:46,406 --> 00:37:48,006
Rest in peace, Gigi.

463
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:52,606
I want to do a video to mourn Gigi for one last time.

464
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:56,926
Could you help me, Young Master? Tin?

465
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:00,846
- Of course.   - Of course.

466
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:43,806
Thank you.

467
00:38:44,941 --> 00:38:46,549
I'm okay now.

468
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:16,126
You can smile like this too.

469
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:27,686
I don't want to smile because of you.

470
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,486
(Breach of contract)

471
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:31,286
(Phing)

472
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:39,326
- Hello?   - I have a nightmare about you two days in a row.

473
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:41,486
I don't feel so good.

474
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:46,526
Your mind might be connected to my mind.

475
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:49,246
Po.

476
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,646
If you really can't hold it anymore, just get out

477
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:54,446
before you don't have a chance.

478
00:41:01,397 --> 00:41:03,526
(Mr. Phudin)

479
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:25,246
Can you finally answer me about whether you'll choose me or Mueang?

480
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,486
Did you call me for that, Mr. Phudin?

481
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,246
Yes.

482
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:33,086
Just answer me. Don't be afraid.

483
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,646
I choose Mueang.

484
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,126
I like his idea more.

485
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:44,806
People usually think that capitalism and nature

486
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:46,486
must be separated.

487
00:41:46,614 --> 00:41:48,766
However, Mueang thinks that both of them

488
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:50,726
can stay together.

489
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:54,926
We can make money while we protect the environment.

490
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:59,646
You seem like you know him better than I thought.

491
00:42:00,078 --> 00:42:02,686
You've been taking his side more recently.

492
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:06,486
I'm not taking anyone's side.

493
00:42:06,606 --> 00:42:07,766
Is that so?

494
00:42:08,397 --> 00:42:11,606
I'd like to continue with Bo Phloi's project.

495
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:13,165
I want you to...

496
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:15,006
I'd like to not do that, please.

497
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,246
If you insist that I do this,

498
00:42:19,894 --> 00:42:22,726
I'll have to find another way to pay off my debt.

499
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,166
Are you asking me to change the deal?

500
00:42:26,096 --> 00:42:28,046
Is it possible?

501
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:29,766
Why?

502
00:42:30,254 --> 00:42:32,046
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

503
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:42,046
I don't want to steal Mueang's smile away.

504
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:46,126
He deserves happiness,

505
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:48,326
not suffering like this.

506
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:11,966
(Po)

507
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,606
- (Phing.)   - What's the matter?

508
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:19,646
I'm going back to Bangkok.

509
00:43:19,773 --> 00:43:21,766
Huh? Is that true?

510
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:24,046
Did you talk to Mr. Phudin?

511
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,806
I'll tell you all about it later.

512
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:29,166
See you.

513
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:39,166
I think we should hire an influencer to come here

514
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:41,247
so that people will follow them.

515
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:44,286
Wait, Sita.

516
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,766
Have you written down the note about my ash scattering ceremony?

517
00:43:47,478 --> 00:43:48,766
What?

518
00:43:49,165 --> 00:43:52,686
I told you that when I die,

519
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:55,939
don't scatter my ash at Sattahip

520
00:43:56,061 --> 00:43:57,486
because my dead enemy's ash

521
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,585
is there at Sattahip as well.

522
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:01,427
If we're together,

523
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:04,806
we might turn into ghosts, killing each other again.

524
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:07,486
Where do you want it scattered?

525
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,246
I'm not sure.

526
00:44:09,886 --> 00:44:14,046
If I die before Din...

527
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:17,206
Please scatter mine with Din's ash.

528
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:19,766
Cool.

529
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:00,446
I'm going to the Gems Market today.

530
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:03,646
The old man told me to take you there as well.

531
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:04,966
So...

532
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,406
I'm telling you.

533
00:45:10,253 --> 00:45:11,526
If you're not going,

534
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,526
I'll get going.

535
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:15,886
Wait.

536
00:45:20,374 --> 00:45:21,606
I'll go with you.

537
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:46,486
You can cross it.

538
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:49,526
Please wait a second. Sorry.

539
00:45:58,238 --> 00:46:00,446
Please tell me about Mueang's mom.

540
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,206
You should ask him yourself.

541
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:06,726
There's no way he'll tell. Please tell me.

542
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:18,046
Well, she asked Boss to see her friends in Bangkok first

543
00:46:19,366 --> 00:46:21,366
before she'd come back to divorce.

544
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:24,086
She didn't get to come back

545
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,406
because on the day she was going to come back,

546
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:30,046
she stopped to buy snacks for Young Master.

547
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,766
She passed away

548
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:35,406
after she was hit by a motorcycle when she was crossing the road.

549
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:38,686
Do you know how to drive?

550
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:40,766
Yes.

551
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,286
When you're at a crosswalk, you have to stop, you know?

552
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:46,726
Of course.

553
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:48,766
I always stop.

554
00:46:49,582 --> 00:46:52,366
Well, I don't have a chance to drive that much. I don't have a car.

555
00:47:05,006 --> 00:47:06,726
Can I tell you something?

556
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,726
What?

557
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:13,732
My parents

558
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,046
died when they drove their car into the water.

559
00:47:19,094 --> 00:47:21,966
It was just a normal day for them.

560
00:47:22,828 --> 00:47:24,726
There was nothing strange.

561
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:30,966
We'll never know when our loved ones will be gone.

562
00:47:32,246 --> 00:47:36,086
If you have a chance, please talk to Mr. Phudin.

563
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:39,053
Please don't regret it later, like I did.

564
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:42,621
I'm telling you this

565
00:47:43,047 --> 00:47:45,846
because I might not have a chance to tell you this anymore.

566
00:47:51,654 --> 00:47:55,766
I found a witness who can confirm the relationship between Mueang and Apo.

567
00:47:55,886 --> 00:47:58,326
They can talk to you at noon.

568
00:47:59,165 --> 00:48:00,366
Okay.

569
00:48:30,286 --> 00:48:33,166
Thank you for taking me to the Gems Market.

570
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:35,166
I got to learn a lot of stuff.

571
00:48:36,686 --> 00:48:37,766
You're welcome.

572
00:48:38,758 --> 00:48:42,366
If you want something, go get it so that we can go back to the office.

573
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,526
I don't think I'm going back to the office.

574
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:49,766
Why? Are you skipping work?

575
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:53,686
My work is all done.

576
00:48:57,654 --> 00:48:58,726
Mueang,

577
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:00,989
I'd like to ask you again.

578
00:49:01,494 --> 00:49:03,086
I'm serious.

579
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:07,646
If you want to do or say something,

580
00:49:08,005 --> 00:49:09,326
please do it soon.

581
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:12,766
Don't wait until he's gone to realize

582
00:49:13,406 --> 00:49:15,126
that you want to apologize to him,

583
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,886
that you want to thank him,

584
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:20,886
or that you want to say you love him.

585
00:49:23,582 --> 00:49:25,806
It might already be too late.

586
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:33,606
I'm leaving.

587
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,366
From now on,

588
00:50:47,303 --> 00:50:49,726
please smile a lot, Mueang.

589
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:11,286
I just want to take care of my children first.

590
00:51:11,414 --> 00:51:13,686
I'll go to the office after I'm done. Yeah.

591
00:51:16,758 --> 00:51:17,966
Mueang.

592
00:51:18,198 --> 00:51:19,766
How could you do this?

593
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:23,326
I just talked with Sita.

594
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:24,686
Sita told me

595
00:51:24,775 --> 00:51:28,086
you wouldn't care if Phudin Park closed down.

596
00:51:29,149 --> 00:51:30,526
What's wrong with that?

597
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,246
It's not related to me.

598
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:34,254
How is it not related to you?

599
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:38,606
Don't you remember why your dad founded Phudin Park?

600
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:41,046
How would I know?

601
00:51:41,229 --> 00:51:43,606
This kind of business might have been popular back then.

602
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:47,326
No. He founded it because of you.

603
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,566
Don't you remember it at all?

604
00:51:49,942 --> 00:51:52,326
Think. Think about it carefully.

605
00:51:53,574 --> 00:51:55,574
Within a small piece of your memory,

606
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:57,566
is there nothing left at all?

607
00:52:12,206 --> 00:52:15,926
Dad, I want those kinds of attractions. I want

608
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,886
to have a big zoo.

609
00:52:17,986 --> 00:52:19,286
Sure, Mueang.

610
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:21,326
I'll find everything for you.

611
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:23,206
Do you promise, Dad?

612
00:52:24,461 --> 00:52:26,126
I promise.

613
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,046
Do you remember it now?

614
00:52:37,981 --> 00:52:39,206
I know

615
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:43,006
that you don't want to remember your childhood as it's full of pain,

616
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:45,806
but your dad is in as much pain as you.

617
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,805
You might forget about everything,

618
00:52:48,886 --> 00:52:51,126
but your dad still remembers everything.

619
00:52:51,757 --> 00:52:52,966
If you want to say

620
00:52:53,278 --> 00:52:55,846
your dad has never done anything for you, I'll challenge you on that.

621
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,686
Your dad has done everything for you.

622
00:53:07,214 --> 00:53:08,366
You can talk to them now.

623
00:53:11,908 --> 00:53:12,908
Hello?

624
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:16,782
Thank you for helping me with this.

625
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:19,846
You can send your account details to my secretary.

626
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,566
Before that,

627
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:26,222
please tell me everything you've seen from start to finish.

628
00:53:38,869 --> 00:53:40,290
Where is Mueang?

629
00:53:40,371 --> 00:53:43,246
If he's not at the office, he's probably at his house.

630
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,286
(I just realized I forgot a lot of things.)

631
00:54:19,782 --> 00:54:21,966
(I forgot to pay attention to others.)

632
00:54:22,822 --> 00:54:25,126
(I just get to see the old man's face often recently,)

633
00:54:25,406 --> 00:54:26,886
(and I saw that...)

634
00:54:31,917 --> 00:54:34,117
(Since when did he have this much white hair?)

635
00:54:35,846 --> 00:54:37,326
(Why haven't I noticed it?)

636
00:54:43,878 --> 00:54:45,878
(His hands are wrinkled.)

637
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,686
(He has a lot of sickness.)

638
00:54:55,998 --> 00:54:58,766
(I don't know how long I'll get to stay with him.)

639
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:05,006
(Our time)

640
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:07,086
(is ticking away,)

641
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:09,726
(but I still want to...)

642
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:20,806
Happy birthday, old man.

643
00:55:21,468 --> 00:55:22,806
I wish you a lot of happiness.

644
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:25,166
(I still want to be happy with him.)

645
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:33,166
(I want to be happy with my loved ones)

646
00:56:16,398 --> 00:56:17,686
(once again.)

647
00:56:21,982 --> 00:56:24,526
Scene one, cut one, take one.

648
00:56:24,886 --> 00:56:25,966
Action.

649
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:27,486
If we talk about death,

650
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:28,966
what would you think of first?

651
00:56:29,206 --> 00:56:30,766
Death is natural.

652
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:32,926
It'll happen to everyone.

653
00:56:33,086 --> 00:56:34,846
When I think about death,

654
00:56:35,102 --> 00:56:37,102
the only thing I can think of

655
00:56:37,341 --> 00:56:38,766
is a hot Grim Reaper.

656
00:56:38,886 --> 00:56:41,366
Aum, I can't think of anything. For someone around my age,

657
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:43,286
who would think of death?

658
00:56:45,029 --> 00:56:47,086
Poe, you can answer first.

659
00:56:51,143 --> 00:56:53,446
Poe, why are you crying?

660
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:57,446
When I think that I have to be apart from you,

661
00:56:57,621 --> 00:56:59,686
it doesn't feel good at all.

662
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:04,279
Ging, don't die.

663
00:57:04,382 --> 00:57:05,686
I won't die.

664
00:57:06,942 --> 00:57:09,966
For me, death is emptiness.

665
00:57:10,262 --> 00:57:11,646
There's nothing left.

666
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:14,646
I don't believe in the afterlife.

667
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,926
I'm not sure if the afterlife exists.

668
00:57:18,221 --> 00:57:21,046
Talking about death,

669
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,726
I probably think of my own funeral.

670
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:28,486
There'd be only Phing who'd cry at the funeral.

671
00:57:28,806 --> 00:57:31,846
She'd probably talk to my photo like,

672
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:33,246
"I miss you,"

673
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,606
"but don't come to me."

674
00:57:34,709 --> 00:57:37,166
Do you know why? Phing is really scared of ghosts.

675
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,446
Honestly,

676
00:57:40,494 --> 00:57:42,766
I'd think of people who would still be living.

677
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:45,206
What do you mean?

678
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:50,206
Like, how would they live without us?

679
00:57:52,398 --> 00:57:53,606
That too.

680
00:57:53,918 --> 00:57:56,206
I'd think of other sides as well, such as...

681
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:01,646
"Would they miss me?"

682
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:06,286
When I'm gone from this world,

683
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,126
would they forget about me?

684
00:58:13,166 --> 00:58:14,886
When I pass away,

685
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:19,286
have I left anything memorable

686
00:58:23,364 --> 00:58:24,806
in this world?

687
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:26,846
If I die,

688
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:29,926
don't forget to think about me.

689
00:59:17,663 --> 00:59:19,126
Have you seen the owner of this car?

690
00:59:20,877 --> 00:59:22,454
Have you seen him?

691
00:59:22,535 --> 00:59:24,334
There's someone injured over there.

692
01:00:32,737 --> 01:00:33,886
Mueang.

693
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:37,166
I'm here.

694
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:13,765
Dad.

695
01:01:18,566 --> 01:01:20,046
You called me "Dad?"

696
01:01:25,493 --> 01:01:26,853
I'm here.

697
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,006
I'm fine.

698
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:26,446
I was really lucky

699
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,685
to get out of the car to buy some lotteries

700
01:02:28,766 --> 01:02:30,566
before a pickup truck crashed into the car.

701
01:02:31,669 --> 01:02:33,366
Lotteries do save lives.

702
01:02:35,392 --> 01:02:37,686
Thank you for worrying about me.

703
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:39,806
It's nothing.

704
01:02:40,063 --> 01:02:42,063
I just did what I was supposed to do.

705
01:02:42,304 --> 01:02:43,406
Really?

706
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,566
You were hugging me tightly back then.

707
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:49,006
No.

708
01:02:49,317 --> 01:02:51,846
You were the one who was hugging me tightly.

709
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:53,886
Hey.

710
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:57,166
You don't have to be scared that something might happen to me.

711
01:02:57,566 --> 01:02:59,006
I have a lot of karma.

712
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,966
You still have a lot of chances to call me "Dad."

713
01:03:03,286 --> 01:03:04,726
Who would call you Dad?

714
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,126
Dream on.

715
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:09,046
I'll call you old man. Who would easily change it?

716
01:03:10,493 --> 01:03:12,446
You're really acting tough.

717
01:03:15,686 --> 01:03:17,126
I'm not used to it.

718
01:03:17,757 --> 01:03:18,841
Mueang.

719
01:03:18,926 --> 01:03:20,566
I have something to tell you.

720
01:03:23,629 --> 01:03:24,886
Me too.

721
01:03:25,126 --> 01:03:26,126
But...

722
01:03:27,005 --> 01:03:28,326
You can go first.

723
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,566
It's about me and Apo.

724
01:03:30,759 --> 01:03:32,686
You probably know it by now.

725
01:03:38,574 --> 01:03:40,926
I'm not really going to marry Apo.

726
01:03:46,721 --> 01:03:48,166
Did you change your mind?

727
01:03:48,677 --> 01:03:51,126
I'll gladly do anything

728
01:03:51,414 --> 01:03:53,846
that you want me to do, except marriage.

729
01:03:54,222 --> 01:03:57,046
What if it's a sham marriage?

730
01:03:57,909 --> 01:03:59,286
What do you mean?

731
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:00,966
It means

732
01:04:01,445 --> 01:04:04,966
if you actually had listened to me in the first place,

733
01:04:05,086 --> 01:04:07,366
you wouldn't have to cry like this.

734
01:04:08,086 --> 01:04:10,646
Are you ready to listen to my real proposal?

735
01:04:11,294 --> 01:04:13,294
My proposal is

736
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:16,166
you and I will only have a fake marriage.

737
01:04:17,046 --> 01:04:19,086
We don't have to have any relationship

738
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:22,206
like a real husband and wife.

739
01:04:24,086 --> 01:04:26,046
Why do you have to do that?

740
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,926
To make my son inherit my business.

741
01:04:31,157 --> 01:04:34,406
I want my son to continue my business,

742
01:04:35,286 --> 01:04:38,046
but he's playing hard to get. He doesn't want to do it.

743
01:04:38,773 --> 01:04:42,126
However, if I bring an outsider like you to it,

744
01:04:42,324 --> 01:04:44,566
my son will never stay still.

745
01:04:44,734 --> 01:04:48,566
He'll surely have to protect what he thinks is his.

746
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,926
So,

747
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:51,486
the condition is

748
01:04:51,756 --> 01:04:53,566
you can do anything

749
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,286
to make my son

750
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:58,966
fully work in my company within four months.

751
01:04:59,446 --> 01:05:00,606
If you can do that,

752
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:02,686
I'll clear all of your debt.

753
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:05,046
If you can't do it,

754
01:05:05,286 --> 01:05:07,046
I'll clear half of your debt.

755
01:05:12,869 --> 01:05:16,206
As for the details, you can read this.

756
01:05:27,406 --> 01:05:28,526
How is it?

757
01:05:28,742 --> 01:05:30,006
Are you interested?

758
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:35,086
Why do you think I can do it, Mr. Phudin?

759
01:05:35,813 --> 01:05:37,886
The fact that I chose Apo for this

760
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,486
isn't because she's my debtor.

761
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:43,022
I saw that this woman

762
01:05:43,246 --> 01:05:46,846
is sincere and strong enough to handle you.

763
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:50,126
And she actually did it.

764
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:52,006
If you want to annoy me,

765
01:05:52,254 --> 01:05:54,406
please don't use a child's trick like this.

766
01:05:54,886 --> 01:05:56,926
We should compete using our talents.

767
01:05:57,478 --> 01:05:59,126
Are you challenging me?

768
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:00,766
That depends on you.

769
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,686
If you think you're better than me,

770
01:06:03,879 --> 01:06:05,006
show it then.

771
01:06:05,229 --> 01:06:07,229
Show it to me. Show it to your dad.

772
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,806
Show it to everyone.

773
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,406
Was that a plan too?

774
01:06:10,573 --> 01:06:11,686
Yes.

775
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,926
That's the plan that Apo offered.

776
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:18,286
But as for your mom's necklace...

777
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:20,646
It was my plan.

778
01:06:22,731 --> 01:06:24,846
This necklace is important to me.

779
01:06:25,757 --> 01:06:27,006
Now,

780
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,406
it's time

781
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:30,446
for me to pass it on to a suitable person.

782
01:06:30,661 --> 01:06:33,246
(When I gave your mom's necklace to Apo,)

783
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:35,806
(I intentionally wanted to make you angry,)

784
01:06:36,206 --> 01:06:38,526
(so that it'd push you)

785
01:06:38,925 --> 01:06:40,909
(to come back to take care of my business.)

786
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:43,446
But...

787
01:06:44,094 --> 01:06:45,926
It was probably too much.

788
01:06:46,526 --> 01:06:49,006
Apo also disagreed with that plan

789
01:06:50,038 --> 01:06:52,046
because she has a lot of goodwill for you.

790
01:06:52,478 --> 01:06:54,206
She really means well.

791
01:06:56,062 --> 01:06:58,526
I'm here to tell you the truth today

792
01:07:00,126 --> 01:07:01,606
because I know

793
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:04,406
that you and Apo have known each other before.

794
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:07,966
You went to the beach with Apo.

795
01:07:08,126 --> 01:07:09,526
There's a witness

796
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,966
who saw how close you two were.

797
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:13,806
Can you tell me

798
01:07:14,502 --> 01:07:16,246
what your relationship is with Apo?

799
01:07:21,261 --> 01:07:22,606
I was in a hurry to see you

800
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:25,406
because I wanted to talk about this.

801
01:07:28,022 --> 01:07:29,406
Since it's come to this,

802
01:07:29,661 --> 01:07:32,366
I want to be honest. I don't want to hide anything anymore.

803
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:35,926
Yes.

804
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,046
I met Apo

805
01:07:38,293 --> 01:07:39,646
when I went to the beach.

806
01:07:40,509 --> 01:07:41,606
But...

807
01:07:42,157 --> 01:07:44,446
We didn't really know each other back then.

808
01:07:45,092 --> 01:07:46,246
And

809
01:07:47,406 --> 01:07:48,406
I like her.

810
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:04,246
I used to think

811
01:08:04,397 --> 01:08:06,566
that we shouldn't have met at the beach,

812
01:08:06,702 --> 01:08:08,046
but right now,

813
01:08:08,246 --> 01:08:10,566
I'm still glad that it happened.

814
01:08:10,726 --> 01:08:13,006
It's already good enough that he doesn't hate me.

815
01:08:14,973 --> 01:08:16,406
There's no way he'll like me.

816
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:19,006
Mueang, why haven't you done anything yet?

817
01:08:19,109 --> 01:08:20,726
I've been thinking hard.

818
01:08:21,046 --> 01:08:23,806
It might be too late if you want Apo to stay.

819
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:27,046
I know you're leaving, but I can't let you leave yet.

820
01:08:28,086 --> 01:08:29,206
What's wrong?

821
01:08:29,566 --> 01:08:31,046
Even if you're View

822
01:08:31,766 --> 01:08:33,166
or Apo,

823
01:08:33,566 --> 01:08:34,846
I like both of them.

824
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:38,806
Can I ask you something?

825
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:40,710
So...

826
01:08:41,272 --> 01:08:42,846
Are we a couple now?
