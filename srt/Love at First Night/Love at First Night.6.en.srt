1
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:03,100
- I ran into someone I knew in the park.   - Who was it?

2
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,366
My old enemy.

3
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,086
You said it was your life choice. Why would you be embarrassed?

4
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:11,366
The one who should be embarrassed is your ex.

5
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:15,566
Although you don't like me, you still feel bad for me.

6
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,406
You're really kind.

7
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:20,326
You have to stop being kind to Apo!

8
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:23,246
Have you seen my MP3 player? It looks like this.

9
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:27,126
- Why would I see it?   - Tomorrow, we have an important mission.

10
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:29,846
Did someone do something to annoy you today, Young Master?

11
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:33,526
Are they crazy? Are they having a huge event in this economy?

12
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:36,126
Let's give a round of applause for Apo's fresh start.

13
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:40,326
- Yay.   - A fresh start.

14
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,806
- A fresh start.   - A fresh start.

15
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:47,246
- A fresh start.   - A fresh start.

16
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:52,566
- A fresh start.   - A fresh start.

17
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:55,926
- A fresh start.   - A fresh start.

18
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:58,206
- I'm not going.   - Okay.

19
00:02:58,326 --> 00:02:59,726
I understand.

20
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,824
- I'm going.   - Sure.

21
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,446
There are things that have sentimental value.

22
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,526
A new one isn't the same.

23
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,166
Aum.

24
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:28,246
Give me a ladder.

25
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:51,446
Yes!

26
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:40,373
Aum, go buy something for me.

27
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,406
I'm here.

28
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,246
Is it really important?

29
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:48,526
Fine. I won't ask.

30
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:23,726
This is your first present.

31
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:26,926
There's still more?

32
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:44,702
No way...

33
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:53,246
This necklace is important to me.

34
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,126
Now,

35
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:56,406
it's time

36
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:58,686
for me to pass it on to a suitable person.

37
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,486
Come here.

38
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:08,941
I'll put it on for you.

39
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,374
- Son.   - Yes.

40
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,126
Turn around.

41
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:06,006
Give it back to Apo.

42
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,326
No, I won't.

43
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:14,246
What's with you? I only want to give a present to Apo.

44
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:15,651
Give her something else.

45
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:17,011
There are other necklaces.

46
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:19,006
If you really want to be extravagant,

47
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:21,366
you can go put an advertisement on a sky train.

48
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,046
I want to give that necklace to her.

49
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,046
Did you fall for her so hard that your mind is broken?

50
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:31,686
My mind is still fine.

51
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:33,846
Who in the right mind would do this?

52
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,126
Before this,

53
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:39,926
I might not mind it.

54
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:41,286
But for this matter,

55
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:43,326
I can't allow it.

56
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:48,046
Fine.

57
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:49,832
Aum, Son.

58
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:50,913
- Yes.   - Yes.

59
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:52,206
Hold Mueang in place.

60
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:54,590
- Well...   - I...

61
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,926
If you don't do it, you'll get fired. Do it!

62
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,181
- I'm sorry, Young Master.   - Hey!

63
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:03,966
- I'm sorry.   - Let me go!

64
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:07,806
- Let me go!   - Young Master, calm down.

65
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:11,366
- Let me go!   - Young Master, calm down.

66
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:12,757
Come here.

67
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:15,446
Young Master.

68
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:16,846
Let it go!

69
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:30,086
- Come here, Apo.   - No.

70
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,115
Mr. Phudin, I don't think this is...

71
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:35,366
When I give you something, you'll have it forever.

72
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:38,966
Turn your back around.

73
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:42,206
Quick.

74
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,646
- Young Master, please don't.   - Young Master, calm down.

75
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,046
Take it off.

76
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,366
Don't listen to him.

77
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,046
I told you to take it off.

78
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,166
No, don't take it off.

79
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:17,686
Get out!

80
00:11:18,814 --> 00:11:22,246
Get out of this place right now. Don't embarrass me again.

81
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:23,566
Get out!

82
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,326
Embarrassed?

83
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,446
I should be embarrassed.

84
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,366
Everyone here knows who this necklace belonged to!

85
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:41,518
This necklace is mine! I can give it to whomever I want!

86
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,126
So...

87
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:48,086
You want to give it to her no matter what?

88
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:49,286
Yes.

89
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:51,406
Apo is the woman I love,

90
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:54,526
and she deserves this necklace.

91
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,326
Do you even know how to love anyone?

92
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:14,726
I don't believe you.

93
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,166
Someone like you can't love anyone

94
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:20,806
because you

95
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:22,966
are heartless!

96
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,006
Get out!

97
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:32,846
I told you to get out!

98
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:38,006
Hey, you're here?

99
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:43,366
Oh, wow.

100
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:44,886
I think he's really upset.

101
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,446
"I think he's really upset."

102
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:52,086
I'm sorry that I've shown you a fight between a dad and a son.

103
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:57,646
Was that man your son, Mr. Phudin?

104
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:01,326
Yes, he's my son. His name is Mueang.

105
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:05,646
I haven't seen that necklace in a long time.

106
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:08,646
- The last time I...   - I've kept it for over ten years.

107
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:12,406
I'm glad that I got to see it again.

108
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,766
You'd probably see it often soon

109
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,854
when Apo wears it for her event.

110
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:21,126
But I think Apo doesn't match the red color.

111
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:22,486
It doesn't match her skin.

112
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:23,618
Really?

113
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:27,766
I think it matches her. She looks nice when she wears it.

114
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,646
Well, we can have different opinions.

115
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:37,606
I'm sorry again. The party is probably over now.

116
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:39,406
Thank you for coming.

117
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:41,926
Thank you for inviting me.

118
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:43,526
You're welcome.

119
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:44,886
Goodbye.

120
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:55,104
(Was that man your son, Mr. Phudin?)

121
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,566
(Yes, he's my son.)

122
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,366
Ing.

123
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:00,926
What's up?

124
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:03,093
Mr. Phudin's son

125
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,957
was the man that I almost got into trouble with.

126
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:10,406
But that's not my fault. He asked for it first.

127
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:11,806
I haven't said anything yet.

128
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,326
Do you know him, Ing?

129
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:18,206
Mueang?

130
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,286
I saw him when I was a child.

131
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:24,406
Around twice or thrice. He was a troubled child.

132
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,806
When he grows up, he's still a troubled adult.

133
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:32,366
What should we do now?

134
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,326
There's Apo's matter. We still haven't talked to her.

135
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:39,326
I think the atmosphere isn't good now.

136
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:41,846
We should hold it. I also have a migraine.

137
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:44,336
Go wait in the car. I'm going to the toilet.

138
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:46,246
Yes.

139
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:04,445
I'm so unfortunate.

140
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:07,206
It's getting harder when it's already hard in the first place.

141
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:09,292
That Game...

142
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,966
Who invited her here?

143
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,246
You...

144
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,406
Do you remember me now?

145
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,566
How did you get here?

146
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:27,846
Did you follow me?

147
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,846
Follow you? You?

148
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:32,046
A vampire?

149
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,733
You can't accuse me like that. It's illegal.

150
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:38,486
We've seen each other three times in a row.

151
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:40,406
It can't be a coincidence.

152
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:42,086
Don't tell me

153
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:46,126
you're a fan of mine!

154
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:51,966
How could you say that? Do you think you're an idol?

155
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:56,286
Oh my god.

156
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,126
I thought this only existed in dramas.

157
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:02,846
You intentionally bumped into me at a parking lot to make me remember you.

158
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,086
You followed me to Phudin Park yesterday.

159
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,326
You followed me to the party today.

160
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:11,726
I can't believe that this really happens in real life.

161
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:16,126
But let me clear up something.

162
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:18,446
I admire your determination,

163
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:22,006
but you're not my type. I like tough guys, not a cute guy like you.

164
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,646
More importantly, I don't date a man who has a different status.

165
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,006
Are you done?

166
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,926
I asked if you were done so that I could say my piece.

167
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,373
Good. It's time for me to say something.

168
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:38,766
First, I think you should start watching logical and serious dramas

169
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:40,486
so that you can improve your logical sense.

170
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:44,317
You probably watched dramas so much that you forgot about reality.

171
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,325
If there's a stranger following you, you should call the police,

172
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:49,190
not bask in your own imagination.

173
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:53,173
I might have wanted to rob you when I was following you.

174
00:17:53,254 --> 00:17:55,606
- You...   - Second, take a look around yourself.

175
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,206
Look at this place carefully.

176
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:00,247
This party is a closed party. I have to be invited to come here.

177
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:04,204
- Look at my costume. Is it in theme with the party?   - Yes.

178
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:07,486
Third, I'm not your fan. I'm only a fan of Blackpink Lisa.

179
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:11,686
I'll also say that I don't like selfish people like you.

180
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,166
You like to take advantage of others. You're self-centered.

181
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:17,846
If there were only two of us left in this world, I'd rather commit suicide.

182
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:19,726
Okay? Understand?

183
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:21,988
Was that a rap to curse me?

184
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:24,206
I forgot one thing. Let me say it again.

185
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,448
I don't mind that you trampled on my plants anymore.

186
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:28,046
But please don't do this to anyone else.

187
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:30,246
They might not be as kind as me.

188
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:32,166
Okay?

189
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:35,366
I warned you because I still have goodwill for you.

190
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:36,926
I'm leaving.

191
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:46,726
This is the first time I couldn't argue with someone in time.

192
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,566
Who's that man?

193
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:04,486
This necklace must mean a lot to Mueang, right?

194
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,526
It was Mueang's mom's necklace.

195
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,566
Why did you give me that?

196
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,126
I have my own reason.

197
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,126
I can't accept it.

198
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,726
You have to accept it.

199
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:27,566
Don't make me force you.

200
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:30,166
I don't want Mueang to misunderstand

201
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:32,606
that I'm here to take away his mom's things.

202
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,006
You aren't a thief.

203
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:36,886
Let me ask you this.

204
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:39,566
How could you be a thief when I gave it to you?

205
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,086
You might want to give it to me,

206
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,510
but Mueang doesn't want to give it to me.

207
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:51,326
If I say I want you to take care of it, does that make you feel better?

208
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:53,766
Listen,

209
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:57,006
I appreciate that you care about Mueang's feelings.

210
00:19:57,886 --> 00:20:01,566
But don't forget you have to keep your promise.

211
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:03,886
Do as I say.

212
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:05,846
There won't be any problem.

213
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:12,806
Darn it.

214
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:14,406
It's getting worse every day.

215
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:17,526
There's only been trouble since Din took that woman here.

216
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:19,326
I don't understand

217
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:20,869
what Din had been thinking

218
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,966
to be able to give Nudi's necklace to Apo.

219
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:27,206
That necklace should be passed down to family members.

220
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:28,726
Yes.

221
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:32,126
Ms. Nudi was going to give that necklace to Mueang.

222
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,246
I can still remember it clearly.

223
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:35,806
Ms. Nudi told me that

224
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:38,246
when Mueang finally found his true love,

225
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:40,246
he should give it to her.

226
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,166
Just like when Mr. Phudin gave it to Ms. Nudi.

227
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,046
And look at that. It's become someone else's property now.

228
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:52,606
No matter how much Din liked that woman,

229
00:20:52,726 --> 00:20:54,926
he should have thought about our feelings.

230
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:56,646
I agree with that.

231
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,006
Mr. Phudin should have thought more about other people's feelings.

232
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:02,158
- Yes.   - Especially,

233
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:04,686
- the feelings of his son...   - Yes...

234
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:09,006
The one who we should worry about the most

235
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,526
is Mueang.

236
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:13,126
Mueang must be pretty sad right now.

237
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,069
I'm also sad about this, Din.

238
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,606
Hey.

239
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:33,246
I'm right here.

240
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:35,446
You can call me.

241
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:10,806
Get out!

242
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:13,406
Get out of this place right now.

243
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:15,036
Don't embarrass me again.

244
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:16,566
Get out!

245
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:48,486
Everyone here knows who this necklace belonged to!

246
00:22:48,582 --> 00:22:51,566
This necklace is mine! I can give it to whomever I want!

247
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:05,126
I'm going to work in Bangkok for a few days.

248
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:07,526
Please come back soon, Mom.

249
00:23:07,646 --> 00:23:08,806
I'll miss you.

250
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:52,166
Take it off.

251
00:24:52,286 --> 00:24:53,726
Don't listen to him.

252
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,006
Show it to him.

253
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:37,846
Show that your life is far better than when you were with him.

254
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:43,046
Although my dad isn't as nice and handsome as me,

255
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,086
I'm confident that my dad's richer than him.

256
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,886
Just dump him.

257
00:25:52,693 --> 00:25:56,086
(Mueang, you're more generous than I thought.)

258
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:31,526
Thanks.

259
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:36,566
Why aren't you drinking it?

260
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:38,486
Are you afraid you'll be poisoned?

261
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:42,646
Sita,

262
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:44,846
if you're upset at me about the necklace...

263
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:46,486
I'm not upset.

264
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:49,286
I just think there must be more to it than that.

265
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,086
I only gave a present to my soon-to-be wife.

266
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,166
There must be something.

267
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:58,406
I think you've been paranoid recently.

268
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:00,646
No matter how much you like Ms. Apo,

269
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:03,646
you'd never give that necklace to her.

270
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:06,246
How would you know?

271
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:08,646
It's not like you're living in my heart.

272
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:12,206
If you're not telling me,

273
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:13,886
I'll find the answer myself.

274
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:17,926
Fine. You can do whatever you want.

275
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:20,726
But I'll tell you that it's a waste of time.

276
00:27:22,366 --> 00:27:24,166
It won't be a waste of time.

277
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:29,286
I'm sure everything is connected to the reason you brought Ms. Apo here.

278
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,286
Po.

279
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:16,686
Run away with me.

280
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:19,366
Seriously.

281
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,846
Why do you have to worry about other people's problems?

282
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:26,766
It's not like it's other people's problem.

283
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:28,766
These are my problems as well.

284
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:33,526
Are you acting like an angel, my friend?

285
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:38,046
Po, do you realize you'll be 30 years old in a few years?

286
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:41,486
You should get to live your life during your last remaining youth

287
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:42,726
for yourself.

288
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,006
You shouldn't have been troubled because of others.

289
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:47,046
I just feel bad.

290
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:50,966
I told Mueang that I wouldn't touch his mom's treasure,

291
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:53,166
but I got her necklace.

292
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:55,966
Mr. Phudin gave it to you. What could you do?

293
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,726
Do you think I don't have to apologize to Mueang?

294
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:01,486
Yes. You have done nothing wrong.

295
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:02,766
But...

296
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:05,406
You have done nothing wrong. Don't argue with me.

297
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:08,046
But I feel like it's my fault.

298
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:10,966
Listen, come here.

299
00:29:11,197 --> 00:29:12,726
Turn your face to me.

300
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:15,646
You have to stop worrying about everything.

301
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:19,366
You can't try to please everyone in the world.

302
00:29:20,686 --> 00:29:22,046
I'll put a curse on you.

303
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:25,404
If you get out of this room again,

304
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:27,846
I hope you'll have a headache, stomachache,

305
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:31,246
stressed mind, and constipation for three days.

306
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:36,366
That's an extremely small nod.

307
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:38,246
My curse is strong, you know?

308
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,926
It's never failed before.

309
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,646
I'm going to chant my curse.

310
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:48,766
What? I've finished chanting my curse. Right now,

311
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:51,486
if you don't do as I said, you'll get cursed.

312
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,566
Why are you sighing?

313
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:57,886
I think everyone in this house is just unpleasant.

314
00:29:57,998 --> 00:30:01,206
If you can, you should get out of here as soon as possible.

315
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:07,806
Are you ready?

316
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:10,886
Did you take me to the front of his house?

317
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:13,646
You're not scared of my curse at all, huh?

318
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:16,166
Thank you for accompanying me.

319
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:18,748
Don't sulk.

320
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:20,766
I'm not sulking. I'm mad.

321
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:23,586
You should listen to what your friend says.

322
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,966
You can't even take care of yourself. How could you take care of others?

323
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:29,726
Be careful.

324
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:33,566
You might die because of your own sympathy one day.

325
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:36,766
Get on.

326
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,566
What's the password? If you don't know, I won't let you in.

327
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,646
You...

328
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:04,365
(My prince...)

329
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:10,046
(My angel...)

330
00:31:27,806 --> 00:31:29,866
(Why do I feel like something is going on?)

331
00:31:33,062 --> 00:31:34,126
Po,

332
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:37,486
you can go handle your business. Leave this to me.

333
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:39,686
- Aren't you mad anymore?   - No.

334
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:44,046
Ms. Stepmother, you can come in.

335
00:31:44,678 --> 00:31:46,086
Is it that easy?

336
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:47,646
Yes.

337
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:50,566
Then, I'm going.

338
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,126
- You should go.   - You should go.

339
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:05,166
Hello, I'm Phing.

340
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:23,126
Mueang.

341
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,766
Are you here?

342
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:31,726
Mueang.

343
00:32:32,526 --> 00:32:34,206
Can I talk to you?

344
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:51,286
Can I go inside?

345
00:33:01,238 --> 00:33:02,566
He's not here.

346
00:33:04,643 --> 00:33:06,006
Where is he?

347
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:34,006
Mueang.

348
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:39,126
Excuse me.

349
00:33:39,604 --> 00:33:42,006
- Is Mueang here?   - He's not here today.

350
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,406
Where is he?

351
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,526
Mueang.

352
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,246
I finally found you.

353
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,206
I don't want to see you.

354
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:37,834
I want to talk about yesterday.

355
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,086
I don't want to.

356
00:34:39,486 --> 00:34:40,686
Wait, Mueang.

357
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:42,446
What do I have to do to make you feel better?

358
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:45,366
Listen, Mueang. If I could give you this necklace, I would.

359
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:47,645
But I can't because your dad told me to treasure it.

360
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:49,326
Does my dad own your life or what?

361
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:52,286
Are you going to die if he orders it?

362
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,166
Don't use my dad as an excuse.

363
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:57,166
You can choose what to do with your life.

364
00:34:57,797 --> 00:34:59,326
There are some things

365
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,086
that we can't choose in our lives.

366
00:35:02,446 --> 00:35:05,753
We have to do what we don't want to do

367
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,526
to survive in this world.

368
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:12,526
If I have something important to you to trade with it,

369
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:15,046
would you go against my dad's wish?

370
00:35:15,926 --> 00:35:17,246
What's that something important?

371
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,206
What if I find your MP3 player?

372
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:22,846
There's no way. It's already gone.

373
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,406
What if I can find it?

374
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,806
Meet me at my house at four.

375
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:29,606
Bring the necklace.

376
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:45,846
This isn't it.

377
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:49,206
Goodbye, little one.

378
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:51,766
Please wait for the next time.

379
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:24,773
I can't let this go.

380
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,006
This is a must-have.

381
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:32,166
That's true.

382
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:39,846
Ing.

383
00:36:40,224 --> 00:36:43,006
I've ordered your favorite food.

384
00:36:54,408 --> 00:36:58,486
My red ruby is gone.

385
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,966
You really like to ruin my mood.

386
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:06,726
Please come out. This is really fresh.

387
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:09,086
It really looks good.

388
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:10,726
What's with you?

389
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:13,806
I've ordered your favorite food.

390
00:37:14,006 --> 00:37:16,006
- I'm not hungry.   - Please have some food.

391
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:18,087
I don't have an appetite. Do you have it?

392
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:19,926
Has Apo answered your message?

393
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:21,526
No.

394
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:25,566
There has to be an update when I'm back.

395
00:37:25,654 --> 00:37:26,748
You have to contact Po.

396
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:29,126
Yes, ma'am. Where are you going, Ing?

397
00:37:29,229 --> 00:37:30,926
Don't ask. It's none of your business.

398
00:37:39,446 --> 00:37:41,846
Excuse me, is Uncle Din here?

399
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:52,326
It's you.

400
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:54,326
Yes, it's me.

401
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,166
Are you a gardener here?

402
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,606
You could say that.

403
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:07,486
And you said all that stuff to me?

404
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:10,966
How could a gardener say that to a guest of the host?

405
00:38:11,126 --> 00:38:13,166
I'll tell Uncle Din to cut your salary.

406
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:15,086
You're too used to using your own privilege.

407
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:18,166
Can't you learn to respect that everyone's equal?

408
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:22,446
You still haven't stopped disrespecting me.

409
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:25,726
Kit and Jiab always treat others nicely.

410
00:38:25,965 --> 00:38:27,546
Why is their daughter like this?

411
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:32,466
How could you call my parents' names like that?

412
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,766
I can even call your name, Ing.

413
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,766
You even know my name?

414
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:41,166
I know you.

415
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:42,686
We're in the same circle.

416
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,446
What? What circle?

417
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:47,406
The gardener circle?

418
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,006
- I haven't touched a shovel before.   - Ing.

419
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:53,046
Thank you.

420
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,446
What do you come here for?

421
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:57,486
Let's set that aside for now.

422
00:38:57,575 --> 00:39:01,486
I have to tell you that your gardener's disrespecting me.

423
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:05,286
Do you think Tin is my gardener?

424
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:07,086
He told me that.

425
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:08,326
Tin.

426
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:10,006
Why did you lie to her?

427
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,446
I didn't lie to her, Uncle Din.

428
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:14,646
I'm really taking care of your garden.

429
00:39:14,797 --> 00:39:16,086
Who would have thought

430
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,846
that Ing has a problem with my career?

431
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:22,646
Ing, Tin isn't my gardener.

432
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:27,326
I bought some plants from his store, so he's here to set them up.

433
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,806
I thought you two already knew each other.

434
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:36,806
He's Mr. Phaibun's son,

435
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:38,486
the owner of S.M. Jewelry.

436
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:42,606
Don't you know Phaibun?

437
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:45,886
I know him. I know Phaibun.

438
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:48,366
- But...   - He's his son.

439
00:39:52,328 --> 00:39:55,406
If you still have any business here, please go wait in the living room.

440
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:58,246
- I'll see you after I'm done with my errand.   - Of course.

441
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:04,646
I told you that we're in the same circle.

442
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:24,908
I'm sorry, Mr. Tin.

443
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:29,126
I didn't know who you were earlier. If I've been rude to you,

444
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:30,766
I'd like to apologize.

445
00:40:31,966 --> 00:40:33,286
That's too insincere.

446
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:43,326
You're smiling, but your eyes are tense.

447
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:45,046
It looks fake.

448
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,366
Just speak the same way. It's already too late.

449
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:51,446
Please don't judge me like that, Mr. Tin.

450
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:54,966
Didn't you judge me before knowing me? What's wrong?

451
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:57,126
You can't take a taste of your own medicine?

452
00:40:57,453 --> 00:41:00,766
Are you sure you want me to be informal with you?

453
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:03,302
Yes. Show your true self.

454
00:41:03,406 --> 00:41:05,726
I want to know how you will end up.

455
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,366
Fine. You're the one who asked for it.

456
00:41:08,526 --> 00:41:12,166
If you know who I am, why didn't you introduce yourself?

457
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:14,606
First, I just found out who you were yesterday.

458
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:16,777
Second, you didn't give me a chance to introduce myself.

459
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:18,726
Third, I was too lazy.

460
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:20,405
And regarding yesterday's matter,

461
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:22,526
don't you want to apologize?

462
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:24,286
You didn't apologize to me.

463
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:25,890
Why didn't you be nice to me?

464
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,006
If you want people to be nice to you, you should be nice to them.

465
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:31,126
- Don't you dare teach me.   - I didn't.

466
00:41:31,526 --> 00:41:32,846
You wouldn't learn anything.

467
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:37,601
If I could block you in real life, I'd block you right now.

468
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,246
That's the same for me. I'd report you as well.

469
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,916
What are you talking about?

470
00:41:42,997 --> 00:41:44,926
What's wrong?

471
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:50,966
It's nothing. I was going to tell you that my customer is rushing me back.

472
00:41:51,047 --> 00:41:54,286
- I have to get going.   - Have a safe drive. See you later.

473
00:42:06,382 --> 00:42:09,445
Tin is like my own son.

474
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:13,846
If he has made you upset, I'd like to apologize in his stead.

475
00:42:14,804 --> 00:42:16,126
It's alright.

476
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,926
Let's talk business, then.

477
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:25,726
Go on.

478
00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:28,526
I'm here to buy your Siamese ruby necklace.

479
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:31,286
Siamese ruby necklace?

480
00:42:32,038 --> 00:42:34,086
The one I gave to Apo?

481
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:35,566
Yes.

482
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:39,926
If you wouldn't help find Siamese rubies for me, please sell them to me.

483
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:43,166
You know that I can't sell it to you.

484
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,398
Why?

485
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,966
It's an important treasure of my family.

486
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:50,206
And it's already Apo's necklace now.

487
00:42:50,911 --> 00:42:54,646
Do I have to ask Apo to sell it to me now?

488
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:58,126
I think Apo wouldn't sell it to you.

489
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:02,286
It's possible Apo might sell it to me.

490
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,686
It's possible.

491
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,846
Then, I have to get closer to Apo now.

492
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:09,246
Wait, Ing.

493
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,886
I also have something to tell you.

494
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:14,286
Have a seat.

495
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:16,966
What's that?

496
00:43:17,484 --> 00:43:18,846
It's about Game.

497
00:43:20,638 --> 00:43:23,886
I just learned that he's Apo's ex-boyfriend.

498
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:31,926
You should take a rest. Don't worry too much.

499
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:34,406
Mr. Phudin.

500
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:38,006
I have something to tell you.

501
00:43:38,477 --> 00:43:40,286
I heard it didn't end well.

502
00:43:41,006 --> 00:43:43,486
Did she tell you anything else?

503
00:43:43,646 --> 00:43:46,726
She told me that Game had cheated on her.

504
00:43:47,765 --> 00:43:49,086
Is that so?

505
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:52,966
I have no idea at all.

506
00:43:53,094 --> 00:43:55,366
He's probably too afraid to tell you.

507
00:43:57,726 --> 00:44:00,846
At first, Apo tried to tell me about it.

508
00:44:01,102 --> 00:44:04,086
She's probably afraid to bring it up with me,

509
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:06,686
but it was probably too much for her yesterday.

510
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:08,286
That's why she told me.

511
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:10,246
I feel bad

512
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:13,326
that I invited Game to Apo's birthday party.

513
00:44:15,413 --> 00:44:16,886
I understand.

514
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:21,926
You wouldn't feel bad with me, would you?

515
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:25,526
No. This isn't related to you, Ing,

516
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:30,086
but I also have a favor to ask of you.

517
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:32,526
What is it? You can tell me.

518
00:44:35,526 --> 00:44:38,006
I'm worried about the feelings of my own people.

519
00:44:38,452 --> 00:44:40,452
So, from now on,

520
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:43,326
I don't want to work with Game anymore.

521
00:44:50,717 --> 00:44:51,966
I see.

522
00:45:04,072 --> 00:45:06,766
What if I find your MP3 player?

523
00:45:07,678 --> 00:45:09,526
There's no way. It's already gone.

524
00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:10,966
What if I can find it?

525
00:45:12,734 --> 00:45:14,486
Meet me at my house at four.

526
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,126
Bring the necklace.

527
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,066
Where is the necklace?

528
00:46:21,444 --> 00:46:23,126
Where is my MP3 player?

529
00:46:34,903 --> 00:46:36,246
Where did you find it?

530
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:38,086
It's not important where I find it.

531
00:46:38,286 --> 00:46:39,766
If you want it back,

532
00:46:40,486 --> 00:46:41,686
give me the necklace.

533
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:01,206
I'm sorry,

534
00:47:04,727 --> 00:47:06,806
but I can't really give you the necklace back.

535
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:13,846
Did you deceive me?

536
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,526
I haven't said

537
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,326
that I would return it to you.

538
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,006
Fine.

539
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,286
If you're not returning it,

540
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,006
I won't return it.

541
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:38,886
It's fine.

542
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:42,126
It's not important to me anymore.

543
00:47:43,766 --> 00:47:44,966
You're lying.

544
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:47,286
I'm not lying.

545
00:47:49,646 --> 00:47:51,646
I already accepted that it's gone.

546
00:47:53,126 --> 00:47:55,526
You should also get over this as well.

547
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:57,406
Get over this?

548
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,886
Have you ever cared about other people?

549
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,664
You like that I'm kind to you.

550
00:48:07,205 --> 00:48:09,286
Why haven't you been kind to me then?

551
00:48:09,837 --> 00:48:12,126
I'll take great care of your necklace.

552
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,166
You don't have to worry.

553
00:48:17,886 --> 00:48:19,526
You're so selfish.

554
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:23,766
I thought

555
00:48:23,886 --> 00:48:25,606
you were a nice person.

556
00:48:26,743 --> 00:48:28,606
But you're just a heartless person.

557
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:31,606
You're the same as my dad.

558
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:34,646
You're heartless.

559
00:48:47,751 --> 00:48:49,206
Since you're cruel to me,

560
00:48:50,406 --> 00:48:52,446
I don't have to be kind to you!

561
00:48:57,757 --> 00:48:58,966
Mueang.

562
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,606
If you don't want it anymore,

563
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:06,286
I'll throw it away.

564
00:49:10,794 --> 00:49:12,086
Mueang.

565
00:49:12,718 --> 00:49:13,886
Mueang.

566
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:16,046
Mueang.

567
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:20,886
Mueang.

568
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:23,846
If you want it, get it back yourself.

569
00:51:10,806 --> 00:51:12,886
What? It's already half past four?

570
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:17,566
Yes.

571
00:51:20,574 --> 00:51:21,966
It's half past four.

572
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:23,279
Don't be too surprised.

573
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,719
I came here just a little before you woke up.

574
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:28,086
I'm sorry for not asking for permission.

575
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:30,326
I just haven't seen you come out.

576
00:51:30,494 --> 00:51:32,846
That's why I came inside to see if you're dead.

577
00:51:35,037 --> 00:51:39,006
I'm sorry. I forgot to set up my alarm.

578
00:51:40,126 --> 00:51:42,686
Are you jet lagged? Which time zone are you from?

579
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:44,566
I'm from Bangkok.

580
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:48,046
Are you a night owl?

581
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:54,206
Please go out and have your food. I've already told them to set it up.

582
00:51:55,046 --> 00:51:56,166
Thank you.

583
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:00,326
Darn it.

584
00:52:05,886 --> 00:52:07,366
Where have they all gone?

585
00:52:08,846 --> 00:52:10,926
It's already late. What's that?

586
00:52:14,326 --> 00:52:15,606
Phing.

587
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:18,646
- I can only send you off from here.   - Yes.

588
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:21,646
Have a safe drive, and good night.

589
00:52:21,925 --> 00:52:23,406
Thank you so much.

590
00:52:31,246 --> 00:52:32,406
What?

591
00:52:32,718 --> 00:52:34,726
Phing, why didn't you wake me up?

592
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:37,166
Why do I have to wake you up? Is it my duty?

593
00:52:38,437 --> 00:52:40,206
You could have called me.

594
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:41,486
I was busy.

595
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:43,086
I had a date.

596
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:44,397
Date?

597
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:47,046
You had a date with him?

598
00:52:48,806 --> 00:52:51,006
How was it? Was it good?

599
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,206
Maybe.

600
00:52:52,765 --> 00:52:53,966
But I think I'm good, though.

601
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:55,846
Why?

602
00:52:56,477 --> 00:52:58,246
At first, it looked okay.

603
00:52:59,981 --> 00:53:03,046
Are you Phing from Jernee Jernun Jernon?

604
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:06,126
Do you know me? I'm glad.

605
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,686
I know you.

606
00:53:08,598 --> 00:53:10,286
I'm a subscriber of your channel.

607
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:15,046
You're really my subscriber. Thank you.

608
00:53:15,622 --> 00:53:16,846
It's alright.

609
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:19,806
I thought I had seen you before yesterday.

610
00:53:19,941 --> 00:53:24,526
I was unsure when you dressed up as a zombie.

611
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:29,526
And what's your name?

612
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:33,246
I'm Aum. I work for Young Master.

613
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,566
(It begins to look bad when we start talking.)

614
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,326
- Here is your coffee.   - Thank you.

615
00:53:44,278 --> 00:53:47,206
(To not waste any time, let's check his personality.)

616
00:53:48,406 --> 00:53:49,566
Aum,

617
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:53,726
I have something that needs your help.

618
00:53:53,854 --> 00:53:55,046
Of course.

619
00:53:55,181 --> 00:53:56,406
I'm glad to help.

620
00:53:56,535 --> 00:53:57,856
Well,

621
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:01,360
I've been working on a video about a trip to Chanthaburi.

622
00:54:01,486 --> 00:54:03,766
I'd like you to help me with it.

623
00:54:04,037 --> 00:54:08,846
I see. I don't really know much about traveling stuff.

624
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,926
You can ask me first. I might be able to answer it.

625
00:54:12,028 --> 00:54:14,246
Okay. Please wait a moment.

626
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:18,766
There's a new cafe.

627
00:54:18,847 --> 00:54:21,606
I'd like you to bring me there.

628
00:54:23,733 --> 00:54:25,366
Is there a new cafe?

629
00:54:27,758 --> 00:54:29,246
Don't you know this place?

630
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:31,086
I don't know it.

631
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:34,966
Aum, this place is really famous.

632
00:54:35,047 --> 00:54:38,046
There's a lot of people. Can you take a look at it again? Here.

633
00:54:38,326 --> 00:54:40,726
There's a line of people.

634
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:47,046
I don't know why that place is famous.

635
00:54:47,462 --> 00:54:49,206
I don't really go outside.

636
00:54:49,468 --> 00:54:51,646
Your young master

637
00:54:51,774 --> 00:54:53,645
doesn't really let you go outside, does he?

638
00:54:53,759 --> 00:54:55,446
It's not like that.

639
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:58,717
- Oh?   - I like staying home.

640
00:54:58,806 --> 00:55:03,206
If Young Master doesn't ask me to go out, I'll stay home the whole month.

641
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:05,206
- The whole month?   - Yes.

642
00:55:05,516 --> 00:55:08,046
If I'm not wrong, I used to stay home for three straight months.

643
00:55:08,285 --> 00:55:09,766
- Three straight months?   - Yes.

644
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:15,646
I don't really want to meet people. It's draining.

645
00:55:16,077 --> 00:55:17,526
Do you get tired when meeting people?

646
00:55:17,678 --> 00:55:18,966
Yes.

647
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:21,766
(I don't like it.)

648
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:23,926
(He just likes to stay home.)

649
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:27,486
You know that I'd be almost dead

650
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:29,526
if I had to stay home even for a day.

651
00:55:29,637 --> 00:55:32,246
There's no way we can be together. No way.

652
00:55:33,844 --> 00:55:35,566
Hey, come on.

653
00:55:35,861 --> 00:55:38,566
These kinds of things take time.

654
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:41,326
It's been taking up my whole life.

655
00:55:41,446 --> 00:55:42,766
I can't even find one.

656
00:55:43,013 --> 00:55:45,206
Why is it so difficult?

657
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:47,366
My friends have already married. They all have a child.

658
00:55:47,486 --> 00:55:50,246
I haven't even had any boyfriends.

659
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:52,606
- Am I not pretty?   - Why didn't you dump him quickly then?

660
00:55:52,726 --> 00:55:53,966
Why are you back so late?

661
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:57,086
I have to stall time to let Apo talk with Mueang.

662
00:55:57,206 --> 00:55:59,006
Huh? Why?

663
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:02,486
She wanted to talk about the necklace with Mueang.

664
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:05,406
You let Po go alone, Phing?

665
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,286
Don't be too worried.

666
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,766
Po's an adult. She can take care of herself.

667
00:56:18,182 --> 00:56:19,606
Like that?

668
00:56:26,246 --> 00:56:27,686
- Po.   - Po.

669
00:56:35,774 --> 00:56:38,226
Po, you should pack your stuff.

670
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:44,166
Phing.

671
00:56:44,574 --> 00:56:46,006
Get Po's suitcase.

672
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:53,286
Hey.

673
00:56:53,654 --> 00:56:55,086
Won't you help me?

674
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:58,566
Listen, you probably know your sister well enough by now.

675
00:56:59,509 --> 00:57:01,486
If she insists she wants to stay,

676
00:57:01,646 --> 00:57:03,266
you can't change her mind.

677
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:11,646
I don't want you to stay here anymore.

678
00:57:14,006 --> 00:57:15,526
Don't worry, everyone.

679
00:57:16,526 --> 00:57:19,246
Mueang isn't that bad of a person.

680
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:22,766
Po, are you still defending him?

681
00:57:23,942 --> 00:57:25,486
I'm not defending him.

682
00:57:26,406 --> 00:57:28,566
I just understand his feelings.

683
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,286
If someone takes away my important treasure,

684
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:34,086
I'll also be angry.

685
00:57:35,246 --> 00:57:36,886
I understand what you're saying.

686
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:39,686
Phing and I

687
00:57:39,926 --> 00:57:41,686
just worry about you.

688
00:57:43,237 --> 00:57:44,526
Yeah.

689
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,486
We're really worried about you.

690
00:57:53,406 --> 00:57:56,086
Thank you for worrying about me.

691
00:57:56,301 --> 00:58:00,566
But don't forget who I am. I'm Apo, the tough girl.

692
00:58:02,126 --> 00:58:05,406
A really tough girl wouldn't try to find a place to cry by herself.

693
00:58:07,646 --> 00:58:10,006
Who's the one who made five transfers to go to university?

694
00:58:10,806 --> 00:58:11,926
You.

695
00:58:12,301 --> 00:58:15,486
Who's the one who went to the hospital when her leg was broken?

696
00:58:15,814 --> 00:58:17,606
- It's you.   - See?

697
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:20,326
I'm...

698
00:58:20,837 --> 00:58:22,486
I'm the best at enduring.

699
00:58:22,965 --> 00:58:25,086
I just have to endure it again,

700
00:58:25,406 --> 00:58:27,246
and this too shall pass.

701
00:58:57,789 --> 00:59:00,726
How could a human be heartless like this?

702
00:59:01,076 --> 00:59:02,226
I agree.

703
00:59:02,366 --> 00:59:03,806
They say everything

704
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:05,406
like they don't have any feelings.

705
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:09,566
Yeah. If they don't live in an ivory tower,

706
00:59:09,661 --> 00:59:13,046
they probably only care about themselves each day.

707
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:15,566
- Yeah.   - Yeah.

708
00:59:16,614 --> 00:59:18,046
What's this about?

709
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:23,526
I just feel like the world lacks empathy.

710
00:59:23,749 --> 00:59:25,206
Not really.

711
00:59:25,444 --> 00:59:27,086
I had a date today.

712
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:30,526
She has that empathy for me.

713
00:59:31,261 --> 00:59:34,151
I felt like she didn't like me that much,

714
00:59:34,232 --> 00:59:36,552
but she stayed with me all day long.

715
00:59:38,918 --> 00:59:40,406
- Did you just brag?   - Did you just brag?

716
00:59:40,501 --> 00:59:43,286
No, it's not like that, Young Master.

717
00:59:43,406 --> 00:59:45,886
I just want to tell you about it.

718
00:59:46,926 --> 00:59:49,566
I don't know who you and Tin

719
00:59:49,646 --> 00:59:52,166
are talking about. But if it's Ms. Apo,

720
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:54,726
I think you shouldn't jump to conclusions.

721
00:59:55,901 --> 00:59:57,886
Since when are you on that side?

722
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:01,686
No, Young Master. I warned you because I'm on your side.

723
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:03,446
Well...

724
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:07,166
Everything always has three sides, Young Master.

725
01:00:07,389 --> 01:00:09,846
Our side, their side,

726
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:11,566
and the truth.

727
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,806
What?

728
01:00:13,246 --> 01:00:15,606
You said like you saw or knew something.

729
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:17,326
Well...

730
01:00:17,726 --> 01:00:19,606
I don't really know much about it.

731
01:00:20,174 --> 01:00:21,486
I just know that

732
01:00:22,165 --> 01:00:24,165
the cause of all problems

733
01:00:24,366 --> 01:00:26,366
isn't from Ms. Apo.

734
01:00:27,046 --> 01:00:28,246
It's from

735
01:00:31,686 --> 01:00:33,406
Ms. Apo's family.

736
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:46,686
(Hello, I'm Darin,)

737
01:00:47,302 --> 01:00:50,406
(a former expert on handbags. Right now,)

738
01:00:50,598 --> 01:00:52,526
(I'm an expert on credit card debt.)

739
01:00:53,046 --> 01:00:56,726
(They said living debt-free is a true blessing.)

740
01:00:57,582 --> 01:01:00,326
(I should just burn the invoice.)

741
01:01:05,142 --> 01:01:07,766
(I can burn every single one of them.)

742
01:01:12,509 --> 01:01:14,766
Mom, are you burning down our house?

743
01:01:15,446 --> 01:01:17,206
(She's my eldest daughter,)

744
01:01:17,295 --> 01:01:18,886
(Rita.)

745
01:01:19,262 --> 01:01:21,686
(She's a model on Instagram.)

746
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:23,566
(She also gives paid reviews on goods.)

747
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:26,446
(But her true job is)

748
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:28,766
(living off her mother.)

749
01:01:29,469 --> 01:01:31,006
This one looks nice.

750
01:01:31,246 --> 01:01:33,806
This one looks nice as well. That one too.

751
01:01:33,973 --> 01:01:35,366
I'll buy all of them.

752
01:01:35,686 --> 01:01:37,382
Mom, give me some money.

753
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:39,828
Huh?

754
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:41,886
It's empty?

755
01:01:42,062 --> 01:01:43,686
What am I going to eat?

756
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:46,966
Mom, give me some money.

757
01:01:47,197 --> 01:01:49,966
Oh my, I feel bad for these animals.

758
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:52,526
I'll try to find money to help you.

759
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:54,846
Mom, give me some money.

760
01:01:55,469 --> 01:01:59,006
(She still asks for my money when she wants to make a donation.)

761
01:01:59,713 --> 01:02:01,286
Mom, give me some money.

762
01:02:02,549 --> 01:02:03,846
Again?

763
01:02:04,165 --> 01:02:05,606
Are you a beggar?

764
01:02:06,486 --> 01:02:10,086
No. I can't compare my child to a beggar.

765
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:12,126
Some good beggars

766
01:02:12,222 --> 01:02:14,366
can even make more money than you.

767
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:15,949
Mom!

768
01:02:20,205 --> 01:02:23,086
(No one else is helping me make money.)

769
01:02:23,445 --> 01:02:25,566
(There are only people spending money.)

770
01:02:26,045 --> 01:02:30,646
(Right, I have my niece who already paid off a big debt,)

771
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:35,486
(but I still have other debts.)

772
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:41,846
(The income from a rental house)

773
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,606
(and eight-room dormitory)

774
01:02:43,694 --> 01:02:45,886
(isn't enough in this day and age.)

775
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:52,006
(All the holy things in the world,)

776
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:55,474
(spirits, protectors, angels, or gods,)

777
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:58,566
(no matter where you are,)

778
01:02:58,647 --> 01:03:02,366
(please save our family.)

779
01:03:04,286 --> 01:03:06,508
- Mom!   - What is it again?

780
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:07,966
Mom, look at this.

781
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:13,086
Is this allowed?

782
01:03:16,613 --> 01:03:20,286
(This is the way to save us all.)

783
01:03:32,366 --> 01:03:34,206
I lost money in the lottery again.

784
01:03:34,942 --> 01:03:38,446
My solution to elevate my status is gone now.

785
01:03:38,718 --> 01:03:39,806
No!

786
01:03:39,966 --> 01:03:41,486
I won't give up.

787
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:42,926
Although I didn't win the lottery,

788
01:03:43,045 --> 01:03:45,126
I'll still get the reward from Young Master.

789
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:47,486
Really? Ging,

790
01:03:47,638 --> 01:03:50,766
there's no way you'll find any evidence to prove Ms. Stepmother's guilt.

791
01:03:50,847 --> 01:03:52,086
Why can't I find it?

792
01:03:52,206 --> 01:03:54,446
Because Ms. Stepmother is a nice person.

793
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:57,686
Is she a nice person or a rich person?

794
01:03:57,774 --> 01:03:59,965
If I were as rich as Ms. Stepmother,

795
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:01,541
I'd also be a nice person.

796
01:04:01,622 --> 01:04:04,606
- I'd make a donation all the time.   - Really?

797
01:04:04,836 --> 01:04:08,726
There's no way you'd be a nice person in this life then

798
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,446
because you can never be rich.

799
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:12,886
- Poe!   - Stop!

800
01:04:14,742 --> 01:04:16,326
I also wonder

801
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:20,246
what kind of person Ms. Stepmother really is.

802
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:21,366
Sometimes,

803
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:25,086
she seems wild and doesn't seem like she cares about anyone else.

804
01:04:25,246 --> 01:04:26,485
Sometimes,

805
01:04:26,566 --> 01:04:30,326
she seems gentle and seems like she cares about our Young Master.

806
01:04:31,221 --> 01:04:33,886
Boem, listen to me.

807
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:38,246
Humans can never be 100 percent evil or good.

808
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,086
But if you're more evil

809
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:42,046
than you're good,

810
01:04:42,198 --> 01:04:45,726
you'll eventually show your true nature one day.

811
01:04:46,743 --> 01:04:48,246
- Cool.   - Yeah.

812
01:04:48,374 --> 01:04:50,406
- I lost money.   - Stop that.

813
01:04:51,326 --> 01:04:52,846
Stop saying that.

814
01:05:04,384 --> 01:05:06,206
I almost stepped on you.

815
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:10,030
Hey, why are you here?

816
01:05:11,766 --> 01:05:13,446
You have to be careful.

817
01:05:16,272 --> 01:05:17,797
This way.

818
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,286
You have to stay here, alright? Okay.

819
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:35,486
(How could a human be heartless like this?)

820
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:38,206
I don't know who you and Tin

821
01:05:38,326 --> 01:05:40,886
are talking about. But if it's Ms. Apo,

822
01:05:41,046 --> 01:05:43,486
I think you shouldn't jump to conclusions.

823
01:05:43,718 --> 01:05:45,718
The cause of all problems

824
01:05:45,926 --> 01:05:47,646
isn't from Ms. Apo.

825
01:05:47,925 --> 01:05:50,646
It's from Ms. Apo's family.

826
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:05,886
Another one. Gosh.

827
01:06:07,095 --> 01:06:08,686
Come here.

828
01:06:09,806 --> 01:06:11,246
You're only kind to animals.

829
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:13,806
Why aren't you kind to humans?

830
01:06:22,686 --> 01:06:25,286
Your house has a lot of slugs.

831
01:06:43,053 --> 01:06:44,246
No.

832
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:46,606
I'll save that one myself.

833
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,606
- Stop!   - No!

834
01:06:55,949 --> 01:06:57,126
- No.   - No.

835
01:06:59,413 --> 01:07:01,413
- Hi, Apo!   - Hi, Apo!

836
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:13,869
- Happy belated birthday.   - Happy belated birthday.

837
01:07:36,857 --> 01:07:39,926
Since Aunt Da and Ri are here to visit me,

838
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:42,246
can you let them stay here?

839
01:07:43,086 --> 01:07:44,086
Yes.

840
01:07:46,198 --> 01:07:48,926
(If your relatives don't go home, I assure you there'll be a problem.)

841
01:07:49,073 --> 01:07:51,486
- No!   - Don't do that, you madman!

842
01:07:51,966 --> 01:07:53,166
That's the thief.

843
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:56,486
Are you crazy? I told you that I came down to drink water.

844
01:07:56,613 --> 01:07:59,486
(Ms. Apo's relatives are using her like a servant.)

845
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:01,726
(Take a look yourself if you don't believe me.)

846
01:08:01,807 --> 01:08:03,886
Don't you feel bad for her at all?

847
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:05,566
Why would I feel bad for her?

848
01:08:05,733 --> 01:08:07,486
She didn't even feel bad for me.

849
01:08:08,806 --> 01:08:10,446
What? Is she dead?

850
01:08:10,606 --> 01:08:13,926
I told you that you don't have to tell me even if she's dead.

851
01:08:14,102 --> 01:08:16,646
- Ms. Apo's dead!   - Huh?
