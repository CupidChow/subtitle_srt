1
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,166
- Mom.   - Go back.

2
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,646
Go back to live your happy life in that house.

3
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:07,686
How did you get here?

4
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:09,486
I told you I'd come.

5
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:11,006
This is an offer.

6
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:14,166
Aunt, Rita, and Om.

7
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,166
All of you will work for me starting today.

8
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:18,806
When you like someone,

9
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:21,926
you want to seem gentle in their eyes.

10
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:23,086
True.

11
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,526
Is this

12
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,806
the time to start dating?

13
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:28,726
You're a serious case.

14
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:32,046
I think you need a personal radar to give you a warning.

15
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:34,686
You just have to be with me all the time.

16
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,246
Do you want me to?

17
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:40,286
- Tin has a girlfriend?   - He seems too happy.

18
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:41,917
- Tin.   - What?

19
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:44,806
Is your business done?

20
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:46,926
Po's been waiting for you.

21
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:50,406
Oh, yeah. It's done.

22
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:56,126
Apo, I...

23
00:02:56,357 --> 00:03:00,686
Mueang and I want to talk about Game with you.

24
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:04,606
I think that jerk...

25
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:11,366
We think Game, your ex-boyfriend, is suspicious.

26
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:13,526
It's as if someone sent him here.

27
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,486
Who?

28
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,926
Do you have any ideas

29
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:22,446
on whether Game knows someone who really wants a Siamese ruby?

30
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:35,086
(Game)

31
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:41,886
What's wrong?

32
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:45,926
I can't think of anyone right now.

33
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:49,926
It's fine.

34
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,446
Take your time.

35
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:53,886
Please tell us if you know anything.

36
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:55,286
Of course.

37
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:58,806
Did Game do something bad again?

38
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:00,486
No.

39
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,286
He hasn't done it yet.

40
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:03,766
But...

41
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:06,046
There's one more thing that's suspicious.

42
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,566
What is it?

43
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:08,926
Do you think

44
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:10,806
your aunt and your cousin

45
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:12,646
agreed too easily?

46
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:16,646
Usually,

47
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:18,846
they wouldn't give in to us this much.

48
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:29,766
- Mom.   - What?

49
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:32,622
Do you think they have caught us?

50
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:35,966
No way. It went pretty smoothly, I assure you.

51
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:39,046
They caught me lying last time.

52
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:40,966
You overdid it last time.

53
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:42,916
This time, we'll stay quiet.

54
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:45,566
Act as if we listen to them. They won't catch us.

55
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,406
Do you think this will work?

56
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,526
Yes. At least we get to come back here again.

57
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:52,686
Listen,

58
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:56,086
you can't go over the top again this time.

59
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:59,022
They told us to be quiet

60
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,486
so as not to make Apo suspicious.

61
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,268
If you spray water on her again,

62
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,046
do you think she'll help us?

63
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:06,286
I'm not as thick-skinned as you.

64
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,446
Fine. I'm thick-skinned.

65
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:12,446
Right now, Po is considered Mr. Phudin's favorite.

66
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,006
She also might become Mueang's wife.

67
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:17,126
She is going to be a millionaire.

68
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:20,326
A real millionaire, Mom.

69
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,606
If you cut off her right now, I think you're being clueless.

70
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,206
- I'll be more careful.   - Good.

71
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,571
Our plan

72
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,206
is to make Apo confused.

73
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:33,366
We'll suck her money out until we're satisfied.

74
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:35,926
You just follow our orders, okay?

75
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:37,262
Okay.

76
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:56,486
A gecko is calling.

77
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:14,526
How did it get here?

78
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:19,246
Darling.

79
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,206
Something just dropped on its own.

80
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:30,566
That means...

81
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,526
I miss you.

82
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:45,286
(Hello, I'm Rita.)

83
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:46,886
(Let's go.)

84
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:53,526
(Spotlight! I've always loved being in the spotlight since I was a child.)

85
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:57,446
Please don't hurt me.

86
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:59,886
(I want to be an actress.)

87
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:03,686
Darling, please stop.

88
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,926
Please stop. Please don't hurt me anymore.

89
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:10,286
Cut!

90
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:12,618
I have to cut again.

91
00:07:12,726 --> 00:07:13,806
My acting is good, isn't it?

92
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:18,566
You're so bad. You're as stiff as a rock. Are you sure you're a human?

93
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:21,693
Who would know that I'm also hurt?

94
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:26,286
(I want to be a singer.)

95
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:27,805
- Who would...   - No.

96
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,302
- You're not good.   - Not good.

97
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:32,526
But I haven't sung the main chorus yet.

98
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:34,686
- Next one, please.   - Next one, please.

99
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,246
(However...)

100
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,806
(I can't reach the goal at all.)

101
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:42,086
(They often told me that)

102
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,926
(I wasn't charming enough,)

103
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:45,606
(I didn't look adorable.)

104
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:47,966
(But I think I have my own charm.)

105
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:49,886
(It might be hidden)

106
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:52,286
(and no one has ever seen it.)

107
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,046
(What's this?)

108
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,926
(Why...)

109
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,326
(Why are we so compatible?)

110
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:21,046
Do you remember me?

111
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:23,286
Yes.

112
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,446
We've met a few times, but Apo always talked about you.

113
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:28,966
That's why I know your face.

114
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:31,646
Why are you here? Are you hanging out here?

115
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,086
I'm working.

116
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:34,966
Working?

117
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:38,006
- Are you a dancer?   - Nonsense.

118
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,541
I have to take a break, you know?

119
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:42,566
What about you?

120
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,486
I'm hanging out with my friends.

121
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:52,806
Don't tell Po that you found me in this state.

122
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:55,566
I won't. We've already cut each other off.

123
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:01,366
Since her life is better, she's never contacted me again.

124
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:05,166
She already forgot about me. She is living happily by herself.

125
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,326
And...

126
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:12,646
Why don't you follow her there?

127
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:16,246
Po hates me and my mom.

128
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:17,846
Nonsense.

129
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:20,379
Apo will never hate your family.

130
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,606
She might just be mad.

131
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,366
You only have to endure

132
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:28,366
and act like a good sister to her.

133
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:30,926
Apo will surely feel bad.

134
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:35,726
- A good sister?   - Yes.

135
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:42,566
As for me, I'll act as a redeemed former boyfriend of hers

136
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:44,925
so that we'll be happy together.

137
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:47,766
Isn't that too easy?

138
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,966
Don't think too much.

139
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:53,686
We're in a bad spot right now because of Apo.

140
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:57,309
We only just need to pay her back a bit.

141
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,366
It'll be alright.

142
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,886
Are you in?

143
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:08,966
- I'm in.   - Bottoms up.

144
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:10,569
(Unbelievable.)

145
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,446
(The plan that two drunkards came up with on that night)

146
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:14,938
(actually becomes true)

147
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:16,966
(one month later.)

148
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:25,486
Yes. I'm in,

149
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:27,286
but there's a little trouble.

150
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:30,246
(Mom also agreed with this plan.)

151
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:32,046
What's the trouble?

152
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:36,174
It seems like Apo and Mr. Phudin's son like each other.

153
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:45,806
(That's it.)

154
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,046
(When two lonely people meet each other,)

155
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,926
(of course, their relationship would be like this.)

156
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:52,806
Our first step is successful.

157
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:54,461
Is there another step?

158
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:55,966
Yes.

159
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:57,886
Since we've come this far,

160
00:10:57,987 --> 00:11:01,827
it's not worth it to just get a small salary.

161
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:03,993
True. It's not worth it.

162
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,046
- We'll be rich.   - Rich.

163
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:11,526
- Rich.   - Rich.

164
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:18,246
Po.

165
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,446
Game, Aunt Da, and Ri

166
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:23,064
are all here now. What's wrong with you?

167
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,437
Are you a charity foundation?

168
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:27,749
I'm not that good of a person.

169
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,446
You're that good of a person.

170
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:34,526
So, what's the matter? I have to go to work soon.

171
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,670
Actually, I have good news to tell you.

172
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,349
What good news?

173
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,726
- Babe.   - Babe?

174
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:47,646
- Baby.   - Baby?

175
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:51,286
- Please wait a second. Let me talk to her.   - Of course.

176
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,886
No way...

177
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:56,109
Ms. Stepmother, hello.

178
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,246
Aum and I

179
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:09,526
are dating.

180
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,166
Dating?

181
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,166
Huh? Since when?

182
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:17,046
Please make yourself comfortable. Young Master lets me use this space.

183
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,566
To do what?

184
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,406
To ease your boredom, Phing.

185
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:23,406
Ease my boredom? Why?

186
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:29,326
We should find something fun to do together.

187
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:32,606
I don't think that's a good idea.

188
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:36,806
Oh?

189
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,166
You don't want to do it with me alone?

190
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,086
You can call your friends here.

191
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,006
Do it in a group too?

192
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:44,206
Yes.

193
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,180
Listen, Aum.

194
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:52,326
I might look like an adventurous woman,

195
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:55,046
- but I'm not...   - Are you ready?

196
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,246
Let's play.

197
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,246
- Playing a game?   - Yes.

198
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:06,886
Do you want a dance game or an island-building game?

199
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,126
I've already turned on the dance game, though.

200
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:13,446
Let's play the dance game. I want to exercise as well.

201
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:14,926
Of course.

202
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,046
I'll set it up.

203
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:21,166
He's inviting me to play a game?

204
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,086
How is it, Phing?

205
00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:59,926
Are you bored?

206
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,646
It's alright.

207
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:05,606
This is what I do when I stay at home by myself.

208
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:10,086
Honestly, I don't want to believe that you like to stay home.

209
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:13,766
From your look, you don't look like an introvert.

210
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:16,406
Who said I'm an introvert?

211
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,286
I used to like to travel a lot like you, Phing.

212
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,088
When I grew up,

213
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:23,046
I just traveled less.

214
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:27,046
That kind of thing doesn't fulfill me anymore.

215
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:29,806
And staying home can fulfill you?

216
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,286
Why don't you like to stay home, Phing?

217
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,046
There's no one in my home.

218
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,406
I don't have anyone there.

219
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,766
It's lonely. I don't like to be alone.

220
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:40,126
But in this house,

221
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:41,446
there's Young Master,

222
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,446
who's like my family.

223
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:47,286
Although we fight, it's fun when we're together.

224
00:14:47,406 --> 00:14:48,686
I don't get it.

225
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,326
Since I moved to Bangkok to study at university,

226
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:54,533
I've always been alone. I've done everything alone.

227
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,926
Please try having a boyfriend.

228
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:01,566
You might love staying home, Phing.

229
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:03,206
You're silly.

230
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:07,246
If you really don't like staying at home,

231
00:15:07,926 --> 00:15:10,566
I'm ready to travel the world with you.

232
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:13,886
Listen, you don't have to try that hard.

233
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,766
I have to try hard.

234
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:18,766
Haven't you heard this?

235
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:21,726
"The right one doesn't have to try."

236
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:25,286
If you're the right one, you have to try even harder.

237
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,606
If you want to stay with someone,

238
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,406
you have to adapt and adjust.

239
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,966
I'm ready to adapt myself for you.

240
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,486
What about you? Are you ready?

241
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:38,046
You're talking big.

242
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:40,986
I'm not an easy girl.

243
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:46,486
(But you're falling for him, Phing.)

244
00:15:58,093 --> 00:15:59,206
(No.)

245
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:01,006
(You can't fall for him.)

246
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:07,446
(His charm)

247
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:12,726
(makes me realize that nirvana does exist.)

248
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:16,126
What are you doing?

249
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:19,766
I'm praying. I like to pray after exercising.

250
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:21,126
Is that so?

251
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:27,206
Phing, you can't decide to date him just because he slicks his hair back.

252
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,486
Why can't I?

253
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:31,086
You didn't see how he slicked his hair.

254
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,534
I'm worried about you.

255
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:37,206
Why are you that easy?

256
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:39,685
My life has been too barren.

257
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,886
And that's it?

258
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:44,926
That's not it. There's still more, actually.

259
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,950
What?

260
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:49,286
Po,

261
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:53,046
have you ever felt like you can truly be yourself when you're with anyone?

262
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:59,206
Although it isn't long, I feel

263
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,966
so relaxed.

264
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:03,206
When you see that possibility,

265
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,686
you feel like you want to grasp it in your hand,

266
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:08,886
although you know it can still go wrong later.

267
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:11,126
You still want to try it for once.

268
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,206
Today is nice.

269
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,206
I've never felt like this for a long time.

270
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,646
I'm glad

271
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,726
that I could make you feel better.

272
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,766
- Aum.   - Yes?

273
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,406
If you want to ask me to be your girlfriend,

274
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,166
you have to do it right now

275
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:39,846
because I might change my mind tomorrow.

276
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:44,806
Phing.

277
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:48,246
Please be my girlfriend, Phing.

278
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:51,686
I know you're hesitating,

279
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,686
but our lives are like an experiment.

280
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:56,486
We'll try to date each other, Phing.

281
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:02,846
Let's try it for once.

282
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,286
Yeah!

283
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,566
Yes! Phing is my girlfriend now.

284
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:08,966
You're my girlfriend now.

285
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,486
- I have a girlfriend.   - Be quiet.

286
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:13,486
I have a girlfriend called Phing.

287
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:18,246
What about you?

288
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,686
You got a head start before me.

289
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:23,966
Are you ready to have a boyfriend?

290
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:37,166
Take your time. I'll go see my boyfriend now.

291
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:40,726
I'm coming.

292
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,046
- Babe.   - Are you done talking?

293
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:44,686
- Yes. Let's go.   - Shall we go?

294
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:46,726
Let's go.

295
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:49,606
Let's go.

296
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,126
(What about you?)

297
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:15,406
(You got a head start before me.)

298
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:18,886
(Are you ready to have a boyfriend?)

299
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:28,486
What do you want me to do?

300
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:32,286
Wait for my aunt to come back.

301
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,942
You'll wait in that room.

302
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:35,486
Take your mom to stay with you.

303
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:53,606
Is your sister

304
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,726
a little jealous of you?

305
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,621
Ri is jealous of me?

306
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:58,926
Yes.

307
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,086
When I interviewed her, she compared herself to you all the time.

308
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:07,006
Like, "I can't do anything as good as her."

309
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:09,166
Wasn't she being sarcastic?

310
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:10,486
Really?

311
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:12,006
Do you think so?

312
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,078
The one who's jealous

313
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:16,526
is me.

314
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:19,326
You? You're jealous of your older sister?

315
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,726
Would you think less of me if I told you about this?

316
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:29,046
No. Just say it.

317
00:20:34,462 --> 00:20:36,086
I have my own bad side.

318
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:40,686
Bad side?

319
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:43,726
When I was a child,

320
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,286
I was jealous of my sister.

321
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:48,246
I wanted to be like Ri.

322
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,286
You wanted to be like that?

323
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:53,446
Ri is charming, you know?

324
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:56,006
She knew how to put on makeup. She knew how to dress up.

325
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,806
Everyone always looks at her.

326
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:01,286
She's confident in herself.

327
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:04,302
She knows what she likes and doesn't like.

328
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:08,286
And look at me.

329
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:09,926
I'm like this.

330
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:11,686
When I was a child,

331
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:14,286
I wanted to be anyone who wasn't me.

332
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:21,406
And that's my dark side.

333
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:23,646
It's not that dark.

334
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:25,046
It's normal.

335
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:29,646
I used to want to be like Tin as well.

336
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:32,046
His dad and his mom are really kind.

337
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:33,746
I want a family like that.

338
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:38,526
Forget it.

339
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:40,526
Well,

340
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:43,486
now,

341
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:46,006
do you still want to be another person?

342
00:21:57,086 --> 00:21:59,366
We're finally back. I'm so tired.

343
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:02,006
Tired? Who's tired again?

344
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,806
It's me who should be tired. I took you to various cafes.

345
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:07,406
I had to take photos everywhere as well.

346
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,166
This isn't on me.

347
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:10,686
It's only Wi's fault.

348
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:14,646
What? Didn't you want to drink peach soda from that cafe?

349
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,609
You said it's their signature drink.

350
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,806
- Right.   - Where's the bathroom? Is it upstairs?

351
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:21,286
No, Mom. It's probably... Oh.

352
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:24,886
They still dare to come here?

353
00:22:35,948 --> 00:22:38,446
Phing, do you think this will go well?

354
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,006
No way.

355
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:44,867
That Mueang. He's leaving a pile of crap for me to clean up.

356
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:49,972
What? Are you saying Ri and I are crap?

357
00:22:50,072 --> 00:22:51,166
Yes.

358
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:53,140
A big pile of crap

359
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:54,846
that can't be flushed away in the toilet.

360
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:58,725
- You!   - Mom, calm down.

361
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,926
Calm down, Mom.

362
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:05,406
If you want to say I'm crap,

363
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:07,646
I'm at least a crap

364
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,806
that's full of nutrition.

365
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,046
How long are you going to talk about this?

366
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:14,966
Please mind your manners.

367
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:17,726
The viewers might be having their meal right now.

368
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:21,126
So,

369
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:25,366
Mr. Mueang assigned you to the souvenir shop, Ms. Darin.

370
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:30,006
As for you, you'll be a sales representative for livestreaming, Ms. Rita.

371
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:33,286
As for Om, he'll be an intern in the IT department.

372
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:35,422
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:38,726
Have you ever done anything before?

374
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,206
I'm talking about work experience here.

375
00:23:41,578 --> 00:23:43,166
Mom and I are good at selling stuff.

376
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:44,966
Selling yourself or what?

377
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:49,606
And how's that bothering you?

378
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:52,046
Calm down, my child.

379
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:55,206
Of course.

380
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,820
I think I can see this company's future now.

381
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,245
It'll flourish, right?

382
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:02,493
- It'll go bankrupt.   - Yeah.

383
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:03,806
No way.

384
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:08,526
How did this happen when I was only away for a while?

385
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:11,062
You also accepted Game, didn't you?

386
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:13,966
I accepted him because I felt bad for Apo.

387
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:16,326
I'm sorry, Mr. Phudin.

388
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:19,846
My family really has nowhere to go.

389
00:24:19,974 --> 00:24:22,446
I'd like them to stay here for a while.

390
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:25,806
Tell them not to cause problems.

391
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,446
I'll try.

392
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,726
If something happens,

393
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:30,966
I'll take responsibility.

394
00:24:31,118 --> 00:24:32,286
You said it.

395
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:35,366
Good.

396
00:24:35,694 --> 00:24:37,926
Right now, forget about Apo's family.

397
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,966
We have to kick Game out of here first.

398
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:45,086
Why do we have to kick Game out?

399
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:47,886
He's the tenth level of security threat.

400
00:24:50,686 --> 00:24:52,365
Tenth level?

401
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:53,526
Yes.

402
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,406
Tenth level.

403
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:56,606
It's that, isn't it?

404
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:59,046
- Yes.   - Are you sure?

405
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:00,990
I'm 100 percent sure.

406
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,326
Clear.

407
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:10,166
Clear.

408
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,646
If what you said is right,

409
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:17,286
we have to be really careful.

410
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:18,492
Yes.

411
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:20,606
We can't risk it for any second.

412
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:25,166
Mueang, Apo.

413
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:27,286
Follow and keep an eye on Game.

414
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:28,806
Keep an eye on him?

415
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:30,086
Roger.

416
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,446
I'm not a spy, though.

417
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,133
Apo...

418
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:39,782
Romanoff.

419
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,326
Human-eating plants.

420
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:54,846
What are you doing?

421
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:58,166
One, two...

422
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:00,246
One, two.

423
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:02,406
One, two.

424
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:04,446
One, two.

425
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,726
- One, two.   - Can't they dance somewhere else?

426
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:09,046
One, two.

427
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:13,006
Wouldn't Game notice?

428
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:15,566
No way. Our acting is so good.

429
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:26,486
What's up?

430
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:29,806
Okay.

431
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,966
I'll see you when I get off my job.

432
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:49,686
I know you will be here early.

433
00:27:55,246 --> 00:27:57,286
I asked someone to investigate.

434
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,246
You're not lying when you said you're working for Uncle Din.

435
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:05,126
Do you want to continue with our talk from last night?

436
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:06,606
Yes.

437
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:09,206
When Mr. Phudin approves of the mining,

438
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,646
I'll report to you as soon as possible.

439
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:16,206
You might not only get a Siamese ruby,

440
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:18,166
but you also might get more.

441
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:21,326
You're exaggerating. There's almost nothing left.

442
00:28:22,238 --> 00:28:26,886
If there is, it'll be an important discovery.

443
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:30,326
I'll report to you about every move,

444
00:28:30,646 --> 00:28:31,886
in exchange

445
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,166
for some support money.

446
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:36,806
It's not bad.

447
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:39,806
- How much do you want?   - Not much.

448
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:41,694
Just three million.

449
00:28:55,115 --> 00:28:56,981
- He's out.   - I saw it.

450
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,566
Is this really Ing's house?

451
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,446
- Yes.   - Why would Game come to see Ing?

452
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:09,446
Their relationship didn't end well.

453
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:11,406
Tin might be able to tell us.

454
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:17,486
No way.

455
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:19,686
Ing isn't related to this.

456
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,566
How would you know?

457
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:23,246
Well...

458
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:25,206
I just know.

459
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:27,966
- Listen, Tin.   - Hm?

460
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:30,006
You're acting suspicious.

461
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:33,366
I just don't believe that Ing is working with Game.

462
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:37,486
You also know how much Ing talked about Siamese rubies with my dad.

463
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,006
Anyway, you're accusing her here.

464
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,166
Ing might not know anything like Tin said,

465
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,006
but she might know something anyway.

466
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,486
Can you try to ask her?

467
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:53,646
We might learn about Game's goal.

468
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:54,846
Yes.

469
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:58,646
Fine. I'll try.

470
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:00,286
Good.

471
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,646
- I'll leave it to you.   - Sure.

472
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,397
Let's go back to the office.

473
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:06,966
- Thank you.   - It's fine.

474
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,674
Please send it to the finance department.

475
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,286
- Of course.   - Thank you.

476
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:39,646
What are you trying to find, Ri?

477
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,366
Artificial tears.

478
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:43,566
They're in your purse.

479
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:46,126
No. How could they be in my purse?

480
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:48,126
Just look at it.

481
00:30:58,006 --> 00:30:59,166
How did you know?

482
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:00,886
Did you open my purse?

483
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:04,406
Hey, you always like to keep a backup there.

484
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:12,646
So, how's your first day at work? Are you tired?

485
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:16,406
Working is not as tiring as dealing with other people.

486
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:19,406
Ri.

487
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:21,846
Tell me if you want my help.

488
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,286
Aren't you mad at me?

489
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:25,686
I'm used to it.

490
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,126
Shall we leave?

491
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:36,686
I already got my stuff.

492
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,846
You can wait in the car.

493
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:45,446
Is something the matter?

494
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:47,566
No.

495
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:49,846
I'll join you later.

496
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:57,197
Ri.

497
00:31:58,406 --> 00:32:02,286
Your purse is too packed. How would you find anything like this?

498
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:04,246
You have to throw something away.

499
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:15,086
Why did you have to be nice to me?

500
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:30,486
- What's up?   - Where are you?

501
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,246
I'm at Chanthaburi.

502
00:32:32,437 --> 00:32:33,806
Why didn't you tell me?

503
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:36,126
I was going to tell you.

504
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,566
Wait there. I'll go see you there.

505
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:53,886
Is he...

506
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,286
Come in.

507
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:04,046
What are you doing here?

508
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:05,766
I have my business.

509
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,646
And...

510
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:10,806
Are you alone?

511
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,566
I'm alone. Why? Did you see someone?

512
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:17,686
No.

513
00:33:19,822 --> 00:33:22,246
What are you doing? Why are there a lot of packages here?

514
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:25,406
I want to throw my childhood stuff away.

515
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:41,366
Is this a lie detector?

516
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,806
Did you play with a lie detector when you were a child?

517
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,566
I bought it when I grew up.

518
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:52,526
I used it when we had a drink.

519
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:53,926
Oh?

520
00:33:54,191 --> 00:33:55,726
Can it actually be used?

521
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,526
Do you want to try it?

522
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:58,886
I'm fine with that.

523
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,166
Sure.

524
00:34:01,198 --> 00:34:02,806
I put in the batteries. Who'll start?

525
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,366
I'll start.

526
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:10,606
- Are you ready?   - Yes.

527
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,926
Do you have someone you're interested in?

528
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,166
Yes.

529
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:27,037
That's correct. It's your turn.

530
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:33,046
I'm ready.

531
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,846
Do you have someone you're interested in?

532
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:41,926
Yes.

533
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:50,726
Is it broken?

534
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:53,566
If it's not broken, it means I didn't lie.

535
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:55,974
It's your turn.

536
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:02,806
The one you're interested in

537
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:04,686
is me.

538
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:11,606
Yes.

539
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,766
It's you.

540
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,206
- Are you lying?   - No, I'm not lying.

541
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:31,006
You're really lying.

542
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:34,526
I'm not lying. I think it's broken. Don't you believe me?

543
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:36,326
Try it.

544
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,486
What about you?

545
00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:40,126
Do you like me?

546
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:42,926
No, I don't like you.

547
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:52,566
- You like...   - I said I didn't like you.

548
00:35:52,678 --> 00:35:56,846
It's broken. It can't be trusted. This is just for fun.

549
00:35:57,286 --> 00:35:59,926
You should go back for now. I have work to do.

550
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:02,086
Hold on. We have to talk about us first.

551
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:06,245
About us? I told you that the detector can't be trusted.

552
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:08,966
This isn't about that machine. This is about our feelings.

553
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:10,766
I don't have anything to talk to you about.

554
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:12,286
Please go back.

555
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:15,806
Please go back.

556
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,126
Sorry. I didn't know you had a guest.

557
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:23,286
Tin?

558
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:27,486
Are you still in contact with him?

559
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:29,526
It's for business.

560
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,246
Please go wait inside.

561
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:52,966
I'll send you off here.

562
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:00,486
What business do you have with Game?

563
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,166
I think I don't have to tell you.

564
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:11,246
I hope you won't tell Mueang that I'm meeting up with Game.

565
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,086
I like you.

566
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:21,686
Don't ask me how or when I like you.

567
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:23,206
I like you,

568
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:26,246
but if you conspire with him against my best friend,

569
00:37:27,494 --> 00:37:28,926
I can't go on.

570
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:17,086
Ing, what should we do?

571
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:20,702
If Tin tells Mueang about this, he'll realize what we're doing.

572
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:38,726
Here. I downloaded the video from the CCTV.

573
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:41,166
We might see Game doing something suspicious in it.

574
00:38:41,757 --> 00:38:44,966
Very good. You're really smart. We'll split the videos.

575
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:46,766
Okay.

576
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,806
- Babe.   - Babe.

577
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,126
They're so quick.

578
00:38:58,286 --> 00:38:59,806
Yeah, they're really quick.

579
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:02,686
Babe, let me kiss your cheek.

580
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:06,006
Let me kiss you back.

581
00:39:08,574 --> 00:39:10,414
People in love really like to show off.

582
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,022
Yeah.

583
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,406
Don't look at it.

584
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:18,646
We have to censor this.

585
00:39:19,117 --> 00:39:22,645
We'll let them flirt. We should go somewhere else.

586
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:25,406
- Let's go.   - Come this way.

587
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:27,086
You're so cute.

588
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,246
It's so mysterious here.

589
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:46,766
It's pretty as well.

590
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:53,686
What are you thinking?

591
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:04,166
I was thinking about what you asked me.

592
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:06,726
"Do you still want to be another person?"

593
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,286
Do you have an answer?

594
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:20,886
Everyone will have their own best moment,

595
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,926
their highest moment.

596
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:26,766
But I feel like

597
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:29,286
I have nothing like that.

598
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:40,766
You might

599
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,286
have to just wait.

600
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:45,966
Wait for the day the light shines onto you

601
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,006
to make you sparkle like that.

602
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:57,486
There'll surely be your day.

603
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,958
Po, you should rest.

604
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:36,406
Yeah.

605
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:46,166
I'll be back.

606
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:09,966
What's that?

607
00:42:10,181 --> 00:42:11,606
Put it on your eyes.

608
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,486
It'll cure your eye strain.

609
00:42:13,582 --> 00:42:14,766
That's what they said.

610
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:18,046
Am I doing it right?

611
00:42:21,094 --> 00:42:22,646
- Do I have to attach it like that?   - Yeah.

612
00:42:22,757 --> 00:42:25,006
- No way. You have to remove the covering first.   - Really?

613
00:42:26,038 --> 00:42:28,526
- Here.   - Oh yeah. Sorry.

614
00:42:31,486 --> 00:42:33,926
And put the strap on my ears.

615
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:36,366
Oh? On your ears.

616
00:42:39,717 --> 00:42:40,926
Like that.

617
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,846
What do you think Game is trying to do?

618
00:43:04,726 --> 00:43:06,126
I don't know.

619
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:09,086
I just feel like something is going on.

620
00:43:11,886 --> 00:43:14,166
I have a plan that needs all of your help.

621
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,526
What plan?

622
00:43:15,607 --> 00:43:18,886
A plan to make us rich.

623
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:22,526
Don't tell me you want me to steal stuff.

624
00:43:23,046 --> 00:43:26,006
I already did that, but it didn't work.

625
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:28,246
What else have you done?

626
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,606
When she lied to them that she had a debt,

627
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,966
they acted like mafias to trick us.

628
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:36,906
This time, let them meet a real mafia.

629
00:43:37,303 --> 00:43:38,646
- A real mafia?   - A real mafia?

630
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:39,766
Yes.

631
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:41,646
We'll rob their house this time.

632
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:43,286
- Rob a house?   - Rob a house?

633
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:48,726
Phuket.

634
00:43:49,606 --> 00:43:50,846
Yala.

635
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:52,806
Chiang Mai.

636
00:43:56,086 --> 00:43:57,486
You can begin.

637
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,950
You probably watched too many series.

638
00:44:05,094 --> 00:44:07,094
I won't do that. You're crazy.

639
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:08,606
Don't you want to be rich?

640
00:44:08,717 --> 00:44:10,566
I don't want to be in jail.

641
00:44:11,573 --> 00:44:13,646
We'll hire a professional thief.

642
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:15,246
They won't be caught.

643
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,926
Darling, I think this is too much.

644
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:22,126
How is it too much?

645
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,446
I don't know,

646
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,086
but I won't do anything with that plan.

647
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:29,126
If there's a robbery, they'll suspect me first.

648
00:44:29,805 --> 00:44:33,286
What if someone gets injured from that?

649
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:35,286
What would we do?

650
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,645
I won't do it. I'll never do it.

651
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:41,246
Mom.

652
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:43,686
Just stay poor, then.

653
00:44:47,046 --> 00:44:50,006
Darling, have you truly thought about this?

654
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:51,606
Yes.

655
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,946
But I think it's too risky.

656
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:57,246
Darling.

657
00:44:57,605 --> 00:44:59,126
How would we be rich if we don't take risks?

658
00:44:59,317 --> 00:45:00,966
If we get that money,

659
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,606
we'll get to live abroad quicker.

660
00:45:04,461 --> 00:45:06,646
Is there no other way?

661
00:45:07,902 --> 00:45:09,086
Darling,

662
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:10,398
when you're an employee,

663
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:12,406
you'll never be rich even if you work hard.

664
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,406
Also, didn't you want to get back at Apo?

665
00:45:19,013 --> 00:45:23,446
This is your chance to lead a better life than your younger sister.

666
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,197
Are you going to let it go?

667
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:33,326
Which one do you want?

668
00:45:54,966 --> 00:45:56,246
I'll zip it for you.

669
00:45:56,846 --> 00:45:57,966
No.

670
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:00,086
You can't do it.

671
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,526
No, I told you.

672
00:46:06,038 --> 00:46:07,606
Please be on standby.

673
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,406
It's almost time for the live stream.

674
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,366
Mom.

675
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:25,686
What's wrong with you? Why can't you stay still?

676
00:46:25,862 --> 00:46:27,366
There's nothing wrong with me.

677
00:46:36,846 --> 00:46:41,126
Ri, you're probably not going to do what your boyfriend told you, right?

678
00:46:41,286 --> 00:46:45,242
Mom, why are you saying it here? People will hear it.

679
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,369
Do you want coffee? Are you hungry?

680
00:46:50,654 --> 00:46:51,966
Have you remembered all the names?

681
00:46:52,165 --> 00:46:54,446
- Yes.   - Don't make any mistakes.

682
00:46:54,534 --> 00:46:55,646
Yes.

683
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,006
Om, get in position.

684
00:47:01,302 --> 00:47:02,406
You know how to use it, right?

685
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,486
- Yes.   - Everyone, get ready.

686
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:06,077
It's almost time.

687
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,006
What's with her?

688
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:11,221
Hello, everyone.

689
00:47:11,326 --> 00:47:13,606
Please hit the like button and share the stream.

690
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,486
Today, we'll show you a ton of products.

691
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:18,686
We have a lot of gems today.

692
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:22,486
We have every color and every type. We have small ones and big ones.

693
00:47:22,614 --> 00:47:25,406
I assure you they're pretty and cheap.

694
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,166
If you already shared the stream, please send in hearts as well.

695
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:34,774
I like you.

696
00:47:39,974 --> 00:47:41,326
Don't ask me how

697
00:47:41,454 --> 00:47:42,566
or when I like you.

698
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:43,966
I like you.

699
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:46,766
But if you're going to work with him to hurt my best friend,

700
00:47:48,246 --> 00:47:49,526
I'll have to stop here.

701
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:51,726
Stop it then.

702
00:47:53,406 --> 00:47:54,606
Go away.

703
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,325
We're out of gems today.

704
00:48:04,413 --> 00:48:06,335
Thank you, everyone,

705
00:48:06,446 --> 00:48:07,845
for ordering our gems.

706
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,966
I have to say goodbye for now. We'll see you in the next livestream.

707
00:48:11,086 --> 00:48:15,646
Right, there'll be new gems on Friday. It's going to be even better.

708
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:17,886
Goodbye.

709
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:24,406
I'm tired.

710
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:29,166
Drink some water.

711
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,366
I'm going to the toilet.

712
00:48:49,286 --> 00:48:50,606
Ri.

713
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:53,566
- We have to talk.   - We'll talk later, Mom.

714
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,006
Wait, Ri.

715
00:49:07,566 --> 00:49:08,806
- What?   - Here.

716
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,526
Aren't you going to the toilet?

717
00:49:10,941 --> 00:49:12,206
What's with you?

718
00:49:12,526 --> 00:49:13,806
I'm fine though?

719
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:15,886
You've been staring at me since earlier.

720
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:20,926
Just take it.

721
00:49:21,646 --> 00:49:22,886
What's this?

722
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:25,446
I only gave you a tissue paper. There's nothing more.

723
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:27,246
Can you stop acting weird?

724
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:28,926
Stop being nice to me.

725
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:30,366
I don't like it.

726
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,806
Why?

727
00:49:32,614 --> 00:49:35,286
Everyone likes it when other people are nice to them.

728
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:37,646
I don't like you being nice to me.

729
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:39,126
Don't do this.

730
00:49:41,086 --> 00:49:42,446
You feel guilty, don't you?

731
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:44,846
The more I'm nice to you,

732
00:49:44,927 --> 00:49:46,646
the more you feel guilty, don't you?

733
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:48,566
Why didn't you think before doing anything?

734
00:49:51,965 --> 00:49:53,166
Doing what?

735
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:10,006
I saw that

736
00:50:10,277 --> 00:50:12,406
you kissed on the CCTV.

737
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:18,046
Are you dating Game right now?

738
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:21,446
Who else saw it?

739
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:23,086
Only I saw it.

740
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,846
I didn't tell anyone.

741
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,646
You won't tell anyone, right?

742
00:50:28,565 --> 00:50:29,726
I don't know.

743
00:50:29,886 --> 00:50:31,606
It depends if you and Game

744
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:33,486
are planning something or not.

745
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,926
Game and I aren't planning anything.

746
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:38,806
Why didn't you tell me the truth then?

747
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,446
Ri,

748
00:50:42,868 --> 00:50:44,366
I've always thought

749
00:50:44,526 --> 00:50:46,686
that you didn't hate me.

750
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:49,166
You didn't hate me as much as Aunt Da, at least.

751
00:50:49,501 --> 00:50:50,886
But if you do this,

752
00:50:50,983 --> 00:50:52,902
you must surely hate me.

753
00:50:53,685 --> 00:50:55,526
You aren't any different from Aunt Da.

754
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:58,686
Yeah. I'm just like my mom.

755
00:50:58,966 --> 00:51:00,246
I'm no good.

756
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:01,966
Just curse me however you want.

757
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:03,526
What are you fighting about?

758
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:08,286
Ri, please stop. You're being loud. It's embarrassing.

759
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:10,046
I'm good for nothing.

760
00:51:10,388 --> 00:51:12,046
I can't be compared to you.

761
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:17,726
Aside from your debt, your life is already good.

762
00:51:18,213 --> 00:51:20,646
You're good at studying. You're doing good with your job.

763
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,830
Everyone likes you wherever you are.

764
00:51:25,413 --> 00:51:26,486
You know,

765
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:29,246
every time you said your life was bad,

766
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:31,725
do you know how I felt?

767
00:51:31,909 --> 00:51:35,606
I felt like my life was worse than yours.

768
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:38,454
I have nothing good.

769
00:51:42,806 --> 00:51:44,246
Who said you had nothing?

770
00:51:45,246 --> 00:51:47,246
Mom and Om always say that.

771
00:51:50,013 --> 00:51:51,846
I saw a lot of good things in you.

772
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,206
When you did the livestream,

773
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,366
you did really well.

774
00:52:01,837 --> 00:52:04,886
This is a green garnet.

775
00:52:04,983 --> 00:52:06,366
Here.

776
00:52:06,448 --> 00:52:09,096
As for this blue one,

777
00:52:09,177 --> 00:52:11,966
it's Blue London.

778
00:52:14,014 --> 00:52:16,926
As for the last one, it's the best one.

779
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:19,366
Everyone probably knows this.

780
00:52:19,454 --> 00:52:22,596
Here you are. It's so sparkling, isn't it?

781
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:24,806
This is yellow sapphire.

782
00:52:24,926 --> 00:52:28,286
You remember the name of every gem within one night.

783
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,660
You also have a nice smile

784
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:32,086
and a friendly face.

785
00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:33,806
You've charmed a lot of customers.

786
00:52:34,053 --> 00:52:36,966
Look at me. A kid would cry when they see my face.

787
00:52:39,046 --> 00:52:41,046
It's not just a kid.

788
00:52:41,566 --> 00:52:44,046
I also want to cry when I see your face.

789
00:52:49,903 --> 00:52:50,989
Thank you

790
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:54,486
for trying to praise me, but I'm just Rita.

791
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:56,606
You aren't just Rita.

792
00:52:57,286 --> 00:52:59,326
You're the Rita.

793
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:02,366
Remember this.

794
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,808
Everyone has their own good points.

795
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:08,046
Everyone can sparkle in their own ways.

796
00:53:15,204 --> 00:53:16,365
Aunt,

797
00:53:16,999 --> 00:53:19,926
state one good point about your daughter.

798
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:23,646
You too, bro.

799
00:53:25,846 --> 00:53:29,686
You know how to fold your own blanket in the morning.

800
00:53:29,926 --> 00:53:31,926
You're really great.

801
00:53:32,437 --> 00:53:34,406
You're a good enough sister for me.

802
00:53:35,606 --> 00:53:38,646
I know you're secretly following my channel.

803
00:53:38,964 --> 00:53:40,270
You know that?

804
00:53:43,806 --> 00:53:45,246
It's your turn.

805
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:49,726
Say one good point about yourself.

806
00:53:50,404 --> 00:53:51,566
Me?

807
00:53:52,766 --> 00:53:54,126
I...

808
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:59,246
I...

809
00:53:59,526 --> 00:54:00,846
You're charming.

810
00:54:01,294 --> 00:54:05,886
I think you're really charming, Ri.

811
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:09,726
I've always been jealous of you for that.

812
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:20,766
Ri.

813
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:23,166
I didn't know

814
00:54:23,604 --> 00:54:26,006
that I caused you to feel this bad.

815
00:54:27,406 --> 00:54:28,766
I'm sorry.

816
00:54:29,622 --> 00:54:31,846
Why would you apologize to me?

817
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:36,206
If you don't want to like me,

818
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:38,806
I understand.

819
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:41,126
It's not that I don't like you.

820
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:43,966
I'm just jealous of you.

821
00:54:44,686 --> 00:54:46,926
Whenever I think of hurting you,

822
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:49,509
I think of the moment when you took care of me while I was sick.

823
00:54:53,526 --> 00:54:55,006
Wait just a bit.

824
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:02,006
After I wipe you, I'll bring you porridge.

825
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:08,886
One, two, three.

826
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:11,766
Okay.

827
00:55:20,006 --> 00:55:23,126
I think of the moment when you brought me to my bed while I was drunk.

828
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,206
- I'll just stay here, Po.   - No.

829
00:55:26,317 --> 00:55:28,126
We'll go upstairs.

830
00:55:28,565 --> 00:55:29,846
Come here.

831
00:55:30,724 --> 00:55:34,806
Okay. Be careful. One, two, three.

832
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:37,046
Oh my. It's coming out.

833
00:55:39,598 --> 00:55:40,846
Swallow it.

834
00:55:42,935 --> 00:55:44,526
Oh my god. Okay.

835
00:55:46,896 --> 00:55:48,046
Just a little bit more.

836
00:55:48,142 --> 00:55:49,446
We're almost there.

837
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:54,206
I can't do it to you

838
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:58,086
because you've never been bad to me.

839
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:02,966
You're a really good

840
00:56:03,414 --> 00:56:05,326
younger sister to me.

841
00:56:05,526 --> 00:56:07,846
You've been good all your life.

842
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,006
When I know

843
00:56:12,213 --> 00:56:14,526
that you're jealous of me like this,

844
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,686
I'm getting crazy. What's going on?

845
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:40,726
I used to be jealous of you.

846
00:56:43,374 --> 00:56:47,286
Why would you be jealous of me? Are you crazy?

847
00:56:47,511 --> 00:56:49,286
You...

848
00:56:58,293 --> 00:56:59,486
Brother.

849
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,086
Brother.

850
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:10,086
Now...

851
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:14,566
Use it.

852
00:57:29,357 --> 00:57:30,966
This is already good enough.

853
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:46,086
Mueang has really grown a lot.

854
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:48,886
Where did he learn how to praise people?

855
00:57:49,141 --> 00:57:50,686
I don't think anyone here

856
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,526
knows how to praise others.

857
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:56,966
Well, just take a look at your actions first.

858
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:02,806
That's too much.

859
00:58:18,174 --> 00:58:19,406
Uncle Din, hello.

860
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:23,286
I have something to tell you.

861
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:26,806
If it's about Game, Ing has already called me.

862
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,086
Uncle Din.

863
00:58:29,669 --> 00:58:30,846
Hello.

864
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,046
What are you going to do, Uncle Din?

865
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:37,526
I'll handle it. You didn't have to come here.

866
00:58:37,671 --> 00:58:39,606
I'm here to apologize.

867
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:43,886
Game has contacted me for a few days. I told you too late.

868
00:58:44,526 --> 00:58:45,526
It's fine.

869
00:58:46,086 --> 00:58:48,746
If you want to know anything,

870
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,566
you can ask me directly.

871
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:52,286
You don't have to go through anyone.

872
00:58:52,566 --> 00:58:53,766
Understood.

873
00:58:54,606 --> 00:58:56,286
I have a meeting to attend.

874
00:58:56,406 --> 00:58:59,486
Tin, you should accompany her.

875
00:59:38,926 --> 00:59:40,646
Won't you say anything?

876
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,246
I'm glad,

877
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:46,246
but you should have realized it earlier.

878
00:59:47,229 --> 00:59:49,086
I think people can change,

879
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:53,086
but they don't easily change.

880
00:59:57,006 --> 00:59:58,246
I'm going back to my store.

881
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:00,486
Stay here and wait for Uncle Din.

882
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:04,126
Wait.

883
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:09,726
What's up?

884
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:20,846
Nothing.

885
01:00:21,182 --> 01:00:22,606
You can go.

886
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:50,846
Mueang.

887
01:00:51,765 --> 01:00:55,326
Is something the matter with Apo's family earlier?

888
01:00:56,269 --> 01:00:58,326
Yeah, but it's already over.

889
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:02,326
Good job.

890
01:01:07,629 --> 01:01:09,486
These few days that I wasn't here,

891
01:01:10,606 --> 01:01:14,506
you've handled everything nicely. Good job.

892
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:42,086
Remember this. Everyone has their own good points.

893
01:01:43,302 --> 01:01:45,606
Everyone can sparkle in their own ways.

894
01:02:03,462 --> 01:02:04,570
I'll start working here tomorrow.

895
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:06,326
Do you think I'll believe you?

896
01:02:07,206 --> 01:02:10,846
I want someone who can dedicate themselves to my business.

897
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,686
Since you don't care,

898
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,486
I don't have to beg you.

899
01:02:15,685 --> 01:02:16,926
Get out of here.

900
01:02:21,353 --> 01:02:23,246
These few days that I wasn't here,

901
01:02:23,862 --> 01:02:26,526
you've handled everything nicely.

902
01:02:26,878 --> 01:02:28,086
Good job.

903
01:02:46,205 --> 01:02:47,386
Mueang.

904
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,686
I'm getting rashes again.

905
01:02:57,526 --> 01:02:58,686
It's fine.

906
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:01,566
You don't have to turn to me.

907
01:03:01,902 --> 01:03:03,406
You can just listen to me.

908
01:03:04,486 --> 01:03:05,686
Okay.

909
01:03:07,694 --> 01:03:08,837
Well...

910
01:03:09,606 --> 01:03:10,966
Over the years,

911
01:03:11,486 --> 01:03:13,086
I have always hated myself.

912
01:03:16,062 --> 01:03:18,366
I hate my weakness.

913
01:03:21,286 --> 01:03:23,166
Aunt Da, it's me.

914
01:03:23,662 --> 01:03:25,662
I hate my sympathy.

915
01:03:27,085 --> 01:03:28,526
I hate my dullness.

916
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:31,926
But right now,

917
01:03:34,005 --> 01:03:36,646
I really like myself.

918
01:03:40,006 --> 01:03:42,086
I'm not just Apo.

919
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:46,086
I'm the Apo.

920
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:53,446
During all these times,

921
01:03:54,382 --> 01:03:56,166
I've never believed that

922
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:58,286
if you love yourself,

923
01:03:58,453 --> 01:04:00,453
love will come for you.

924
01:04:01,926 --> 01:04:03,166
But now,

925
01:04:03,366 --> 01:04:07,086
I believe that with all my heart.

926
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:16,446
Would you be my boyfriend?

927
01:04:44,424 --> 01:04:45,926
What did you say?

928
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,686
I didn't hear it.

929
01:04:53,397 --> 01:04:55,006
Would you be my boyfriend?

930
01:05:00,381 --> 01:05:01,686
Are you ready?

931
01:05:05,406 --> 01:05:06,646
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

932
01:05:08,806 --> 01:05:10,646
I want to have happiness with you.

933
01:05:11,485 --> 01:05:13,366
I want to enjoy every moment.

934
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,046
I don't want you to just come and go.

935
01:05:21,486 --> 01:05:22,646
Or...

936
01:05:23,806 --> 01:05:25,726
Are you not ready?

937
01:05:26,686 --> 01:05:27,846
I'm ready.

938
01:05:28,749 --> 01:05:30,206
I'm so ready.

939
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:33,486
I've been ready for all my life.

940
01:05:53,326 --> 01:05:54,686
Thank you.

941
01:06:11,374 --> 01:06:12,814
This is the first time

942
01:06:13,087 --> 01:06:15,126
someone has asked me to be their boyfriend.

943
01:06:17,614 --> 01:06:19,014
It feels so strange,

944
01:06:21,046 --> 01:06:22,446
but it's so good.

945
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:28,446
Din, Mueang. Do you know what happens?

946
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:31,966
- What?   - Our workers are gossiping

947
01:07:32,102 --> 01:07:34,526
about a dad and his son

948
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:36,486
having the same wife.

949
01:07:36,606 --> 01:07:39,286
They said Ms. Apo and Mr. Mueang...

950
01:07:40,062 --> 01:07:41,566
- Are you crazy?   - Mueang.

951
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,406
- Calm down.   - How could I stay calm?

952
01:07:44,486 --> 01:07:46,166
I don't like it when people talk badly of you.

953
01:07:46,254 --> 01:07:48,126
Have you thought it through

954
01:07:48,207 --> 01:07:50,486
when you decided to date only Mr. Mueang?

955
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:53,726
Although she seems neat and tidy,

956
01:07:53,846 --> 01:07:57,326
- I'd never think that she's...   - You!

957
01:07:57,446 --> 01:07:58,966
- Young Master.   - No.

958
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:01,326
Mueang, why did you take off your clothes?

959
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:05,126
You said you would do that for me.
