1
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:03,526
- Why are you here?   - Mr. Phudin sent me to learn about work in Bo Phloi.

2
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:06,526
Do you have only this much strength?

3
00:02:06,646 --> 00:02:09,169
(Ms. Stepmother, if you actually know him,)

4
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,726
(you'll realize there's nothing wrong with him at all.)

5
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:13,526
(He's just not good at communicating.)

6
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:15,006
(He only has goodwill.)

7
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:16,726
(He never has ill will for anyone.)

8
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,046
You're going in the wrong way.

9
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,126
The relationship between you two will only get worse.

10
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,326
(I know Mueang better than you.)

11
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:25,886
(How would you know)

12
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:27,974
(that you know Mueang the best?)

13
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:30,606
(There might be other things that you didn't know about.)

14
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:34,846
(From now on, I'll be the one to protect your dreams.)

15
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:37,926
Tomorrow morning, please come to the house.

16
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:40,166
I promise I won't waste your time.

17
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
I thought I was the only one meeting you here.

18
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:04,605
Why did you tell him to come here?

19
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:06,966
Calm down.

20
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:09,006
I want both of you guys

21
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,046
to talk nicely, please.

22
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:13,286
- I'm leaving.   - I'm leaving.

23
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,886
All I need is five minutes.

24
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,086
Please, Mueang.

25
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:23,326
Make it quick.

26
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:24,646
What do you want?

27
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:27,846
I think you two actually want to reconcile.

28
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:31,566
Who? Who would want to reconcile with the old man next door?

29
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:33,557
Who are you calling the old man next door?

30
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,086
I didn't mention any names.

31
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,726
Are you really my son?

32
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:39,926
Why are you nothing like me? Darn it!

33
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,246
You're the exact same!

34
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:46,406
- You're a bootleg version of me!   - You're a bootleg version of me!

35
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:48,366
Again, exactly the same.

36
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,446
Hey, please stop!

37
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:58,446
You scratched your butts with the exact same movement.

38
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,526
- Are we different now?   - Are we?

39
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,886
You are!

40
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:17,886
I think if you both try a little bit harder,

41
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:19,766
you would...

42
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:27,626
They don't even listen to me!

43
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:32,526
Listen, Apo. It's hard for me to talk to Mueang.

44
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:35,166
It's harder than making a monkey give birth to an egg.

45
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,606
Do you know why I'm sick of people?

46
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,606
It started with my dad.

47
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,766
I'm sure I've been a good dad.

48
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:47,446
A good dad? The dad who forgot his kid at the mall? How is that a good dad?

49
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:52,166
Yeah? So you've been a good son who never understands his parents?

50
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:54,406
Stop! Stop trying.

51
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:58,766
Apo.

52
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:01,566
I think you should find another way.

53
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,806
This is hard.

54
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,407
Boem, Poe, please help me.

55
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:20,006
Ms. Stepmother, if you need our help, just let us know.

56
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,725
We're always on your team.

57
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:23,686
We're ready to support you.

58
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,765
- Let me go!   - We're here!

59
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:29,660
- Come on!   - Let me go! Help!

60
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:33,126
- Did you pick him up just like that?   - We did! And we can't let go!

61
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:38,886
Ms. Stepmother, ask him if you want to know something. He knows everything.

62
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:43,366
Okay. Aum, since you've opened up to me about your young master,

63
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:45,166
please help me one more time.

64
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:48,326
I want Mr. Phudin and Mueang to do something,

65
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:50,926
but I don't know how to get both of them on board.

66
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:54,926
- Die!   - There's one way, ma'am.

67
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,286
Both Boss and Young Master don't like to lose.

68
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,726
Challenging them will probably work.

69
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:05,406
- Let me go!   - Stay still!

70
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:12,789
- Mr. Phudin.   - Yeah?

71
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:15,606
I heard you kidnapped Aum.

72
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:21,006
Mueang.

73
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,566
It's good you're here.

74
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,406
Now that you're both here,

75
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,286
I have a challenge for both of you.

76
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:32,046
I'd like to challenge you two to swap your life with another for a month.

77
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:39,046
Mr. Phudin will live Mueang's life.

78
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,966
Mueang will live Mr. Phudin's life.

79
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:46,006
This is the best way to make you guys understand each other.

80
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:48,726
That's playing like a child.

81
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,406
Who would want to switch with you?

82
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:54,566
Are you afraid to lose?

83
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:59,286
Living as the old man? How would that be difficult?

84
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:05,766
Living as Mueang? That's a piece of cake.

85
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:08,966
Then there's no reason to refuse

86
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,526
if you're not a coward.

87
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:16,846
- Challenge accepted! Bring it on!   - Challenge accepted! Bring it on!

88
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:27,726
Young Master, stop! Don't hurt yourself.

89
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:30,446
Aum! Do you know what's bigger than a titan?

90
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,326
I don't.

91
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:34,966
My ego!

92
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,606
That's really big.

93
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,326
I shouldn't have accepted her challenge!

94
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:48,446
Din, I need to talk to you about my store.

95
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:50,174
Get out if you don't want to get hurt!

96
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:51,566
Get out of here!

97
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:57,406
Young Master?

98
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,318
I can't fail. I can't lose.

99
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:07,133
I won't lose my face.

100
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,406
What?

101
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:11,645
Do you want to fight?

102
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:13,133
Bring it on!

103
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:25,046
To prevent confusion about your switching,

104
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,486
I've informed Mr. Phudin's employees

105
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,166
and Mueang's workers.

106
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,646
Both of you can get to work.

107
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:35,446
Okay. I'll be on my way.

108
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:37,046
So will I.

109
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:51,526
I can't believe it.

110
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,966
You actually got Din and Mueang to switch.

111
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:56,486
That's creative.

112
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:59,886
I binge-watched a lot of shows and never came up with that idea.

113
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:03,766
I'm just trying to find a way for Mr. Phudin and Mueang

114
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,166
to open up to each other.

115
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:07,686
I think it won't work.

116
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:10,838
Mr. Phudin and Mr. Mueang will run out of patience before that happens.

117
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:12,526
That's right.

118
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:16,686
- Prepare to accept failure.   - Prepare to accept failure.

119
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,309
Let's go.

120
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:33,686
Keep going, me! I'll do my best!

121
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:45,846
- What the...   - Beep!

122
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:51,046
You're censored. Don't swear. Please respect the place.

123
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:55,686
These are all the documents that Mr. Phudin has to sign.

124
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:58,086
You don't need to sign it. Just read through everything.

125
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:01,046
You will find out what Mr. Phudin does.

126
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,566
He has to sign documents all day long.

127
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:11,926
Doesn't he do anything else?

128
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:18,206
It's hot!

129
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:21,406
It's hot!

130
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:24,846
Do your best, Boss! Don't be afraid!

131
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:28,446
This is not the world of humans.

132
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,366
This is hell.

133
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:33,486
This is fricking hell!

134
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:39,606
- Do your best, Boss!   - Do your best, Boss!

135
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:42,246
- Do your best, Boss!   - Do your best, Boss!

136
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,606
It's so boring!

137
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,246
It's a waste of my time.

138
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,446
Mining crypto will make me richer than mining this!

139
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:00,166
What the heck is he doing here?

140
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:01,886
What are you doing?

141
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,566
Whoa!

142
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,086
Stop!

143
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:25,966
No, stop!

144
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:32,446
Mueang, we have to stay at least one meter apart.

145
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:34,686
- Stop that!   - Hey!

146
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:36,446
It's over.

147
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,726
Did you have fun pranking us?

148
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:45,686
This is not a prank.

149
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:47,806
What I did, I mean well.

150
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:49,206
You mean well?

151
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,886
I'm getting bored to death! I've got a huge pile of files!

152
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,526
You have to calm down and adapt.

153
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,766
You can talk. You're not the one doing it.

154
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,606
Are you giving up?

155
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:06,686
Mr. Phudin hasn't complained yet.

156
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:12,406
I didn't say I gave up.

157
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:14,646
Then do your best.

158
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:16,886
Do your best.

159
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:21,686
Hi! Hi, Ms. Apo.

160
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:25,166
Ms. Ing, are you here to see me?

161
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:26,846
No.

162
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:33,006
The only way you can get that necklace

163
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:35,982
is to have Mueang sell it to you.

164
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:37,806
I'm here to see Mueang.

165
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:45,166
Hey, give me your hand.

166
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:52,046
What?

167
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:54,206
Have lunch with me.

168
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:57,446
Are you trying to poison me?

169
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:59,446
Whoa! Come on!

170
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,846
I just thought we'd be working together for a while,

171
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,246
so it's better to get ourselves acquainted.

172
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:09,573
No!

173
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,086
Come on, Mueang.

174
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,406
Don't play hard to get.

175
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:21,726
What do you want? You're being weird.

176
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,326
Do you have a crush on me?

177
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:27,046
What if I do? Will you date me?

178
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:41,486
What are you doing here?

179
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,846
I'm waiting for Mrs. Sita.

180
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:49,886
I'm here to see Mueang.

181
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:52,526
He's up there, isn't he?

182
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:54,926
He is.

183
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:57,286
I won't.

184
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:59,806
You're not my type.

185
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:05,846
Wait! Hey, Mueang!

186
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,246
I said no! Why would you follow me? What's wrong with you?

187
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:11,646
- Where are you going?   - Tin!

188
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,646
You're late. I'm starving.

189
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,806
- Let's go.   - Why are you so hungry?

190
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:18,246
- What should we have today?   - What would you like?

191
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:25,326
Ms. Apo, why is Mueang working in Uncle Din's office?

192
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,206
What? Ms. Ing has a crush on you?

193
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:36,286
Yeah! She likes me, not Apo.

194
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:43,726
Your courage is a five,

195
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:47,046
but your confidence is a ten, bro. Nice!

196
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,606
Hey, I'm serious.

197
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:51,006
Why else would she ask me out?

198
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,366
I believe you, bro. Just pretend you don't understand.

199
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,606
She will stop when she's bored.

200
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:01,966
Just don't be too mean to her.

201
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,286
Hey, wait.

202
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:08,006
Why are you so nice to her?

203
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,046
You said you hated her.

204
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:14,926
When did I say that?

205
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:16,406
Whoa, man!

206
00:15:16,757 --> 00:15:18,326
Let's forget about her.

207
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,549
We should talk about you switching with Uncle Din.

208
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:22,206
What's got into you?

209
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:23,606
Tell me.

210
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,966
Mueang switched with Uncle Din?

211
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:30,766
Yeah.

212
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:38,926
Is it okay to tell me, though?

213
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,206
It's okay. It's not a secret.

214
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,206
So, can I join in?

215
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:46,646
Join in?

216
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,086
Yeah.

217
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,166
I want to see Mueang and Uncle Din reconcile too.

218
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,126
I'll do my best to help.

219
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:56,446
You want to get involved.

220
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,134
I'm ready.

221
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,206
How was your first day?

222
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,446
Old man.

223
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:13,126
Let me ask you this. You have projects all over the place.

224
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,207
Don't you want to have an inch of nature?

225
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:16,486
Why would I?

226
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:18,526
It's better to make money.

227
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:20,757
You should start thinking like I do.

228
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,486
If I leave everything as it is, when will we get rich?

229
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,166
How much money do you need to be rich?

230
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:27,926
A hundred million? A billion?

231
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:31,486
All we need is enough to pay our employees and make a living for ourselves.

232
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,886
That's it. Employees?

233
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:36,966
Why don't you use machines to save on labor?

234
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:38,526
Look at my mine.

235
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,886
I have only a few workers.

236
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:43,206
Your machines destroy the environment.

237
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:44,966
Which do you think is better?

238
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,486
- What?   - My way or Mueang's way.

239
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:55,277
Answer me honestly.

240
00:16:55,821 --> 00:17:00,766
Both of your ways have pros and cons.

241
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:04,286
Whoa! That's a Miss Universe's answer.

242
00:17:04,469 --> 00:17:05,806
It's true.

243
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:09,966
You know what? I'll give you time to think.

244
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,766
I'll ask you again later.

245
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,766
Think carefully. Me or Mueang.

246
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:40,486
Take this card. It's got an unlimited balance.

247
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:44,006
You're not trying to pay me to say you win, are you?

248
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:48,006
No, I don't have to bribe with this little challenge.

249
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:50,886
This! This is obviously a bribe!

250
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:55,806
I just thought you might want some new clothes.

251
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,406
Maybe you want a new pair of designer shoes,

252
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:00,501
a bag, or an acc...

253
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:02,126
Thank you,

254
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:04,086
but please don't think for me.

255
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,701
I think you should head to Bo Phloi.

256
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:10,406
Oh! Don't forget to water Mueang's plants.

257
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:20,086
The target

258
00:18:20,614 --> 00:18:22,326
cannot be bought.

259
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:26,526
This way, please, Boss.

260
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,966
Our next task is to water the plants.

261
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:37,446
- Water the plants?   - Yes.

262
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:39,086
Din!

263
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,606
I'll be helping you.

264
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:44,965
No need. Give it to me. I'll do it myself.

265
00:18:45,285 --> 00:18:46,486
Come on.

266
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:54,446
Please talk with the plants, Boss.

267
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:57,646
Are you mad? Why would I talk to them?

268
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:00,286
Young Master always talks to them.

269
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:02,246
Talks to the plants?

270
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,406
He does. When he was young

271
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:05,966
and felt lonely,

272
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,726
Young Master turned to plants

273
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:09,237
and made them his friends.

274
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:21,406
Guys.

275
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,766
What does Mueang talk to you about?

276
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,166
Do the plants talk?

277
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,406
- I didn't hear a thing.   - Oh!

278
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,286
How does he talk to them?

279
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:39,006
Talking is my expertise. Talking to myself is my specialty.

280
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:40,926
Move it, Din.

281
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,686
(Speaking gibberish)

282
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:48,806
This one looks like it's well-fed.

283
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,126
You have good photosynthesis. You're nice and green.

284
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,966
We understand each other

285
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:59,686
because we communicate with our hearts.

286
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:09,646
I haven't talked to Mueang so much that he has to talk to plants?

287
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,366
While The Maze project is on hold,

288
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:16,486
I'll pitch another project to Mr. Phudin. I'll give you a brief.

289
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,206
Okay, sis.

290
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,006
- There's a space that's way out...   - Knock-knock!

291
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,166
Are these foods for us?

292
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:29,726
You bought a lot!

293
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:33,926
Yeah. I saw how you guys always work overtime.

294
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:37,726
- Thank you, Brother Mueang.   - Thank you, Brother Mueang.

295
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:39,486
What? Wait!

296
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,725
Since when do you consider him your bro?

297
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:44,366
Since now, right?

298
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:46,606
Yeah.

299
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,846
- That's right.  - We'll leave these here, for now, sis. Let's eat later.

300
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:01,166
Don't eat without us!

301
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:07,646
Hey.

302
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:10,046
Are you trying to bribe the judges?

303
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:13,006
Do you want to make sure I pick you as the winner?

304
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:14,966
No!

305
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:16,926
I just thought they were probably hungry.

306
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:18,446
Don't do that!

307
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:21,926
Aren't you taking this challenge too seriously?

308
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:26,926
Also, both the dad and the son know how to bribe.

309
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:31,566
I'm not like him. Don't think I'm the same as my old man.

310
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:37,966
Look. You have to oversee the construction for Mr. Phudin today.

311
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,486
Why are you still here?

312
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:41,126
Do you

313
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:42,726
want to lose?

314
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,406
Do you? You're losing.

315
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:47,006
Get going.

316
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:08,006
Mr. Mueang, Mr. Phudin's employees are here to see you.

317
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:10,326
- Fine, bring them in.   - Okay.

318
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,686
Please come in.

319
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:21,886
- Young Master?   - Yes?

320
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:24,189
Has Boss contacted Master Bee?

321
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:25,730
Who's Master Bee?

322
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:27,550
The fortune teller who's been accurate.

323
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,742
A fortune teller?

324
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:31,726
My old man doesn't believe in this stuff, does he?

325
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:33,310
He didn't in the past,

326
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:35,526
but he has become so concerned for you.

327
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:38,086
What does it have to do with me?

328
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:43,118
Boss is afraid he'll die, so he wants to see the future.

329
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:46,286
He's concerned that when he's gone, will you be okay?

330
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:52,446
This guy is too much!

331
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:56,286
Tell him I'll be fine. Don't worry.

332
00:22:57,686 --> 00:23:00,406
- Okay!   - Leave. This is nonsense.

333
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:02,446
I'm not seeing any fortune tellers.

334
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:04,566
- Will this be okay?   - I don't know.

335
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:32,006
You know what? I'll give you time to think.

336
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:34,046
I'll ask you again later.

337
00:24:13,877 --> 00:24:15,166
(Think carefully.)

338
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:17,926
(Me or Mueang.)

339
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:12,653
You're clumsy.

340
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:21,566
Next time, use this

341
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,406
so you won't waste paper.

342
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:38,886
Not going home yet?

343
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:41,126
I need to read some more things.

344
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:43,166
I'll be in this room with you.

345
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:45,006
We need to save on electricity.

346
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:31,126
Am I handsome?

347
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:34,726
What are you asking?

348
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,246
You've been staring at me.

349
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:43,326
Am I your type?

350
00:26:51,774 --> 00:26:53,726
Where did that confidence come from?

351
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:57,286
Are you my type? No.

352
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,237
Never ever!

353
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:23,501
Ms. Apo, do you have a type?

354
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:27,406
My type?

355
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,914
- Aum, show me how.   - Bend down, Young Master.

356
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:35,380
- A bit harder. It's not easy, Young Master.   - Harder?

357
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:37,952
- Yeah. That's good.   - Harder, Young Master. Keep it tight.

358
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:40,359
- Yeah! Use your waist!  - Is this it?

359
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:42,326
- Young Master, you got it!   - Is this right?

360
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:44,085
Are you ready, Young Master?

361
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,046
(A funny)

362
00:28:05,021 --> 00:28:07,323
(and sexy guy.)

363
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:25,806
So, do you have a type?

364
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:28,926
I don't.

365
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,326
Not at all?

366
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,726
I really don't.

367
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:38,086
Once I grew up, I didn't really have a type. Just someone who understands.

368
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:40,685
Why did you ask?

369
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:43,686
I didn't mean your type for a boyfriend.

370
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,526
I meant the type of plants you like.

371
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:51,006
You want some plants for your desk, don't you?

372
00:28:52,224 --> 00:28:53,726
I do.

373
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:58,366
Why did you say type? It's confusing.

374
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:01,086
Choosing plants is like choosing a partner.

375
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,686
It's totally different.

376
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,246
Okay. It's different.

377
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,206
I'm sorry for using the wrong word.

378
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:09,726
What you said

379
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,446
triggered my curiosity.

380
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:13,446
What kind of guys do you like?

381
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:28,086
That's more like it.

382
00:29:41,838 --> 00:29:43,246
You spooked me!

383
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,554
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:47,166
I don't forgive you. I'm two million percent sure.

385
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,846
You needed to talk to me. What is it?

386
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:01,326
Please sit down.

387
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:14,493
Last night, I checked last year's revenue.

388
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:17,646
Since when have we been suffering losses?

389
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:19,966
Let me ask you this first.

390
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:22,486
What are your boundaries for this switch?

391
00:30:24,086 --> 00:30:25,886
We're just learning each other's lives.

392
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:29,686
The power and decision remain the same in each of our own jobs.

393
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:31,006
Okay.

394
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:33,286
Then I can tell you this.

395
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:37,606
Phudin Park might be closing down.

396
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:50,806
(I know Phudin Park is not as important as Bo Phloi to you,)

397
00:30:51,022 --> 00:30:53,606
(but this place is your dad's life work.)

398
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,853
(He's trying to hold on to it.)

399
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:57,926
(He's barely hanging on, though.)

400
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,286
Mueang, if you want to ride an elephant, ride me first.

401
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:02,926
- Let's go!   - Come on. Turn around.

402
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,209
Are you ready? One, two, three!

403
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:07,846
- Are you okay, Din? Be careful!   - Whoa!

404
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:09,501
Don't fall off!

405
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:11,485
- Be careful!   - Left and right!

406
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:14,446
Forward and back.

407
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,246
Be careful, son!

408
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:26,566
(Even if it's closed down,)

409
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:28,966
(you wouldn't feel a thing, would you?)

410
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,206
Go and help out.

411
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:44,926
- Son.   - Yes?

412
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:49,166
Although Bo Phloi is closing down,

413
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:52,406
I'm not leaving you guys behind. You know that, right?

414
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:54,526
We know, Boss.

415
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:56,406
What are you afraid of then?

416
00:31:57,254 --> 00:32:00,326
I'll still get to work at Phudin Park,

417
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,886
but for those other guys,

418
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,246
the jobs you offer

419
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,886
are out of reach for some of them.

420
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:12,446
Those who didn't graduate will have to leave and work low-paying jobs.

421
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:14,446
All of us right now

422
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,646
are making a good living with Young Master.

423
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:19,126
He even gives us sick days off.

424
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:23,326
It doesn't mean I won't take care of you guys.

425
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:26,366
Well, Boss.

426
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:29,806
It's unfair if you're the only one taking care of us.

427
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:32,606
We all want to make ourselves useful.

428
00:32:32,766 --> 00:32:35,086
We all want to take care of both of you together.

429
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:37,366
But

430
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:40,126
if you really have to close it down,

431
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:42,486
we all understand, Boss.

432
00:32:56,854 --> 00:32:59,326
- Let's go.   - Sorry!

433
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,006
It's fine.

434
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:14,046
These are all must-read for you, Mr. Mueang.

435
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:16,246
All of this?

436
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:19,326
This is not all. You have two more batches coming tomorrow.

437
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,326
- There's more?   - Yes. You'll get it tomorrow.

438
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:24,006
Whoa. This...

439
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:27,806
I'll just take this for now.

440
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:29,406
Okay, Mr. Mueang.

441
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:30,446
(Ms. Apo, do you have a type?)

442
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,086
Hold the file.

443
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:46,166
Look at it after I walk away.

444
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:32,006
Hi, Ms. Apo. Go get dressed up!

445
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:37,566
Ms. Ing, how did you know we're doing an exercise?

446
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:39,526
Aunt Wi told me.

447
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:42,726
She said from now on, everyone has to gather in the afternoon.

448
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,486
It's to improve the relationship between Uncle Din and Mueang, right?

449
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:48,646
Yeah.

450
00:35:48,886 --> 00:35:52,046
Can I join you, please? Pretty please.

451
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:54,246
Okay. You're welcome to join, Ms. Ing.

452
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:57,526
Yay! Come on, Ms. Apo. Let's rehearse.

453
00:35:57,886 --> 00:35:59,086
Come on.

454
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:03,806
Why are you here? Who called you?

455
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,486
I invited him.

456
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,366
Oh, okay.

457
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:17,957
If we want Mueang and Uncle Din to reconcile quickly,

458
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:22,086
we need to bring back the old atmosphere from when they were happy. Agree?

459
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,726
I agree. We can bring back the good memories.

460
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:31,079
I remember. I came over to his house as a child.

461
00:36:31,278 --> 00:36:34,166
They did group activities. They were very cute.

462
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:45,246
For a healthy relationship in the family.

463
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:48,446
Healthy relationship!

464
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:55,566
- Fight!   - Fight!

465
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:08,766
Pathetic.

466
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:13,246
Look at you. You're a woman in her 20s.

467
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:17,086
You're bold to lead.

468
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,126
Okay, everyone.

469
00:37:23,301 --> 00:37:25,126
Let's get ourselves warmed up.

470
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:28,006
Let's start with our heads. Move your head around.

471
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:30,446
Okay. Next is the shoulders.

472
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:32,566
Swing your arms.

473
00:37:32,828 --> 00:37:38,686
Shake your waist. Yeah, shake it! Now, legs!

474
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:43,046
Thank you so much for coming today, everybody.

475
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:45,806
I think it's really nice that we meet every afternoon.

476
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:48,526
Maybe we can talk more.

477
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,966
It's good for your health.

478
00:37:57,404 --> 00:37:59,126
Ms. Apo, you're awesome.

479
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:00,246
So

480
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:02,495
let's get started.

481
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:10,926
- Hi. This is Bebe's Fit Routine...   - Bebe?

482
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:15,006
Are you ready, guys?

483
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,414
Let's go!

484
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:34,726
Let's go, guys!

485
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:37,846
Jump up! Jump and bounce!

486
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:15,686
- Are you alright?   - Give me a break.

487
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,046
Punch!

488
00:39:33,478 --> 00:39:36,238
The world is not fair!

489
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:38,726
Bebe still looks fine after this workout.

490
00:39:38,886 --> 00:39:40,326
Ms. Apo.

491
00:39:40,566 --> 00:39:44,966
I think this is too brutal to invoke nostalgia.

492
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:49,486
Right now, I'm thinking of my next life.

493
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:51,206
Next life,

494
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:54,806
I wish it didn't exist. I'm tired.

495
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,046
The equipment you need is here.

496
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,434
Don't forget what we talked about.

497
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:10,086
When Mueang and Uncle Din reconcile,

498
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:12,886
tell them they have me to thank too.

499
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:18,886
The next activity

500
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:22,566
is the hula hoop. Guys, shake it!

501
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:23,926
Let's go!

502
00:40:24,126 --> 00:40:25,366
Okay.

503
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,486
Can you do it, sweetie?

504
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:38,722
- Come on, Mueang.   - One, two, three.

505
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:40,030
Shake it, Din.

506
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:46,846
- Shake as hard as you can. Are you ready?   - Bring it.

507
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:27,205
Stop!

508
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:36,622
I know what you're trying to do.

509
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:44,606
Don't do this again.

510
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:49,166
Young Master?

511
00:41:58,446 --> 00:41:59,766
Din?

512
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,566
I told you it won't work.

513
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:17,806
Wait, Mueang.

514
00:42:22,934 --> 00:42:25,406
You still blame me, don't you?

515
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:33,166
I told you. Before your mom passed away,

516
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:34,486
your mom and I

517
00:42:34,606 --> 00:42:36,086
had already cleared everything up.

518
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,046
We agreed to divorce.

519
00:42:38,286 --> 00:42:40,166
If we had tried to drag it on,

520
00:42:40,646 --> 00:42:42,366
it wouldn't have been good for you.

521
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,486
I'm sorry for everything.

522
00:42:48,486 --> 00:42:50,166
I'm sorry too.

523
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,366
Have a safe travel.

524
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:00,886
Thanks.

525
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:04,926
So

526
00:43:05,526 --> 00:43:08,846
when I come back, we'll file the divorce.

527
00:43:11,446 --> 00:43:12,766
I have to go.

528
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,446
Okay.

529
00:43:26,766 --> 00:43:28,126
Be back soon, Mom.

530
00:43:28,246 --> 00:43:29,526
I'll miss you.

531
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:31,486
I'll be back soon.

532
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:47,606
Do you still don't understand?

533
00:43:51,925 --> 00:43:53,925
I've never blamed you for Mom's death.

534
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:56,606
However, after she passed away,

535
00:43:56,877 --> 00:43:59,046
have you ever been a good father to me?

536
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,006
When I needed you,

537
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:07,726
where were you?

538
00:45:12,966 --> 00:45:15,006
(I've never blamed you for Mom's death.)

539
00:45:15,806 --> 00:45:17,486
(However, after she passed away,)

540
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,726
(have you ever been a good father to me?)

541
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,046
(You still blame me, don't you?)

542
00:45:23,248 --> 00:45:26,326
(I told you. Before your mom passed away,)

543
00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:29,566
(your mom and I had already cleared everything up.)

544
00:45:31,926 --> 00:45:33,406
(When I needed you,)

545
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:35,646
(where were you?)

546
00:45:44,086 --> 00:45:45,846
(We agreed to divorce.)

547
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,166
(If we had tried to drag it on,)

548
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:50,806
(it wouldn't have been good for you.)

549
00:46:46,406 --> 00:46:48,126
You didn't sleep, did you?

550
00:46:54,861 --> 00:46:56,206
Thank you.

551
00:46:59,046 --> 00:47:01,446
I didn't come last night.

552
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,246
I thought you needed some time alone.

553
00:47:05,886 --> 00:47:09,526
I got to think about a lot of things.

554
00:47:10,717 --> 00:47:14,246
I said I knew Mueang well.

555
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:17,766
It was all in my head.

556
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:22,006
The movies he liked,

557
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,526
the music he liked,

558
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,486
the girl he had a crush on,

559
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:31,646
I never knew any of that.

560
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:37,766
Then, you can use this time

561
00:47:38,206 --> 00:47:40,686
to get to know all about Mueang.

562
00:47:44,286 --> 00:47:45,646
Yeah.

563
00:47:56,326 --> 00:48:00,886
- Nut. Check the packages and send some photos to the buyers.   - Yes?

564
00:48:00,974 --> 00:48:03,439
- Okay.   - Handle them with care when you ship them.

565
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:05,086
- I'm counting on you.   - Okay.

566
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,086
- Surprise!   - Surprise!

567
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:18,886
Dad, Mom, why are you here?

568
00:48:28,046 --> 00:48:29,166
Do you like her?

569
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:31,886
If you do, swipe right. If you don't, swipe left.

570
00:48:32,086 --> 00:48:34,006
Whoa. What are you doing?

571
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,846
This is not a dating app.

572
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,486
What about this one?

573
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:42,206
Stop. That's enough.

574
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:45,606
You guys said you wouldn't force me again in this life.

575
00:48:46,286 --> 00:48:48,206
You're too slow.

576
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:53,206
Did I give you too much freedom, TinTin?

577
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:54,766
I'm good.

578
00:48:55,166 --> 00:49:00,806
TinTin, your dad and I are worried you'll be alone when you're old.

579
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:04,406
Dad, Mom, don't worry.

580
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:06,049
I talked to Mueang about this.

581
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,646
If we don't have anyone when we're old, we'll get a nursing home.

582
00:49:09,765 --> 00:49:11,206
My gosh!

583
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:15,326
Stop and leave. Go home. I need to pack my shipment.

584
00:49:15,734 --> 00:49:17,086
What about this one?

585
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,566
How is she on the list?

586
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,213
Ever since you were a kid,

587
00:49:24,325 --> 00:49:29,006
this style of women has been your favorite, right?

588
00:49:29,206 --> 00:49:30,486
Right.

589
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:34,486
Don't know me too much.

590
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:38,926
Honey, that means this one has a chance.

591
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:43,510
Is that right?

592
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:49,246
- Admit it.   - Whoa!

593
00:49:49,348 --> 00:49:50,566
I'm going out.

594
00:49:57,653 --> 00:49:58,933
Young Master.

595
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:01,526
Are you all right?

596
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,190
Young Master?

597
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,126
Young Master?

598
00:50:12,925 --> 00:50:14,446
Young Master!

599
00:50:15,206 --> 00:50:17,006
Young Master won't see anyone today.

600
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:18,966
Wait.

601
00:50:19,886 --> 00:50:22,966
He called in sick, so I came to check him out.

602
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:25,902
Well, he's in a bad shape.

603
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:31,486
Aum!

604
00:50:31,885 --> 00:50:33,366
Is it done?

605
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,206
I've been waiting.

606
00:50:49,357 --> 00:50:52,406
What's so funny? You're a bully.

607
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:54,286
Sorry.

608
00:50:58,758 --> 00:51:00,126
I'm ugly, right?

609
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,806
You're not. You're kind of cute.

610
00:51:06,445 --> 00:51:07,926
That's so fake.

611
00:51:08,286 --> 00:51:09,486
Go back to where you come from.

612
00:51:12,046 --> 00:51:13,366
Before you go,

613
00:51:13,606 --> 00:51:15,046
please look for Aum.

614
00:51:15,549 --> 00:51:18,326
Aum headed out to buy your medicine. It has run out.

615
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:23,726
You need to get up and eat. When Aum gets back, you'll take your pills.

616
00:51:26,773 --> 00:51:27,990
Get up.

617
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,926
Go back already.

618
00:51:53,374 --> 00:51:55,766
It's not serious. I'll be fine tomorrow.

619
00:51:57,792 --> 00:51:59,086
I will.

620
00:52:04,478 --> 00:52:05,966
Did Aum buy this?

621
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:09,166
No, I ordered it.

622
00:52:11,701 --> 00:52:14,166
Why didn't you get the beansprouts?

623
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:17,606
You don't eat it, do you?

624
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:19,566
How did you know?

625
00:52:20,406 --> 00:52:21,806
I remember.

626
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,406
I said no beansprouts.

627
00:52:55,326 --> 00:52:56,726
Eat up.

628
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:04,086
I bought two, just in case.

629
00:53:04,702 --> 00:53:06,325
There's also Lod Chong

630
00:53:06,453 --> 00:53:09,086
and muskmelon with lots of coconut milk, your favorite.

631
00:53:19,246 --> 00:53:20,502
Look.

632
00:53:21,246 --> 00:53:22,606
About yesterday,

633
00:53:23,597 --> 00:53:25,126
I'm sorry.

634
00:53:25,366 --> 00:53:27,806
I didn't mean for it to turn out that way.

635
00:53:31,566 --> 00:53:32,846
Forget it.

636
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:34,806
What's done is done.

637
00:53:36,685 --> 00:53:38,046
From now on,

638
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:41,446
I won't do anything without making sure I know what I'm doing.

639
00:53:44,542 --> 00:53:45,886
I promise.

640
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:01,846
Don't look.

641
00:54:09,174 --> 00:54:10,606
Is it good?

642
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:38,046
Let me eat with you.

643
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:39,726
I'm hungry.

644
00:54:59,416 --> 00:55:00,966
Thanks.

645
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:12,726
Don't look.

646
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,726
You're looking at me.

647
00:55:15,726 --> 00:55:17,166
I'm not.

648
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:05,286
Don't scratch!

649
00:56:05,775 --> 00:56:07,326
Don't scratch.

650
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,206
Hey! I said don't scratch! Stop right now.

651
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,246
It's too itchy. What am I supposed to do?

652
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:23,166
Stop! Enough already.

653
00:56:24,813 --> 00:56:27,246
Stop! That's enough.

654
00:56:28,086 --> 00:56:29,246
Stop!

655
00:56:30,462 --> 00:56:32,606
You're almost bleeding all over.

656
00:56:34,274 --> 00:56:35,654
Look.

657
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,806
Look. See?

658
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:40,726
You scratched all over your neck, the back of your neck.

659
00:56:40,846 --> 00:56:42,646
It's spread to your forehead.

660
00:56:42,845 --> 00:56:45,006
Don't scratch. Stop.

661
00:56:49,254 --> 00:56:50,734
Why are you taking care of me?

662
00:56:54,326 --> 00:56:55,766
Are you free?

663
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:00,286
I'm not.

664
00:57:01,366 --> 00:57:02,846
So why are you doing it?

665
00:57:08,862 --> 00:57:10,206
Do you

666
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:14,166
care about me?

667
00:57:42,886 --> 00:57:44,326
I care.

668
00:58:16,664 --> 00:58:19,966
Aum's here. Make sure you take your pills.

669
00:59:36,646 --> 00:59:38,846
(I don't know when it started)

670
00:59:39,988 --> 00:59:42,366
(but when I noticed...)

671
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,326
(You said you're not using your phone.)

672
00:59:53,544 --> 00:59:56,366
(You're a social media addict. Delete it.)

673
00:59:56,573 --> 00:59:58,006
(Did you delete it?)

674
01:00:04,328 --> 01:00:05,686
(You said you're not using your phone.)

675
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:07,406
(You're a social media addict.)

676
01:00:07,487 --> 01:00:09,535
(Delete it. Did you delete it?)

677
01:00:37,015 --> 01:00:38,015
(Delete - Restore)

678
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:40,326
(Restore)

679
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,846
(I found myself often watching my story of him.)

680
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,006
(And)

681
01:00:47,206 --> 01:00:49,966
(I keep thinking about the nice things he did for me.)

682
01:00:51,086 --> 01:00:52,646
I don't want to go, Mueang.

683
01:00:54,046 --> 01:00:56,966
Why? Are you embarrassed your new boyfriend is old?

684
01:00:57,526 --> 01:00:59,646
You said it was your life choice. Why would you be embarrassed?

685
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:03,086
The one who should be embarrassed is your ex.

686
01:01:03,454 --> 01:01:04,606
Let's show him

687
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,366
how much your life is better than when you were with him!

688
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,086
Leave my house now!

689
01:01:30,662 --> 01:01:32,046
Let go.

690
01:01:53,194 --> 01:01:55,174
How did it come to this?

691
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:18,406
- Son.   - Yes?

692
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,526
Has Mueang ever brought a girl over?

693
01:02:20,622 --> 01:02:21,846
No, sir.

694
01:02:22,646 --> 01:02:23,886
Really?

695
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:25,286
Yeah.

696
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:28,166
Young Master never introduced us to any of his girlfriends.

697
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,326
Why don't you try asking Aum?

698
01:02:31,463 --> 01:02:33,326
He knows a lot more than I do.

699
01:02:34,954 --> 01:02:39,286
Aum won't talk. Mueang must have told him to say nothing.

700
01:02:40,086 --> 01:02:42,286
As his father,

701
01:02:42,373 --> 01:02:45,766
I want to know what kind of girls he likes.

702
01:02:46,246 --> 01:02:47,446
Do you know about that?

703
01:02:47,605 --> 01:02:50,406
I know a little bit about that.

704
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,366
This is the one. She's his type.

705
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:06,046
Whoa! Did he attend a net idol's Meet and Greet?

706
01:03:07,197 --> 01:03:10,006
I heard Young Master talk to Tin.

707
01:03:10,143 --> 01:03:12,766
Young Master goes to every event of hers.

708
01:03:16,518 --> 01:03:18,989
Mueang likes a halfling?

709
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,206
He does.

710
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:22,606
Every time he meets a girl like this,

711
01:03:22,702 --> 01:03:25,126
he always loses control.

712
01:03:29,446 --> 01:03:30,606
Every time.

713
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:44,366
Stop scratching! Will you stop or not?

714
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,326
Stop scratching. You're going to ruin your face.

715
01:03:46,979 --> 01:03:48,886
- Okay. I'll stop.   - Are you tapping out?

716
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:50,486
I'm tapping out.

717
01:03:52,317 --> 01:03:53,686
You're going to ruin your face.

718
01:03:53,846 --> 01:03:56,806
Tin, did Aum tell you?

719
01:03:58,526 --> 01:03:59,846
Have you eaten?

720
01:04:00,389 --> 01:04:01,646
I have.

721
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:03,206
Apo brought me a meal.

722
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:05,766
Ms. Apo did?

723
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:11,686
Come to think of it,

724
01:04:12,406 --> 01:04:14,886
Uncle Din and Ms. Apo are indeed strange, as you said.

725
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:17,646
I told you they're strange.

726
01:04:18,067 --> 01:04:20,526
You told me they sleep in separate rooms.

727
01:04:21,406 --> 01:04:22,566
Right!

728
01:04:22,686 --> 01:04:24,846
They probably still think they had me fooled,

729
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:28,686
but I know that Apo's room is connected to the other room.

730
01:04:28,926 --> 01:04:30,566
I ran all over that house as a kid.

731
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:34,646
I saw my old man come out of that room early in the morning.

732
01:04:37,598 --> 01:04:40,206
It's true that I don't believe in their fake marriage,

733
01:04:40,614 --> 01:04:43,126
but Apo is still my dad's fiancée.

734
01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:47,806
What do you think Ms. Apo and Uncle Din are planning?

735
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:53,766
I don't think it's just a marriage to pay off her debt.

736
01:05:11,422 --> 01:05:12,926
I'm trying to figure it out.

737
01:05:13,766 --> 01:05:18,086
At first, I thought my old man brought her in to get me to work for him.

738
01:05:18,446 --> 01:05:21,606
But she's trying to get you and Uncle Din to reconcile.

739
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:24,566
I think there's more to it.

740
01:05:25,726 --> 01:05:29,206
There must be some important reasons. That's why Apo can't say the truth.

741
01:05:30,413 --> 01:05:31,766
But what are they?

742
01:05:32,126 --> 01:05:35,006
What are those reasons? Why is it so confusing?

743
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:36,686
I don't like this!

744
01:05:36,782 --> 01:05:39,086
Please don't get things more complicated.

745
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:41,486
- My head hurts so much already.   - Mueang!

746
01:05:54,908 --> 01:05:56,453
I'm going to start.

747
01:06:00,486 --> 01:06:01,686
What?

748
01:06:18,327 --> 01:06:21,846
(Just when I thought things couldn't get more complicated,)

749
01:06:26,006 --> 01:06:27,926
(things get even more complicated!)

750
01:06:28,046 --> 01:06:29,646
It's Apo.

751
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:39,366
Sorry. I...

752
01:06:40,654 --> 01:06:42,174
I'm here to get my purse.

753
01:06:44,661 --> 01:06:46,846
- Apo! Let me go!   - Mueang!

754
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:48,966
What the heck are you doing?

755
01:06:49,062 --> 01:06:51,486
I'm here to let you know.

756
01:06:52,286 --> 01:06:54,606
- Let me know what?   - I'm going to hit on you.

757
01:06:57,142 --> 01:06:59,286
I didn't mean to spy on you. I'm leaving.

758
01:06:59,367 --> 01:07:00,686
Don't go anywhere.

759
01:07:01,174 --> 01:07:03,966
She says it out loud. She wants all of us to hear it.

760
01:07:04,341 --> 01:07:06,166
That's right. I've got nothing to hide.

761
01:07:06,374 --> 01:07:07,886
I already rejected you.

762
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,646
I don't like you. Leave me alone.

763
01:07:10,206 --> 01:07:12,286
All men say that at first.

764
01:07:15,021 --> 01:07:17,286
Mueang, what's wrong with your face?

765
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:19,406
Ew! Does it spread?

766
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:22,126
Ew! I touched you a lot.

767
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,606
Clean it up!

768
01:07:24,886 --> 01:07:27,446
- Does that spread?   - Are you trying to kill me?

769
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,406
I'll be back, okay?

770
01:07:30,566 --> 01:07:32,646
I'm surely hitting on you, okay?

771
01:07:52,886 --> 01:07:54,486
Do you have anything to tell me?

772
01:07:54,774 --> 01:07:56,046
I don't.

773
01:07:56,127 --> 01:07:59,406
Why don't you ask Mr. Mueang and Ms. Apo themselves?

774
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:03,286
If it's that simple, they wouldn't have kept quiet until now.

775
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:06,006
If you insist that I do this,

776
01:08:06,814 --> 01:08:09,606
I'll have to find another way to pay off my debt.

777
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:12,126
Are you asking me to change the deal?

778
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:14,046
Is that Mueang's girlfriend?

779
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,566
Who are you talking about?

780
01:08:15,647 --> 01:08:18,886
The cute girl who owns a jewelry brand.

781
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:23,366
Apparently, she's having lunch with Mueang in the cafeteria.

782
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:25,126
I just want to let you know I'm not dating Ing.

783
01:08:25,246 --> 01:08:30,686
(All I know is from this moment on, my heartbeat)

784
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:33,006
(will never be the same.)
