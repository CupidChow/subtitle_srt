1
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:15,966
Wait.

2
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:20,126
(Hi. My name is Mueang.)

3
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,886
(I need your advice on something.)

4
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,286
(The thing is,)

5
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,486
(I like this girl.)

6
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:29,686
(But I don't know who she is, where she's from,)

7
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:32,566
(or how old she is. I don't know anything.)

8
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,166
(You might think I'm crazy, but don't judge me)

9
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:38,966
(until you know the whole story.)

10
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:45,006
(Seven days ago,)

11
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:47,446
(that was the day I first met her.)

12
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:08,926
Hey! Someone's drowning!

13
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,406
(That's how I met her.)

14
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,486
(Of course, it wasn't love at first sight.)

15
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,206
(It was chaotic.)

16
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:59,526
Are you alright?

17
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,366
Did you get cramps?

18
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,686
I did not.

19
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,926
(Okay. In short,)

20
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,526
(she's a novice surfer, not an expert.)

21
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:27,366
Thank you.

22
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:28,646
If it weren't for you,

23
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:30,726
I would have died there.

24
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:35,341
Yeah. Quit this if you don't want to die. It's dangerous.

25
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:37,646
You might not die alone. Someone might die trying to save you.

26
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:39,766
You're lucky your surfboard didn't hit anyone.

27
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:42,700
When you fall, don't kick the board, okay?

28
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,606
Wear your harness tightly on your legs too.

29
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,086
Didn't your instructor teach you?

30
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:49,606
Why did it come off?

31
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:52,286
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:57,006
If you're new, surf in shallow waters. The waves are hard where it's deep.

33
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,148
Understand?

34
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:00,686
Understood, sir.

35
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:02,126
Are you okay now?

36
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:08,326
Show me how you stand on the board.

37
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,406
Come on.

38
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,166
I want to see if you know how to do it.

39
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,046
Stand right here.

40
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,180
Get up on my count.

41
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,926
- Okay.   - One, two, three!

42
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:23,244
Again.

43
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,630
Come on. Get up.

44
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:42,886
I'll teach you from the start.

45
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:44,726
You will start over.

46
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:46,726
(All I thought was)

47
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:49,233
(I needed to do my part as a former surfboard instructor.)

48
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:51,766
Let's start all over. Warm-up.

49
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:53,926
(I just couldn't help)

50
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,686
(but volunteer to teach her.)

51
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:58,846
(I don't want her to become a ghost of the sea.)

52
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,366
What's wrong? Come on. Do as I do.

53
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,581
I'll show you first.

54
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:13,246
Lie down on the board. Balance yourself. Look straight.

55
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:14,846
Keep your feet well aligned.

56
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:16,046
One!

57
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:17,886
Two!

58
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:20,726
Three! And then, four!

59
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,046
One!

60
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:23,246
Two!

61
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:24,597
Three!

62
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:25,782
Four!

63
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,366
Bend your knees down, or you'll lose balance.

64
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:30,206
See?

65
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:34,526
Is that good? Step over here.

66
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:36,726
Again. One!

67
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:38,086
Two!

68
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:39,933
Three!

69
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,333
Four!

70
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,806
That's better.

71
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:45,373
Ready?

72
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:47,206
- I am.   - To the waters!

73
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:51,406
Wear your harness tightly. It won't come off.

74
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,726
Is it tight now?

75
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:10,966
Again!

76
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:36,246
Nice!

77
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,606
Whoa! That was awesome!

78
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:54,366
Look, when you learn to catch the waves, it will be even more fun.

79
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,486
Thanks for teaching me.

80
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:01,086
Do you remember what I taught you? Show me.

81
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:05,606
Always plan before surfing. Check your equipment.

82
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:06,966
Don't take too much risk.

83
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:09,806
Whoa! You have a good memory.

84
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:14,221
Thank you so much, Mr...

85
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:17,566
You're...

86
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:20,886
(I forgot I haven't told her my name.)

87
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:22,697
I'm Mueang.

88
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:24,017
Mueang.

89
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:27,206
And you?

90
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:35,046
Did you drink so much of the sea that you forgot your name?

91
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:38,726
I'm View.

92
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,846
View.

93
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,846
(She said her name was View.)

94
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:55,846
(Maybe I do know something.)

95
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:59,126
(At least, I know what she goes by.)

96
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:02,526
(View said she was a lone tourist,)

97
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:04,846
(so I asked her to tag along.)

98
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:08,966
What's your perfume?

99
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:10,692
You smell so good.

100
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,726
(She agreed to let me tag along)

101
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:16,766
(on one condition. Don't ask anything personal.)

102
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:23,686
(That's why I don't know anything except the name she goes by.)

103
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,253
Your lips are sweet.

104
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:46,766
(Okay. Let's move on to the next issue.)

105
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,566
(I'll tell you guys)

106
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:51,286
(how I got crazy about her.)

107
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,046
(Fourth day of Mueang and View's trip)

108
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:00,253
Hey!

109
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,326
Sorry. I forgot to set my alarm.

110
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:11,886
It's fine. I just got here.

111
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:13,886
What? You just got here?

112
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:15,966
You're sweating all over your makeup.

113
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:18,726
Are you bullying my look?

114
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:19,988
I'm not.

115
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:22,886
It's just I can tell you've been here for a while.

116
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:24,806
If you feel guilty,

117
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:26,846
treat me to something nice and cold, okay?

118
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,646
Okay. Where to?

119
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:32,326
On the way here, I saw a cute cafe.

120
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:34,926
You're a cafe hopper.

121
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,926
Sure. Lead the way.

122
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,929
Come on.

123
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:42,206
What would you like?

124
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:44,446
I'd like something dark.

125
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:46,406
- Iced Americano. No sugar.   - Sure.

126
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:51,126
- A second, please.   - Sure.

127
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:54,046
- Do your best!    - You can do it!

128
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:58,846
- Let's go!    - Come on! Finish it!

129
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:02,086
- A Pink Paradise, please.   - Okay.

130
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:03,869
Hey.

131
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:05,566
Come here.

132
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,646
Let's play that game.

133
00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:15,646
"Pass the Rubber Band?"

134
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:18,966
"If you can pass more than five rubber bands

135
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:22,406
in two minutes, you get your drinks for free."

136
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:26,286
You said you'd treat me.

137
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:28,806
It's just for fun.

138
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:34,486
No.

139
00:11:34,886 --> 00:11:37,086
Why? Are you afraid to lose?

140
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:40,246
If you're afraid to lose a game, what can you do?

141
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:43,766
Do you want to find out?

142
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,046
Mister.

143
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:49,886
- Yes?   - I want to try this game.

144
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,566
Okay. I'll arrange it.

145
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:54,206
Please follow me.

146
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,726
That's more like it!

147
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:01,406
Come on! Quick!

148
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,286
Hold it steady.

149
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,166
Very good!

150
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:13,286
That's good. Go!

151
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:16,166
Focus! Don't rush.

152
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:18,246
You still have time.

153
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:22,926
(All my life,)

154
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:25,966
(I've never believed you can fall in love)

155
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:27,886
(just by looking in someone's eyes for a few seconds)

156
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:29,846
(until)

157
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,966
(I fell in love for real.)

158
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:40,486
(When I realized how much I liked her,)

159
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:42,446
(I went crazy.)

160
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:44,926
(Whether it's her smile,)

161
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:58,006
(the way she moves her hair,)

162
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,486
(or her laughter.)

163
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:05,966
(Everything about her)

164
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,806
(made me lose my mind.)

165
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:18,766
Did it hurt?

166
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,246
You scratched me.

167
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,206
Sorry.

168
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:35,166
(Okay. Before you think I'm more obsessed than I am,)

169
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:38,166
(here's something touching for a change.)

170
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:40,286
Mueang.

171
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:43,606
Yes?

172
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:45,486
Is something on your mind?

173
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:48,413
No.

174
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:50,206
Really?

175
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:55,646
If you want to talk, I can listen.

176
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,846
You said we wouldn't talk about anything personal.

177
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,326
I don't mean to pry.

178
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:07,926
I just want to help you if I can.

179
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:12,286
Think of it as me returning the favor when you saved me from drowning.

180
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:14,886
Don't talk if you don't want to.

181
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:18,206
Say what you want, or don't say anything.

182
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:21,806
(At that moment, I was surprised at myself)

183
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,686
(as for why I told her.)

184
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:27,566
(Maybe it's because I feel comfortable with her.)

185
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:29,606
I ran away after a fight with my dad.

186
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:36,286
What was the fight about?

187
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:38,486
What did your dad do to you?

188
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:48,926
(Okay. I'll need over two hours to tell you about my family.)

189
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:51,966
(I'll tell you the short version first)

190
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,606
(so you won't get bored.)

191
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:55,926
If you want me to stop,

192
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,806
you have to work for me.

193
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:00,566
Learn everything about my business.

194
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,366
Quit this measly Bo Phloi. That's the deal.

195
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,366
(This old man is Phudin, my father.)

196
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:09,845
(He owns the jewelry mine and Fun Park.)

197
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:14,342
(The thing is, he wants to expand his Fun Park into my jewelry mine.)

198
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:15,766
(I won't allow it.)

199
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,846
My answer is no!

200
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,846
You will have to work for me in the future anyway.

201
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,486
You're my only son.

202
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,366
You have to take over my business.

203
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:29,406
Old man, are you so old that your brain has stopped working?

204
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:31,086
Did you forget our deal?

205
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,726
You stay in your place,

206
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:34,406
and I'll stay in mine.

207
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:35,806
We don't bother each other.

208
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,086
Mueang!

209
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,686
You can't point your finger at your father like that.

210
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:44,446
(This old lady is Wi, my mom's sister.)

211
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:48,086
(She does nothing except binge-watch TV shows and flirt with my dad.)

212
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:49,926
Quiet, lady!

213
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:51,446
No one is talking to you.

214
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,366
Mueang!

215
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,046
Mr. Mueang.

216
00:15:55,526 --> 00:15:58,086
Please calm down. We can talk about this.

217
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,406
(This is Mrs. Sita, my dad's assistant.)

218
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,926
(Sometimes, she takes my dad's side.)

219
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,646
(Sometimes, she takes mine.)

220
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:05,846
(I can't tell which side she's on.)

221
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,717
If you don't stop messing with my Bo Phloi,

222
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:13,366
I'll be a pain in your butt every single day!

223
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:26,086
See? My family is a soap opera, right?

224
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:28,046
Not really.

225
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:32,046
Every family has a problem of its own.

226
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,526
Your family must be great, right?

227
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,686
Is that why you're so optimistic?

228
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,486
You think I'm optimistic?

229
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:44,926
Yeah!

230
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:46,926
It's almost naive, from what I can tell.

231
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:48,366
Nonsense.

232
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:49,566
What?

233
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:51,686
It's true.

234
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:57,046
I just don't want negative energy to ruin a good day.

235
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:01,086
That's called optimistic.

236
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:04,726
Nobody can do that in real life.

237
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:09,366
Then take advice from an optimistic person, please.

238
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,446
Don't be afraid

239
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:17,646
to say you can't take it anymore.

240
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:21,286
You need someone who listens to you like I'm doing

241
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:23,006
and just lets it all out.

242
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:28,606
What if I can't find that someone?

243
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:30,526
What do I do?

244
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,646
Are you so much of a jerk that you have no friends?

245
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,606
Do you see anyone around here?

246
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:40,726
You're all I have right now.

247
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:45,526
Fine.

248
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:47,246
Talk to me.

249
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,126
I can listen. I'm free. I have time.

250
00:17:51,726 --> 00:17:52,926
That's more like it.

251
00:17:56,998 --> 00:18:01,726
(You may be wondering why we ended up at my place.)

252
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:05,206
(From this moment on,)

253
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:08,846
(watch closely if you don't want to miss the good stuff.)

254
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:10,486
Cheers!

255
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,886
Yeah!

256
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:21,046
Again!

257
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:48,462
Whoa!

258
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,046
Should we go?

259
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:20,526
Wait.

260
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:23,326
Are you sure?

261
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,006
Yeah, you?

262
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,126
(That night,)

263
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,086
(we had fun in my RV all night long.)

264
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:39,926
(View left her marks all over the place.)

265
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,486
(My couch)

266
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,846
(smells like her shampoo.)

267
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:59,446
(Her hairband was on the floor.)

268
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:07,726
(My bed)

269
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:11,446
(is covered in her scent.)

270
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:26,246
(I thought it was a good night for both of us.)

271
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:28,806
(However,)

272
00:20:30,822 --> 00:20:32,166
(I was wrong.)

273
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,950
(I woke up)

274
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,766
(and View was gone.)

275
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:08,966
(I thought she went back to her place)

276
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:10,926
(and that she would be back soon.)

277
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:41,926
(I sat there waiting from noon)

278
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:44,766
(till midnight.)

279
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,526
(She didn't come back.)

280
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:23,966
(I tried to look for her contact info,)

281
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:26,126
(but there was none.)

282
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,926
(You may be wondering how)

283
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:41,646
(I didn't get her number or Line after seven days together.)

284
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:46,486
(You see, we told each other when and where to meet.)

285
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:49,686
(View wanted to try a tech-free trip.)

286
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,486
(That's why we can't contact each other.)

287
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,646
(I don't even know where she stays.)

288
00:22:55,685 --> 00:22:57,646
I should have asked for her Line.

289
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:08,566
(This is the advice that I need.)

290
00:23:09,246 --> 00:23:11,366
(I'm looking for this girl,)

291
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:14,206
(but I have nothing to find her at all.)

292
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:17,526
(Where do you guys think I should start?)

293
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:43,556
Did you want to see me, Mr. Phudin?

294
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,326
I wanted to ask if Mueang is home.

295
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:50,606
He just got home this morning.

296
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:51,846
Si.

297
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,446
I want you

298
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,166
to drive someone here.

299
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:57,006
Who?

300
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,846
"I'm looking for

301
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:10,206
a girl from Mo Chit BTS.

302
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:15,126
She stole my heart."

303
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:22,846
This works!

304
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:24,766
Chills, man!

305
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:33,206
Yeah, this doesn't work.

306
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:35,246
I agree.

307
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:39,246
Aum!

308
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:41,486
How long have you been watching me?

309
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:44,926
Are you looking for the girl who stole your heart?

310
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:47,566
That's none of your business.

311
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,566
Do you have a photo of her?

312
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,950
I said it's none of your business.

313
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:56,406
It's just an advice. You can use photos of her to find her on social media.

314
00:25:13,126 --> 00:25:15,086
Did you take photos of me?

315
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:17,486
I shot the views.

316
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:19,326
Give it to me.

317
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:21,966
Let me shoot you too.

318
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:23,766
Let go.

319
00:25:28,685 --> 00:25:29,886
The camera is out of a film.

320
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,446
Yeah! That's right!

321
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,206
The last photo of that roll!

322
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:40,286
Aum.

323
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:42,111
Thank you so much.

324
00:25:44,414 --> 00:25:45,886
Thanks a lot.

325
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:52,966
Please be a shot of her. Please be good. Please don't have light leaks.

326
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:10,486
That's it.

327
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:04,286
Why did the protagonist have to die?

328
00:27:09,223 --> 00:27:10,766
That cruel writer.

329
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,526
I'm going to burn his house down.

330
00:27:29,926 --> 00:27:31,126
What is it?

331
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:33,246
Meet me in the living room at four o'clock.

332
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:42,806
It's been years. He never asked to talk to me.

333
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:44,926
Something's happening.

334
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:48,166
Is he going to accept my love?

335
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:21,646
Did you get the photo, Young Master?

336
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,735
Aum! Cover your eyes!

337
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:25,406
- Yes.   - I will too.

338
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:27,737
- Alright.   - Remove the hand on my count.

339
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:28,836
Yes, Young Master.

340
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,197
- Ready?   - Yeah.

341
00:28:30,406 --> 00:28:32,446
- Ready?   - I am, Young Master.

342
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:37,166
Remove your hand!

343
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:42,046
- No!   - Young Master?

344
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:44,204
Is this person an alien?

345
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:46,726
Why is her face glowing like that?

346
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:49,406
It's called a light leak.

347
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:50,846
I was kidding.

348
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:52,726
I wanted to lighten the mood.

349
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:57,526
There goes my hope.

350
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:58,966
It was my only hope.

351
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:01,006
How can I find her now?

352
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,806
Why did it happen?

353
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,493
(Mueang, you can hear me, can't you?)

354
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:10,592
Where is that coming from?

355
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:11,686
I don't know.

356
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,086
(I know you can hear me.)

357
00:29:16,062 --> 00:29:17,286
Hey!

358
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:21,741
Seriously?

359
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:25,205
(Meet me at my house at four o'clock.)

360
00:29:25,286 --> 00:29:27,286
(Don't keep everyone waiting.)

361
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:31,126
I can't believe this.

362
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:32,966
Aum!

363
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:35,086
How did my old man get in and install this?

364
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:38,566
I didn't watch over the house closely. It's my fault.

365
00:29:47,846 --> 00:29:50,406
What did you want to talk to me about?

366
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:53,101
Wait for Mueang. So he can find out too.

367
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,606
(Did I do anything wrong?)

368
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:58,206
(Did I use too much AC and make the bills go up?)

369
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:01,726
You invaded my house again, old man.

370
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:06,861
Your house is as good as mine.

371
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:09,208
Do you want to see who owns the piece of land?

372
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:12,686
You're annoying. All you say is you own the place.

373
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,388
Because I do.

374
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:15,886
Stop haunting me.

375
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,126
Take this back.

376
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:20,046
You old ghost. Just go and rest in peace.

377
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:22,446
Wait. Come back.

378
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,046
I want you to meet my soon-to-be new wife.

379
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:28,566
Soon-to-be wife?

380
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:31,526
Did I hear that right?

381
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:39,206
I didn't hear that.

382
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:40,966
Say it again.

383
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:46,226
I want you to meet my soon-to-be new wife.

384
00:30:46,942 --> 00:30:49,526
Din, are you going to get married?

385
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,424
Who are you getting married to?

386
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:56,821
I called all of you here because I wanted you guys to meet her.

387
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:00,966
Why didn't you tell us before?

388
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:03,046
I'm telling you right now.

389
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,766
Who is she?

390
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:07,806
You can ask her yourself. There she is.

391
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:46,206
(Am I hallucinating? Is that View?)

392
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,045
Guys, this is Apo.

393
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:20,766
My soon-to-be new wife.

394
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:23,766
Good afternoon.

395
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,086
I'm Apo.

396
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:27,446
You can call me Po for short.

397
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:32,886
My name is View.

398
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,198
(What the heck is going on?)

399
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:39,643
- (Who exactly is this woman?)   - (My name is View. I'm Apo.)

400
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:42,606
(View... Apo...)

401
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:45,766
(Ten days ago)

402
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:50,526
(Hi, my name is Apo.)

403
00:32:50,686 --> 00:32:52,886
(I need your advice on something.)

404
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:57,686
(The thing is, I want to quit being me.)

405
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:59,630
(I don't know what to do.)

406
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:04,646
(Could you please listen to what I have to say?)

407
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:07,686
(I promise it won't be long.)

408
00:33:08,574 --> 00:33:09,926
(Please listen)

409
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:12,006
(and tell me what I should do.)

410
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:15,446
You know our company is in trouble, right?

411
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:18,166
Our clients can't afford to pay us in this economy.

412
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:21,726
All their projects are on hold. That's why we need to...

413
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:23,766
(Notice of Termination)

414
00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:27,486
(This morning, I got fired.)

415
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:32,806
Okay, Malee.

416
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:35,966
I understand the situation.

417
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,046
(One thing I learned from my job is that)

418
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:35,446
("we work like a family here" is a lie.)

419
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:37,886
(If anyone says that to you,)

420
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:40,566
(please know that they're lying.)

421
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,366
Miss.

422
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:54,966
We're here.

423
00:34:57,286 --> 00:34:59,806
- How much?   - It's 147 baht.

424
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:21,006
(Today is Game and I's third anniversary.)

425
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,366
(I don't want to ruin our good day.)

426
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:26,526
(That's why I won't tell him about getting fired yet.)

427
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:44,286
(The house that we dreamt of but can't afford yet.)

428
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:47,006
(I made a miniature of it as a present for Game.)

429
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,526
(I thought he would like it.)

430
00:35:51,494 --> 00:35:52,646
Happy anni...

431
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:59,566
- Po!   - (I saw this on TV.)

432
00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:02,286
(I never thought it would happen to me.)

433
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:05,526
(It felt like getting smashed in the head.)

434
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:07,886
- Po.   - (If this was a TV show,)

435
00:36:08,046 --> 00:36:10,286
(the girl would just slap her boyfriend right there,)

436
00:36:10,382 --> 00:36:14,488
(or she would slap the girl, but I couldn't move my legs.)

437
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,126
(My legs froze still.)

438
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:20,926
Po, listen to me.

439
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:25,686
Po, listen to me.

440
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:33,206
Since when?

441
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:36,606
Why would you want to know that?

442
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:38,606
Since when?

443
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:41,886
Three months ago.

444
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,126
So

445
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,886
every time I said I needed you,

446
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:52,478
you said you couldn't make it.

447
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:54,966
Was that when you were cheating?

448
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,486
How could you do this?

449
00:36:58,669 --> 00:37:00,686
How could you do this to me?

450
00:37:01,926 --> 00:37:03,726
I turned out this way because of you.

451
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:05,806
All you do is work.

452
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:07,326
You don't have time for me.

453
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,326
You expect me just to sit still alone?

454
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:11,710
Was it my fault?

455
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:15,166
If you were a good girlfriend, I wouldn't have anyone else.

456
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:19,806
Shameless!

457
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:21,566
You're so fricking shameless!

458
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,046
I'm shameless? You're so fricking boring!

459
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:28,766
Do you realize how boring it was when we were together?

460
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,726
It was boring?

461
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,526
You said

462
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,366
you wanted to get married, buy a house, and live together. Was that a lie?

463
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,406
That wasn't a lie.

464
00:37:45,886 --> 00:37:47,526
I just changed my mind.

465
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,606
That feeling is gone.

466
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:55,286
Just tell me what you want.

467
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:56,726
It's you

468
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:59,646
who needs to decide how you deal with this.

469
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:01,646
Then it's over.

470
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:05,206
I don't feel happy with you.

471
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:07,726
It's a waste of time for both of us to drag on.

472
00:38:15,366 --> 00:38:18,366
Do these three years mean nothing to you?

473
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:20,326
Look.

474
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,046
Next time you break up with someone,

475
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,406
just tell her you don't love her anymore.

476
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,606
Don't make stupid excuses like these.

477
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:30,526
Between us,

478
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:32,286
the one who should get to say it's over

479
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:34,246
is me, not you!

480
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:37,806
We're done!

481
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:48,526
What the heck?

482
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,686
(That's it.)

483
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:29,086
(That's why I'm here.)

484
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:34,206
(Why is life so hard?)

485
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:41,766
(Do you think I should just jump?)

486
00:39:50,117 --> 00:39:53,086
(I don't really want to die.)

487
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:55,926
(I just want to escape the pain.)

488
00:40:07,957 --> 00:40:09,246
Hello?

489
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:11,966
(Hello. Is this Ms. Apo?)

490
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:16,855
- Yes.   - (Congratulations.)

491
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:20,566
(You have been chosen as a winner of a free vacation.)

492
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:22,646
What is it?

493
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:27,766
(Two weeks ago, you entered a contest on "Travel with Deals" titled)

494
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:32,166
("I'm feeling burned out. I want to... so much." Is that right?)

495
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:34,006
I did.

496
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:37,086
(What was your answer in the comment section? Do you remember?)

497
00:40:40,158 --> 00:40:42,926
"I'm feeling burned out.

498
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:47,006
I want to go somewhere no one knows me so much."

499
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:50,366
(That's correct. We randomly chose three winners.)

500
00:40:50,462 --> 00:40:52,366
(You're one of them.)

501
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:55,206
Really?

502
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:57,205
I'm a winner?

503
00:40:57,286 --> 00:41:02,366
(That's right. You have won a ten-day stay at a beachside hotel.)

504
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:03,933
Ten days?

505
00:41:04,014 --> 00:41:06,166
(That's right. Ten days.)

506
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:14,086
Thank you.

507
00:41:15,478 --> 00:41:17,877
- Thank you so much.   - (You're welcome.)

508
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,645
(We sent a DM to you,)

509
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:22,126
(but you didn't reply, so we called.)

510
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,166
(I'm sorry if this call bothers you.)

511
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:30,246
It doesn't.

512
00:41:31,286 --> 00:41:32,886
It doesn't bother me at all.

513
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:45,086
(Finally, I've found an escape for myself.)

514
00:41:53,885 --> 00:41:57,886
Awesome!

515
00:42:00,997 --> 00:42:04,046
Hey, awesome sister. Do you want to be more awesome?

516
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:08,845
Yeah.

517
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,857
Follow me. Over there.

518
00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:12,526
Okay.

519
00:42:17,646 --> 00:42:19,606
- Good morning.   - I'm here to learn surfing.

520
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:21,846
Boss, get something for this awesome sister.

521
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:23,999
Of course. I'll give you the fun.

522
00:42:24,573 --> 00:42:25,846
It's going to be awesome.

523
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,926
(I wanted to get out of my safe zone.)

524
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,166
(I wanted to see if I would feel like a new me)

525
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:38,366
(when I get to do something I've never done before.)

526
00:42:47,213 --> 00:42:51,126
(After the class, I rented a board to try surfing myself, but...)

527
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:56,046
(I got ahead of myself.)

528
00:42:56,295 --> 00:42:58,726
(Did I just avoid suicide by dying by drowning?)

529
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:01,926
(No! I can't die yet!)

530
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:04,406
(They say when you're dying,)

531
00:43:04,486 --> 00:43:07,646
(you'll see the one you love, but why?)

532
00:43:07,982 --> 00:43:10,566
(Why do I see this man?)

533
00:43:21,326 --> 00:43:23,606
Quit this if you don't want to die. It's dangerous.

534
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,763
You might not die alone. Someone might die trying to save you.

535
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,623
You're lucky your surfboard didn't hit anyone.

536
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,046
When you fall, don't kick the board. It might hit someone!

537
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:35,006
(This man saved my life.)

538
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:38,566
(He likes to look angry all the time)

539
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:40,806
(but he's actually a kind soul.)

540
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:44,366
(He saved my life and taught me for free.)

541
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:47,351
(Oh! I forgot. His name was...)

542
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:49,486
- I'm Mueang.   - Mueang.

543
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:52,126
And you?

544
00:43:52,406 --> 00:43:56,486
(When he asked my name, I didn't want to say "Apo.")

545
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,766
(I wanted to quit being myself for a while.)

546
00:43:58,997 --> 00:44:03,206
(The sky, the ocean, the beach, the mountains?)

547
00:44:03,717 --> 00:44:05,086
(What is my name?)

548
00:44:05,557 --> 00:44:09,877
What? Did you drink so much of the sea that you forgot your name?

549
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:15,206
(I'll just take all those things then.)

550
00:44:15,806 --> 00:44:18,046
I'm View.

551
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:19,806
View.

552
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,806
(It's okay, I guess. He's a stranger anyway.)

553
00:44:26,006 --> 00:44:27,646
(We just met here.)

554
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,406
Are you traveling alone?

555
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,540
I'm trying to meet people on the way, like in the movies.

556
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:44,206
A dork like you?

557
00:44:44,638 --> 00:44:47,726
That's harsh. Aren't you a blunt one, sir?

558
00:44:48,861 --> 00:44:51,566
If you want to argue, don't "sir" me.

559
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,046
Sorry.

560
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:58,366
Just talk to me casually.

561
00:44:58,726 --> 00:45:01,846
If you're too polite, I would feel like I'm a sinner.

562
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:06,686
Okay, sir.

563
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:09,206
I mean, okay.

564
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:13,982
Let's travel together, shall we?

565
00:45:18,374 --> 00:45:19,766
Do you think I'm hitting on you?

566
00:45:21,334 --> 00:45:22,526
No.

567
00:45:23,446 --> 00:45:26,586
That high-pitched voice? I can hear it from the top of these coconut trees.

568
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:30,606
I just asked to tag along, in case you're alone.

569
00:45:30,742 --> 00:45:34,566
(At that moment, I thought it would be good)

570
00:45:34,686 --> 00:45:36,286
(to have someone I can trust traveling with me.)

571
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,326
Okay.

572
00:45:41,766 --> 00:45:44,126
But we need to have rules.

573
00:45:46,582 --> 00:45:47,606
What rules?

574
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:49,366
We will travel as

575
00:45:50,054 --> 00:45:52,286
strangers who don't know each other.

576
00:45:53,037 --> 00:45:54,686
Never ask anything personal.

577
00:45:55,046 --> 00:45:56,486
Just travel together.

578
00:45:56,941 --> 00:45:59,486
Why? Do you have a boyfriend?

579
00:45:59,853 --> 00:46:02,133
Are you a Natasha Romanoff?

580
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:07,686
(No, I just didn't want to talk about myself. I wanted to forget it.)

581
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,846
I'm not.

582
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:16,006
Well, I just thought it would be fun.

583
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:18,966
Fine.

584
00:46:19,182 --> 00:46:21,526
That's easy. I'm not a nosy type, anyway.

585
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:23,686
Okay.

586
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,326
Deal?

587
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:26,686
Deal.

588
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:34,046
(Second day of View and Mueang's trip)

589
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:45,326
(Each morning, we meet at nine o'clock.)

590
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:47,526
- Ready?   - Let's do it.

591
00:46:47,686 --> 00:46:48,886
Let's go.

592
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:08,566
(Sometimes, I was late.)

593
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:10,166
(Third day of View and Mueang's Trip)

594
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:12,366
I'm sorry that I'm late.

595
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:28,126
Thumbs up!

596
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,646
(Sometimes, he was late.)

597
00:47:33,782 --> 00:47:34,886
Sorry.

598
00:47:35,213 --> 00:47:36,326
I forgot to set my alarm.

599
00:47:36,422 --> 00:47:38,326
It's fine. I just got here.

600
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:40,424
(Sometimes, we arrive at the same time.)

601
00:47:40,505 --> 00:47:41,646
Hi.

602
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:45,006
Are you really not going to give me your number?

603
00:47:45,846 --> 00:47:47,206
It's hard to reach you.

604
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:50,726
What if I die? Wouldn't you have to wait for me at this dock every day?

605
00:47:51,693 --> 00:47:54,566
"I'll be here waiting for you at this dock every day."

606
00:47:55,446 --> 00:47:56,726
Do you get the joke?

607
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:58,246
I'm Mueang, not Pee Mak.

608
00:48:00,594 --> 00:48:04,006
I just want to try living without a phone.

609
00:48:04,126 --> 00:48:06,309
I want to see if I can live without it.

610
00:48:06,455 --> 00:48:07,814
That's why I'm not giving my number.

611
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,438
Okay.

612
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,625
(Sixth day of View and Mueang's trip)

613
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:45,446
(At first, our trip was just for fun.)

614
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:49,046
(I didn't really think we would...)

615
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:51,646
(Seventh day of View and Mueang's trip)

616
00:48:52,086 --> 00:48:53,486
(That night,)

617
00:48:54,038 --> 00:48:56,486
(he made me forget the pain.)

618
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:58,766
(He was like a healer in a video game)

619
00:48:58,847 --> 00:49:01,406
(who healed my HP up to full with one spell.)

620
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:13,926
(I was beginning to think what if he found out I wasn't View.)

621
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:19,166
(If I wasn't the optimistic woman he thought, how would he feel?)

622
00:49:22,246 --> 00:49:24,566
(What if he sees the real me?)

623
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:28,034
(Would he still have feelings for me?)

624
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:37,166
I'll introduce you to her.

625
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:38,926
This is Wiwan,

626
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:40,526
my late wife's sister.

627
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:43,646
This boy is Mueang, my son.

628
00:49:46,886 --> 00:49:47,886
What?

629
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,046
Get to know each other.

630
00:49:51,126 --> 00:49:52,366
Get to know her?

631
00:49:55,902 --> 00:49:57,086
Fine.

632
00:49:57,981 --> 00:49:59,286
I will.

633
00:50:18,342 --> 00:50:20,046
Nice to meet you.

634
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:24,126
Mueang, what are you doing?

635
00:50:24,214 --> 00:50:26,006
Mueang!

636
00:50:26,102 --> 00:50:27,886
- Mueang!   - Mr. Mueang!

637
00:50:27,998 --> 00:50:29,806
Come here. Get out!

638
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:31,846
Mueang!

639
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:39,006
- Hey, Mueang.   - Stop!

640
00:50:39,087 --> 00:50:41,327
- Stop! What are you doing? Stop right now!   - What are you doing?

641
00:50:45,014 --> 00:50:47,046
What are you doing?

642
00:50:49,686 --> 00:50:51,006
You must explain it to me,

643
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:52,486
or this won't end well.

644
00:50:52,646 --> 00:50:53,926
- Come here!   - Hey.

645
00:50:54,086 --> 00:50:55,366
- Mueang!   - Mueang!

646
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,566
Where are you taking her? Wi!

647
00:50:57,703 --> 00:50:59,268
Get the spare keys and open this!

648
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:02,326
- Spare keys?   - Mueang!

649
00:51:02,446 --> 00:51:04,486
- Mueang! Does this one work?   - Is it this one?

650
00:51:04,582 --> 00:51:07,046
- Try this.   - Here. It's this one.

651
00:51:07,142 --> 00:51:08,246
Try it!

652
00:51:08,406 --> 00:51:10,766
This is not it! It won't open!

653
00:51:10,918 --> 00:51:13,126
- Aum!   - This is all we have.

654
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,726
Come here right now!

655
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:16,046
Mueang!

656
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:27,486
Hey!

657
00:51:28,438 --> 00:51:29,588
Where are you taking me?

658
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:30,846
We need to talk.

659
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:38,173
What are you and Young Master playing?

660
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:39,926
Just open the door, Aum!

661
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:41,206
Yes, sir.

662
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,366
- Move!   - Oh!

663
00:51:45,029 --> 00:51:46,246
Where...

664
00:51:47,243 --> 00:51:49,166
What the heck is wrong with Mueang?

665
00:51:49,438 --> 00:51:52,606
Does Mr. Mueang know your soon-to-be wife?

666
00:51:53,837 --> 00:51:56,846
Aum, where is Mueang taking Apo?

667
00:52:01,149 --> 00:52:04,486
So, is your name View or Apo?

668
00:52:08,766 --> 00:52:09,966
It's Apo.

669
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:12,726
Okay, Ms. Apo.

670
00:52:12,926 --> 00:52:15,046
How did you become my dad's soon-to-be wife?

671
00:52:18,366 --> 00:52:20,578
It's personal. I'd rather not tell you.

672
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:22,766
It's come to this, and you still won't talk?

673
00:52:22,847 --> 00:52:24,166
It's my right!

674
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:27,166
Yeah, it is, but don't I deserve an explanation?

675
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,606
You slept with me, and you're marrying my dad?

676
00:52:29,766 --> 00:52:31,366
How am I supposed to feel?

677
00:52:33,806 --> 00:52:37,566
I really didn't know you were Phudin's son.

678
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:40,726
I didn't know you were marrying my dad.

679
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:48,246
You know what? For the sake of both of us,

680
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:50,445
let's confess to Phudin together.

681
00:52:51,412 --> 00:52:53,326
- Let's go.   - I won't.

682
00:52:55,037 --> 00:52:56,206
What do you want then?

683
00:52:56,326 --> 00:52:58,686
You have to answer me, so I know what to do with you.

684
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,086
When did you meet my dad?

685
00:53:03,373 --> 00:53:05,046
Before I met you.

686
00:53:05,926 --> 00:53:09,285
So you were cheating on my dad when you slept with me?

687
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:10,499
It's not like that.

688
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,046
What is it like then?

689
00:53:14,437 --> 00:53:17,806
That night, I didn't know yet that I was getting married.

690
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:21,206
You're making excuses.

691
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:27,086
I'm not. You should ask your dad when he proposed to me.

692
00:53:27,526 --> 00:53:29,286
What exactly is the deal with you?

693
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,606
Huh?

694
00:53:38,325 --> 00:53:39,726
What's the deal with you?

695
00:53:40,253 --> 00:53:41,686
Are you a two-timer?

696
00:53:43,725 --> 00:53:46,021
Is it fun playing with someone's feelings?

697
00:53:47,246 --> 00:53:48,486
Mueang.

698
00:53:49,286 --> 00:53:50,646
I guess it's fun, then.

699
00:53:50,773 --> 00:53:52,966
You were feeling so great that night.

700
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:55,693
Who? Who felt great?

701
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,126
You did.

702
00:53:58,542 --> 00:53:59,830
Don't you remember?

703
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:04,486
Watch your tongue.

704
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,726
I will soon be your stepmother.

705
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,526
Stepmother, my butt!

706
00:54:10,813 --> 00:54:11,817
You're not my mom.

707
00:54:11,898 --> 00:54:14,566
I'm marrying your dad. Don't cross the line.

708
00:54:14,647 --> 00:54:16,306
Where's the line? Show me!

709
00:54:16,406 --> 00:54:17,870
- Get off!   - No!

710
00:54:17,981 --> 00:54:20,766
- Get off!   - No! Answer me first.

711
00:54:22,174 --> 00:54:24,006
How long have you been dating my dad?

712
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:25,926
I'm not dating him.

713
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:27,366
What do you mean you're not?

714
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:29,166
We didn't date. We're just getting married.

715
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,686
Isn't that too easy?

716
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,686
This is marriage, not Uber Eats!

717
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,529
I have my reasons.

718
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,126
Tell me then.

719
00:54:37,991 --> 00:54:39,206
What stunned you?

720
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:42,286
Tell me! Huh?

721
00:54:43,256 --> 00:54:44,886
Why are you marrying my dad?

722
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,646
Why do people get married?

723
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:50,286
Do you love my dad?

724
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,406
I said do you love my dad?

725
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:58,006
I don't love him.

726
00:54:58,102 --> 00:54:59,686
If you don't, why are you getting married?

727
00:55:01,404 --> 00:55:02,822
Tell me!

728
00:55:03,085 --> 00:55:04,486
Why are you getting married?

729
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,526
- Answer me!   - Hey! Mueang!

730
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,646
Apo, are you alright?

731
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,566
I'm fine.

732
00:55:15,765 --> 00:55:17,686
Don't pull this stunt again.

733
00:55:18,966 --> 00:55:20,526
Who's pulling stunts?

734
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,526
You're marrying a girl who can be your daughter. Have you lost your mind?

735
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:26,726
You're going too far! Show Apo some respect!

736
00:55:26,846 --> 00:55:28,286
Why would I?

737
00:55:28,932 --> 00:55:31,246
Who is this woman? Do you even know her?

738
00:55:31,526 --> 00:55:33,606
Do you know how fricking untrustworthy she is?

739
00:55:35,286 --> 00:55:37,166
How is she untrustworthy?

740
00:55:37,365 --> 00:55:39,366
You sound like you know her well.

741
00:55:40,606 --> 00:55:43,246
Tell me if you know something I don't.

742
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:48,086
Con artists are running wild these days.

743
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:49,966
People fake even their names.

744
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:51,606
I'm not stupid.

745
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,126
Only a stupid man say he's smart.

746
00:55:54,806 --> 00:55:56,366
I'll let it slide this time.

747
00:55:56,757 --> 00:55:59,006
If I find out you pull this again,

748
00:55:59,206 --> 00:56:01,686
I'll be a pain in your butt too. Just watch!

749
00:56:01,806 --> 00:56:03,086
Let's go.

750
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:14,206
You're already a pain in my butt. Don't you know?

751
00:56:17,661 --> 00:56:19,661
I need to apologize again.

752
00:56:20,686 --> 00:56:22,566
Stop apologizing, Mr. Phudin.

753
00:56:22,788 --> 00:56:25,286
I said I understood where Mueang was coming from.

754
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:28,606
I wouldn't trust a stranger in my house too.

755
00:56:28,773 --> 00:56:31,246
Are you sure he didn't do anything to you?

756
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:33,846
I am.

757
00:56:35,149 --> 00:56:38,966
I hope you can tolerate him and don't run away.

758
00:56:40,726 --> 00:56:42,286
This is easy for me.

759
00:56:42,406 --> 00:56:46,206
Good. Remember, you have me by your side.

760
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:48,166
Don't be afraid of anyone.

761
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:53,126
Get some rest. Tell me if you need anything.

762
00:56:53,646 --> 00:56:55,126
- Thank you.   - Okay.

763
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:09,366
Why?

764
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:12,486
Why did it turn out this way?

765
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:17,286
Why?

766
00:57:31,526 --> 00:57:34,806
Then take advice from an optimistic person, please.

767
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:40,646
Don't be afraid

768
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:42,846
to say you can't take it anymore.

769
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:46,406
You need someone who listens to you like I'm doing

770
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:47,966
and lets it all out.

771
00:57:52,286 --> 00:57:55,686
Watch your tongue. I will soon be your stepmother.

772
00:57:57,126 --> 00:57:58,406
Stepmother, my butt!

773
00:57:58,869 --> 00:57:59,877
You're not my mom.

774
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:02,726
I'm marrying your dad. Don't cross the line.

775
00:58:10,197 --> 00:58:11,646
Here's your snack, Young Master.

776
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,606
- Aum.   - Yes?

777
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:14,966
Sit down.

778
00:58:16,425 --> 00:58:18,166
What is it, Young Master?

779
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:20,806
Do you think people

780
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,846
can have two personalities?

781
00:58:23,397 --> 00:58:24,726
Of course.

782
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:26,486
Like in TV shows.

783
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:32,446
- How?   - One day, she's an angel. On other days, she's a demon.

784
00:58:33,114 --> 00:58:35,486
Exactly! That's it!

785
00:58:35,574 --> 00:58:37,166
Because they're twins!

786
00:58:40,038 --> 00:58:45,046
- Go away! Run away from my foot!   - Calm down, Young Master!

787
00:58:45,238 --> 00:58:47,366
I just wanted to lighten the mood.

788
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:49,206
I feel even worse now.

789
00:58:50,749 --> 00:58:51,886
Well,

790
00:58:52,486 --> 00:58:56,846
Young Master, I think you shouldn't be angry with your dad.

791
00:58:57,261 --> 00:59:01,166
He's getting married, but he still loves you the most.

792
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:05,326
I'm not angry with that.

793
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:07,206
So what's wrong with you?

794
00:59:08,686 --> 00:59:10,486
I just don't trust that woman.

795
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:12,046
Why?

796
00:59:12,158 --> 00:59:14,158
Ms. Apo seems lovely.

797
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:15,966
Lovely, my butt.

798
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:20,446
My sense tells me she's up to no good.

799
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:23,726
You need to keep an eye on her.

800
00:59:23,846 --> 00:59:26,566
Tell me if you see anything odd, okay?

801
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:27,804
Yes, sir!

802
00:59:27,885 --> 00:59:29,126
You can leave now.

803
00:59:29,788 --> 00:59:30,788
Yes.

804
01:00:09,671 --> 01:00:10,966
Mrs. Sita.

805
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:16,486
When did you get here?

806
01:00:16,782 --> 01:00:18,246
I didn't hear you come in.

807
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:22,286
I've been here for a while. You didn't notice.

808
01:00:22,461 --> 01:00:23,646
(So freaky.)

809
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:28,846
You don't look well today.

810
01:00:29,006 --> 01:00:30,326
Did you not sleep well?

811
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:33,526
I'm still getting used to it.

812
01:00:33,908 --> 01:00:38,166
Mr. Phudin sent me to take you to breakfast. Are you ready?

813
01:00:39,526 --> 01:00:40,686
Okay.

814
01:00:41,853 --> 01:00:43,726
Lead the way, please.

815
01:01:39,134 --> 01:01:40,286
What the heck?

816
01:01:56,937 --> 01:01:58,526
Mrs. Sita.

817
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,446
What's wrong with him?

818
01:02:02,566 --> 01:02:05,646
Mr. Mueang just asked Aum to keep an eye on you. It's nothing.

819
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:16,206
None of these people are normal.

820
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:19,566
(Keep your love in my heart.)

821
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,406
(Think of you in my mind.)

822
01:02:22,526 --> 01:02:28,286
(Don't have to shout it out. I feel no doubt.)

823
01:02:28,366 --> 01:02:30,333
(Just having you here...)

824
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:33,686
- Don't be shocked to see Miss Wi singing.   - (I'm happy with you near.)

825
01:02:33,806 --> 01:02:36,166
Because she likes to sing.

826
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:39,006
Okay.

827
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:45,366
You sure are quiet.

828
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:56,886
Your phone, please.

829
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:08,446
This is my number.

830
01:03:08,653 --> 01:03:10,333
Call me if you need anything.

831
01:03:10,966 --> 01:03:12,246
Thank you.

832
01:03:13,646 --> 01:03:14,866
Miss Wi.

833
01:03:15,134 --> 01:03:16,606
Your tone is off today.

834
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:24,086
Sit down.

835
01:03:55,973 --> 01:03:58,943
Do you think you can just take everything away from me?

836
01:04:05,326 --> 01:04:06,606
This meat

837
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:09,726
was bought from my friend's farm.

838
01:04:12,402 --> 01:04:16,726
This vegetable is grown by me.

839
01:04:17,647 --> 01:04:20,766
You want to take my everything, don't you?

840
01:04:22,486 --> 01:04:23,926
(Is she too emotional?)

841
01:04:24,038 --> 01:04:25,246
Answer me!

842
01:04:27,221 --> 01:04:29,766
I don't intend to take anything from you.

843
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,310
You took Din from me.

844
01:04:32,485 --> 01:04:37,246
Without you, Din would have married me.

845
01:04:37,445 --> 01:04:39,646
(My aunt, she does nothing)

846
01:04:39,727 --> 01:04:42,006
(except binge-watch TV shows and flirt with my dad.)

847
01:04:44,293 --> 01:04:46,006
Miss Wi.

848
01:04:46,526 --> 01:04:49,286
I, too, have had a one-sided love.

849
01:04:54,621 --> 01:04:58,726
Are you saying it was all in my head?

850
01:04:59,517 --> 01:05:00,677
No.

851
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:06,286
As I thought, you're a nasty one. Someone like you has to face me.

852
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,893
Just eat nothing.

853
01:05:12,446 --> 01:05:17,686
Don't ever hope to eat anything without me saying so.

854
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:37,606
Then I'll take my leave.

855
01:05:43,997 --> 01:05:46,190
Is there anyone normal in this house?

856
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:59,565
Place it gently. Right there. Watch the top. Yeah.

857
01:05:59,678 --> 01:06:02,046
Get her some sunlight. That's it.

858
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:06,246
Okay. The next one is this. And this. Take it.

859
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:07,526
Hey!

860
01:06:07,606 --> 01:06:10,246
Be careful. I'll be in trouble if it breaks.

861
01:06:10,686 --> 01:06:12,606
Be gentle with my kids.

862
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:15,966
Put them there. Make another trip.

863
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,886
Got it?

864
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:26,126
Go. Place it gently.

865
01:06:27,136 --> 01:06:29,126
Hey, Tin!

866
01:06:30,246 --> 01:06:32,086
I told you to be quiet.

867
01:06:36,406 --> 01:06:38,406
Good morning, my honey.

868
01:06:38,497 --> 01:06:39,766
Honey, my butt!

869
01:06:40,213 --> 01:06:42,446
Whoa! Such a mood killer.

870
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:48,766
I brought you your new little girl.

871
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:53,286
Lovely, right? She's cute.

872
01:06:53,629 --> 01:06:56,584
Oh, no, you don't! Stop selling me these.

873
01:06:56,671 --> 01:06:59,806
I bought so many of your trees that my house is becoming a jungle.

874
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:01,286
Come on.

875
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:03,367
It's a little bit of happiness in your life, bro.

876
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:05,246
Here. Take it.

877
01:07:09,862 --> 01:07:11,886
Yeah, did you find out anything about that?

878
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:15,046
Pay me first.

879
01:07:15,926 --> 01:07:17,406
Am I your friend or what?

880
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:19,878
I hired a PI for you, man.

881
01:07:20,676 --> 01:07:22,323
I'll wire the money.

882
01:07:22,419 --> 01:07:25,926
Will you? You haven't paid me for these trees.

883
01:07:26,326 --> 01:07:28,086
I'll pay for them all at once.

884
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:29,846
Tell me what you found out.

885
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,446
I found out

886
01:07:31,766 --> 01:07:33,406
how she came to marry Uncle Din.

887
01:07:46,886 --> 01:07:49,846
Stop! What do I need to do to stop this wedding?

888
01:07:50,006 --> 01:07:51,444
Do you have ten million, then?

889
01:07:51,574 --> 01:07:53,726
You don't know everything, Mueang.

890
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:56,479
Your world and mine are different.

891
01:07:56,566 --> 01:07:59,606
Don't ever think you can come, stay, and leave easily.

892
01:07:59,749 --> 01:08:01,326
Nothing will be as easy as you think.

893
01:08:02,365 --> 01:08:04,046
Apo!

894
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:08,406
I'm not done!

895
01:08:09,406 --> 01:08:14,406
From this moment on, you will be under my watch 24/7.

896
01:08:15,934 --> 01:08:17,766
Have you asked the owner before coming in?

897
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:19,908
What you're doing is a crime.

898
01:08:19,989 --> 01:08:21,326
I know the ending of this.

899
01:08:21,414 --> 01:08:24,806
- Tell me.   - You will end up with Mueang.

900
01:08:24,942 --> 01:08:25,970
Mueang!
