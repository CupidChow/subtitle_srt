1
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,406
What do I need to do to stop this wedding?

2
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:03,818
Do you have ten million, then?

3
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:06,886
Everyone, Boss' new wife is here.

4
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,366
Boss is going on an offensive.

5
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:11,206
He's taking Ms. Apo to the park.

6
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:15,486
Can you forget about that night?

7
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:18,926
Think of it as something fun that we did in the heat of the moment.

8
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,006
No! I'm moving back to live in this house again.

9
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,166
- Live in this house again?   - Live in this house again?

10
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:25,846
From this moment on,

11
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:29,026
you will be under my watch 24/7.

12
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:33,606
Have you asked the owner before coming in? What you're doing is a crime.

13
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:35,246
Can I go inside?

14
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,526
I heard a dragging noise. What were you doing?

15
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:52,166
I was setting up my room.

16
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:55,286
At this hour?

17
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:02,166
I blocked the door with stuff

18
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:04,046
so Mueang can't get it.

19
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,486
So you're feeling unsafe?

20
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:13,166
Yeah, a little.

21
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:17,086
I understand.

22
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,766
Is something the matter, Mr. Phudin?

23
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:25,566
You probably know

24
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,525
why I came in.

25
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:54,366
Fifteen minutes.

26
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:58,086
Half an hour.

27
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:03,830
An hour.

28
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,046
What is he doing in there?

29
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:21,405
(Did he leave?)

30
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:23,926
(No, he didn't. I haven't seen him leaving.)

31
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,566
(Nothing happened.)

32
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:42,606
(Nothing happened. It was all in my head.)

33
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:44,086
(Nothing happened.)

34
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,086
Are you sure?

35
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:36,710
Whoa!

36
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:39,686
I can't let this happen.

37
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:51,846
(Because it couldn't be you.)

38
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:58,286
(I already said yes to your dad.)

39
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,766
(Okay?)

40
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,062
It's pretty.

41
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,109
You're pretty.

42
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,406
Is that your girlfriend?

43
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,766
It's just a notification for my phone bills.

44
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:13,766
I thought your girlfriend was looking for you.

45
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:16,406
What girlfriend? I'm single.

46
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:20,126
Selling yourself, huh?

47
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,645
I really am.

48
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:26,446
Are you really single?

49
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:28,766
Why?

50
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:32,966
I don't know. Maybe because my blood is type B.

51
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:35,886
What's that got to do with this?

52
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,606
Just kidding.

53
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,846
I just haven't met the right one.

54
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:48,166
Let me ask you

55
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:52,366
what kind of person is the right one for you.

56
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:54,966
I can't say it,

57
00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:58,278
but I can tell when I see her.

58
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:04,126
(If that day,)

59
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,806
(I confessed to her right there,)

60
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:09,966
(would things have been different?)

61
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:17,286
What's wrong?

62
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:20,686
Nothing.

63
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:23,406
I was just pushing my teeth with my tongue.

64
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:38,806
(Do you know what hurts the most?)

65
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:42,046
(Between her and me,)

66
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,166
(it was over before it even started.)

67
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,094
Why is he not here yet?

68
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,166
Did I wake up late?

69
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:00,949
Is my stuff ready?

70
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,366
It's all there, Ms. Wi.

71
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,326
You can go do whatever you want now.

72
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:06,206
I don't want to share my merit.

73
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:07,638
Okay.

74
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:17,229
This way, sir.

75
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,046
Please come a bit faster.

76
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:28,966
This won't take long.

77
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:36,566
If nobody said you were here, I would have walked the other way.

78
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:39,966
Nobody in this house wakes up early to give food to the monks.

79
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:43,806
I woke up early to get my Shopoo order.

80
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,766
I figured I might as well give you food.

81
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,390
Are you serious?

82
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,486
I am.

83
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,423
I'll never be more serious than this.

84
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,126
This is vitamin C.

85
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:01,966
Your skin will be bouncy.

86
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,126
Collagen.

87
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:05,966
It makes your skin smooth.

88
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:11,886
Fiber helps your digestive system and makes you slim.

89
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:15,886
I hope that in my next life,

90
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:18,526
I will still be as beautiful as I am.

91
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:20,446
Amen.

92
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:35,126
(Saying Buddhist prayer.)

93
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,606
Hey, this morning, I saw Boss coming out of Ms. Apo's room.

94
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,709
- You did?   - I did.

95
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,166
- It's nothing weird. They're a couple.   - Yeah.

96
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:46,686
Quiet!

97
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:48,446
Can you be quiet?

98
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:49,846
You merit-seeking ghost!

99
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,326
Calm down, Miss.

100
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,318
I didn't mean you. I was talking to myself.

101
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:58,766
That's not a sin, right?

102
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,493
Okay.

103
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:06,064
(Saying Buddhist prayer.)

104
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,517
Amen.

105
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,406
The lead girl in the TV show last night was so hot!

106
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:23,213
She removed her top, you know?

107
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:24,726
- Really?    - Yeah.

108
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:26,606
Wait!

109
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:34,966
I heard you two talking.

110
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,502
You saw Mr. Phudin

111
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:41,126
coming out of Apo's room.

112
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:43,701
Is that right?

113
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:56,230
Mueang, it's me! Open the door!

114
00:11:56,406 --> 00:12:00,246
- Open the door!   - Yeah?

115
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:02,046
What is it?

116
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,686
Last night, your dad and Apo

117
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,974
boinked

118
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:12,926
and tap-tapped!

119
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:14,686
Why are you telling me?

120
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:17,446
I didn't want to know who hooked up.

121
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:19,326
You need to know!

122
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:23,606
She wants your dad to fall for her. We need to act quickly.

123
00:12:24,686 --> 00:12:27,246
We need to find a way to get rid of her.

124
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,246
Wait.

125
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:31,246
- We?   - Yeah.

126
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:35,646
Me and you. We

127
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:38,046
have to join forces.

128
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,006
In your dreams!

129
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:42,126
Who would join forces with you?

130
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:44,006
Look!

131
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,566
Put down your ego.

132
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:47,526
Let's call a truce for now.

133
00:12:47,614 --> 00:12:50,966
Get rid of her first, and then we can fight.

134
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:54,926
No! You suck. You will just ruin the plan. Get out.

135
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:56,706
- Get out!   - Hey!

136
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:59,629
- Hey, Mueang!   - Go!

137
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,606
- Get...   - This is not the time to pick your sides.

138
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:06,366
I'll never pick your side in this life or the next.

139
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:08,126
Go!

140
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:13,686
Mueang!

141
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:17,406
Did someone say "Mueang?"

142
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:28,126
Delivery for you.

143
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:29,262
Okay.

144
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:32,526
I have Ms. Apo and Ms. Wiwan's packages.

145
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,806
- Please sign here.   - Okay.

146
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:41,686
- This is the first one.   - Thanks.

147
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:45,206
Mueang! Darn you!

148
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,326
Third and fourth.

149
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:50,966
- Are you okay? There are two more.   - My god.

150
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:52,894
She shops more than I do.

151
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,405
Din is surely going bankrupt.

152
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:58,806
- Here you are.   - Where's mine?

153
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:02,286
This is yours, Ms. Wiwan.

154
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:05,926
I got your signatures.

155
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,126
Thank you.

156
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:16,806
Don't accept my packages next time. I'll do it myself.

157
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:20,926
He's going bankrupt.

158
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:49,126
Thanks.

159
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:50,886
Good morning, Ms. Apo.

160
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:52,806
Do you know me?

161
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:55,086
I do. You're famous.

162
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,846
I'm famous?

163
00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:58,907
Come on. I'll help.

164
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:00,526
Wait.

165
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:02,326
Who are you?

166
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,606
My name is Tin, a friend of Mueang.

167
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,046
Mueang's friend?

168
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,206
Don't judge me.

169
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:16,566
I'm not a spoiled brat like him.

170
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,086
That's great.

171
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:23,566
Let me help.

172
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:26,006
Okay.

173
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:27,766
Thank you.

174
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:47,941
Who's making the noise?

175
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,566
Tin.

176
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,166
- Oh, hey!   - Hi.

177
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:07,646
What are you doing?

178
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:09,726
Ms. Apo wants a peephole.

179
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:12,486
Can't you install it yourself?

180
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,046
I can. Your friend offered to help.

181
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:16,646
I don't want to refuse.

182
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,286
Leave my friend alone.

183
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:19,966
I don't like to share my friends.

184
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,813
Are you still keeping me to yourself?

185
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:25,246
You know I have no friends these days.

186
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:27,206
Are you done talking?

187
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:29,885
Tin, let's get the peephole installed.

188
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:31,878
Okay. I'll...

189
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:34,159
- I'll keep this one.   - Use this one.

190
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,606
Okay.

191
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:39,966
Get it in. Right there.

192
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,486
- Tin.   - Get it in tightly.

193
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,726
Get it in. Is it tight now?

194
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,126
- Okay.   - Whoa!

195
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,606
Thank you, Tin.

196
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,366
(She's using her sweet voice.)

197
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:58,286
You're welcome. Tell me if you need anything.

198
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:00,109
(You're falling for her.)

199
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,846
You really are nice.

200
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,326
You're not like your friend at all.

201
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,165
Hey!

202
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:12,846
What are you doing? You're going to ruin my shirt. Let go.

203
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,006
- Come on! You stay right there!   - Hey!

204
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:16,766
I'll be back to talk to you.

205
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:19,726
Mueang.

206
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,486
When will you stop this madness, my friend?

207
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,966
- Come right here!   - Mueang!

208
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:30,646
- Mueang!   - Let's talk. What's the deal with you?

209
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:35,406
You seduced my dad, and you want to seduce my friend too?

210
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:38,733
Is that all you think about?

211
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:40,366
Well, it's all you think about!

212
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:43,006
Was it fun last night?

213
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:46,046
- What fun?   - Don't play dumb.

214
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:47,886
I saw my old man going into your room.

215
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:53,686
Well, it was okay. I slept well.

216
00:17:55,486 --> 00:17:57,686
How could you say that? Have you no shame?

217
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,462
Why would I be ashamed?

218
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:03,246
We're family. Should I tell you about it?

219
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:07,006
- Don't.   - Last night, Mr. Phudin brought me a key...

220
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,326
I said don't tell me.

221
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,766
After that...

222
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:15,003
- After that... After... - No!

223
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:17,406
I'm going to tell you. You're going to love this.

224
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:21,646
Don't you want to hear? Listen!

225
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:23,446
What's wrong with you?

226
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:25,486
You really don't want to hear?

227
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,806
I don't!

228
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,406
I want to tell you.

229
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,086
If you want to tell someone, go write an adult novel.

230
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,886
Mr. Phudin's plan really works.

231
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:50,126
You probably know why I came in.

232
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,566
Close that so you don't get woken up by the sunlight in the morning.

233
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:11,326
This one too.

234
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:16,766
That's more like it.

235
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,926
Thank you.

236
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,246
Come with me.

237
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:26,766
Come on.

238
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:37,286
This door connects to another bedroom.

239
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,286
I'll be sleeping in there tonight.

240
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,926
Mueang will think I'm sleeping in your room.

241
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:44,166
He won't bother you.

242
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:48,966
- I see.   - Do you agree?

243
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,286
Absolutely.

244
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,499
Good. Then...

245
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:56,883
This is the key to your room. Keep it.

246
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:59,806
You can be sure no one can unlock your room now.

247
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,206
Thank you, Mr. Phudin.

248
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,086
Okay. Good night.

249
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,726
Good night.

250
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:19,830
I said don't tell me!

251
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,446
And you still did!

252
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:30,046
Mueang!

253
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:32,006
Mueang.

254
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:34,326
Mueang!

255
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:38,326
Mueang!

256
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,166
- Mueang!   - Whoa!

257
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:43,686
Mueang!

258
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:45,566
So, you really won't talk to me?

259
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,126
What are you doing? This is not Songkran.

260
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,966
I'm still furious.

261
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,526
You're feeling the heat in your heart.

262
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:59,726
All the water in the world won't cool you down.

263
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:02,246
Aren't you going to stop me?

264
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:04,766
I'm all wet. Are you really my friend?

265
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,286
I know you. If I try to stop you, you will do it even more.

266
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:10,366
- Let me help you, then.   - No!

267
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,798
You're in too deep.

268
00:21:14,414 --> 00:21:17,798
Some people move on in circles, but they move.

269
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:21,445
You stay in the same spot. One spot by one.

270
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,846
You have more spots than a Dalmatian now.

271
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,366
I'm not a dog.

272
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:28,966
I don't even like her anymore.

273
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,886
- You're bold.   - How?

274
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,726
You're bold to lie to me again!

275
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:35,206
I'm trying to figure her out, okay?

276
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:39,206
At this point, you might as well install a camera in her room.

277
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:41,526
- It's illegal.   - That was sarcasm!

278
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:45,006
Are you really going to keep stalking her?

279
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,406
It doesn't work.

280
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:50,686
It's good you realized.

281
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:52,366
I need to change my plan.

282
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:54,022
What did you realize?

283
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:58,246
At first, I wanted some proof. I've had enough now.

284
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,206
I will drive her out of here.

285
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,406
- Come in.   - Thanks.

286
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:17,646
How is it? Think you can work in this room?

287
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,926
There's everything I'll ever need.

288
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:26,206
I did my homework, didn't I?

289
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:29,686
You sure did.

290
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:33,086
From now on, this is your office.

291
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:34,804
Let's go.

292
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:37,426
Let's talk about work in my office.

293
00:22:37,653 --> 00:22:38,917
Okay.

294
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:44,606
Mueang.

295
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:46,486
You should leave Apo alone.

296
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:49,526
I will when she leaves my house.

297
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:52,686
So she's going to be all you think about and nothing else?

298
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:54,406
What do you want now?

299
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:57,446
Have you seen this notice?

300
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:02,366
I saw this on the way here this morning.

301
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:04,886
What notice?

302
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:06,926
Read it.

303
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:12,606
"Notice on the closing of Bo Phloi.

304
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:18,317
As Bo Phloi will be renovated to attract tourists by Phudin Park,

305
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:23,206
under supervision by Mr. Phudin and the new board member,

306
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:30,246
those involved in Bo Phloi's business must evacuate as soon as possible."

307
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:33,886
Your dad is evicting you, and you have no idea.

308
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,086
I need to see the area first.

309
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:53,366
I'll see what it's like and what needs to change.

310
00:23:53,486 --> 00:23:55,686
As for my building project,

311
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,046
I want to make use of the existing structure as much as possible.

312
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:02,526
I'll send you the designs I had in mind.

313
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,686
Mueang, it's you?

314
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:13,726
Am I seeing things, or are you really here in my office?

315
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,766
I'm talking about work with Apo.

316
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:20,806
Come here. You need to listen.

317
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:22,686
Cancel this project.

318
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:25,646
Don't think that you can easily close down Bo Phloi.

319
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,973
I don't think I can do as you wish.

320
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,134
You can do as you wish.

321
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:33,606
You brought in someone who can't do her job.

322
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,606
Are you accusing Apo of incompetence?

323
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:41,726
This is her field of study.

324
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:49,286
I mean, you appointed her to the board.

325
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,566
I need her to learn my job.

326
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:53,206
You refused to help,

327
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:55,726
so I needed to find someone who could take over me.

328
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:58,126
She's taking over your business?

329
00:24:58,726 --> 00:24:59,846
That's right.

330
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:07,046
I get it now.

331
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,966
I understand

332
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:10,926
why you're getting married all of a sudden.

333
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:15,206
You needed her to motivate me, didn't you?

334
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,726
You used her as bait to lure me to your job.

335
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:23,486
You got it wrong.

336
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:25,606
How about I start tomorrow?

337
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:27,366
So she can leave.

338
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,486
Do you think I believe you?

339
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:31,388
As soon as I fire Apo from this job,

340
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:33,366
you will leave the job as you always do!

341
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:36,206
I have Apo now.

342
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:37,885
My intention is for Apo

343
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:39,806
to replace you.

344
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:44,526
I need someone who gives 100% to my business.

345
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:47,406
Since you don't care about it,

346
00:25:47,757 --> 00:25:49,246
and I have Apo now,

347
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:51,006
I don't need you anymore.

348
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:54,966
You can leave now. I need to work.

349
00:25:57,206 --> 00:25:59,566
Where were we just now?

350
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:06,966
I can't let you do that.

351
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:10,006
I said leave. I need to work!

352
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:14,926
This business

353
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:17,886
is built with my mom's sweat and tears.

354
00:26:18,422 --> 00:26:21,046
I won't let an outsider take over.

355
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,966
Especially her Bo Phloi,

356
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:28,126
I won't let anyone mess with that!

357
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:55,566
Hey, how did it go?

358
00:26:55,686 --> 00:26:57,966
Go home. Leave me alone for now.

359
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:13,566
See? My family is a soap opera, right?

360
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:23,286
This business

361
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:26,086
is built with my mom's sweat and tears.

362
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,326
I won't let an outsider take over.

363
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:31,894
Especially her Bo Phloi,

364
00:27:32,326 --> 00:27:35,286
I won't let anyone mess with that!

365
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:57,326
If that's the case, work on your designs and present it to me.

366
00:27:58,884 --> 00:28:00,166
Okay, sir.

367
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:03,566
Sita will represent me when working with you.

368
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:07,326
Please work with her so we can keep the work systematic.

369
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:10,046
Okay, sir.

370
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:14,166
Is there anything wrong?

371
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,966
Are you worried about Mueang?

372
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,806
I am.

373
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:21,726
I didn't know Bo Phloi belonged to his mom.

374
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:25,966
I get why he's so angry at me now.

375
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:29,166
I don't think you should take that seriously.

376
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,646
Mueang is like a kid who refuses to grow up.

377
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,006
I don't think so.

378
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:36,006
Bo Phloi just means a lot to him.

379
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:40,126
It probably represents the memory of his mom.

380
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,486
I think that's it for today.

381
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:49,286
You can leave now. I have some more work to do.

382
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,926
You might think I don't need to know,

383
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:59,766
but I think it's best that I know you guys' problems.

384
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:03,886
At least I can prepare for what to expect.

385
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,446
You need me to trust you.

386
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,166
I need you to trust me too.

387
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,126
Please sleep on that.

388
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:16,406
Wait.

389
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,366
Sit down.

390
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:56,846
(Originally, Bo Phloi belonged to Nudi.)

391
00:29:57,014 --> 00:29:58,326
(She was my wife.)

392
00:29:58,782 --> 00:30:00,686
After we got married,

393
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:02,886
she put me in charge of her business.

394
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:06,966
Unfortunately, we have different views.

395
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:08,806
We couldn't work together.

396
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:13,766
(Mueang felt the fallout.)

397
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:18,926
(Growing up, he always saw me and Nudi arguing.)

398
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:27,966
I disagree.

399
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:30,926
I'm not asking for your opinions.

400
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,286
I don't have a say in anything anymore, do I?

401
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,086
Mining the same way is outdated.

402
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,526
Nobody does that anymore.

403
00:30:38,654 --> 00:30:41,286
Do we need to follow the world with everything?

404
00:30:41,446 --> 00:30:43,205
Yeah, because we do business!

405
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:44,366
We need to look ahead.

406
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:46,366
You're not looking ahead.

407
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:49,046
The faster we mine, the faster it depletes.

408
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:51,126
But we can make more money.

409
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:53,966
Since when has money been more important than my happiness?

410
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,646
Money can bring us happiness.

411
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:01,126
It does. It brings happiness. Money's important, but what we have

412
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,766
brings us enough happiness as it is, right?

413
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:06,606
Why do you have to want more?

414
00:31:06,717 --> 00:31:10,206
Every woman wants her man to make more money.

415
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,052
You're the only one

416
00:31:12,183 --> 00:31:14,646
who never sees your husband's worth.

417
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:48,446
(It must have been really uncomfortable for Mueang.)

418
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,686
Mueang hates my guts.

419
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:58,286
He blamed me for his mom being gone.

420
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,446
Did you divorce Mrs. Nudi?

421
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:04,709
I didn't.

422
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:08,006
So where is Mrs. Nudi now?

423
00:32:11,317 --> 00:32:12,686
She's gone.

424
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,086
Look. I'll be working in Bangkok for a few days.

425
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:32,366
Please come back soon.

426
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,766
I'll miss you.

427
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:36,566
There, there.

428
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:44,286
I'll be back soon.

429
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:46,166
Be safe, Mom.

430
00:32:46,695 --> 00:32:48,006
Okay.

431
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:49,886
I have to go.

432
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,341
Drive safely, Mom.

433
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:19,224
Be back soon!

434
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:20,686
I'll miss you!

435
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,566
I'll be back soon.

436
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:45,838
(Did Mueang's mom pass away?)

437
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,950
(Yes, she did.)

438
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:19,766
(Notice on the Closing of Bo Phloi)

439
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,206
(Stop)

440
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:22,926
(thinking)

441
00:34:25,516 --> 00:34:26,646
(about it.)

442
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:50,166
Be back soon.

443
00:34:50,366 --> 00:34:51,566
I'll miss you.

444
00:34:51,766 --> 00:34:53,646
I'll be back soon.

445
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:50,846
Say what you have to say.

446
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:53,886
I'm here to assure you.

447
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:56,566
I don't intend to take anything from your mom.

448
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:59,286
I had to interfere with Bo Phloi

449
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,126
because it's my work.

450
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,886
Why would you make that excuse to me?

451
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:05,966
I don't want you to misunderstand

452
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,246
that I intend to come here to hurt you.

453
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:10,206
Even if it's unintentional,

454
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:11,926
I'm already hurt.

455
00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:14,086
I already felt it.

456
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:19,966
I know how you feel.

457
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,526
I lost my parents at a young age too.

458
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:26,206
I know it's hard.

459
00:36:27,197 --> 00:36:28,326
So...

460
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:30,446
My dad told you something, didn't he?

461
00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:32,126
What did he say?

462
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,886
My mom died, so was I a problem child?

463
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:36,974
Did you feel sorry for me?

464
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:38,958
No!

465
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:41,141
I just want to tell you I understand.

466
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:43,126
Don't say you understand me!

467
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,886
I hate it so much

468
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,806
when someone says they understand!

469
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:49,926
They don't know anything!

470
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:54,046
I really regret it.

471
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:55,846
I regret being a fool

472
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,806
who thought you were the only one who could listen to me.

473
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:03,806
You need someone who listens to you like I'm doing

474
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:05,566
and just lets it all out.

475
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:11,245
What if I can't find that someone?

476
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,246
What do I do?

477
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:17,046
Actually,

478
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:19,926
you are the very last person on earth

479
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:21,910
who should know about me.

480
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,766
Do you remember your rules from our trip?

481
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:38,486
I want the same rules here.

482
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:41,246
Never talk to me about anything personal.

483
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,366
Leave. You're not welcome here.

484
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:07,726
Go.

485
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,766
I said go!

486
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:05,149
(It's my sixth day in this house.)

487
00:39:09,062 --> 00:39:11,406
(Why did my ending my problems)

488
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:14,766
(cause more problems to others?)

489
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:19,446
(Mueang helped me through my pain,)

490
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:23,246
(but I hurt him in return.)

491
00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:44,926
("Don't forget why you came here.")

492
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:48,126
("I want to go home,)

493
00:39:49,117 --> 00:39:51,286
(but it's not really a home anyway.")

494
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:54,966
("Why is the world so small?)

495
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,486
(Mueang and Mr. Phudin of all people?")

496
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,566
("You can't make everyone on earth understand you.")

497
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:36,766
(Even if you hate me, I have to do it.)

498
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:38,886
("Even if you hate me,)

499
00:40:39,757 --> 00:40:41,157
(I have to do it.")

500
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:05,566
Hello, Mr. Tin? Where are you? Can you come in?

501
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,726
I can't. I told you I'm going to a tree fair in Bangkok.

502
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:10,246
Yeah. That's right.

503
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:12,606
Why? What's wrong with your young master now?

504
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:15,126
He had a fight with Ms. Apo!

505
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:17,446
Again? What was it about this time?

506
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:21,046
I don't know, but Young Master seems really angry at her.

507
00:41:23,053 --> 00:41:24,206
Now,

508
00:41:25,454 --> 00:41:27,526
he's smashing his head against the wall.

509
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:30,966
Let him be.

510
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:32,326
Is it okay, Mr. Tin?

511
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:35,246
(It's okay. He's not angry at Ms. Apo.)

512
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,966
Believe me. He's angry at himself.

513
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,326
(Did I overdo it?)

514
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:46,206
(Those eyes...)

515
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:51,766
(Those are the eyes of those who care.)

516
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:58,526
No!

517
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,166
I was right!

518
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,646
Mr. Tin.

519
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,046
He's talking to himself now.

520
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:08,086
As if you haven't seen that before.

521
00:42:08,221 --> 00:42:10,326
No, I won't give in.

522
00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:12,846
I won't give in!

523
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:15,486
Aum! Come here!

524
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:17,846
Mr. Tin, Young Master's calling. I have to go.

525
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:21,686
Yes, Young Master?

526
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,286
It's time for the mission.

527
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:25,766
Yes, sir.

528
00:43:06,446 --> 00:43:07,566
Son.

529
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,366
Have you apologized to Ms. Stepmother?

530
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:13,206
I haven't. I haven't seen her since that day.

531
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:16,886
Son, you were just following Young Master's order. Don't worry.

532
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:20,286
- Right, Boem?   - I don't know. I'm just dancing.

533
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:22,646
I don't know. I'm just dancing!

534
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,286
"Following orders" is not an excuse, right?

535
00:43:26,453 --> 00:43:29,126
It's not. If something had happened to Ms. Stepmother,

536
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,686
you would have been an accomplice.

537
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:34,086
- You're right.   - Yeah.

538
00:43:35,765 --> 00:43:37,006
Look, Son!

539
00:43:37,126 --> 00:43:39,526
Mrs. Sita said there's a meeting today.

540
00:43:39,765 --> 00:43:41,765
You can see her there.

541
00:43:56,606 --> 00:43:58,286
No one's here yet.

542
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:01,126
Yeah, and it's almost time.

543
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,366
What do you do, Son? Are you really going to wait for her?

544
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,766
I think we should come back later.

545
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:12,808
- Let's go.   - Wait! What if we see her?

546
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:14,366
We can get it done.

547
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:18,334
No one's coming.

548
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:19,966
- What are you doing?   - Oh!

549
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:21,365
- Aum!   - Aum!

550
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:23,006
Hi, guys.

551
00:44:23,295 --> 00:44:24,686
- What do you want?   - What do you want?

552
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:26,446
I don't want anything.

553
00:44:26,982 --> 00:44:29,086
Don't judge me like that.

554
00:44:29,438 --> 00:44:33,686
You ghost! I know Young Master sent you here to do something ghastly.

555
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,646
- Tell me what you're here for.   - Tell us.

556
00:45:02,806 --> 00:45:04,206
Can you reach Mueang?

557
00:45:04,606 --> 00:45:06,446
He won't pick up the phone.

558
00:45:06,926 --> 00:45:08,926
That boring nephew.

559
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,486
He's being dramatic again.

560
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:13,886
Forget him.

561
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,886
I'll do this myself!

562
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:31,646
Din, I need a minute.

563
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,606
- What is it now?   - Well...

564
00:45:37,061 --> 00:45:39,246
Why is Apo attending this meeting today?

565
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:41,286
Why not? Is there a problem?

566
00:45:41,526 --> 00:45:43,376
There is. The problem is that

567
00:45:43,511 --> 00:45:45,126
it's about money.

568
00:45:45,206 --> 00:45:47,286
Should she be aware of that matter?

569
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:48,937
That's not what the meeting is about.

570
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:51,646
Oh? So what is it about?

571
00:45:51,742 --> 00:45:53,486
We're talking about the new project.

572
00:45:56,574 --> 00:45:58,886
New project?

573
00:46:00,006 --> 00:46:02,926
Since you mentioned money,

574
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,999
I can change the topic of this meeting.

575
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:08,406
Let's find out who's scamming the company, shall we?

576
00:46:16,332 --> 00:46:20,926
You don't need to change it. The previous topic is fine. Yeah? Right?

577
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,023
Yeah, that's right. Let's stick to that!

578
00:46:25,104 --> 00:46:29,286
Let's go. Come on! Let's start the meeting. Quick...

579
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,406
Mueang!

580
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:39,246
How did you get here?

581
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:43,246
Mueang.

582
00:46:44,406 --> 00:46:45,566
Mueang.

583
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:47,206
Mr. Mueang.

584
00:46:49,886 --> 00:46:51,566
Everyone, listen carefully.

585
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,446
I'll be working here,

586
00:46:55,366 --> 00:46:57,086
starting from today.

587
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,166
You said you'd be working here. What do you mean?

588
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:13,726
I mean what I said.

589
00:47:13,966 --> 00:47:15,566
Don't pretend you don't understand.

590
00:47:15,718 --> 00:47:17,446
I know you need me, old man.

591
00:47:17,646 --> 00:47:18,886
I need you?

592
00:47:18,982 --> 00:47:20,806
You sure are confident.

593
00:47:21,646 --> 00:47:22,846
Of course.

594
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:25,357
I know that place better than anyone.

595
00:47:25,517 --> 00:47:27,174
How could you not consult me?

596
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,566
So you have given your approval.

597
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:30,926
Not yet.

598
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:32,766
I need to see the plan first.

599
00:47:33,006 --> 00:47:35,206
Then I'll decide if I approve it or not.

600
00:47:35,526 --> 00:47:38,046
I don't need to seek your approval.

601
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:41,126
If you want the project to go smoothly, don't go against me.

602
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:53,405
Din, I think it's good to have Mueang helping us.

603
00:47:53,486 --> 00:47:57,166
Apo is still new. He can give her useful information.

604
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:03,566
What do you say, Apo?

605
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:05,926
Do we need him?

606
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:10,246
Truly, we don't.

607
00:48:14,421 --> 00:48:17,806
If you want to help,

608
00:48:18,446 --> 00:48:19,806
we welcome you.

609
00:48:21,741 --> 00:48:22,966
Okay.

610
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,246
Please work together nicely.

611
00:48:26,485 --> 00:48:28,286
Don't let me see you two fight.

612
00:48:28,422 --> 00:48:29,566
Everyone,

613
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,286
please follow the company's motto.

614
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:33,926
"Believe the president.

615
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:35,326
The work will be efficient.

616
00:48:35,407 --> 00:48:36,926
We will be triumphant."

617
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:38,606
Applause.

618
00:48:41,245 --> 00:48:44,086
Give a round of applause! Now!

619
00:48:51,573 --> 00:48:52,846
That motto sucks.

620
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:54,645
It really does.

621
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:56,046
"Believe the president?"

622
00:48:56,245 --> 00:48:58,926
What does that mean? Does everyone have to agree with Mr. Phudin?

623
00:48:59,077 --> 00:49:00,126
Isn't that a dictatorship?

624
00:49:00,277 --> 00:49:01,766
It is a dictatorship.

625
00:49:01,926 --> 00:49:03,766
"The work will be efficient." What's that?

626
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,766
Even a kid can come up with a better motto.

627
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:07,206
"We will be triumphant."

628
00:49:07,326 --> 00:49:09,406
Wait. What do we have to beat?

629
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:10,726
If I can change one thing,

630
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,126
this motto will be the first thing I'll change.

631
00:49:13,238 --> 00:49:14,406
Right!

632
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:18,446
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

633
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:24,166
You can ask me anything about Bo Phloi.

634
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:28,126
I asked all I needed to in the meeting.

635
00:49:29,477 --> 00:49:31,286
- Was that all?   - Yes.

636
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:34,206
You can leave now.

637
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,126
- Are you dismissing me?   - Yeah.

638
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,886
I volunteered to help you.

639
00:49:43,726 --> 00:49:46,726
Ta-da! Sis!

640
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:50,806
Num! May! Thanks for coming.

641
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:53,006
You called. Of course, we'd come.

642
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:56,126
I love you guys.

643
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:02,286
My real assistants are here. You can leave now.

644
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,566
Look. This project is really big. Have you read my emails?

645
00:50:09,662 --> 00:50:10,846
We have.

646
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,766
Then let's start right away.

647
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:17,869
Whoa! Start now? Do you want us to work right out the bat?

648
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,967
- Can't I get some rest?   - We have to sit and chill.

649
00:50:21,048 --> 00:50:24,873
- Hello!   - Welcome to Chanthaburi.

650
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,686
Did you lose weight? You look better. Are you in love?

651
00:50:32,526 --> 00:50:34,086
She sets her standards high.

652
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:37,086
So when she falls,

653
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,166
she shrinks to this size.

654
00:50:41,682 --> 00:50:42,926
Ignoring me, huh?

655
00:50:43,288 --> 00:50:44,886
She acts like such a boss.

656
00:50:46,894 --> 00:50:48,966
Why would I follow her order?

657
00:50:50,788 --> 00:50:52,166
Young Master.

658
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:54,677
I have done what you asked.

659
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,206
This way, Young Master.

660
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,926
Let's go.

661
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:03,206
Did Young Master really tell us to do this?

662
00:51:04,078 --> 00:51:05,806
Why is he so cruel?

663
00:51:05,887 --> 00:51:09,256
Don't say it! You're too loud. You'll get us in trouble.

664
00:51:09,337 --> 00:51:12,286
- It's true!   - Guys! Young Master is here!

665
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:15,806
- Good afternoon!   - Good afternoon!

666
00:51:18,947 --> 00:51:20,326
This is not an order.

667
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:22,366
I'm asking you a favor.

668
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:23,726
Roger that, sir!

669
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:26,686
What about the rest of you?

670
00:51:27,613 --> 00:51:30,806
I feel sorry for Ms. Stepmother, Young Master.

671
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,006
Wait.

672
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,246
Who told you to call her Ms. Stepmother?

673
00:51:36,462 --> 00:51:38,723
I just called her by her title, Young Master.

674
00:51:38,806 --> 00:51:40,085
How is that her title?

675
00:51:40,989 --> 00:51:42,527
I have only one mother.

676
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:44,246
All of you have one mother.

677
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:48,320
Don't call that woman my mother again, got it?

678
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:50,246
- Got it, sir.   - Louder!

679
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,046
- Got it, sir!   - Got it, sir!

680
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:53,212
Good.

681
00:51:54,532 --> 00:51:56,526
- Does anyone have any objection?   - Boem!

682
00:51:57,861 --> 00:51:59,126
Darn you!

683
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:03,606
I think we shouldn't bully Ms. Stepmother...

684
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:05,932
I mean Ms. Apo, sir.

685
00:52:06,013 --> 00:52:07,166
Who told you to bully Apo?

686
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:08,526
Aum did!

687
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:12,694
You wanted us to prank Ms. Stepmother...

688
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:16,206
I mean Ms. Apo and get her out of here, didn't you?

689
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,046
You got it all wrong.

690
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,566
Why did you twist my words?

691
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:23,446
I'm sorry. I misunderstood, Young Master.

692
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:27,126
Let's clear this up. Listen to me.

693
00:52:27,997 --> 00:52:30,166
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

694
00:52:30,373 --> 00:52:34,366
If you have proof of Apo doing any misdeed or being suspicious,

695
00:52:34,661 --> 00:52:36,661
report it to me immediately.

696
00:52:37,902 --> 00:52:39,686
- That's it!   - That's it!

697
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:41,566
Yeah! That's it!

698
00:52:41,862 --> 00:52:43,726
Anything you report

699
00:52:44,005 --> 00:52:46,206
will be rewarded.

700
00:52:59,238 --> 00:53:01,287
Great!

701
00:53:01,383 --> 00:53:03,246
I'll do that, sir.

702
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:10,526
Aum. Next time, don't spread fake news.

703
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:13,406
Well, I was just helping you drive her out.

704
00:53:13,526 --> 00:53:15,726
I didn't mean any harm, Young Master.

705
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:19,886
Be careful next time. I could be in trouble.

706
00:53:20,173 --> 00:53:21,486
Yes, Young Master.

707
00:53:22,054 --> 00:53:23,526
Are you hungry, sir?

708
00:53:24,526 --> 00:53:26,286
No. I'll eat with Tin.

709
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:29,566
Mr. Tin is not coming,  Young Master.

710
00:53:30,022 --> 00:53:32,022
- Where is he?   - He's in Bangkok, sir.

711
00:53:32,207 --> 00:53:33,646
- Bangkok?   - Yes.

712
00:53:33,894 --> 00:53:35,606
He left some food with me.

713
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:38,486
What is it?

714
00:53:39,462 --> 00:53:40,606
Here you are.

715
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:42,086
Huh?

716
00:53:43,222 --> 00:53:44,686
These are all vegetables.

717
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:46,766
Look at this.

718
00:53:48,108 --> 00:53:51,326
(You're an adult now. Eat some veggies, my dear friend.)

719
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,086
Tin!

720
00:53:55,558 --> 00:53:59,606
I want grilled meat!

721
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:03,166
(Hi. My name is Tin.)

722
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:04,926
(I need your advice on something.)

723
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:07,766
(The thing is,)

724
00:54:07,973 --> 00:54:09,526
(I ran into a woman)

725
00:54:09,918 --> 00:54:13,166
(who suddenly unlocked my hidden critic skill.)

726
00:54:14,342 --> 00:54:16,966
How did you grow up? How have you survived?

727
00:54:17,078 --> 00:54:20,766
(Guys, I can't believe there is a person like this in the world.)

728
00:54:22,454 --> 00:54:23,726
(Okay.)

729
00:54:24,045 --> 00:54:26,045
(I'll need to explain the background.)

730
00:54:28,455 --> 00:54:29,983
Oppa!

731
00:54:30,086 --> 00:54:32,406
I want to marry you, Oppa.

732
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,566
(I may look like an Oppa. I look gentle.)

733
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:37,206
(What do they call it?)

734
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:39,086
(Wholesome guy, right?)

735
00:54:40,966 --> 00:54:43,286
(There is a rarely known fact about me.)

736
00:54:43,853 --> 00:54:46,286
(I was part of a critic duo in high school.)

737
00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:48,450
(Firstnet@Games)

738
00:54:52,933 --> 00:54:56,086
(By critic, I don't mean I criticize without reasons.)

739
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:59,566
(I'm just ready to call out what is not right.)

740
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:03,406
Is this a road or the surface of Mars?

741
00:55:04,141 --> 00:55:05,557
I need to report this.

742
00:55:07,495 --> 00:55:09,495
Report.

743
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,326
Whoa!

744
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:21,086
It's shaking me inside out.

745
00:55:22,287 --> 00:55:24,813
The world must know about this.

746
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:26,726
This! And this!

747
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:29,966
Report!

748
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,766
(Alright. Back to where we were.)

749
00:55:33,982 --> 00:55:36,206
(I was leaving the tree fair.)

750
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:38,166
(I was walking to my car.)

751
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,646
(She suddenly bumped right into me.)

752
00:55:41,926 --> 00:55:43,086
(At first,)

753
00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:44,686
(I wasn't angry.)

754
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:46,046
(It was an accident.)

755
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:48,046
The floor is not leveled.

756
00:55:48,686 --> 00:55:50,046
Such a bother.

757
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,206
Leveled floors don't exist in Bangkok.

758
00:55:52,293 --> 00:55:53,526
(However,)

759
00:55:53,846 --> 00:55:56,246
(she doesn't seem to feel remorse.)

760
00:55:57,797 --> 00:56:00,126
I was looking at my phone, so I tripped.

761
00:56:00,246 --> 00:56:02,646
How much is this? I'll pay you.

762
00:56:03,477 --> 00:56:05,486
- It's fine.   - Good. Okay.

763
00:56:05,549 --> 00:56:07,886
Miss, won't you apologize?

764
00:56:07,982 --> 00:56:10,286
Apologize? What did I do wrong?

765
00:56:10,853 --> 00:56:12,566
You bumped right into me!

766
00:56:14,446 --> 00:56:15,686
It wasn't my fault alone.

767
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:19,126
It's true I was looking at my phone, but the floor is to blame too.

768
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,646
(I was almost speechless.)

769
00:56:22,566 --> 00:56:24,366
Okay. The floor is not good.

770
00:56:24,462 --> 00:56:26,662
You didn't watch where you go. That's why you bumped into me.

771
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:28,286
Shouldn't you say sorry?

772
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:30,166
Are you hangry or what?

773
00:56:31,366 --> 00:56:33,806
It's just a plant. Why do you have to be upset?

774
00:56:34,246 --> 00:56:35,966
That's too far. We're not friends or anything.

775
00:56:36,078 --> 00:56:37,926
Wait.

776
00:56:38,749 --> 00:56:42,846
How did you grow up? Have you always been like this? How have you survived?

777
00:56:45,705 --> 00:56:47,486
Looks like you won't listen.

778
00:56:51,406 --> 00:56:53,046
Come out. I'm at the parking lot.

779
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:55,366
I'm with some weirdo.

780
00:56:55,942 --> 00:56:58,131
I'm a weirdo? It's bold of you to say that.

781
00:56:58,212 --> 00:56:59,450
You're the weirdo here.

782
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:01,846
If I'm a weirdo, no one is normal in this world.

783
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:03,366
You're the only weirdo. See?

784
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,186
I won't talk.

785
00:57:05,878 --> 00:57:08,446
- What's wrong, Ms. Ing?   - Talk to this man for me.

786
00:57:08,527 --> 00:57:10,246
Don't let him follow me.

787
00:57:11,686 --> 00:57:14,086
- Hey, Miss!   - Hey!

788
00:57:14,461 --> 00:57:15,886
Why are you following her?

789
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:20,646
(All my life,)

790
00:57:20,742 --> 00:57:23,566
(no one has made me this furious.)

791
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,446
(Does such a person exist?)

792
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:32,806
(Hi. My name is Ing. I need your advice on something.)

793
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,566
(The thing is,)

794
00:57:34,726 --> 00:57:39,574
(I'm beautiful and perfect in every way.)

795
00:57:39,926 --> 00:57:43,221
(However, I have one weakness.)

796
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:50,078
(I'm clumsy.)

797
00:57:50,841 --> 00:57:52,326
(Clumsiness)

798
00:57:52,695 --> 00:57:55,166
(is permanent. It can't be cured.)

799
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:04,906
(How do you think I can fix this?)

800
00:58:05,134 --> 00:58:07,486
(Okay. Before we talk,)

801
00:58:07,598 --> 00:58:10,406
(let me clear up your misunderstanding.)

802
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,886
Happy anni...

803
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,006
Apo!

804
00:58:15,046 --> 00:58:20,126
(You may think I like to hook up with someone's boyfriend.)

805
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:28,446
Apo, listen to me.

806
00:58:28,837 --> 00:58:32,566
(In fact, I do like to hook up,)

807
00:58:32,647 --> 00:58:34,686
(but not with someone's boyfriend.)

808
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,446
(I didn't know he already had a girlfriend.)

809
00:58:37,526 --> 00:58:40,606
(So, in a few minutes,)

810
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:43,166
(I'll dump him hard for you to see.)

811
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:49,286
Whoa! Ms. Ing.

812
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,926
I'm sorry.

813
00:58:52,038 --> 00:58:56,366
Forget it. Explain it to her. Don't ruin my reputation.

814
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,126
I already broke up with her.

815
00:58:59,846 --> 00:59:01,046
So what?

816
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:03,206
You can be at ease.

817
00:59:03,287 --> 00:59:06,326
Maybe you want to take it further.

818
00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:08,566
I told you. I don't like commitment.

819
00:59:08,742 --> 00:59:11,126
I don't like persistence, either.

820
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:14,766
What happened here stays here. Don't let it affect your job.

821
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,886
Remember, I'm your boss.

822
00:59:17,446 --> 00:59:18,846
You're my employee.

823
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,406
Yes, Ms. Ing.

824
00:59:20,526 --> 00:59:23,166
Don't let your ex say I broke you up

825
00:59:23,286 --> 00:59:24,686
because I did not.

826
00:59:24,926 --> 00:59:26,726
If my brand and reputation are ruined,

827
00:59:26,886 --> 00:59:28,566
you can't possibly pay for that.

828
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:32,366
- Ms. Ing.   - It's over!

829
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:40,526
(That's what really happened.)

830
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:43,646
(Usually, I can deal with every problem)

831
00:59:44,006 --> 00:59:47,486
(except my own clumsiness.)

832
00:59:49,477 --> 00:59:51,606
(Whether it's an invisible door,)

833
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:56,726
(a sewage cover,)

834
01:00:03,045 --> 01:00:04,646
(or a step,)

835
01:00:06,286 --> 01:00:08,166
(I have been through it all.)

836
01:00:15,271 --> 01:00:19,519
- Won't you apologize?   - (Today is a day unlike any other.)

837
01:00:19,607 --> 01:00:21,767
How did you grow up? Have you always been like this?

838
01:00:21,855 --> 01:00:23,855
How have you survived?

839
01:00:24,006 --> 01:00:27,566
(All my life, I've never been pointed in the face.)

840
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:32,046
Looks like you won't listen.

841
01:00:33,477 --> 01:00:34,553
What's wrong, Ms. Ing?

842
01:00:34,646 --> 01:00:37,486
Talk to this man for me. Don't let him follow me.

843
01:00:38,796 --> 01:00:40,590
- Hey, Miss!   - Hey!

844
01:00:47,766 --> 01:00:49,806
(A guy like him is like a mosquito.)

845
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:54,246
(You think you can taste my blood. Never!)

846
01:01:07,726 --> 01:01:08,966
It's done.

847
01:01:09,213 --> 01:01:10,686
That man is gone.

848
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:16,126
When are you going to Chanthaburi, Ms. Ing?

849
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,166
Why do you ask?

850
01:01:18,606 --> 01:01:20,446
Maybe

851
01:01:21,342 --> 01:01:22,966
you want me to accompany you?

852
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:26,446
Yeah. It's good to have an expert with me.

853
01:01:28,013 --> 01:01:29,206
Where are we going, ma'am?

854
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:30,766
Phudin Park.

855
01:01:33,645 --> 01:01:35,086
Why am I getting chills?

856
01:01:35,933 --> 01:01:37,566
Do you need to take a dump?

857
01:01:38,213 --> 01:01:39,886
Probably.

858
01:01:40,006 --> 01:01:41,886
Whoa! Are you crazy?

859
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:45,726
- The AC is too cold. Turn it down.   - Okay.

860
01:01:48,534 --> 01:01:51,966
Sis, when will they send us the updated plan?

861
01:01:52,622 --> 01:01:54,206
What time is it now?

862
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,246
Can we make it in time?

863
01:01:56,654 --> 01:01:58,366
I'll ask them.

864
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:03,566
Sis, Mr. Phudin often changes his mind, right?

865
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,366
He seems like that type.

866
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:07,583
We have to wait for the update from Mrs. Sita.

867
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:08,966
This won't be easy.

868
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:12,941
(Updated Plan Report)

869
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:14,886
- There it comes.   - Really?

870
01:02:16,686 --> 01:02:19,046
- I'll forward it to you guys.   - Okay.

871
01:02:19,646 --> 01:02:22,406
(Updated Plan Report)

872
01:02:24,021 --> 01:02:26,877
Mueang sent another copy? It's exactly the same.

873
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,126
("Dear Ms. Apo,)

874
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:33,886
(Mr. Phudin would like to change the size of the area detailed as follows.)

875
01:02:34,647 --> 01:02:36,086
(Fill up all the existing mines.)

876
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,446
You made a copy of the plan.

877
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,526
I'll send you the updated one.

878
01:02:43,646 --> 01:02:44,886
Use the one from Mueang.

879
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,886
- Roger that!   - Roger that!

880
01:02:47,357 --> 01:02:48,557
Let's do it!

881
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:30,766
Hey, guys!

882
01:03:31,326 --> 01:03:33,366
We don't sleep till the job's finished.

883
01:03:34,006 --> 01:03:36,046
We don't sleep till the job's finished.

884
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:38,326
Keep fighting, guys! You can do it!

885
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:40,566
Fight!

886
01:03:47,301 --> 01:03:50,414
It's done! We survived!

887
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,046
Thanks, guys.

888
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:06,206
You can go home and get some rest.

889
01:04:07,749 --> 01:04:09,486
I'll call you after I present this.

890
01:04:09,567 --> 01:04:11,286
Yeah.

891
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,246
Thank you.

892
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:16,285
- Good night, sis.   - Thank you.

893
01:04:16,372 --> 01:04:18,846
Sweet dreams. We're going home.

894
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:20,606
See you.

895
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:22,486
I'm spent!

896
01:04:25,543 --> 01:04:26,886
Yeah.

897
01:04:27,525 --> 01:04:28,886
Yeah.

898
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:49,446
(I'm really getting old. I can't pull an all-nighter anymore.)

899
01:04:49,566 --> 01:04:52,566
(I want to get a long sleep.)

900
01:05:01,014 --> 01:05:02,446
Wake up!

901
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,366
I'm not ready to fight you now.

902
01:05:11,301 --> 01:05:13,286
I'm not ready for a fight.

903
01:05:14,015 --> 01:05:16,046
I'm not here for a fight.

904
01:05:17,181 --> 01:05:18,766
I'm here to wish you luck

905
01:05:18,933 --> 01:05:20,246
and hope your work

906
01:05:20,486 --> 01:05:21,766
goes well.

907
01:05:22,757 --> 01:05:25,366
- Is this a curse?   - No.

908
01:05:26,174 --> 01:05:29,526
You're presenting today. Good luck.

909
01:05:39,834 --> 01:05:41,206
What's with him?

910
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:44,405
It feels like I got cursed.

911
01:05:53,152 --> 01:05:56,126
Mueang, are you attending the meeting today?

912
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,086
Of course. I won't miss this one.

913
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,366
Right now, I need my breakfast.

914
01:06:12,534 --> 01:06:15,046
If you're ready, you can start.

915
01:06:15,206 --> 01:06:16,206
Okay.

916
01:06:18,446 --> 01:06:21,966
The Maze Project will be built on the existing Bo Phloi.

917
01:06:22,149 --> 01:06:25,826
Overall, the project will be a slope.

918
01:06:26,022 --> 01:06:30,466
There will be a community of villagers and miners.

919
01:06:30,772 --> 01:06:34,726
You can travel to the project by car or plane.

920
01:06:34,846 --> 01:06:37,486
Land at U-Tapao International Airport and rent a car.

921
01:06:37,606 --> 01:06:41,326
You can also come with Phudin Park's own shuttle bus.

922
01:06:41,494 --> 01:06:43,966
Next is the area analysis.

923
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:45,926
Wait.

924
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:48,326
Why is the entrance at the same spot?

925
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:53,646
You didn't say it needed to change.

926
01:06:53,766 --> 01:06:57,438
I told you to make the entrance to the right.

927
01:06:57,606 --> 01:07:00,046
Sita, did you not tell Apo?

928
01:07:01,246 --> 01:07:02,846
It was in the email.

929
01:07:04,614 --> 01:07:05,926
It wasn't.

930
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:14,286
Here, Sita wrote a remark at the bottom.

931
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:15,950
Wait a sec.

932
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:26,166
(Change the entrance)

933
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,046
(from the left side of the project,)

934
01:07:28,134 --> 01:07:29,406
(the one by the main road,)

935
01:07:29,534 --> 01:07:31,726
(to the right side of the project.)

936
01:07:33,286 --> 01:07:34,726
(How did I miss that?)

937
01:07:35,902 --> 01:07:37,529
(Updated Plan Report)

938
01:07:42,477 --> 01:07:45,406
Mueang sent another copy? It's exactly the same.

939
01:07:48,126 --> 01:07:50,966
Since it's wrong, should we continue the presentation?

940
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:55,246
Should we cancel the meeting?

941
01:08:06,686 --> 01:08:08,726
If I win your approval,

942
01:08:08,813 --> 01:08:12,326
you and I will leave each other alone. Let's have a competition.

943
01:08:12,406 --> 01:08:14,126
Are you challenging me?

944
01:08:17,883 --> 01:08:20,846
Looks like a champ is going down today.

945
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:22,326
You talk big.

946
01:08:22,486 --> 01:08:24,366
Win first, talk later.

947
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:27,366
Why are they fighting?

948
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:32,606
Don't you get it? Two tigers can't share one mountain.

949
01:08:32,718 --> 01:08:33,806
What's the challenge this time?

950
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:35,686
Are you up for it? Bring it on!

951
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:36,835
Bring it on!

952
01:08:36,932 --> 01:08:38,366
I don't know her at all.

953
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:41,006
You should get to know her once again, then.

954
01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:44,726
(If Mueang knows that I've dug up a lot of information on him,)

955
01:08:44,974 --> 01:08:46,606
(will he be scared of me?)
