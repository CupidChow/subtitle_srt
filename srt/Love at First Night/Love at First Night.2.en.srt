1
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,286
Are you traveling alone?

2
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:04,086
- Let's travel together, shall we?   - Sure.

3
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:08,302
(I thought it was a good night for both of us.)

4
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,622
(However, I was wrong.)

5
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:16,246
I want you to meet my soon-to-be new wife.

6
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,526
Who is she?

7
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:20,446
You can ask her yourself. There she is.

8
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:22,006
I said, do you love my dad?

9
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,286
I don't love him.

10
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:26,206
- If you don't, why are you getting married?   - Mueang.

11
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:30,566
Don't pull this stunt again.

12
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:33,166
My sense tells me she's up to no good.

13
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,747
You need to keep an eye on her. Tell me what you know.

14
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,406
I found out how she came to marry Uncle Din.

15
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:59,726
- (How is it?)   - It's pretty smooth, Aunt Da.

16
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,646
There's no problem at all.

17
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,470
Is the house big? Let me see it.

18
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,526
(They must be so rich.)

19
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,086
(Can I visit you?)

20
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,526
(Get back here, Ri.)

21
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:18,365
- Get back. Po.   - Hey, Om.

22
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:20,566
Run away, Po. Just run.

23
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:23,246
Where can I run to, Om?

24
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:27,246
(America, Canada, or Australia. Just move to another country.)

25
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,406
- Take this.   - Ouch.

26
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:32,726
No matter where you run to, I can take you back anyway.

27
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:35,766
(And don't forget this. Don't disappear on me again.)

28
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,366
(And don't try to live happily by yourself.)

29
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:43,286
You have to pay back for what your parents did.

30
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:50,286
(Aunt Da)

31
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,326
(Aunt Da - 20 missed calls, Ri - 15 missed calls, Om - 10 missed calls)

32
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,806
(Aunt Da)

33
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:13,726
(Where are you? You didn't answer my call.)

34
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,566
I'm sorry, Aunt Da.

35
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,766
I muted my phone.

36
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,526
Come back home right now.

37
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,286
What happened, Aunt Da?

38
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:24,006
What?

39
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,966
I'll get back as soon as I can.

40
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,326
I might be there by 3 pm.

41
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:40,166
Aunt Da, has Mr. Phudin arrived?

42
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,086
Don't be stupid. You would have seen him by now.

43
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:46,166
Why did he suddenly decide to demand money from us again?

44
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:48,406
We pay him every month.

45
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,893
I don't know. Isn't it strange?

46
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,806
You're back?

47
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,366
Ri.

48
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:01,726
What have you been doing all day long? You're so useless.

49
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:06,926
Ri, were you sleeping here again?

50
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:10,086
Well, you weren't here.

51
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:14,086
No one took me upstairs, so I slept here.

52
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:17,206
- Are you alright?   - Yes. It's just a hangover.

53
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,166
- Mom.   - What?

54
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:32,245
I'm hungry. Do we have any food?

55
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,966
I have nothing for you.

56
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:37,406
You only sleep and eat all day long.

57
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,409
Here.

58
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,886
I'm so glad that my servant is back here again.

59
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:55,166
Hey.

60
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,486
Po isn't your servant, Ri.

61
00:06:58,046 --> 00:06:59,446
That's disgusting.

62
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:06,406
Om, you play games all day long. You've never made money to help Mom.

63
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:08,566
This is my way of making money.

64
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,286
When I'm famous, don't talk to me anymore.

65
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:15,169
There aren't many people who watch your livestream.

66
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:17,846
- You suck.   -  No, you suck.

67
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:21,486
You're looking down on my dream. Look at Po.

68
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:24,846
Although she isn't my real sister, she's taken care of me better than you.

69
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,326
- Om, you... Come here.   - What are you doing? What?

70
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:35,046
- Stop.   - Come here. Come back here.

71
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:37,486
- Let me go.   - Wait.

72
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,806
Stop!

73
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:42,126
Mr. Phudin is here.

74
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:47,205
Mom, did you tell Po the truth?

75
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:50,669
What truth?

76
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,246
The money you made...

77
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:53,806
Mom used it all for gambling.

78
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:01,566
Is that true, Aunt Da?

79
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,086
I haven't paid Mr. Phudin back for half a year now.

80
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:16,180
Rita, go open the gate. Quick. Yes, you.

81
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:19,262
Go right now. Now.

82
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:24,206
Half a year, Aunt Da? How could you do this?

83
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,806
You have no right to say that to me.

84
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:30,948
I've sacrificed myself for your family for long enough. If your parents

85
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:33,285
didn't take a loan and used me as a guarantor,

86
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:34,786
I would never be in this much trouble.

87
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:37,622
Do you understand?

88
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:49,846
Welcome.

89
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:53,006
Hello, Mr. Phudin.

90
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:56,166
I miss you so much. We haven't seen each other for a long time.

91
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,206
I'm here to talk to you.

92
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:02,806
Please come into our house, Mr. Phudin.

93
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:05,406
Do we have any space to talk together? Just two of us.

94
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:08,686
Yes.

95
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,206
I'm sorry

96
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:15,886
for not paying you back for half a year.

97
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:18,566
We'll try to find money to pay you back again.

98
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:21,326
Where can you find it?

99
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:22,966
Aren't you unemployed?

100
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:28,086
I know that you're the only one who's trying to make money,

101
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:29,526
not Darin.

102
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,886
For today,

103
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:33,846
I have an offer for you

104
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,486
in exchange for canceling your debt.

105
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,590
I'm not sure if you'll be interested.

106
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:40,126
What offer?

107
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:41,806
You'll marry me.

108
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,686
- Marry you?   - Yes.

109
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,966
- The condition is that you...   - No.

110
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,526
No.

111
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:54,052
I won't marry you to pay off our debt.

112
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,726
Don't you want to listen to it first?

113
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,246
No.

114
00:09:57,398 --> 00:10:01,734
No matter how good it is, I won't do it.

115
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:04,486
Well, I can't force you.

116
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,766
I promise I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

117
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:11,246
Please give me around three or four months.

118
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,006
If you change your mind, contact me.

119
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,604
Yes.

120
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:27,526
Goodbye.

121
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:40,166
Po, what did Mr. Phudin say?

122
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:48,046
Two million baht by next month?

123
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:51,846
Why is it that quick? Did you make him upset?

124
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:55,726
You're the cause of this, Mom. Stop blaming this on Po.

125
00:10:57,468 --> 00:10:59,966
I asked you if you made him upset.

126
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:09,406
I rejected Mr. Phudin's offer.

127
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:10,990
What offer?

128
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:15,046
He...

129
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,006
He asked me to marry him.

130
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:26,446
Ew, marry him to pay off our debt?

131
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,646
Po, it's good that you refused him.

132
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,366
No one will make you marry him.

133
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:36,006
You must marry Mr. Phudin.

134
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:38,006
Mom.

135
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:40,566
Mom, are you crazy?

136
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,846
Yes, you can call me crazy.

137
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:46,126
You should do what Mr. Phudin tells you to do.

138
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:50,126
- Mom, this is too much.   - What?

139
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,446
It's not too much, is it?

140
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:53,926
Think about it.

141
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,486
How many times

142
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:58,526
have both of you lost your opportunities because of this debt?

143
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,366
Rita and Om didn't get to study abroad because of you.

144
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,526
That's true.

145
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,076
Mom, can you stop talking about this?

146
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:13,366
Isn't it true? If I didn't have to use my money for this debt,

147
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:15,206
you'd be comfortable by now.

148
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:17,646
Anyway, Po isn't at fault for that.

149
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:20,966
She didn't even know that her parents took a loan.

150
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,093
They took a loan for her education.

151
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:26,885
I'll tell Mr. Phudin that you change your mind.

152
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:27,966
Mom.

153
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,966
I beg you, Mom.

154
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:34,182
Think about it. If she died in a car accident one day,

155
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:36,886
wouldn't we be in debt for all our lives?

156
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,806
Even if you have to get married,

157
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:44,686
even if you have to do anything for him,

158
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:47,126
you have to handle it yourself.

159
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:49,526
Stop dragging everyone else down with you.

160
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:51,246
Understand?

161
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:56,526
Mom, we have to talk about this.

162
00:12:58,246 --> 00:12:59,606
It's true.

163
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:20,126
(Stop dragging everyone else down with you.)

164
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:32,646
Ri, what's wrong?

165
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:38,606
It's fine, Ri. I'm here now.

166
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:40,726
Don't talk to me.

167
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:45,206
I don't get to learn ballet now because of you.

168
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,166
Mom wouldn't let me anymore.

169
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:04,766
(Rita and Om didn't get to study abroad because of you.)

170
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,966
Mom, can I go to summer school in England?

171
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:10,646
Do we have money?

172
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:13,006
What did you use to buy your handbag?

173
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:17,806
Handbags are more expensive every year. It's a worthwhile investment.

174
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:20,286
Can you invest in my future, then?

175
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:23,326
My friend's parents all sent them there.

176
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:25,366
I'm sorry

177
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:28,206
that I'm not as good as your friend's parents.

178
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:33,326
Can you pay for it first? I'll try to return the money to you later.

179
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:36,686
If you can do that,

180
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:39,486
you should just pay off our debt first.

181
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:56,606
I'm sorry, Om.

182
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:57,886
For what?

183
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,766
You didn't get to study in England.

184
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,806
You worried too much.

185
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:04,046
It's not your fault.

186
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:07,646
I'll try to save money for you.

187
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:10,526
No. It's not a big deal.

188
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:13,286
I'll just apply for a scholarship.

189
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,926
I'm pretty good, you know?

190
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,486
Trust me.

191
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,886
You should smile.

192
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:23,686
Smile.

193
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:31,566
(If I didn't have to use my money for this, you'd be comfortable by now.)

194
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:41,406
Yes. I'll transfer it to you at the end of the month.

195
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,446
For sure. Trust me.

196
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:47,206
Yes.

197
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:58,381
Hello, Aunt Da.

198
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:00,886
You're back?

199
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:02,406
Aunt Da.

200
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:05,846
I'll transfer the money from tutoring this month to you.

201
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,486
It's not enough.

202
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:11,766
Do you know

203
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,357
that every time I see your face,

204
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:14,886
what do I think of?

205
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:16,566
"Unfortunate."

206
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:21,326
The only thing I can see from your face is that word.

207
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:23,326
It's on there.

208
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,446
I'm so unfortunate...

209
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:10,535
Po, don't cause trouble for others when you grow up.

210
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,526
Yes, Mom.

211
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:14,726
The trouble that came from us

212
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:16,996
has to be handled by us.

213
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:19,526
Don't let others take the fall for it.

214
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:20,765
Understand?

215
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,166
Yes.

216
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,286
Did you change your mind?

217
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,686
I'll gladly do anything

218
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,646
that you want me to do, except marriage.

219
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:16,706
We're in the digital age. Do we still have people marry to pay off debt?

220
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:22,526
What do you say? Aren't you here to pay off your debt?

221
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,965
So, what then?

222
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:27,486
Pathetic.

223
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,966
Yeah. My life is pathetic like that.

224
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:36,646
Why are you like this?

225
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:38,766
You don't look like that kind of person.

226
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,566
The woman you used to know

227
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:44,806
and the woman I am right now is different.

228
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:46,606
Which one is the real you?

229
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:51,213
Hey.

230
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,526
Which one is the real you?

231
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:58,126
This one.

232
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,006
I know it looks crazy,

233
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,446
but don't judge anyone's decision before you know them well enough.

234
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:08,126
It's not that I don't know you well enough.

235
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:10,166
I just don't know you at all.

236
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:17,365
You...

237
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:19,526
You're just greedy.

238
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:22,486
And what's wrong with that?

239
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,846
I thought you'd love yourself more than this.

240
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,166
- Didn't your parents teach you to value yourself...   - Hey.

241
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:32,686
You can rebuke me however you want but don't talk about my parents.

242
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,086
Then, stop doing this.

243
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:36,686
There are millions of other ways to pay off debt.

244
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,966
I chose this way.

245
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:43,006
You don't know everything, Mueang.

246
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:46,166
Your world and mine are different.

247
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:52,126
You can marry me instead.

248
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,894
If my dad owns your debt, it means I also own your debt.

249
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:02,246
I won't marry you.

250
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:07,126
- Why?   - It's...

251
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,166
It's...

252
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:15,646
It can't be you, that's why.

253
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,926
I already agreed to marry your dad. Understand?

254
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,046
Stop talking about useless stuff. Can we talk about the main matters now?

255
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,662
Can you forget about that night?

256
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,286
Think of it as...

257
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:35,446
As something fun that we did in the heat of the moment.

258
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:36,846
Like...

259
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:38,766
A one-night stand.

260
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:41,366
- Can you?   - No. No way!

261
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:45,246
Stop talking about that night. I don't want to hear it anymore.

262
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:47,238
Okay.

263
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:48,766
Then...

264
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:52,086
We can make it like nothing happened.

265
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:55,366
We've never known each other before. Alright?

266
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:58,006
Who do you think you are? Trying to argue with me.

267
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:00,726
Mueang.

268
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:03,286
Don't make it harder than this.

269
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:05,086
Do you want an easy way out?

270
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:08,166
I'm sorry that I don't want to do that.

271
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,966
Don't ever think you can come, stay, and leave easily.

272
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,166
Nothing will be as easy as you think.

273
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:36,046
Sita, tell Wi and Apo to meet me in the living room.

274
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,326
Okay.

275
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:48,446
Stop.

276
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,926
Open the door.

277
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,646
Just say what you want.

278
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:05,926
Ten million baht for a new wife. Is it worth it?

279
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:08,966
Our opinions on what's worth it are different.

280
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,886
You might run out of money easily, you know?

281
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:14,406
- Thank you for your concern.   - I'm not concerned.

282
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:17,606
So, are you jealous?

283
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:19,886
I'm possessive of my mom's legacy.

284
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,006
What do I need to do to stop this wedding?

285
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:27,526
You're even worse than I thought.

286
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:29,286
Tell me.

287
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:32,086
Do you have ten million, then?

288
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:33,766
So, you want ten million?

289
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:36,926
You really don't want me to get married that much?

290
00:22:37,262 --> 00:22:38,366
Yes.

291
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:39,766
Why?

292
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:41,329
It's not like that.

293
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,926
You can get married, but you can't get married to her.

294
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:49,406
I'm sorry. Apo...

295
00:22:50,197 --> 00:22:51,606
She's just my type.

296
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,126
Even if you have 100 million baht, I won't change my mind.

297
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:59,526
Then, why did you say that?

298
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:04,526
It's fun for me to see you furious. I like it.

299
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:14,526
What did you do to Apo?

300
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:17,166
No.

301
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:18,766
I didn't do anything.

302
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:21,606
I saw everything. You took away Apo's food.

303
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,271
Am I a dog or what?

304
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,437
This.

305
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:28,966
Did you set up cameras inside the house?

306
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:33,246
You aren't the only one here who can buy stuff online.

307
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:41,486
Apologize to Apo now.

308
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,126
Quick.

309
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,166
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,166
Your punishment is

311
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:57,086
that from now on, you have to receive your packages by yourself.

312
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:00,126
Din...

313
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,716
I can't wake up in time for that.

314
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:06,646
Then, don't buy anything anymore. Our house is full of stuff now.

315
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:09,229
If I find out that you

316
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,046
do something to Apo again,

317
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:14,966
I'll cut you off from every streaming service.

318
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:24,606
Don't cry. Take this.

319
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:27,046
Let's go, Apo.

320
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,406
Please stop.

321
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:39,598
If not, you won't get to watch the Korean series.

322
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:48,526
Darn it.

323
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:52,406
I have to apologize to you again.

324
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,286
My house is full of weirdos.

325
00:24:56,126 --> 00:25:00,446
Are you sure you're alright? You looked stressed earlier.

326
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,246
I'm okay.

327
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:04,955
Look.

328
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:09,206
I'm the only one who can help you in this house.

329
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:11,606
If you aren't honest with me,

330
00:25:11,941 --> 00:25:13,446
I won't know how to help you.

331
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:19,966
I want time.

332
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:22,526
Everything happened too fast.

333
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:24,246
I'm still a little confused.

334
00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:29,606
Sure.

335
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:31,886
You can think about it again.

336
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:35,446
I won't change my mind.

337
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:39,166
I have already decided on something. I won't turn back to it.

338
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:54,326
Why is he

339
00:25:54,796 --> 00:25:57,046
acting like a heartbroken man?

340
00:25:59,262 --> 00:26:01,326
Just go to bed. I'll handle it.

341
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:08,486
Good night.

342
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:09,966
Good night.

343
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:36,326
Don't be too dramatic.

344
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:39,686
I'm not, though.

345
00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:41,406
Do you think you can trick me?

346
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:42,726
When we were in grade two,

347
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,926
you stole an eraser from your crush.

348
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:46,718
I still caught you.

349
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,086
I know what you feel.

350
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:53,066
You already told me everything

351
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:55,446
about how good you felt at the sea.

352
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,806
Why don't you just tell Uncle Din about you and Apo?

353
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:03,246
So that it'll be over.

354
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:05,366
I'll watch her for now.

355
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:10,526
You still haven't stopped.

356
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:13,046
- Stop what?   - You haven't stopped sulking.

357
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,886
I'm not sulking.

358
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,345
Look.

359
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:24,926
I'll tell you something.

360
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:27,926
You didn't like her. You were just charmed.

361
00:27:28,926 --> 00:27:31,326
If she didn't come here for a week,

362
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:33,166
you'd already forget about her.

363
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,726
(It's something fun that we did in the heat of the moment.)

364
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,286
(Like a one-night stand.)

365
00:28:11,477 --> 00:28:14,206
(You said you didn't have your phone.)

366
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:18,086
(You're addicted to social networks. Delete it. Did you delete it?)

367
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:24,206
(If I could turn back the time...)

368
00:29:24,526 --> 00:29:26,366
Someone is drowning.

369
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:35,061
I'll help you.

370
00:29:49,358 --> 00:29:50,726
Thank you so much.

371
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:15,206
(It'd be better if we didn't meet each other.)

372
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,086
Human hearts

373
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:33,766
are really difficult to understand.

374
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:35,886
That's why I don't want to get involved with people.

375
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:38,606
Do you agree with me?

376
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:41,486
What do you say, Pinkie?

377
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,566
Jenny.

378
00:30:44,604 --> 00:30:45,726
Peter.

379
00:30:47,654 --> 00:30:48,926
Alexandra.

380
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,086
You agree with me, right?

381
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:26,326
Everyone, Boss' new wife is here.

382
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:31,646
This is serious. She's really beautiful.

383
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:38,086
Boss brings his new wife here. I repeat, Boss brings his new wife here.

384
00:31:38,718 --> 00:31:43,086
Oh my god. Our boss is pretty good, isn't he?

385
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,606
We have to get back here. He'll introduce her to us when they're done.

386
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,206
- Roger that.   - Roger that.

387
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:52,486
Roger that.

388
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:58,486
She's Apo, my soon-to-be wife.

389
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:03,486
Hello.

390
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,726
- Hello.   - Hello.

391
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:07,766
I'll be in your care.

392
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,230
Yes.

393
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:12,366
From today onwards, Apo will work here.

394
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,806
I'd like all of you to get to know her.

395
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:16,366
- Of course.   - Of course.

396
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,926
Good. Everyone, you can go back to work now except Son.

397
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:24,126
Me?

398
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,246
What's wrong, Boss?

399
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:34,686
Has Mueang gone to Bo Phloi today?

400
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:37,086
He hasn't gone there.

401
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:41,366
Then, when you're done with work, please take Apo there.

402
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:44,006
- Let's go.   - Let's go.

403
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:47,286
That place.

404
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,686
Of course, Boss.

405
00:32:58,307 --> 00:33:01,126
Oh my god.

406
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:04,646
He's here.

407
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:07,966
What's wrong? Hey...

408
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,686
- Ouch. What's wrong with you?   - Come here. Come here now.

409
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:16,517
Son, what did Boss tell you?

410
00:33:16,686 --> 00:33:20,686
Boss told me to bring Ms. Stepmother to Bo Phloi.

411
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:22,886
- Stepmother?   - Yes. What's wrong?

412
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,926
Soon, Ms. Apo will become our young master's stepmother.

413
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,126
Of course, we have to call her that.

414
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,139
Well, I understand that.

415
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:33,606
But why did Boss want you to take her to Bo Phloi?

416
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:37,486
Yeah. Won't she get killed by Young Master?

417
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:40,726
Poe, are you sadistic or what?

418
00:33:40,806 --> 00:33:44,646
My young master is a nice guy with a nice face.

419
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:47,206
He's not cruel or sadistic like you thought.

420
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:50,006
Hey, you're just taking your superior's side.

421
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:52,046
Your young master

422
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:53,446
is really scary, you know?

423
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:54,966
Since I worked here,

424
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:57,005
I haven't seen him smile ever.

425
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:58,926
But I have.

426
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,686
I've seen his cold smile.

427
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:06,126
- How?   - He was smirking like this.

428
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:09,686
He looked down like this.

429
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,246
He also said...

430
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,460
What are you talking about?

431
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,606
- I really saw that.   - It's you who's scary.

432
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,566
Let me say something.

433
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:22,806
As a so-called annoyed person,

434
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,646
I'm not annoyed. I'm just hot.

435
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:26,206
You're annoyed right now.

436
00:34:26,286 --> 00:34:27,406
Your eyes are scary.

437
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:30,909
If you want to protect him that much, you should just be his girlfriend.

438
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,806
Then, should we break up now, Poe?

439
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:36,209
Ging, you can't say that to me.

440
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,166
- You challenged me yourself.   - It hurts, you know?

441
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:42,191
You're always trying to make yourself look tough.

442
00:34:42,272 --> 00:34:44,205
- Ging.   - You...

443
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:47,815
- Hey, stop that. You're like dogs.   - Please stop.

444
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:49,686
Stop, you Pomeranian. Stop, you Shih Tzu.

445
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:52,606
You two just can't break up every day like this.

446
00:34:52,686 --> 00:34:55,606
I always have a headache from being with you.

447
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,886
All of you, get to work. The park is almost open now.

448
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:01,499
If there's anything, I'll tell you all about it.

449
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,846
Ging, let's go. Come with me.

450
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:04,993
Go.

451
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:06,766
You have to make up with me later.

452
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,646
Look at her.

453
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:12,846
You also have to go to work, Poe. Gosh.

454
00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:19,366
Young Master.

455
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:23,846
What's this sign? Why is it here again?

456
00:35:24,213 --> 00:35:26,406
Right, Young Master.

457
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:28,246
Bad news.

458
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:29,726
Boss is going on an offensive.

459
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:31,566
He's taking Ms. Stepmother...

460
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:33,726
He's taking Ms. Apo to the park.

461
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:36,326
Hello? Young Master?

462
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,686
Is he sleeping?

463
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:46,646
Is this another hibernation?

464
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:50,526
You told me to tell you if anything happened.

465
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:02,286
Here you are. The car is here for you, Ms. Stepmother.

466
00:36:03,846 --> 00:36:06,886
You don't have to call me that. Just call me Po.

467
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,433
I can't do that.

468
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:10,086
Boss told me to do that.

469
00:36:10,206 --> 00:36:12,526
If not, we'll get scolded by him again.

470
00:36:13,998 --> 00:36:15,366
Ms. Stepmother.

471
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:18,094
We can go now.

472
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:22,166
Are you sure you'll go there?

473
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:23,446
Yes.

474
00:36:24,326 --> 00:36:25,806
Why? What's wrong?

475
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:27,486
It's nothing.

476
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:30,406
There's nothing at all.

477
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:32,726
Shall we go?

478
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:43,406
This is it.

479
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:46,206
This is the place where Boss wants me to take you to.

480
00:36:46,406 --> 00:36:48,806
Young Master's Bo Phloi.

481
00:36:49,246 --> 00:36:50,806
You can take a look at it.

482
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:52,446
Yes.

483
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:57,766
- This way?   - Yes, that way.

484
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:19,526
This is it, Ms. Stepmother.

485
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:25,406
Follow this path, and you'll see Bo Phloi.

486
00:37:26,149 --> 00:37:28,406
- Thank you.   - Please wait a second.

487
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:30,686
Are you sure you'll go there?

488
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:32,886
Yes. I have to go there anyway.

489
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:36,243
Well, you can go there first.

490
00:37:36,324 --> 00:37:38,526
I'll come back with cold water for you.

491
00:37:38,718 --> 00:37:40,166
- Thank you.   - You're welcome.

492
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:42,726
You can go inside.

493
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,326
Good luck.

494
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:49,086
(The way to Bo Phloi)

495
00:38:23,006 --> 00:38:24,686
Have you asked the owner before coming in?

496
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,326
What you're doing is a crime.

497
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:29,166
Do you think you can come here easily?

498
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:32,366
I'll let you know that Son is my people.

499
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,686
(I heard Apo was at the park.)

500
00:38:37,237 --> 00:38:38,886
(Do you have anything to tell me?)

501
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:49,966
(You read my message but didn't answer it. Suspicious.)

502
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:51,606
Oh no...

503
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:57,566
(I'm sorry.)

504
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,054
(So what?)

505
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:11,766
(Boss asked me to take Ms. Stepmother to Bo Phloi.)

506
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:19,566
Why are you here?

507
00:39:21,038 --> 00:39:22,406
I'm here for work.

508
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:23,846
What work?

509
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:27,606
I have to change this place to become a new spot for Phudin Park.

510
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,086
I'm the landscape architect for this project. Let me go.

511
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:38,406
I don't allow it. Get out of here right now.

512
00:39:41,566 --> 00:39:44,366
If you don't get out, I'll throw you in a hole.

513
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:46,686
You're good at threatening someone.

514
00:39:46,782 --> 00:39:48,086
It's not a threat.

515
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,886
I'm serious.

516
00:39:55,713 --> 00:39:57,286
Fine. I'll leave.

517
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:03,749
I'm leaving

518
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:05,286
not because I'm scared

519
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:06,966
but because my work is done.

520
00:40:07,886 --> 00:40:10,406
We can talk later when your mood is better.

521
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,006
I won't talk to you.

522
00:40:13,686 --> 00:40:14,766
Get out.

523
00:40:14,886 --> 00:40:16,766
Get out and don't come back.

524
00:40:17,068 --> 00:40:18,286
Leave.

525
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:34,806
Young Master.

526
00:40:34,942 --> 00:40:36,486
Where have you been?

527
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:39,886
Do you know what he wants her to do at Bo Phloi?

528
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:41,926
I know even more than that.

529
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:43,486
What?

530
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,326
Tell me what you know.

531
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,566
Boss appointed Ms. Apo as an executive.

532
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:55,486
They said she had a 200,000 baht salary.

533
00:40:58,063 --> 00:40:59,646
- A salary of 200,000 baht?   - Yes.

534
00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:02,486
I think she isn't here to pay off her debt.

535
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:04,486
She's here to rob us.

536
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:10,286
Fine.

537
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:12,846
If you want to be a thief that much,

538
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:14,886
we'll see.

539
00:41:24,574 --> 00:41:26,254
Whom did he talk to?

540
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:53,606
Apo!

541
00:41:57,262 --> 00:41:59,166
Where are you?

542
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:00,646
Come out here.

543
00:42:08,202 --> 00:42:09,566
Apo!

544
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:10,926
I'm here.

545
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:16,046
You're the one who summoned me here.

546
00:42:16,206 --> 00:42:17,766
Summoned you here?

547
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:25,726
I was summoned here because of your desire.

548
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:27,926
It's because of your strong desire to make money.

549
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:33,926
That's why I have to come here.

550
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,886
I'll move in and live here.

551
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:40,166
So that I can watch over you.

552
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:43,457
- Watch over me for what?   - I'm not sure now

553
00:42:43,538 --> 00:42:45,006
if you're here to pay off your debt

554
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:46,766
or you're here to rob my dad.

555
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:51,526
It's not wrong for you to want a rich husband.

556
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:54,446
But most of everything here is my mom's legacy.

557
00:42:54,566 --> 00:42:56,126
I won't allow you to take it away.

558
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,974
I didn't come here to take anything.

559
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,006
I'll keep myself close to you.

560
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:05,686
- Are you crazy?   - If you behave suspiciously,

561
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,446
I'll throw you out of the house.

562
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:10,942
From this moment on,

563
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:14,326
you will be under my watch 24/7.

564
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:17,246
What?

565
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:20,446
Mueang.

566
00:43:51,405 --> 00:43:52,646
What's this?

567
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:55,038
What's going on?

568
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:58,246
He's crazy.

569
00:44:05,713 --> 00:44:07,206
(From this moment on,)

570
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:10,366
(you will be under my watch 24/7.)

571
00:44:14,591 --> 00:44:16,766
What should I do?

572
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,446
Why does my stomach always act up

573
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:31,086
whenever I'm stressed?

574
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:35,206
I'm getting goosebumps now.

575
00:44:41,241 --> 00:44:42,982
I can't stand it anymore.

576
00:44:57,886 --> 00:44:59,926
There's another one coming.

577
00:45:07,646 --> 00:45:08,886
What's that sound?

578
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,726
What's this again?

579
00:45:14,246 --> 00:45:16,886
I haven't finished my business yet.

580
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:21,206
It's a sin to stop someone from finishing their business.

581
00:45:23,022 --> 00:45:26,526
Get back. Get back in. Get in.

582
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:37,686
What are you doing?

583
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:42,286
Installing a peephole to watch you.

584
00:45:42,446 --> 00:45:44,046
Do you have to do this much?

585
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:45,326
Yes.

586
00:45:45,718 --> 00:45:47,006
Be nice.

587
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,686
I'm always watching you.

588
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:34,246
You're playing with the wrong person.

589
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,206
It's too obvious.

590
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:22,846
He's acting like he's doing some push-ups.

591
00:48:00,951 --> 00:48:02,406
Coffee or me?

592
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:06,206
Did he just warp? He's too quick.

593
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:20,062
He can't follow me here.

594
00:48:27,206 --> 00:48:29,406
Come out. I need to pee.

595
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:32,606
Darn it. I'm getting crazy.

596
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,486
Come out.

597
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:40,806
Come out.

598
00:48:41,214 --> 00:48:43,948
Go use another toilet. You have a lot of them.

599
00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:46,286
No. I want to use this one.

600
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:49,566
Come out.

601
00:48:55,086 --> 00:48:56,726
I'll break into it.

602
00:49:02,749 --> 00:49:04,566
You can come. I left a big pile of poop in the toilet.

603
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:06,046
Go in.

604
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,606
(For someone like me,)

605
00:49:33,886 --> 00:49:35,406
(whenever I'm curious,)

606
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:37,326
(nothing can stop me.)

607
00:49:37,662 --> 00:49:39,326
(No matter how deep you try to hide it,)

608
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,526
(I'll still dig it up.)

609
00:49:42,478 --> 00:49:45,246
(I have to know if you get close to my dad for...)

610
00:49:45,574 --> 00:49:47,414
(Social network users share posts about "poop relieving medicine.")

611
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,990
Poop relieving medicine?

612
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,526
How could you look at my laptop's screen? That's so rude.

613
00:49:56,814 --> 00:49:58,486
I thought you were doing something suspicious.

614
00:49:58,646 --> 00:50:00,006
You're being secretive.

615
00:50:00,087 --> 00:50:02,606
So, you're just trying to find a way to stop taking poop?

616
00:50:02,687 --> 00:50:05,206
I understand why this place stinks now.

617
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:09,126
You should learn your manners. I can't stand it anymore.

618
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:12,566
You asked your subordinate to follow me all day the other day.

619
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:17,846
You're always using the same trick. You're uncreative.

620
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:20,206
Well, Aum isn't as quick-witted as me.

621
00:50:20,366 --> 00:50:22,526
That's why I have to be close to you.

622
00:50:24,846 --> 00:50:26,932
Why don't you just possess me?

623
00:50:27,013 --> 00:50:29,166
Let your spirit possess my spirit.

624
00:50:29,286 --> 00:50:31,046
So that you'll know what I have on my mind.

625
00:50:33,983 --> 00:50:35,566
Interesting.

626
00:50:36,646 --> 00:50:38,166
And how do I do that?

627
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:39,486
Possessing you.

628
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:42,046
Don't you know I was being sarcastic?

629
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:44,326
Let's begin the ritual.

630
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:01,206
Mueang? Wait. Hey...

631
00:51:02,745 --> 00:51:04,526
What are you doing? You'll get dizzy for sure.

632
00:51:16,246 --> 00:51:17,366
Mueang.

633
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,166
Mueang.

634
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,486
I'll possess you.

635
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:31,830
- Ouch. You...   - This is crazy.

636
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:34,086
- Stop. Come here.   - Don't come closer.

637
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:36,086
Mueang.

638
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:38,640
- Let go of my legs.   - No.

639
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,686
Are you scared that my dad will see you?

640
00:51:41,759 --> 00:51:44,086
I'm scared that all the people here will see us.

641
00:51:44,389 --> 00:51:47,806
It's good, then. They'll realize how close we are.

642
00:51:48,246 --> 00:51:50,206
- Ouch.   - Who's close to you?

643
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:52,741
- You?   - You're crazy.

644
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:54,494
Mueang is here?

645
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:01,446
- Mueang, let me go. You won't let me go?   - No way.

646
00:52:01,527 --> 00:52:03,486
You won't let me go? Fine.

647
00:52:10,896 --> 00:52:12,486
- Stop.   - No.

648
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:18,046
- Mueang, stop. Let me go.   - No.

649
00:52:19,197 --> 00:52:20,486
Darn it.

650
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:24,326
- I won't let you go.   - Why are you this sticky?

651
00:52:24,413 --> 00:52:26,766
Were you a gecko in your last life?

652
00:52:26,854 --> 00:52:28,846
No. But I won't let you go.

653
00:52:30,493 --> 00:52:31,806
- You won't let me go?   - No.

654
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:33,326
If you don't let me go...

655
00:52:36,557 --> 00:52:38,286
Wait. What?

656
00:52:43,448 --> 00:52:45,246
Stop there.

657
00:52:49,982 --> 00:52:52,286
Where? Where is he?

658
00:53:00,326 --> 00:53:02,966
Old man, you're back?

659
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:08,086
What are you doing?

660
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,326
Oh, wow. What a warm welcome for me.

661
00:53:20,454 --> 00:53:21,886
Everyone is here to welcome me.

662
00:53:21,967 --> 00:53:23,486
I'm so touched.

663
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:25,237
Why did you come back?

664
00:53:25,508 --> 00:53:27,606
What? Do I need any reasons?

665
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,246
Stop blabbering.

666
00:53:31,886 --> 00:53:33,886
I'm moving back to live in this house again.

667
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:36,109
- Live in this house again?   - Live in this house again?

668
00:53:36,134 --> 00:53:37,246
Yes.

669
00:53:37,853 --> 00:53:40,206
Do you know the word "homesick?" I miss my home.

670
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:46,686
Who would be stupid enough to believe you? I'll let you answer it again.

671
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:49,926
No. You're the one who doesn't understand my answer.

672
00:53:50,086 --> 00:53:52,446
(You come back to get rid of Apo, right?)

673
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,485
Din,

674
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,740
Mueang already decided he wanted to move back into the house.

675
00:53:58,821 --> 00:54:00,446
Please don't ruin the atmosphere.

676
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:02,473
Wait.

677
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:04,792
Since when have you and Mueang been close?

678
00:54:04,877 --> 00:54:06,846
You've never wanted him to be back.

679
00:54:08,855 --> 00:54:11,686
Well, didn't he say he missed his home?

680
00:54:11,774 --> 00:54:15,006
I also know that you miss your son.

681
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:16,886
Isn't that right, Sita?

682
00:54:16,982 --> 00:54:18,726
I'll let the family handle this.

683
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:20,206
I don't have any opinion.

684
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,206
Well, you should have talked to her first.

685
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:28,406
Din, it's like this.

686
00:54:28,542 --> 00:54:32,566
I know that you also want Mueang to live here again.

687
00:54:32,973 --> 00:54:34,166
Right?

688
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:36,286
You don't mind, right?

689
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:39,046
A dad and son want to spend their time together.

690
00:54:46,725 --> 00:54:48,566
How could I say anything?

691
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:50,166
This is Mueang's house.

692
00:54:50,278 --> 00:54:52,278
Don't you see?

693
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:54,126
Everyone's okay with it.

694
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:55,767
You're the only one who's concerned.

695
00:54:55,886 --> 00:55:00,006
I'm concerned because I know you're back to cause trouble.

696
00:55:00,578 --> 00:55:03,166
What? Please look at my face.

697
00:55:03,326 --> 00:55:04,926
Do I look like a bad guy to you?

698
00:55:10,189 --> 00:55:11,446
- Yes.   - Yes.

699
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:15,966
Are you crazy? But I'm handsome, right?

700
00:55:16,806 --> 00:55:18,246
A handsome man can be a bad guy.

701
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:20,806
If I'm a bad guy, you're also a bad guy.

702
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,852
Your face didn't even get any of the actor genes from me.

703
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:25,226
Which era of actors, anyway?

704
00:55:25,307 --> 00:55:27,252
You can use Google to look it up.

705
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:28,886
Stop.

706
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:31,646
Can we get back to the main topic? We don't have much time.

707
00:55:36,243 --> 00:55:37,446
What do you say?

708
00:55:38,381 --> 00:55:39,806
Are you letting me live here again?

709
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:41,326
You can stay here.

710
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:43,126
See? It's that easy.

711
00:55:43,477 --> 00:55:46,806
Wait. If you ever cause me trouble,

712
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:50,486
I promise I'll throw you out of this house immediately. Understand?

713
00:55:51,238 --> 00:55:52,286
Yes.

714
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:53,550
What did you understand?

715
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:56,268
- I understand what you said.   - What did I say?

716
00:55:56,357 --> 00:55:57,677
- Everything...   - Stop.

717
00:55:59,991 --> 00:56:01,166
Please.

718
00:56:09,382 --> 00:56:10,766
Please lock the door.

719
00:56:16,014 --> 00:56:17,126
Look.

720
00:56:17,326 --> 00:56:20,406
Did anything happen before I came in?

721
00:56:22,157 --> 00:56:25,166
So, you won't let me go? Ouch.

722
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:27,046
- Hey.   - I won't let you go.

723
00:56:29,006 --> 00:56:32,606
Did you set up cameras inside the house?

724
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,166
Why aren't you answering me?

725
00:56:40,286 --> 00:56:42,366
Mueang has been trying to find fault with me.

726
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:45,350
Find fault with you?

727
00:56:56,453 --> 00:56:58,126
I've never thought that

728
00:56:58,221 --> 00:57:00,446
you would cause him to be this restless.

729
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:03,286
Good job.

730
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:10,726
Mr. Phudin, I have something to ask you.

731
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,286
What is it?

732
00:57:12,502 --> 00:57:16,166
What's wrong between you and Mueang?

733
00:57:21,214 --> 00:57:22,422
I'm sorry.

734
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:24,166
I shouldn't have asked.

735
00:57:24,773 --> 00:57:27,846
It's your usual problem between a dad and son.

736
00:57:28,206 --> 00:57:29,846
Why do you want to know that?

737
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:35,046
If you want me to be his stepmother,

738
00:57:35,366 --> 00:57:37,206
I think I should know about it.

739
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,526
That's unnecessary.

740
00:57:39,478 --> 00:57:40,726
Listen.

741
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:42,926
Sometimes,

742
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:44,766
it's not good to know too much of something.

743
00:57:45,111 --> 00:57:46,886
Do you understand what I said?

744
00:57:47,622 --> 00:57:49,366
- Yes.   - Good.

745
00:57:50,877 --> 00:57:54,686
If there's anything I think you need to know,

746
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:56,446
I'll tell you.

747
00:58:15,086 --> 00:58:18,806
Why didn't you agree with me earlier, Sita?

748
00:58:18,934 --> 00:58:22,446
How could you say you didn't want to offer any opinion?

749
00:58:23,565 --> 00:58:26,206
I don't want to say anything that I'm unsure about.

750
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:28,662
There's already an example right here.

751
00:58:28,807 --> 00:58:29,966
If we get challenged,

752
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:32,166
people will say we're stupid.

753
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:37,806
Please stop with your acting.

754
00:58:38,206 --> 00:58:40,726
I know that you hate her.

755
00:58:40,846 --> 00:58:42,766
Instead of helping me chase her away,

756
00:58:42,942 --> 00:58:44,195
you chose to stay silent.

757
00:58:45,384 --> 00:58:47,686
People have different ways to express themselves.

758
00:58:48,806 --> 00:58:50,366
When will you stop being silent?

759
00:58:51,046 --> 00:58:53,606
Do you want to wait for you to be involved first?

760
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:57,406
Sita.

761
00:58:58,332 --> 00:59:02,646
You've been taking care of us since we were children. I know

762
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,006
how much you love my big sister.

763
00:59:05,326 --> 00:59:07,006
You're still here

764
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:10,606
because you want to look after what Nudi has built.

765
00:59:12,702 --> 00:59:15,006
Can you really stand

766
00:59:15,366 --> 00:59:17,086
watching that woman

767
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:20,646
take everything away from Nudi?

768
00:59:21,126 --> 00:59:22,486
I...

769
00:59:23,606 --> 00:59:25,926
I'll let the family handle it.

770
00:59:26,406 --> 00:59:27,646
You...

771
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:29,846
Gosh.

772
00:59:33,859 --> 00:59:36,446
I'm so done. Just do whatever you want.

773
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:38,166
I don't care anymore.

774
00:59:39,726 --> 00:59:42,886
I'll just count on Mueang to handle it for me.

775
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,918
It's 8 pm.

776
01:00:03,525 --> 01:00:05,006
She hasn't come up yet?

777
01:00:14,518 --> 01:00:16,086
Did she just fart?

778
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:26,582
Do you think I'm scared?

779
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:39,886
You can't escape my watchful eyes.

780
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,846
Am I in hell right now?

781
01:01:29,565 --> 01:01:32,446
I'll just borrow this for now.

782
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:36,198
Just you come in.

783
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:43,086
I'll stab you. Stab you. Stab you like this.

784
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:54,606
Phing? Phing.

785
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:56,806
Phing.

786
01:01:56,985 --> 01:02:00,966
Are you in America or hell? You haven't answered my call at all.

787
01:02:01,189 --> 01:02:03,526
Po, calm down.

788
01:02:03,606 --> 01:02:05,326
(You don't have to use the knife to scare me.)

789
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:08,726
I'm sorry. I forgot I had it.

790
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:14,486
Are you an assassin or what?

791
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,326
My fever is pretty bad.

792
01:02:16,453 --> 01:02:19,166
I haven't answered any calls for two days. I was sick.

793
01:02:19,247 --> 01:02:21,326
Really? Are you sick?

794
01:02:22,446 --> 01:02:26,686
It's so frustrating. I've had a fever since I arrived at the airport.

795
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,326
I see. It's a shame. I wish you a speedy recovery.

796
01:02:31,046 --> 01:02:35,006
I'm getting better. What about you? How are you?

797
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:36,926
Have you moved on?

798
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:40,926
(But you already have a man from the sea to heal you, right?)

799
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,046
Heal what?

800
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:46,846
It's bad. It's so bad now.

801
01:02:46,927 --> 01:02:48,486
(Why is it bad?)

802
01:02:48,684 --> 01:02:49,846
Tell me about it.

803
01:02:50,095 --> 01:02:51,166
It's like this.

804
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:58,449
It's over. That's the recap from me. Isn't this bad?

805
01:03:00,646 --> 01:03:01,806
Phing.

806
01:03:02,766 --> 01:03:04,926
Don't tell me you're disconnected.

807
01:03:05,254 --> 01:03:06,486
Phing.

808
01:03:06,646 --> 01:03:08,526
Hello? Phing?

809
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:10,926
(It's not that.)

810
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,526
(I was shocked.)

811
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:17,406
Po, did you choose the hard difficulty when you were born?

812
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:21,172
- Right?   - (Your life is like a drama.)

813
01:03:21,253 --> 01:03:24,006
It's like a drama plot. A female lead

814
01:03:24,126 --> 01:03:25,646
was forced to marry

815
01:03:25,758 --> 01:03:28,286
a man who was as old as your dad because of necessity.

816
01:03:28,374 --> 01:03:30,125
But in a twist of fate,

817
01:03:30,222 --> 01:03:34,686
that man's son is the man you truly love.

818
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:36,166
Hold on.

819
01:03:36,317 --> 01:03:37,486
Who loves him?

820
01:03:37,645 --> 01:03:39,006
Po, I think

821
01:03:39,087 --> 01:03:42,726
you'll learn that you have an incurable disease in three or four months.

822
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:45,206
If not, you might learn that

823
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:47,006
you're the daughter of a wealthy family.

824
01:03:47,087 --> 01:03:48,526
Phing...

825
01:03:49,085 --> 01:03:50,646
I know the ending of this.

826
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:52,006
Tell me.

827
01:03:52,213 --> 01:03:54,326
You will end up with Mueang.

828
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:56,326
Wait. Hold on.

829
01:03:57,076 --> 01:03:58,917
How could it end like that?

830
01:03:58,998 --> 01:04:02,286
It's a happy ending for a romantic drama.

831
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:05,006
I think you're misunderstanding something.

832
01:04:05,126 --> 01:04:07,566
This drama is a drama about murders.

833
01:04:07,662 --> 01:04:09,886
I'm a corpse that's involved in the story.

834
01:04:10,086 --> 01:04:12,326
It's not that bad. Do you know why?

835
01:04:12,454 --> 01:04:14,861
Because you have a friend like me

836
01:04:14,942 --> 01:04:17,006
who'll save your life, Po.

837
01:04:17,126 --> 01:04:20,726
I think you should stop being a YouTuber and become a scriptwriter instead.

838
01:04:21,438 --> 01:04:24,286
Fine. I'll stop joking. I don't want you to be stressed.

839
01:04:24,783 --> 01:04:26,206
When will you come back?

840
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:30,566
Around next month. I have to record my trip to America for my vlog.

841
01:04:30,647 --> 01:04:33,126
(I'll immediately visit my best friend as soon as I'm done.)

842
01:04:33,246 --> 01:04:37,006
Don't be sick. Don't die. Understand?

843
01:04:37,446 --> 01:04:39,006
Please come back soon.

844
01:04:39,206 --> 01:04:40,606
(I love you.)

845
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:43,606
I love you too.

846
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:46,434
You'll survive, alright?

847
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:01,446
It's 11 pm.

848
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,246
- Who is it?   - It's me.

849
01:06:09,326 --> 01:06:11,126
Wait, old man?

850
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:13,886
Why is he here?

851
01:06:17,951 --> 01:06:19,326
Please wait a second.

852
01:06:22,981 --> 01:06:24,406
Let's start with this.

853
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:43,686
You should just go back, old man.

854
01:06:44,086 --> 01:06:45,326
He's so stubborn.

855
01:06:47,766 --> 01:06:49,246
I'm sorry for being late.

856
01:06:52,965 --> 01:06:55,526
It's fine. Can I go inside?

857
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:30,686
So, you really won't talk to me?

858
01:07:31,983 --> 01:07:34,446
- I'm still furious.   - Was it fun last night?

859
01:07:34,606 --> 01:07:36,326
- Should I tell you about it?   - No.

860
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,325
Last night, Mr. Phudin brought me a key...

861
01:07:39,406 --> 01:07:41,326
- I said don't tell me.   - After that...

862
01:07:41,446 --> 01:07:42,726
No...

863
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:46,326
I was looking at my phone, so I bumped into you.

864
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:48,120
How much is it? I'll buy a new one for you.

865
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:51,766
I don't want you to misunderstand that I intend to come here to hurt you.

866
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:53,606
Even if it's unintentional,

867
01:07:53,846 --> 01:07:56,166
I'm already hurt. I already felt it.

868
01:07:56,526 --> 01:07:58,046
(Did I overdo it?)

869
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,526
Cancel this project.

870
01:07:59,607 --> 01:08:01,366
I don't think I can do as you wish.

871
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:03,566
Don't think that you can easily close down Bo Phloi.
