1
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:02,046
Mueang, Apo.

2
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:04,246
Follow and keep an eye on Game.

3
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:07,566
I downloaded the video from the CCTV.

4
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:09,966
We might see Game doing something suspicious in it.

5
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,286
Didn't you want to get back at Apo?

6
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:17,246
If it's about Game, Ing has already called me.

7
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:19,366
Uncle Din.

8
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,126
Hello.

9
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:24,913
Is something the matter with Apo's family earlier?

10
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,886
Yeah, but it's already over.

11
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:33,366
You've handled everything nicely. Good job.

12
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:34,886
Would you be my boyfriend?

13
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,686
Is there a ghost here?

14
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:44,626
You look like you've seen a ghost.

15
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:48,526
Young Master

16
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:50,326
and Ms. Stepmother?

17
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:52,366
What the heck is this?

18
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,286
I think I saw something I shouldn't have seen.

19
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:56,566
What is it?

20
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:02,206
I saw Young Master and Ms. Stepmother embraced.

21
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:04,886
They embraced?

22
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,366
Don't tell anyone.

23
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,086
Who embraced?

24
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:11,316
- Tell me. I want to know.   - Young Master and Ms. Stepmother.

25
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:13,966
We saw them that day too.

26
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,406
They seemed weirdly intimate, Ging.

27
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,606
Could it be true?

28
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:23,806
- Young Master and Ms. Stepmother are having an affair.   - Ging, quiet!

29
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:25,965
Hey! Why would you cover it up?

30
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:29,486
Indecency will not be tolerated!

31
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:39,581
We have nothing to do.

32
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,006
Yeah.

33
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,686
What does a couple normally do?

34
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,486
I haven't had a girlfriend in a long time.

35
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:53,606
Do you have a pen and paper?

36
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:56,246
On the desk.

37
00:03:58,637 --> 00:03:59,766
Should I go get it?

38
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,686
No. It's okay.

39
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:15,166
Let's try to list three things we want to do together.

40
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,486
Yeah.

41
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:29,606
I'm done.

42
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:33,046
What's wrong?

43
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,726
I think mine is too adult-ish.

44
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:40,446
Let's read yours.

45
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:49,446
First, a date at Phudin Park.

46
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,726
It should be fun to go on the rides.

47
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:54,646
Interesting.

48
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,766
Secondly,

49
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:04,086
exciting activities?

50
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:08,446
Like surfing,

51
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:10,326
or some exciting sports.

52
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:11,886
You can teach me those things.

53
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:18,341
Okay.

54
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,686
Thirdly,

55
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:22,686
go into a jungle.

56
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:25,366
I want to cut myself off from the outside world.

57
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:27,486
We can actually do this right now.

58
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,006
- Really?   - Yeah.

59
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:30,246
Let's go, shall we?

60
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,646
Yeah.

61
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:35,406
See?

62
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:38,446
It looks comfy.

63
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,726
Of course. When we have time, I'll take you to a real jungle.

64
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,086
Let's pretend this is a jungle for now.

65
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:47,686
Okay.

66
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:49,958
Let's sit down and talk.

67
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:05,926
Since we're dating now,

68
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,086
should we call each other

69
00:06:08,197 --> 00:06:09,926
something cute?

70
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,086
Yeah.

71
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:16,458
Honey.

72
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:19,246
It tickles.

73
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,046
You don't like it?

74
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:24,446
Can it be something more normal?

75
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:28,566
Then...

76
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,566
Let's stop using pronouns

77
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,126
and refer to ourselves in the third person.

78
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:36,806
Okay. So, I'll refer to myself as Po

79
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:39,646
and call you Mueang.

80
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:41,246
Okay.

81
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:42,886
Let's try that.

82
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,086
- Po.   - Mueang.

83
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,926
I'm not used to this.

84
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:52,286
It takes time, maybe?

85
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,662
Hey, let me ask you something.

86
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:58,966
You rub your eyebrows when you're embarrassed, right?

87
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,686
Po noticed it a while ago.

88
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:05,166
At first, Po thought

89
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,812
you were lost in your thoughts,

90
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,766
so you rubbed your eyebrows, but really,

91
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:12,469
you're embarrassed when you're with me, right?

92
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:14,886
Well,

93
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,886
that's probably it.

94
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,406
Mueang is a shy guy.

95
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:19,766
I didn't notice.

96
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:22,046
You're observant.

97
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:24,966
I'm a curious girl.

98
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:29,086
Actually, I'm curious about a lot of things about you.

99
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:30,566
Me too.

100
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:33,206
I made a chart. Do you want to see it?

101
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:37,766
Ta-da!

102
00:07:38,318 --> 00:07:41,406
You made me look like a serial killer.

103
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:46,246
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,646
Actually,

105
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,486
I made one too.

106
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:50,726
Really?

107
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,126
Let me see.

108
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:03,646
It's more complicated than a thesis.

109
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,326
You said you used to be a surfing instructor.

110
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:10,486
Why did you quit?

111
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,926
I think some things are more important than my dream.

112
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,966
I can surf at any time,

113
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:24,046
but my mom's Bo Phloi

114
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:26,206
needs to be taken care of right now,

115
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:27,926
at this very moment.

116
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:32,286
What about you?

117
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:34,966
Why did you want to be a landscape architect?

118
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,966
Was it your childhood dream? Did it grow on you later?

119
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:40,486
It wasn't exactly a childhood dream.

120
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:45,006
It began when my parents took me to go camping just like this.

121
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,118
Really?

122
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,246
My parents were tour guides.

123
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,686
I used to travel with them a lot.

124
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:58,246
Our hobby was to guess the plants.

125
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:02,006
Whether it's bungor, lagerstroemia, or Thai bungor,

126
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:03,726
I recognize them all.

127
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:05,846
Plants that people usually get confused about,

128
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:07,486
I can tell them apart.

129
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:09,366
Whoa.

130
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:12,326
At that age,

131
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:15,046
I was playing crystal balls.

132
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,206
I was jumping ropes too.

133
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,606
You showed your age with that one.

134
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:22,366
Your crystal balls were for old boys too.

135
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,126
You know what, Po?

136
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,406
Tomorrow, let's tell everyone

137
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:06,006
that we're dating.

138
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:10,326
- Okay.   - Okay.

139
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,086
I wonder what my old man is doing.

140
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,766
What do you mean Apo knew about us?

141
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,806
She saw you and Ri kiss in the CCTV.

142
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:24,904
What did she say?

143
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:27,086
She didn't mind,

144
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:29,686
but I didn't want to get in trouble.

145
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:33,646
You can't get scared that easily.

146
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:36,006
Darling, I think you should stop.

147
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:38,626
Everyone's watching you right now.

148
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:41,406
I think you shouldn't do something you'd regret.

149
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:44,206
The only thing that will make me regret is you dumping me.

150
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:47,126
If you want to act out your plan, do it alone.

151
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:48,886
My daughter and I are out.

152
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:50,246
Let's go, Ri.

153
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:51,606
Come on!

154
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,406
- Let's get out of here.   - Mom!

155
00:10:58,051 --> 00:10:59,381
Darn it!

156
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:05,766
You two are dating.

157
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:10,646
We are.

158
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:14,086
Sita.

159
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:16,126
Yes, sir.

160
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:26,668
(Congratulations. You are now a couple.)

161
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:28,309
What does it say?

162
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:35,606
(Congratulations. You are now a couple.)

163
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,846
Mr. Phudin had this one made a while ago.

164
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:48,366
It's a thank-you gift for you, Apo.

165
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:51,446
Why would you thank me?

166
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,766
Oh? For taking my son off the market.

167
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,126
If he does something bad,

168
00:11:59,222 --> 00:12:01,070
just scream, and I'll punish him.

169
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,766
Whoa, you're more childish than I am.

170
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,006
Oh? It's because I appreciate it.

171
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:07,526
A nice girl like Apo

172
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,726
chose to date a weird guy like you.

173
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,726
You're lucky I'm not giving her a gold platter

174
00:12:11,854 --> 00:12:13,781
with a candle, flowers, and incense

175
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:16,046
as a token of appreciation.

176
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:19,326
You're embarrassing.

177
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:21,886
Din!

178
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,210
Din!

179
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,046
- Mueang, do you know what's happening?   -What?

180
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:29,366
Our workers are gossiping that...

181
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:30,955
That?

182
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,326
That

183
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,286
a dad and his son

184
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,726
have the same wife.

185
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:52,646
Boem, I told everyone.

186
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,646
- Everyone knows now.   - Well done.

187
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:57,006
- Fab.   - Ms. Stepmother deserves a...

188
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:58,966
Boem! Stop talking already!

189
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:02,006
If Boss and Young Master hear this, you'll be in trouble!

190
00:13:04,581 --> 00:13:07,566
Son! Aren't you curious?

191
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,846
Yeah! You're the one who started it.

192
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,827
You weren't supposed to tell anyone, Ging!

193
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,988
Son, you made a mistake. You know it.

194
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:16,245
Boem and Ging

195
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,086
never keep a secret!

196
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,966
By now, the whole galaxy knows.

197
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:23,966
Even the whole Milky Way. Even Thanos knows.

198
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,406
That's too much!

199
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,326
- We're toast.   - What did Ging do?

200
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,446
There goes my employee of the year award!

201
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,206
This can't stand.

202
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:37,686
We need to clear this up.

203
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:39,846
Where are you going?

204
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:41,246
I'm telling them the truth.

205
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:44,086
What are you going to tell them?

206
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,766
That everything was an act.

207
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,486
There's nothing between the old man and Apo.

208
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:50,806
Everyone believed them.

209
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,726
Would you let them believe the lie? No.

210
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,566
I'll protect Apo's reputation.

211
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:57,806
It's okay.

212
00:13:58,062 --> 00:13:59,406
It's just people talking.

213
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:02,846
All I need is we both know the truth.

214
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,606
That's not enough.

215
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:08,326
You're the one who started this.

216
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,326
You need to fix it.

217
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,006
Mueang, calm down.

218
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:16,286
How could I stay calm?

219
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:18,206
I don't like it when people talk badly of you.

220
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,806
They only speak of what they know.

221
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,966
They believed I came in as your stepmother.

222
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:25,766
That's what makes me mad!

223
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,600
If my old man hadn't come up with this crazy plan,

224
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:28,966
this wouldn't have happened to you.

225
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,686
But it happened.

226
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,486
I think we should find a solution together.

227
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,566
I forgot how nosy people are.

228
00:14:46,757 --> 00:14:48,126
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:50,726
If I had been more careful, I would have been more aware.

230
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:52,486
I should have told them the truth earlier

231
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,966
so nobody got the wrong idea.

232
00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:56,326
It's fine.

233
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:59,406
We took it step by step.

234
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:01,366
We didn't do anything wrong.

235
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:03,366
We don't have to keep our relationship a secret.

236
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:11,006
Let's go to work and do things as usual.

237
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:14,006
Are you really okay?

238
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:17,326
I'm really okay.

239
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,486
Let people say what they say.

240
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:21,006
I don't care.

241
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:24,326
Okay.

242
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:33,926
Don't sigh, please.

243
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:35,766
It will make you age.

244
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:39,766
Why did the things I thought were good

245
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:41,806
turned out awkward?

246
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:43,886
Do you mean

247
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,006
when Apo played the role of your soon-to-be wife?

248
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:52,246
Actually, I think it was a little crazy.

249
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:57,046
Crazy?

250
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,206
I meant well with my son.

251
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,486
Why did it turn out like this?

252
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:06,486
Stop asking yourself why, please.

253
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:08,366
Anyone can make a mistake.

254
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,286
We should try to figure out

255
00:16:10,414 --> 00:16:14,166
how to restore Apo's reputation.

256
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,246
If I had known from the start

257
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:18,406
that Apo and Mueang had feelings for one another,

258
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:20,606
I would have held a wedding for them by now.

259
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:24,166
Arranged marriage? That's outdated.

260
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:26,886
It really is.

261
00:16:27,246 --> 00:16:30,166
Mueang definitely won't let you force him.

262
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:33,307
Whatever is your idea, he's against it.

263
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:35,566
He won't agree. You're thoughtless.

264
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:38,086
I thought you'd know that.

265
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:39,886
You're really too far gone.

266
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:46,326
I'm frustrated.

267
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:52,206
Hey, you!

268
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:55,086
They said Ms. Apo and Mr. Mueang...

269
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:57,053
Are you crazy?

270
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:59,686
For real! This is a big deal!

271
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:02,526
Don't turn around.

272
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:06,286
I said don't turn around. Let's get out of here.

273
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,366
Get to your desk! What are you waiting for?

274
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:19,246
Apo, how did you just stand there while they talked trash about you?

275
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,846
You're my niece.

276
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:24,046
You have to list their names and send them to Mr. Phudin.

277
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:26,206
Yeah. Rumors of you have spread too far.

278
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,366
Some people think you had a makeover surgery and come back for revenge.

279
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:32,046
Is that too far?

280
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,238
They've been gossiping about you all morning.

281
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,006
How did you two know they were gossiping about me?

282
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:46,206
Don't tell me you were gossiping with them.

283
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:50,606
It's Ri. She heard it in the bathroom.

284
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:55,606
But I told everyone it's complicated between you and Mr. Phudin.

285
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:58,006
I told them there were details and not to judge you.

286
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,286
See? You were gossiping with them.

287
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:03,566
Apo!

288
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,206
Have you thought it through

289
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:09,326
when you decided to date Mr. Mueang?

290
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:12,446
You should think carefully. Mom and I know the truth,

291
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,166
but others already judged you.

292
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:18,446
It's not too late to change your mind.

293
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,166
Don't let yourself be the talk of the town.

294
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,366
- Come on!   - Cheers!

295
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:33,686
Young Master.

296
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,866
What's the deal with you and Ms. Stepmother?

297
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:40,806
Torn, you're drunk. Go to bed.

298
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:42,646
Not yet.

299
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:43,926
Let him finish.

300
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:49,566
You shouldn't have done that.

301
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:52,246
Those guys in the park said

302
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:55,786
Ms. Stepmother seduced you.

303
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:01,046
Although she seems neat and tidy,

304
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,766
I'd never think that she's...

305
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:07,446
- Young Master, calm down!   - Let go!

306
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:09,006
- Young Master?   - If you talk about her,

307
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,846
show her some respect.

308
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:14,006
Do you think you can do anything just because you're my boss?

309
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,661
Who do you think you are?

310
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,206
How dare you say that?

311
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,366
Don't talk about Apo again.

312
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:26,286
Sucker!

313
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:30,246
You're mad. That means it's true.

314
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:32,086
Is that right, Young Master?

315
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,526
- Is that...   - Torn!

316
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:36,846
Torn, stop! What are you doing?

317
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:39,646
- What are you doing?   - Young Master?

318
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:43,533
- Stop them!   - Torn! Young Master!

319
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,566
- Young Master?   - Will you shut up now?

320
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,246
- Will you shut up?   - Young Master!

321
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:50,806
Stop already!

322
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,006
Mr. Phudin.

323
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:57,606
- What?   - Mr. Mueang had a fight with a worker.

324
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:06,526
Mueang.

325
00:20:08,913 --> 00:20:10,406
Look at you.

326
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:12,766
Apo? Why are you here?

327
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:18,166
Aum told Phing, and she told me.

328
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:19,566
What for?

329
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:21,126
What happened?

330
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,126
You said you had quit fighting.

331
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:28,446
I had to.

332
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,486
Why did you have to?

333
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:32,886
Mueang.

334
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:38,246
I was sick of guessing the word.

335
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:39,846
Guessing the word?

336
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:43,046
It's when people gossip.

337
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,806
The first guy said one thing. The next guy said another.

338
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:49,006
People these days like to stick their noses.

339
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:51,406
That is why the world is in crisis.

340
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:55,246
Did someone say bad things about me again?

341
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:00,646
Mueang.

342
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,526
If anyone says anything again,

343
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:03,886
don't respond.

344
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:05,967
- But it's...   - Sue them!

345
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,686
If you get in a fight, you could get fined or go to jail.

346
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,637
If you sue, you get money.

347
00:21:10,718 --> 00:21:12,718
Money is hard to earn these days.

348
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:15,413
Wow.

349
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:17,726
If they offer a gift as an apology,

350
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,446
you can be kind and sue them for a bit less.

351
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:23,766
You sure have a business mind.

352
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:27,506
This is why you must not use violence again, got it?

353
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,366
Got it.

354
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:34,006
Mueang.

355
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,166
You can't change people's opinions.

356
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:39,406
Don't get hurt over something like this again.

357
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:44,046
Okay, ma'am.

358
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:47,366
Sit down.

359
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:49,286
I'll do it.

360
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:01,486
Mueang.

361
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,046
Why did you take off your clothes?

362
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,486
You said you would do it.

363
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,485
I mean, dress your wound.

364
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,166
Sit down!

365
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:15,846
Put your shirt on.

366
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,406
Showing off your body again.

367
00:22:25,926 --> 00:22:27,886
- Just a bit.   - Sit down! Sit!

368
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,606
Are you ready?

369
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,086
For what?

370
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,246
For the right thing that you should do.

371
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:04,606
Are you embarrassed?

372
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:07,006
How far are you pushing me?

373
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:09,686
I'm trying to do the best I can.

374
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:11,766
You have been thinking about it all night.

375
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:13,886
I hope you didn't change your mind.

376
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:21,926
Why did you call me here?

377
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:27,726
We need to talk.

378
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:32,726
Son, why did Boss call us out here?

379
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:35,646
I don't know. He said he had an important announcement.

380
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:39,966
Could he be suing the one who started the rumors about Ms. Stepmother?

381
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,486
I don't think so.

382
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,126
Don't say that.

383
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:47,006
There they are.

384
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:50,406
- Go! Sit down.   - In position!

385
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,166
Go!

386
00:23:52,392 --> 00:23:55,006
- Who's with him?   - They're all here.

387
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:04,406
Good morning.

388
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:07,766
I called you guys out here early

389
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:11,366
because something's been troubling me.

390
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:16,086
At this time, some people are spreading nasty rumors about Apo.

391
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:17,766
See? I told you.

392
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:21,646
I want the one who started the rumors punished.

393
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:26,286
There goes my employee of the year award. It's over!

394
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:28,006
The truth is

395
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:31,106
the one who most deserves to be punished

396
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,006
is me alone.

397
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:36,366
What I'm about to tell you,

398
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:39,406
I assure you everything is the truth.

399
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:41,446
Months ago,

400
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,686
I came up with a silly plan.

401
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:49,366
I brought Apo in as my soon-to-be wife

402
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,566
in order to motivate Mueang, my only son,

403
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:54,846
to take over the business.

404
00:24:55,358 --> 00:24:57,446
That's why Apo and I

405
00:24:57,527 --> 00:25:00,286
never had a romantic relationship.

406
00:25:01,686 --> 00:25:06,286
We were both playing roles as agreed in our deal.

407
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:09,446
What? So we were lied to?

408
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,366
I intended to trick all of you,

409
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:14,326
including my son.

410
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:16,029
In fact,

411
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:20,166
I wasn't obligated to clarify any of this to you.

412
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:23,406
It's a family matter anyway.

413
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:27,686
I just can't let my son down again,

414
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,926
and I have to speak up for Apo,

415
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:35,766
the woman that my son loves.

416
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:48,209
Apo and Mueang met and fell in love

417
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:50,766
before I came up with any of this plan.

418
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:53,126
When Mueang found out

419
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:56,126
that Apo came here as his stepmother,

420
00:25:57,566 --> 00:25:59,126
he had to give up.

421
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:04,846
However,

422
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:07,526
when the truth is revealed,

423
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:12,006
they both follow their own hearts.

424
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:16,046
Apo and Mueang are genuinely in love.

425
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:18,446
They didn't do anything wrong.

426
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:20,046
Therefore,

427
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:21,686
I ask all of you

428
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,446
to stop the rumors

429
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,406
and start telling the truth.

430
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:27,886
If you want to blame someone,

431
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:30,222
just blame the dad that's

432
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,126
too deadbeat alone.

433
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:37,846
This is me asking for your favor.

434
00:26:56,006 --> 00:26:58,406
Din, you're awesome!

435
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,126
Mrs. Nudi would be so proud of you.

436
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:11,886
And also,

437
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:15,006
there's one more important thing to announce.

438
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:16,926
I assure you that

439
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:19,486
Mueang has agreed to this.

440
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,646
What is it?

441
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:25,606
Moving forward,

442
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:28,966
Mueang will take over from me.

443
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,686
- Really? Is that true, Mueang?   - That hurts.

444
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,286
I'm asking all of you to adapt to this transition.

445
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:43,846
Applause!

446
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:17,806
You can go and do your jobs now. That's all.

447
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:19,486
- Yes, sir!   - Yes, sir!

448
00:28:27,821 --> 00:28:31,046
Stop crying, my boy. There, there.

449
00:28:32,186 --> 00:28:33,646
There, there.

450
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,246
As of now,

451
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:37,486
I think our job is done.

452
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,526
Let's go.

453
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:57,326
- Come here.   - What?

454
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:01,806
I think Young Master is sending us a message.

455
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:04,126
(Mind your own businesses.)

456
00:29:05,428 --> 00:29:06,766
We almost got in trouble.

457
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,286
Who would have known it'd turn out this way?

458
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,846
I told you. If you don't know for sure, don't say anything.

459
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,246
Anyway, this is a really interesting twist and turn.

460
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:20,846
Guys, what should we call Ms. Stepmother now?

461
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:22,766
I don't know.

462
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,686
She rejected my calls.

463
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:52,286
(The number you dialed cannot be reached...)

464
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:53,766
She turned her phone off.

465
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,446
I'm heading back to my store.

466
00:30:01,846 --> 00:30:03,806
You stay here and wait for Uncle Din.

467
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:06,446
Wait.

468
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,286
What?

469
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:12,606
Nothing.

470
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:14,606
Just go already.

471
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:40,566
(Game)

472
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,846
Does he have all my numbers?

473
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:50,366
Stop calling me.

474
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:53,566
Are you trying to bail on me?

475
00:30:53,717 --> 00:30:54,966
Bail on what?

476
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:56,926
We haven't started anything.

477
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:58,486
We had a deal.

478
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,406
I can cancel that, can't I?

479
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:02,806
We didn't sign any contract whatsoever.

480
00:31:04,086 --> 00:31:05,406
So this is what you want?

481
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:06,696
Yeah.

482
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,126
This is what I want.

483
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:11,366
Uncle Din already found out what you're trying to do.

484
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,582
He's letting you stay for now

485
00:31:13,902 --> 00:31:16,246
because he thinks it's easy to get rid of you.

486
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,486
Let me warn you.

487
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:20,766
If you want to stay in this business,

488
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:25,046
it's best to stay on good terms with Uncle Din.

489
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:29,086
You've changed so much.

490
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,446
You're suddenly a good girl.

491
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,246
This is not you.

492
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:37,406
Did you change your ways because of Tin?

493
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,766
What if I did?

494
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,126
Pathetic.

495
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:42,926
Don't you realize?

496
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:45,486
Who can love someone like you?

497
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,446
Everyone who gets close to you wants something.

498
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:50,326
Stop pretending.

499
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:52,166
You can't change.

500
00:31:52,607 --> 00:31:54,126
I can change.

501
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:55,461
What did you say?

502
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:57,979
I can change. Don't underestimate me.

503
00:31:58,077 --> 00:31:59,846
If I want something, I will get it

504
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:01,246
because I am Ing.

505
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,646
I believe in mankind's power and potential.

506
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:07,166
Everyone can change.

507
00:32:07,846 --> 00:32:09,526
Don't look down on me.

508
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:12,486
I'll be a new me. Just watch.

509
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:35,471
You said we were on a date.

510
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:40,446
Sorry. Tin's been depressed. I didn't want to leave him alone.

511
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:45,966
Don't be mad at me.

512
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,646
Hey, what did you do to my girl?

513
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:08,206
Miss, I didn't do anything.

514
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:11,566
He really didn't do anything. Kid...

515
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,486
Pick on someone your own size.

516
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:15,366
There, there. Don't cry, my baby.

517
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:17,606
Come on. Don't cry.

518
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,726
- Don't cry, okay?   - I really didn't do anything.

519
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:38,166
You seem nervous. Why?

520
00:33:45,366 --> 00:33:48,166
I told Ing that Tin's here.

521
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,646
Why did you tell her?

522
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:54,006
You didn't know?

523
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:57,886
Is your sense that bad?

524
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:04,086
Remember when we saw Tin smiling alone?

525
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,326
Yeah.

526
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:08,006
I think

527
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:10,686
Tin was texting Ing.

528
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:11,886
What?

529
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,486
Tin?

530
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:18,246
Tin and Ing?

531
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:24,086
That's why he's been protecting her.

532
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,646
Let them work it out.

533
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,006
Where are you going?

534
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,086
Why did you ask?

535
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:55,606
I'll give you a ride.

536
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:00,686
Hey!

537
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:03,646
Wait for me.

538
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:05,086
Are you hot?

539
00:35:06,389 --> 00:35:07,606
Is it hot today?

540
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:12,046
Walk slowly.

541
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:13,486
Wait.

542
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:18,646
Stop it.

543
00:35:28,446 --> 00:35:29,846
Eat a lot, guys.

544
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:31,806
Water and a cooling towel.

545
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:34,606
- Anything else?   - I want nothing.

546
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:40,566
Sorry. Excuse me.

547
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:42,046
Let me in, please.

548
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,286
Come on.

549
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,486
Sorry, girl.

550
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,166
Come on.

551
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:48,566
Hey, you.

552
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,646
What? What do you want?

553
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,126
What are you doing?

554
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:55,805
That's enough. Stop following me.

555
00:35:57,318 --> 00:35:58,526
Go.

556
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:33,446
He won't accept anything.

557
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:35,406
I did everything I could.

558
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:37,286
He's so hard to please.

559
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:40,006
Is this your best effort?

560
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,310
I've never tried to make up with anyone.

561
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:49,126
I don't know what to do.

562
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:50,726
Thanks for trying, though.

563
00:36:52,454 --> 00:36:53,766
Are you not mad anymore?

564
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,486
I'm still mad.

565
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:57,726
But seeing your effort,

566
00:36:58,206 --> 00:36:59,486
I can respect that.

567
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:02,526
We're good now.

568
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,606
I'm sorry.

569
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:08,966
I think

570
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:12,566
my judgment of right and wrong wasn't functioning properly.

571
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:18,446
But if I have you with me to warn me,

572
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:21,866
I think it can function properly.

573
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,486
There's nothing wrong with you.

574
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,326
At first, I wanted to be perfect,

575
00:37:34,326 --> 00:37:36,046
but after meeting you,

576
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,886
I just wanted to be a better person every day.

577
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,646
Can you help me?

578
00:37:42,149 --> 00:37:43,446
I can't help you with that.

579
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,326
It's up to you, in your own heart.

580
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:48,966
What I can do

581
00:37:49,526 --> 00:37:52,006
is be there for you.

582
00:37:55,718 --> 00:37:57,966
I want to be a better person too.

583
00:37:59,134 --> 00:38:00,526
Let's try to

584
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:03,686
help each other then.

585
00:38:03,926 --> 00:38:05,246
Help each other?

586
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:09,646
How can a sinner like me help you?

587
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:11,006
You can.

588
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:13,326
It's not just you

589
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:14,646
or me.

590
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:16,486
It's us.

591
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:19,813
I think it should go well.

592
00:38:27,366 --> 00:38:28,526
Deal?

593
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:35,446
Deal.

594
00:38:52,126 --> 00:38:55,006
- Where should we go next?   - That way?

595
00:39:12,669 --> 00:39:15,206
Why are you pointing at his face?

596
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:16,886
Sorry.

597
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:19,886
What's wrong?

598
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:27,086
Oh! So, kids really cry at the sight of you?

599
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:31,326
I think my black eye makes me look mean.

600
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:37,586
I made this for you.

601
00:39:38,572 --> 00:39:39,797
I think you need it.

602
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,686
Ta-da.

603
00:39:49,006 --> 00:39:50,326
There's a heart on it?

604
00:39:51,544 --> 00:39:53,726
It's to let people know you got hit by love.

605
00:39:56,618 --> 00:39:57,886
What a pickup line.

606
00:40:05,031 --> 00:40:06,686
- Whoa.   - Let me.

607
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,606
I can't see you clearly.

608
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:21,526
That's good. Kids won't cry now.

609
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,277
- Which one is mine?   - This one is mine.

610
00:40:28,365 --> 00:40:29,773
- Really?   - Yeah.

611
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:31,766
Let's ride the Viking.

612
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,126
- The Viking?  - Yeah.

613
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:34,766
It's for kids.

614
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:36,846
Adults can ride it too.

615
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:39,726
It feels like when we were kids.

616
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:42,726
Oh? Are you scared?

617
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:44,366
I'm not!

618
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:46,046
I'm fine.

619
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:03,118
Mueang? Mueang!

620
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,366
Number one, check.

621
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:15,326
Whoa! This is too high!

622
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,326
That was fun.

623
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:35,406
Are you hungry?

624
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,206
A little.

625
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:39,766
Okay. I'll cook something.

626
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:41,606
- I'll help.   - No.

627
00:42:43,765 --> 00:42:45,205
Stay here. I'll be back.

628
00:43:27,966 --> 00:43:29,526
(Doctor's Appointment)

629
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:40,846
Is the room too messy?

630
00:43:41,566 --> 00:43:42,766
I'll clean it up.

631
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:47,518
I opened the fridge, and we were out of meat. Let's order something.

632
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,966
What would you like?

633
00:43:56,421 --> 00:43:57,726
Anything's fine.

634
00:43:57,822 --> 00:43:59,134
You can order something.

635
00:44:13,806 --> 00:44:15,366
That's all, Uncle.

636
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:17,046
Thank you.

637
00:44:17,127 --> 00:44:18,924
I'll pay by bank transfer.

638
00:44:19,005 --> 00:44:21,366
Thank you so much. Please come again.

639
00:44:21,606 --> 00:44:24,046
Okay. You can go that way.

640
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,926
That way? What's there? Why are you telling me to go?

641
00:44:29,624 --> 00:44:31,286
Your girlfriend's waiting.

642
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:37,606
That's mad, Uncle.

643
00:44:37,814 --> 00:44:39,126
She's not my girlfriend.

644
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:41,526
Hey, do you think I'm stupid?

645
00:44:43,872 --> 00:44:45,406
It's not official yet.

646
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:48,566
You're slow.

647
00:44:48,694 --> 00:44:50,846
I can see from way up on Pluto,

648
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:53,846
and I can tell the girl likes you.

649
00:44:54,614 --> 00:44:56,859
- Go.   - Okay. Thanks, Uncle.

650
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,406
- I'll come again.   - Thanks so much. Drive safely.

651
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,246
You're clueless.

652
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:17,686
Hey, you.

653
00:45:18,286 --> 00:45:19,926
Don't you have work to do?

654
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:21,366
I'm on a workation.

655
00:45:21,525 --> 00:45:22,646
Workation?

656
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:25,006
Work on your vacation?

657
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,326
That's right.

658
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:30,046
Good morning.

659
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,566
Good morning.

660
00:45:32,422 --> 00:45:34,806
We follow your Facebook page.

661
00:45:35,028 --> 00:45:37,028
We came all the way from Bangkok.

662
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:38,286
Thank you so much.

663
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:41,046
You can look around. See what you like.

664
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:43,406
If you like a plant, let me know. I'll be waiting there.

665
00:45:43,503 --> 00:45:46,006
- Take your time.   - Okay. Thank you.

666
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:50,366
He's cute!

667
00:45:51,726 --> 00:45:55,046
- His skin is so smooth.   - He looks better in person!

668
00:45:55,181 --> 00:46:00,286
- Do I look good?   - I think I need photos to show off today...

669
00:46:02,814 --> 00:46:04,006
Yes?

670
00:46:05,078 --> 00:46:06,206
He's mine.

671
00:46:11,486 --> 00:46:13,806
- Let's go home.   - Goodbye.

672
00:46:14,077 --> 00:46:16,806
- Goodbye.   - Oh! Are you leaving?

673
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,206
We have to go! Bye!

674
00:46:21,726 --> 00:46:23,566
Do your job!

675
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:25,726
What the heck?

676
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:29,046
They came all the way and bought nothing?

677
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:34,486
Please take care of this.

678
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:36,246
You can send it to me later tonight.

679
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,486
Okay.

680
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,166
Ms. Apo.

681
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:45,246
Have you seen Mr. Mueang?

682
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:50,166
- He isn't in his office?   - No. There are some things he needs to check.

683
00:46:50,622 --> 00:46:53,686
- I'll get it to him.   - Okay. Thank you.

684
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:03,086
(Hello?)

685
00:47:03,206 --> 00:47:04,726
You didn't come to work today?

686
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,926
I'm on my way. I had something to do first.

687
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:10,166
Where are you?

688
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:11,628
I'm not far.

689
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:12,709
(I'm on my way back.)

690
00:47:13,006 --> 00:47:14,366
Is something the matter?

691
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:19,046
Your staff came for you. There's something you need to check. It's with me.

692
00:47:19,413 --> 00:47:22,766
Okay. I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.

693
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,246
Okay.

694
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:44,806
What is it?

695
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:48,966
You found out about me and Ri, right?

696
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:51,886
What do you think?

697
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,926
I think it's got nothing to do with me.

698
00:47:56,867 --> 00:47:59,286
Apo, don't you feel anything?

699
00:47:59,455 --> 00:48:00,606
I do.

700
00:48:01,686 --> 00:48:03,606
I feel annoyed.

701
00:48:03,758 --> 00:48:06,846
Apo, don't be annoyed.

702
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:11,156
I don't know what Ms. Ing said that made Mr. Phudin

703
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:12,964
upset with me.

704
00:48:13,086 --> 00:48:14,566
Please help me.

705
00:48:15,486 --> 00:48:18,686
No. I'll never help you again.

706
00:48:19,156 --> 00:48:20,526
What you did

707
00:48:20,638 --> 00:48:23,046
is coming around for you!

708
00:48:24,686 --> 00:48:26,546
- I'm sick of you.   - Apo.

709
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,246
Aunt Da?

710
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:46,086
Your aunt confessed everything.

711
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:50,206
I don't want to get caught with him.

712
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,446
Mr. Phudin, whatever Game is doing

713
00:48:55,574 --> 00:48:57,926
has nothing to do with me and Ri.

714
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,166
Mr. Phudin.

715
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:02,766
I'm sorry

716
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,046
I brought someone like Game here.

717
00:49:06,726 --> 00:49:10,486
It's fine. We have proof of everything now.

718
00:49:11,597 --> 00:49:13,766
The only thing left to decide is how we deal with him.

719
00:49:14,078 --> 00:49:17,366
Your ex-boyfriend committed a lot of crimes.

720
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:20,286
He leaked our company secret to Ms. Ing.

721
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:23,886
Rumors of you and Mr. Mueang spread fast

722
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,886
because he was the one spreading it.

723
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:32,766
What about Mueang? Where is he?

724
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:37,046
He said he was on his way.

725
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:39,206
Mr. Mueang went to Bangkok.

726
00:49:39,486 --> 00:49:42,166
He told me this morning.

727
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:43,646
Really?

728
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,606
What should we do then?

729
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:50,126
Should we wait for Mueang, or should we take care of him right away?

730
00:50:01,886 --> 00:50:02,886
What is it?

731
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:04,686
Did you get the recording from Ing?

732
00:50:05,054 --> 00:50:06,126
What recording?

733
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:09,156
Her conversation with Game, she recorded it.

734
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:11,446
She said she sent it to Uncle Din this morning.

735
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:12,878
I haven't heard anything.

736
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:17,646
Okay. Let's say Uncle Din has proof to catch Game.

737
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,606
He's going to fire him today.

738
00:50:19,806 --> 00:50:22,886
That's crazy! Why didn't anyone tell me a thing?

739
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:24,806
Okay. Fine.

740
00:50:41,653 --> 00:50:44,606
(How to get revenge in a cool way.)

741
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:56,206
"One of the acts of revenge most commonly seen in TV shows

742
00:50:58,019 --> 00:50:59,566
is kidnapping."

743
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:06,686
Game, run!

744
00:51:08,022 --> 00:51:09,086
Run to where?

745
00:51:09,206 --> 00:51:12,846
Cops are coming to arrest you. Run!

746
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:24,246
- Hey!   - Hey!

747
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,966
Catch him! Catch!

748
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,686
- Move it!   - Catch him!

749
00:51:29,582 --> 00:51:34,646
Move! To your left! Whoa! I've lost him!

750
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:38,126
Hey, guys! Catch him!

751
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:41,166
- Catch him!  - Who? Where are you going?

752
00:51:42,294 --> 00:51:44,566
- Catch him! Don't let him go!   - You idiot!

753
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,286
- My eyes.   - Catch him!

754
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,926
- Catch him! I got you!   - Boem!

755
00:51:49,054 --> 00:51:51,566
- I got you!   - Catch him, not me!

756
00:51:51,661 --> 00:51:53,286
Young Master?

757
00:51:53,997 --> 00:51:55,566
- He went that way!   - Everyone!

758
00:51:55,685 --> 00:52:00,806
Catch the man in white with glasses. He assaulted me! Help!

759
00:52:01,781 --> 00:52:03,853
- Catch him!   - Dead or alive!

760
00:52:03,937 --> 00:52:06,686
You're mine! Ouch!

761
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:10,766
- Stop!  - Catch him!

762
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,926
- Young Master? There you are!   - Catch him!

763
00:52:15,086 --> 00:52:17,286
- It hurts. Help.  - Quick!

764
00:52:17,517 --> 00:52:18,726
You guys...

765
00:52:18,846 --> 00:52:21,119
I said catch him. What are you lying here for?

766
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:23,446
- Get up!   - I got hurt, Young Master.

767
00:52:23,527 --> 00:52:27,085
- Go!   - Let's go, guys!

768
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,486
- Follow him!   - Catch him!

769
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:31,666
I think I'm blind!

770
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,686
Wait!

771
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,646
Mueang, stop!

772
00:52:44,566 --> 00:52:46,766
Mueang, hop on.

773
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:51,846
Number two, check.

774
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:55,806
Do an exciting activity together.

775
00:52:57,126 --> 00:52:59,446
I brought that trash here.

776
00:52:59,998 --> 00:53:02,126
I'll be the one who catches him!

777
00:53:08,014 --> 00:53:10,486
Let's go!

778
00:53:15,886 --> 00:53:18,646
- There he is!   - Catch him!

779
00:53:18,726 --> 00:53:21,206
- Don't let him go!   - Why are you blocking me?

780
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:23,846
- Why did you kick me?   - Surround him!

781
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:27,686
Surround him. Don't let him go.

782
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:31,006
You're mine now. There's nowhere to run.

783
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:34,017
- Get him!   - Let me go!

784
00:53:34,098 --> 00:53:37,365
Where are you going? I won't let go!

785
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:41,045
- Let me go!   - I won't let you go!

786
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:43,046
Surround him. Don't let him out.

787
00:53:43,126 --> 00:53:45,286
Hold him tight.

788
00:53:45,374 --> 00:53:47,086
- Don't struggle.   - Let me go!

789
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:48,566
- Let me go!   - No! You're getting it!

790
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:58,366
I've always wanted to scream in your face!

791
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:00,846
What's wrong with you?

792
00:54:01,862 --> 00:54:03,306
If you hate me that much,

793
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:06,846
you can go to hell!

794
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:10,340
- Apo!   - How does that feel?

795
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:13,366
- Serve you right.   - Apo, don't use violence. It's not good.

796
00:54:25,046 --> 00:54:26,326
So satisfying.

797
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:30,366
- Apo, hey!   - Is he okay?

798
00:54:32,086 --> 00:54:34,566
Let me go! Why are you holding me?

799
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:37,326
Just choke on water and die!

800
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,046
- Die!   - Yeah!

801
00:54:42,373 --> 00:54:44,566
Young Master, who should the cops arrest?

802
00:54:44,653 --> 00:54:47,406
I don't know. This is too risky.

803
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:49,166
Look at Ms. Apo go!

804
00:54:49,422 --> 00:54:51,566
She's doing all the work.

805
00:54:51,678 --> 00:54:53,181
What should we do now?

806
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:55,086
Just do what Ms. Apo is doing.

807
00:54:55,206 --> 00:54:57,686
- Let's go!   - Kick him for me!

808
00:54:57,813 --> 00:54:59,966
- Yeah!   - Get him!

809
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,806
What should we do, Young Master?

810
00:55:02,134 --> 00:55:03,726
This is an emergency.

811
00:55:05,686 --> 00:55:06,686
Honey!

812
00:55:07,486 --> 00:55:08,606
Kick his butt!

813
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,510
I'll protect you from the world's eyes.

814
00:55:18,486 --> 00:55:19,686
Come on, Son!

815
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,566
Benz! Come here!

816
00:55:26,727 --> 00:55:28,271
One, two, three!

817
00:55:40,206 --> 00:55:41,926
- Shield them.   - Shield them!

818
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:43,166
Don't let anyone see Apo!

819
00:55:43,247 --> 00:55:45,606
- Yes, Young Master!   - Don't let go!

820
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:56,846
This is it!

821
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:59,406
I agree!

822
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,366
Excellent!

823
00:56:02,686 --> 00:56:05,286
This punishment is fittingly childish for you guys.

824
00:56:05,565 --> 00:56:06,766
That's settled.

825
00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:08,606
Let's do it.

826
00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:14,846
Your punishment is

827
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:19,366
you're trapped forever in a pile of crap!

828
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,486
I'd rather be in jail.

829
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:33,206
Don't slack off. Do your job quickly.

830
00:56:34,526 --> 00:56:38,286
- Pick it up.   - There's more crap for you to pick up.

831
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:40,126
Do it quickly!

832
00:56:40,486 --> 00:56:43,966
An offender must be punished.

833
00:56:51,846 --> 00:56:54,966
Clean up all the crap. Make it look like Ging's face.

834
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,606
My face doesn't look like crap!

835
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:00,006
- Yeah. Scoop it up, quick!   - Do it!

836
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,326
Quick!

837
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:03,566
Pick it up, boy.

838
00:57:03,702 --> 00:57:05,526
- I know!   - Can you scoop that up?

839
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,166
Over there! There's another pile in the back.

840
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,646
Don't step on that!

841
00:57:37,726 --> 00:57:39,406
You animals!

842
00:57:43,446 --> 00:57:44,606
What did he say?

843
00:57:51,446 --> 00:57:53,465
Serves him right! He deserves that!

844
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,086
You don't care about your image anymore.

845
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,926
Good job, Mr. Phudin.

846
00:58:03,366 --> 00:58:05,126
What good job are you talking about?

847
00:58:05,406 --> 00:58:08,046
Why would he keep him? Why didn't he send him away?

848
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:10,326
Sending him away won't make him learn.

849
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:11,446
This is the way.

850
00:58:11,566 --> 00:58:13,606
A five-year-long slave contract

851
00:58:13,686 --> 00:58:14,886
will teach him his lesson.

852
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:18,046
Hey, you don't have to hold grudges like I do.

853
00:58:18,406 --> 00:58:20,166
I don't hold grudges.

854
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:23,246
You said you'd forgive Game.

855
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:26,166
If I forgive him, when will I get my revenge?

856
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:31,526
Vengeful girl mode unlocked.

857
00:58:34,582 --> 00:58:36,966
Why did Game and I end up like this?

858
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,886
What do they call it?

859
00:58:39,006 --> 00:58:40,446
Fate or destiny?

860
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:42,206
The more you hate him, the more you see him.

861
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,006
Maybe.

862
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:47,006
Honestly,

863
00:58:47,334 --> 00:58:50,406
I once tried to kick him out of your life,

864
00:58:50,662 --> 00:58:51,886
but I failed.

865
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,846
Watch where you're going!

866
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:25,126
Sorry.

867
00:59:25,598 --> 00:59:27,686
It's crowded here. Let's talk somewhere else.

868
00:59:33,006 --> 00:59:35,086
You end up seeing him anyway.

869
00:59:36,525 --> 00:59:38,486
Did you do something like that?

870
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:45,006
Sometimes, the world throws awful people at you.

871
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:47,886
Other times,

872
00:59:48,238 --> 00:59:50,166
it throws a nice person at you.

873
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,366
It threw you at me.

874
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:56,646
Why did you never tell me this?

875
00:59:59,694 --> 01:00:01,166
I didn't know how to say it.

876
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:07,286
You were really mad at me back then. Why did you help me?

877
01:00:11,028 --> 01:00:12,286
Maybe

878
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:15,006
I have a soft spot for you.

879
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:19,486
I could never really be mad at you, not once.

880
01:00:24,142 --> 01:00:25,526
So that's it.

881
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:29,206
I was confused.

882
01:00:29,686 --> 01:00:31,526
You seemed really angry,

883
01:00:31,982 --> 01:00:33,846
but you always helped me.

884
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,486
You rode a bike with me to get back at Game.

885
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:38,166
You helped me find my MP3 player.

886
01:00:38,262 --> 01:00:39,886
You saved me from Aunt Da.

887
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,446
Seriously,

888
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:47,086
there were a lot of signs that you liked me.

889
01:00:47,285 --> 01:00:49,686
Why couldn't I sense it?

890
01:00:51,165 --> 01:00:54,446
Well, don't blame yourself.

891
01:00:55,181 --> 01:00:56,726
We're dating now.

892
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:58,686
Let's forget about the past.

893
01:01:01,566 --> 01:01:03,246
You have been so good to me.

894
01:01:05,926 --> 01:01:09,806
Stop praising me. You're sending me over the moon.

895
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:14,486
It seems like

896
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,846
you will always have something to surprise me.

897
01:01:20,173 --> 01:01:21,446
I won't.

898
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:25,646
Let's go.

899
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,086
I'll drop you off.

900
01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:45,406
Mueang.

901
01:01:45,938 --> 01:01:48,246
Did you go to Bangkok today?

902
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:53,206
No, I was around here. I told you.

903
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:55,286
Okay.

904
01:01:55,861 --> 01:01:58,966
Mrs. Sita said you went to Bangkok.

905
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:01,926
Mrs. Sita just likes to talk.

906
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:04,246
She's old. She's forgetful.

907
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:11,086
The other day,

908
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:13,726
I saw your doctor's appointment.

909
01:02:14,095 --> 01:02:16,206
Was it a follow-up on something?

910
01:02:20,295 --> 01:02:23,286
It's old. It's nothing. Don't worry.

911
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:25,726
Let's go. It's cold outside.

912
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:39,246
Phing, if you feel like Aum is hiding something from you,

913
01:02:39,446 --> 01:02:40,606
what would you do?

914
01:02:40,766 --> 01:02:43,646
I'll smack his head, stab him, and drag his intestine out.

915
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:46,966
Whoa! Be serious.

916
01:02:47,606 --> 01:02:49,446
I don't know. I'd

917
01:02:49,825 --> 01:02:52,286
keep asking until he tells me.

918
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:53,926
Why are you asking me that?

919
01:02:54,165 --> 01:02:57,206
Is Mueang hiding something from you?

920
01:02:58,805 --> 01:02:59,886
The thing is,

921
01:03:00,046 --> 01:03:02,166
I was helping him clear his desk,

922
01:03:02,247 --> 01:03:04,686
and I saw a doctor's appointment.

923
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:07,606
I picked it up to read, but he snatched it from me.

924
01:03:07,815 --> 01:03:10,006
I asked about it,

925
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:12,486
and he seemed not to want to tell me.

926
01:03:12,636 --> 01:03:14,525
Is Mueang terminally ill?

927
01:03:14,606 --> 01:03:17,486
Something incurable, and he's got four months...

928
01:03:17,638 --> 01:03:20,606
Are you crazy? Hit your lips! That's not it.

929
01:03:20,886 --> 01:03:23,046
- Maybe?   - Who knows?

930
01:03:23,421 --> 01:03:26,606
Can you find this out from Aum?

931
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:28,526
I'm worried about my boyfriend.

932
01:03:28,832 --> 01:03:31,566
Okay. I'll try to ask him.

933
01:03:32,606 --> 01:03:33,726
All right, guys.

934
01:03:33,886 --> 01:03:37,606
Today is the last day before we close Bo Phloi for maintenance.

935
01:03:37,686 --> 01:03:39,726
Clear out your equipment and clean up.

936
01:03:39,926 --> 01:03:41,526
Of course, Young Master.

937
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:44,326
- Go.   - Guys, follow me.

938
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,086
Come here.

939
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:49,246
Let's split into groups of men and women.

940
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:53,048
Men will clean up the garden in the back.

941
01:03:53,213 --> 01:03:55,566
Women...

942
01:03:57,711 --> 01:03:59,166
What's he doing fitness for?

943
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:03,766
Women will clean up the living quarters. Let's go.

944
01:04:07,622 --> 01:04:09,006
He's getting fit.

945
01:04:13,062 --> 01:04:14,206
Young Master.

946
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,566
This is your lunch.

947
01:04:17,389 --> 01:04:18,709
Thank you.

948
01:04:19,837 --> 01:04:22,140
Are you sure you want this dish?

949
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:23,861
Yes. Sure.

950
01:04:45,726 --> 01:04:48,446
Aum! Come on.

951
01:04:49,406 --> 01:04:51,006
Come here.

952
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:57,086
Is Young Master eating veggies?

953
01:04:57,246 --> 01:04:59,206
Yeah. I'm confused too.

954
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:01,686
I'm not used to this.

955
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:08,486
Mrs. Sita, I'll send you the quotation right away.

956
01:05:08,726 --> 01:05:09,926
Thank you.

957
01:05:10,469 --> 01:05:12,046
Sorry to keep you waiting.

958
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,886
Apo.

959
01:05:14,566 --> 01:05:16,286
Don't get sad.

960
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:17,606
Why?

961
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:20,966
Is it that serious?

962
01:05:22,703 --> 01:05:23,966
Aum.

963
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:26,886
So what's wrong with Mueang?

964
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:31,606
Ms. Apo.

965
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,486
I analyzed his food

966
01:05:33,709 --> 01:05:36,926
and his fitness routine these days.

967
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:38,886
It's possible that

968
01:05:39,093 --> 01:05:40,766
Young Master has been seeing a doctor for...

969
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:43,726
Stop! I don't want to hear it again.

970
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:47,566
His "down there" is not functioning.

971
01:05:47,702 --> 01:05:49,526
- Not functioning?   - Yes.

972
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:51,246
Not...

973
01:05:52,966 --> 01:05:54,086
It's okay, Po.

974
01:05:54,206 --> 01:05:57,926
This thing can be fixed. Doctors these days are good.

975
01:05:58,044 --> 01:05:59,044
That's right.

976
01:05:59,134 --> 01:06:01,214
- Right? It's nothing.   - Yeah.

977
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:19,166
Mueang.

978
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:22,046
Are you okay?

979
01:06:22,366 --> 01:06:23,726
I'm okay.

980
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:25,926
Mueang.

981
01:06:26,429 --> 01:06:28,966
Whatever you're going through in your life,

982
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:30,646
please remember

983
01:06:30,806 --> 01:06:33,126
I'll always be here for you.

984
01:06:34,718 --> 01:06:36,166
Wait, Apo.

985
01:06:36,741 --> 01:06:39,046
What happened? Why did you say that?

986
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:42,646
Nothing happened.

987
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,826
I just wanted to tell you that no matter what's wrong with you,

988
01:06:47,158 --> 01:06:49,526
I still like you the way you are.

989
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,206
Okay.

990
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:54,686
Noted.

991
01:06:54,766 --> 01:06:56,006
That's why

992
01:06:56,606 --> 01:06:58,966
you don't need to be stressed and nervous.

993
01:06:59,073 --> 01:07:01,886
Yeah. I'm not stressed or nervous. Okay.

994
01:07:02,286 --> 01:07:03,526
Great!

995
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:06,006
Awesome!

996
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:08,886
You can continue your work.

997
01:07:09,021 --> 01:07:12,366
Here. I'll be working right beside you.

998
01:07:13,213 --> 01:07:14,406
Okay?

999
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:16,366
Let's do it.

1000
01:07:24,766 --> 01:07:25,926
Keep fighting.

1001
01:07:26,054 --> 01:07:27,406
Keep fighting.

1002
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,686
Are you okay?

1003
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:06,006
Mr. Phudin.

1004
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:07,766
Not now.

1005
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:09,886
I'm here to tell you I'm quitting.

1006
01:08:10,206 --> 01:08:12,286
If you want to stay in this house,

1007
01:08:12,382 --> 01:08:15,305
keep your feelings to yourself. Don't say it.

1008
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:16,806
I like you, Din!

1009
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:19,446
At five o'clock today,

1010
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:21,086
everything must change!

1011
01:08:21,254 --> 01:08:22,586
Let's go!

1012
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:28,733
I'm really anxious.

1013
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:30,454
I really need you, Master.

1014
01:08:30,846 --> 01:08:32,266
What master?

1015
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:35,006
Are you still stressed about that?

1016
01:08:35,134 --> 01:08:37,366
- What are you talking about?   - ED.

1017
01:08:37,934 --> 01:08:39,206
What the heck, Apo?

1018
01:08:39,302 --> 01:08:43,086
Are you crazy? What are you talking about? It's still working.
