1
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:03,045
Aunt Da and Ri traveled all the way here.

2
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:04,366
Would you let them stay?

3
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,886
- Yes. - Ms. Apo's relatives are using her like a servant.

4
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:10,086
Don't you feel bad for her at all?

5
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,606
Why would I feel bad for her?

6
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:13,086
She didn't even feel bad for me.

7
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:14,942
Help me! There's a thief!

8
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:17,446
Do you think my dad can protect you?

9
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:21,483
I'll tell you something. Nobody in this house can protect you.

10
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:23,886
Did Mr. Phudin lend me the money?

11
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:25,406
You ungrateful brat!

12
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:28,646
Leave my house now.

13
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:30,526
Thank you.

14
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:33,326
Nobody has ever saved me like that.

15
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:35,540
- Where's Apo? - She went out with Mueang.

16
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:37,646
- Where did they go? - I don't know.

17
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:40,046
I only know that Mueang went out hand in hand with her.

18
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,606
You can stay here if you still don't want to go back.

19
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:54,046
I'll send you off when you're ready.

20
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,566
Where have you been?

21
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:30,926
- It's... - Something happened today.

22
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,486
Mr. Phudin...

23
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:35,246
Go wait for me outside.

24
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,485
Listen to me, Mr. Phudin.

25
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,806
I want to listen to my son.

26
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,126
Just go along.

27
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,246
You should go.

28
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,533
Go.

29
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:06,006
Alright.

30
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,086
You can curse me however you want.

31
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,726
Go on.

32
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,926
Who said I would curse you?

33
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:18,766
I was going to thank you.

34
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:21,686
Thank me?

35
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,606
This isn't a hidden camera prank, is it?

36
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:27,206
Do you think I have that much time?

37
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:29,406
Why would you thank me, old man?

38
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:32,286
I was going to thank you for helping Apo.

39
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:36,486
How did you know?

40
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,106
Sita told me.

41
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,926
She saw you help Apo from Darin.

42
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:07,351
Anyway, I have to thank you

43
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,446
for looking after Apo for me.

44
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,806
I didn't look after Apo.

45
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:15,366
I was just passing by and saw it happened.

46
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:17,246
You still helped her.

47
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:21,726
You're not actually a heartless person.

48
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:23,966
Who's heartless?

49
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:25,486
Watch your words.

50
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,606
Since Apo came here,

51
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:30,566
you've changed a lot.

52
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:35,206
I haven't changed.

53
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,246
I'm the same.

54
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:43,246
That's fine, but I think you're actually a better person.

55
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,246
I was already a good person.

56
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:47,278
Just go back.

57
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,526
Not yet.

58
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:50,146
I still can't go back.

59
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,630
You have to tell me

60
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:54,566
what Darin did to Apo.

61
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,166
Mom, should we ask Mr. Phudin for compensation?

62
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:12,326
His son has hurt us. We can't just accept it.

63
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:14,166
I don't want to accept it either,

64
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:17,046
but everyone in this house is against us.

65
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,366
Who will be our witness?

66
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:21,126
It's Apo, Mom.

67
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,526
Po is the worst one here.

68
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,326
I told you

69
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,717
she didn't even help me when I fell down.

70
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:30,526
She even walked out of the house with Mr. Phudin's son.

71
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:32,926
Why didn't you tell the full story to her?

72
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:39,246
It's because you hurt Apo first,

73
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:41,406
so Mueang had to push you away.

74
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:43,166
Is that true, Mom?

75
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,246
Well, Mueang shouldn't have gotten involved.

76
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,606
It's just an aunt and her niece talking.

77
00:06:57,046 --> 00:07:00,406
Do you think I'll lend you money when you hurt my people?

78
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:01,806
Lend you money?

79
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,886
Mom, are you going to borrow money from Mr. Phudin?

80
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,766
You probably don't know that your mom took out a loan from a loan shark.

81
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,566
Mom, didn't you promise me you wouldn't take out a loan anymore?

82
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,126
I don't have enough money.

83
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,846
You've never learned your lesson.

84
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:21,646
Let me tell you.

85
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:23,965
I won't lend you money.

86
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:25,966
Let's go.

87
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:27,526
You can't do that.

88
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,966
If you don't lend me your money,

89
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:32,806
we're going to die.

90
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,526
I'm serious.

91
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:39,166
Me, Ri, Om, and Po.

92
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:41,006
We'll all die.

93
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:59,526
When I tell you about the truth,

94
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,246
I'll ask you one thing.

95
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,606
Please don't scold me too harshly. I'll be depressed.

96
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:08,853
Gosh. Stop getting sidetracked.

97
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:11,206
Just tell your story.

98
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:13,166
Okay.

99
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:15,526
The people I owe

100
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,486
are mafia.

101
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:18,966
- Mafia? - Mafia?

102
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:20,806
Yes.

103
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:25,046
It's my fault. I was stupid

104
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:27,086
to take out a loan from them.

105
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:29,886
I thought they would give me a fair interest,

106
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:31,886
but that's not what happened.

107
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,446
They asked for a lot worse interest.

108
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:39,086
When I didn't have money to pay them back,

109
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:42,526
they started to send people to threaten me.

110
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:44,886
Come out!

111
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:46,966
You're not paying your debt.

112
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:50,286
Darn it. Come out!

113
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:52,766
I know you're here.

114
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,966
If you don't pay your debt, you'll die.

115
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,606
At first,

116
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:07,926
they just threatened me that they'd confiscate the house.

117
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:09,966
But right now,

118
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:12,726
they told me they'd kill all of the family.

119
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:16,686
Aunt Da, why didn't you tell me in the first place?

120
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:20,326
I had no chance to tell you.

121
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,979
Shouldn't we call the police?

122
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,646
No. They said they have their own people in the police force.

123
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:30,966
Da, you're really the cause of disaster.

124
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:34,806
I'm really sorry.

125
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:37,566
I know that I'm a troublemaker,

126
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,038
but I have no one else to rely on.

127
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:43,086
That's why I have to take Ri here for now.

128
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,853
This is crazy. What if they come here?

129
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:47,950
What will happen to my house?

130
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,766
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

131
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,766
Mr. Phudin,

132
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,646
I have to apologize in her stead.

133
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,870
Aunt Da.

134
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,766
Is there any way we can negotiate with them?

135
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:09,006
They said if we transfer three million baht to them tomorrow,

136
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:11,806
they'd let me go.

137
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,118
Mr. Phudin.

138
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:23,726
When I took out a loan this time,

139
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:27,366
I didn't take it

140
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:31,126
for gambling or buying expensive things.

141
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,086
I took out a loan

142
00:10:34,237 --> 00:10:37,086
because I wanted to renovate my dorm.

143
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,450
I thought that if it were beautiful

144
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:42,486
and made a lot of money,

145
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:46,126
I wouldn't have to bother Apo again.

146
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:53,366
Mr. Phudin.

147
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:56,126
Even if you don't want to help me,

148
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:59,766
please think of it as helping my children.

149
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,246
I promise

150
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:07,446
I'll pay you back fully.

151
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:19,246
Mom, you always do something without consulting us.

152
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,966
You should know she doesn't want you to worry about money.

153
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,846
I'm not okay with this.

154
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,646
I'm also not okay with this.

155
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:30,326
If she can't pay Mr. Phudin back,

156
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:32,606
won't you have to marry like Po?

157
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,366
No way. I don't want to marry Mr. Phudin.

158
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,366
But if it's Mueang, I might want to.

159
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,566
Are you serious?

160
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,686
Mom's here.

161
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,486
Mom.

162
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,286
Mom, why are you crying?

163
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,646
We are going to survive now.

164
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,766
What happened?

165
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:03,606
Om, calm down.

166
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,046
This time,

167
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,206
it's worse than before.

168
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:09,086
How is it worse?

169
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,126
Your mom gets involved with someone who she shouldn't be involved with.

170
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:16,726
Listen, if all of you

171
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:19,126
still want to live in this world,

172
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,026
you have to do as I say.

173
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:35,806
I knew it. That woman is in need of money.

174
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:38,406
That's why she tried to steal something in the house.

175
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,406
I'll tell Din

176
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:44,086
that Apo intentionally brought her relatives here to steal our treasure.

177
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,486
Please wait a second.

178
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:49,406
- What's wrong? - Before you go to Mr. Phudin,

179
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,646
you should know about this first.

180
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:13,726
How many sides does she have?

181
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:30,886
When she cries,

182
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:33,886
she's small like this.

183
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:41,526
Why are you that surprised?

184
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:45,166
Why are you here?

185
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:47,606
You come to my house every day.

186
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,286
Don't you have your job to do?

187
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:51,966
I do have my job, but my store is already closed.

188
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:53,926
Do I have to stay in my store any longer?

189
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:58,126
Wait.

190
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:00,806
Why did you light up the candles? Are you feeling romantic?

191
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:02,686
That's not your business.

192
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:10,286
Hey.

193
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,846
What's wrong with your feet? Why are you walking like that?

194
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:33,606
Mueang, do you think you were a protagonist?

195
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,366
You were barefoot.

196
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:36,766
Look at you.

197
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,246
How are you, Mr. Cool-Guy Wannabe?

198
00:14:39,352 --> 00:14:41,553
Well, my feet are swollen.

199
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:51,526
Can I buy that laughing voice of yours for myself?

200
00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:52,886
When will you stop?

201
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,246
Okay.

202
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,646
Okay. I'll stop.

203
00:14:58,326 --> 00:14:59,726
You're really...

204
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:01,526
You said you would give up on her.

205
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:03,206
You can't do it, can you?

206
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,246
It's already done.

207
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,166
Why did you help her then?

208
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:11,166
I'm against domestic violence.

209
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:15,566
It's fine.

210
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,246
I was just teasing you.

211
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:21,166
Honestly, I think you did the right thing today.

212
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:23,126
I believe

213
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:26,046
that Ms. Apo is surely grateful to you.

214
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:29,086
She isn't.

215
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:32,766
She never even looks at me.

216
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,606
Po.

217
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:05,166
Why does your aunt always ask for trouble?

218
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:07,709
This time, she gets involved with the mafia.

219
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:09,806
I'm having a headache for you.

220
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:12,806
What did you do in your past life to deserve this?

221
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:21,246
Get out of my house.

222
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:30,806
Wear it.

223
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:44,846
But at least there are still some good things today.

224
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:05,006
Why don't you hug it?

225
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,126
Are you crazy? Who would hug shoes?

226
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,046
Well, I saw you stroke them.

227
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,126
I thought you missed the owner of those shoes.

228
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:16,486
Phing.

229
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:21,966
Look into my eyes.

230
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:27,046
Are you still reminiscing about what happened at the sea?

231
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:32,526
Who's reminiscing? You can't say that.

232
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:33,926
What?

233
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:36,038
From the look of your face, I know

234
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:39,446
that you still have feelings for Mueang, don't you?

235
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,806
Phing, stop!

236
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,006
Stop talking about impossible things.

237
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:49,506
You know what his status is and what mine is.

238
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:51,806
I said that because I do know.

239
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:54,166
I'm worried about you, Po.

240
00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:56,245
I'm afraid your life will be harder.

241
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:58,126
Enough. That's enough.

242
00:19:58,606 --> 00:19:59,886
Just go to bed.

243
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:03,126
I have to wake up early to clear Aunt Da's business tomorrow.

244
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:07,566
Change the topic.

245
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,766
Act like you're indifferent.

246
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,566
Throw the shoes away.

247
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:39,046
Mr. Phudin asked you to sign the contract in the office. Follow me.

248
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:04,286
Hello.

249
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:09,566
Is that true?

250
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,686
Please check it again thoroughly, Pui.

251
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:27,086
Mom, those mafias don't know where we are, right?

252
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:28,365
They don't know.

253
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:31,766
What if they follow your phone signal like in the movies?

254
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:34,966
I told you it's not like that.

255
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:37,406
I'll handle them if they come here.

256
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:40,166
- Good. - You really talk big. If they actually come...

257
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,486
Apo.

258
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,726
Apo.

259
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:46,726
Are you selling the necklace?

260
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:48,486
No?

261
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:52,486
Oh, someone I know told me that your aunt said that.

262
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:13,606
Pui.

263
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:15,846
I sent you the photo of the necklace.

264
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:19,126
Fifty million?

265
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:23,046
Well, Apo's interested in selling it.

266
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:25,206
But please don't tell anyone.

267
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,526
Yes.

268
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:33,246
What did you say, Aunt Da?

269
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,366
I wasn't going to sell it. I was just checking the price.

270
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,166
Thank you for telling me that,

271
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:46,646
but there was a misunderstanding.

272
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:48,526
I'm not going to sell it.

273
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:51,726
You can sell it if you're interested.

274
00:22:51,886 --> 00:22:54,806
- You can contact me... - No...

275
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:58,606
- What's going on? - What's happening?

276
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:05,086
- Go get Darin! - What?

277
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,766
- Stay still! - No!

278
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,806
Let me go! I'm not related to that family.

279
00:23:22,926 --> 00:23:24,046
Let me go.

280
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:27,006
Help! Please help us!

281
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,526
Please. I still haven't had a boyfriend before.

282
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,486
- Let me go right now! - No!

283
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:34,886
Why did you want Aunt Da?

284
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,806
We're going to transfer the money soon.

285
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:39,366
No, it's too late.

286
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:40,846
Our boss is impatient.

287
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,766
Let me go.

288
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:45,606
Let me go. Why would you capture me?

289
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,766
Stop talking.

290
00:23:46,854 --> 00:23:49,050
You still owe money to our boss.

291
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,846
No way. Just let me go!

292
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:55,366
Stop talking, or your daughter will die.

293
00:23:59,296 --> 00:24:01,985
Don't do that. Let me go.

294
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:04,726
- Stay still, or I'll shoot you. - Let me go.

295
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:08,671
How much do you want? I'll hire you to betray your boss.

296
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:09,886
Give me your account.

297
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:13,387
- Mom, please help me. I'm scared. - Get in the car.

298
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,566
If you don't want your family to die, get in.

299
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:19,125
- Get in! - Let her go!

300
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:21,846
- Get in the car! - Stay still!

301
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:25,366
- Mom! - Stay still!

302
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:28,686
- Mom, come down. - Let me go!

303
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,726
This is your punishment for paying my boss too late!

304
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:37,806
- This is a misunderstanding. - Shut up!

305
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:39,556
- Let me go! - No!

306
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:41,846
- Let me go! - No!

307
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:43,646
If you break your promise to our boss,

308
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:45,326
you must die!

309
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,006
Stop right now.

310
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:06,966
What are you doing?

311
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:12,846
I don't owe your boss any money.

312
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:14,246
Why did you capture me?

313
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,206
You don't owe money? What do you mean, Aunt Da?

314
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:20,686
It means I didn't take out a loan from anyone.

315
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:23,406
And this mafia thing didn't even happen.

316
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:26,766
I don't even know who these people are.

317
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,266
- What? - What?

318
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:36,286
I finally caught the liar in the act.

319
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,766
Thank you for the cooperation from the supporting actors.

320
00:26:07,397 --> 00:26:08,598
Mueang?

321
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:12,406
Here.

322
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:16,086
(It means I didn't take out a loan from anyone.)

323
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,766
(And this mafia thing didn't even happen.)

324
00:26:18,886 --> 00:26:20,057
(I don't even know)

325
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:22,366
(who these people are.)

326
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,447
The plan is successful.

327
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:32,166
Mom.

328
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:45,101
Wake up. I know you're acting.

329
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,006
She acts like she's dead.

330
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:50,126
She's probably pretending to be dead.

331
00:26:51,253 --> 00:26:53,206
If you don't wake up, I'll call the police.

332
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:01,006
Please don't call the police to arrest me.

333
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,686
I was wrong.

334
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:05,811
Do you really think you can swindle me to get my money?

335
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:09,640
I was suspicious about it when you talked about mafias. I investigated it,

336
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:11,886
and it's as I thought.

337
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,926
Those mafias you talked about don't exist.

338
00:27:15,428 --> 00:27:18,326
When I learned the truth, I called a big meeting.

339
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:20,966
I sent my people to investigate Darin,

340
00:27:21,246 --> 00:27:24,246
and I learned that those mafias don't exist.

341
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:28,406
There's no mafia or anything. Everything is a lie.

342
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:31,046
So, we'll set up a trap

343
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:34,006
to make Darin spit out the truth, understand?

344
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:37,206
Mueang, you'll wear a balaclava.

345
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:38,889
You'll go to them.

346
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,126
Act like a mafia. Hold them hostage.

347
00:27:43,214 --> 00:27:45,846
And beat them up. Understand?

348
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:50,152
You do that. As for you two, act like you know nothing. Understand?

349
00:27:50,238 --> 00:27:52,246
Try acting like you know nothing.

350
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,766
Good job.

351
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,566
Act like you know nothing. You all understand, right?

352
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:58,926
- Give me your hand. - Yes.

353
00:28:00,197 --> 00:28:01,446
Let's go.

354
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:05,326
We had a brainstorming session to come up with this plan.

355
00:28:05,677 --> 00:28:06,886
I'll tell you one thing.

356
00:28:07,046 --> 00:28:08,686
You're the only one

357
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:11,326
who can make my family work as a team.

358
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:20,886
But if you know that Aunt Da was lying,

359
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:22,806
you could just tell us.

360
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:25,926
No. She needs to learn some lessons.

361
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:29,686
We might get a heart attack first.

362
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:30,966
That's true.

363
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,286
I'm sorry about that.

364
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:35,886
But if I tell the truth to even a single one of you,

365
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,486
I'm sure you'll feel bad for her

366
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:38,846
and tell Darin about it.

367
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,606
My plan would be ruined.

368
00:28:41,382 --> 00:28:44,126
Also, I want her to say it with her own mouth

369
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,686
so that she will get trapped by her words.

370
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:50,086
Okay.

371
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:54,526
I admit that I was lying about the mafias,

372
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:57,166
but I really have debts.

373
00:28:57,372 --> 00:28:58,694
Your credit card debts?

374
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:03,439
You didn't use the money to renovate your dormitory.

375
00:29:04,015 --> 00:29:05,806
You spent it on brand-name goods.

376
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:08,446
Look.

377
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:11,406
Is this a person for whom you should be grateful?

378
00:29:12,406 --> 00:29:14,246
You're really too much.

379
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:16,006
Aside from lying to us,

380
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,326
you can still lie to your family.

381
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:20,478
A family wouldn't do this to each other.

382
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:23,286
What do you want from me?

383
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:25,966
I was wrong. I've already apologized.

384
00:29:26,206 --> 00:29:28,886
Are you going to take action against me?

385
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:30,846
- I won't do that. - What?

386
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:34,686
No way. You have to get rid of her.

387
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:38,086
Yes, Din. You can't let an evil person go like this.

388
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:39,926
We worked with you

389
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,846
because we want you to take action against her.

390
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,366
Who said I wouldn't take action against her?

391
00:29:46,797 --> 00:29:48,406
I'll let you go this time

392
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,566
with a condition.

393
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,446
What condition?

394
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:54,926
From now on,

395
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:57,012
you can't use your status as Apo's aunt

396
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:58,806
to control her life anymore.

397
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:15,446
I'd like to take Apo away from you.

398
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:19,446
Apo's freedom for your freedom.

399
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:21,846
What do you say? Do you want it?

400
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:00,766
- Where's Uncle Din? - He asked me to apologize to you.

401
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,446
You can go back.

402
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:03,853
Is that it?

403
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,197
He's going to apologize to you again.

404
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,286
What the hell happened?

405
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:13,046
You came at the wrong time,

406
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,806
so everyone had to play along.

407
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:18,526
Play along? Who would take responsibility if I was shocked to death?

408
00:31:18,607 --> 00:31:20,726
Your life insurance. Don't you have one?

409
00:31:20,886 --> 00:31:22,966
- Oh, wow. - I'm just kidding.

410
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:29,406
I'm sorry for hurting you.

411
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:30,866
You know how to apologize.

412
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,606
Yeah. I'm not like you who don't know how to apologize.

413
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:37,966
I was really in the wrong this time.

414
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,686
If something happens to you,

415
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,766
I'll take responsibility.

416
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:43,846
Okay?

417
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:47,446
I'm getting goosebumps.

418
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:50,686
- I'm leaving. - Wait a second.

419
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:54,766
Can you talk about Apo's family to me?

420
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:57,046
I want to know what their troubles are.

421
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:00,901
I might be able to help her.

422
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:06,606
You really didn't know about that before, right?

423
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:11,126
No. No one here knows about Mr. Phudin's plan.

424
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:12,406
Are you sure?

425
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:14,886
Mom, we're the ones who should be mad at you.

426
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:16,766
You lied to all of us.

427
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,606
I'm sorry.

428
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,166
As for Mr. Phudin's condition

429
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:22,886
that I can't get involved in your life,

430
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:24,406
did you know about that?

431
00:32:27,452 --> 00:32:32,406
I knew it. You don't dare to leave all of us for your happiness alone.

432
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:33,966
That's true.

433
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,406
Aunt Da.

434
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:42,846
Although I didn't know about Mr. Phudin's condition beforehand,

435
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,686
I decided

436
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,606
that I would never help you again.

437
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,606
I've helped you all the time,

438
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:54,566
but you never learn how to spend your money.

439
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:58,766
You still tried to steal some stuff here. You made up your story.

440
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:01,806
I don't want to hurt you,

441
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:04,674
and I don't want you to hurt anyone more than this.

442
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:07,006
- You! - From now on,

443
00:33:08,126 --> 00:33:11,046
you have to pay off your own debt by yourself.

444
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,006
- You! - Mom, get off her.

445
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:19,725
- This ungrateful niece. - Stop that.

446
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:21,571
- Let me go. - Aunt Da.

447
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:23,446
- Let me go. - Please stop.

448
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,166
I think this is for the best.

449
00:33:26,894 --> 00:33:28,486
Do you really want it like this?

450
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,326
Do you think this is for the best?

451
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:32,726
Fine.

452
00:33:33,662 --> 00:33:35,502
From now on, we're strangers.

453
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,806
I don't want an ungrateful niece like you!

454
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,566
From today onwards,

455
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:45,206
you and I are strangers.

456
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:46,606
Mom.

457
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:50,206
If you want to go back with me,

458
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:51,926
go pack your stuff.

459
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,886
We'll leave in half an hour.

460
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,950
Is this what you want, Apo?

461
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:14,086
Don't call me your sister anymore.

462
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:21,366
Po.

463
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:23,726
You did the right thing.

464
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:40,566
Please leave Mom and Ri alone for now.

465
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:42,686
This isn't the best time to talk with them.

466
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,950
Po.

467
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,206
When you decide that you won't help Aunt Da anymore,

468
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:53,166
I think it's the right decision.

469
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:55,817
Yes.

470
00:34:55,902 --> 00:34:58,006
The more you help her, the more spoiled she becomes.

471
00:34:58,726 --> 00:35:01,646
I hope she'll understand that it's for her own good.

472
00:35:05,078 --> 00:35:06,686
But there's one thing I'm curious about.

473
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:08,926
You always give in to her.

474
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,046
What made you realize this time?

475
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,926
You think of them as family.

476
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,646
But for them,

477
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,686
they think of you as something else.

478
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:25,686
Stop living for someone else

479
00:35:26,406 --> 00:35:28,526
and live for yourself for once.

480
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:34,386
I just don't want to be selfish.

481
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,246
I didn't tell you to be selfish.

482
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,926
I just want you to love yourself.

483
00:35:41,246 --> 00:35:42,486
Can you do that?

484
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:46,357
If you can't love yourself,

485
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:48,326
how would you be happy?

486
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:51,606
From someone unexpected.

487
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:12,326
Bye-bye.

488
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,206
And don't come back.

489
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:26,606
These people here are evil.

490
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:30,526
Do they have to be in such a hurry?

491
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:33,566
How would they dare to live here anymore?

492
00:36:33,878 --> 00:36:35,046
She got caught.

493
00:36:42,502 --> 00:36:43,686
There's another one.

494
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,886
Can I talk with you, Mueang?

495
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:01,166
You want to talk?

496
00:37:01,974 --> 00:37:03,126
Yes.

497
00:37:10,286 --> 00:37:13,486
- Should I go with you? - No, I can handle it.

498
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,526
Phing.

499
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:18,726
I'll help you, Phing.

500
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:21,626
Thank you.

501
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:28,486
Aum, I can take it from here. Thank you.

502
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:33,614
Phing.

503
00:37:35,526 --> 00:37:38,246
I apologize for making you scared earlier.

504
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:43,006
It's fine. You had to play your role. I understand.

505
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:46,846
Are you going back, Phing?

506
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:51,206
Yes. I have an important job, so I'll go with Aunt Da.

507
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,286
Phing.

508
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,246
Please give me a message when you're home.

509
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:08,166
Aum.

510
00:38:09,189 --> 00:38:10,966
I think

511
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:13,686
our relationship might not last.

512
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:17,566
We should just end it here.

513
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:23,006
Serve you right. You're the one who surprised me.

514
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:24,846
I'll wait for you.

515
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:29,606
Please have a safe trip, Phing.

516
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:33,046
Is he crazy?

517
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,006
Bye, Phing.

518
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,846
Om, where are you?

519
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:55,526
Yeah. He isn't here to help us load up our suitcases.

520
00:38:56,749 --> 00:38:58,046
We have to do it.

521
00:39:01,413 --> 00:39:04,046
Mom, wait a second. One, two, three.

522
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:06,046
I'm here.

523
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:12,029
Mom, don't act like nothing happened.

524
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:14,966
I still haven't paid you back for lying to me.

525
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:18,566
What's with you? Why are you hitting me?

526
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:22,086
I did all of these to make money for you.

527
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:24,046
Sure. Make money for us.

528
00:39:24,126 --> 00:39:27,646
Don't leave us hanging if you want to go with us.

529
00:39:27,758 --> 00:39:29,326
- Yes. - Come on.

530
00:39:33,686 --> 00:39:35,526
Please have a safe trip, Aunt Da.

531
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:48,606
Don't worry, Po. I'll talk with her.

532
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,726
Thanks, Om.

533
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:54,606
You also have to take care of yourself. I'll visit you again.

534
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:57,966
Come here.

535
00:39:58,325 --> 00:40:01,846
Why do you have to be that sentimental? Hurry up.

536
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:07,166
Don't worry. I'll talk with her. Take care.

537
00:40:07,326 --> 00:40:10,126
- Bye. - Have a safe trip.

538
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,919
I'm here, Mom.

539
00:40:14,966 --> 00:40:16,126
Bye.

540
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:41,046
Why has my life never been easy?

541
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:14,006
In your life,

542
00:41:14,853 --> 00:41:16,446
do you have anyone who always gives in to you?

543
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:18,446
How would I have one?

544
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:20,246
Think about it carefully.

545
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:23,006
Someone who would cover you from rain.

546
00:41:23,206 --> 00:41:25,926
Someone who would keep the last piece of your favorite food for you.

547
00:41:26,837 --> 00:41:28,206
Someone who would stay up

548
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:30,126
to listen to your trouble.

549
00:41:30,597 --> 00:41:31,806
Don't you have that?

550
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,166
Someone like that

551
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:35,846
doesn't exist in real life.

552
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:37,166
It exists.

553
00:41:37,726 --> 00:41:39,166
I know one.

554
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:40,806
It's Po.

555
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:44,326
My sister has always sacrificed herself for me.

556
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,726
She always protects me.

557
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:48,366
So,

558
00:41:48,846 --> 00:41:50,726
I'll never let my sister get hurt again.

559
00:41:51,181 --> 00:41:53,806
I beg you. Please don't hurt my sister anymore.

560
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:57,606
(At that moment, I realized that after all this time, )

561
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:59,966
(I only know Apo on a surface level.)

562
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:02,886
(She's not an optimistic person.)

563
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:06,606
(She needs to force her smile to get through her life.)

564
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,526
(She's not a strong person.)

565
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,974
(She just knows that in this world, )

566
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:14,645
(there's no place for a weak person.)

567
00:42:20,078 --> 00:42:21,266
Did you deceive me?

568
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:22,806
I haven't said

569
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,566
that I would return it to you.

570
00:42:24,998 --> 00:42:26,766
(She's not heartless, )

571
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:29,006
(but she has to be one)

572
00:42:29,853 --> 00:42:31,286
(for her family.)

573
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:44,926
(She)

574
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,206
(isn't different from me.)

575
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,046
(I understand her pain.)

576
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,686
(I understand her loneliness)

577
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:01,566
(so much that I want to stay beside her.)

578
00:43:16,118 --> 00:43:17,758
(But I forgot)

579
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,126
(that the one she wants beside her)

580
00:43:23,886 --> 00:43:25,086
(isn't me.)

581
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:19,006
It must be difficult, right?

582
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:22,406
Yes.

583
00:44:23,606 --> 00:44:25,606
While it's a relief for me,

584
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:27,486
I also...

585
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:28,846
You also feel guilty.

586
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:32,126
Yes.

587
00:44:34,101 --> 00:44:35,646
You have to stop thinking

588
00:44:35,853 --> 00:44:39,006
that you're the one who caused Darin and your family to be in trouble.

589
00:44:39,517 --> 00:44:40,886
Actually,

590
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,286
they shot themselves in the foot.

591
00:44:46,326 --> 00:44:48,446
I'm afraid that if I don't help them,

592
00:44:49,006 --> 00:44:50,606
they won't be able to survive.

593
00:44:51,966 --> 00:44:53,566
They have to.

594
00:44:53,766 --> 00:44:57,766
Think of it as you're making them stronger.

595
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,526
Thank you, Mr. Phudin.

596
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:10,166
I'd never think that you'd help me from Aunt Da.

597
00:45:11,285 --> 00:45:13,285
I only want to repay you

598
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:17,486
for not being angry at me when I didn't consult you before doing something.

599
00:45:17,575 --> 00:45:18,975
That's a relief for me.

600
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:26,326
Honestly,

601
00:45:27,286 --> 00:45:30,326
I've been wanting to get out of that house for a long time.

602
00:45:31,518 --> 00:45:33,046
But I was afraid that

603
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:36,646
I'd lose my only family.

604
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,046
When actually,

605
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:40,806
aside from Om,

606
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:44,886
no one in that house sees me as family.

607
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,606
During the time I'd lived in that house,

608
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:52,046
I always felt like I was an outsider.

609
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:55,886
Since I was a child,

610
00:45:56,646 --> 00:46:00,366
I've never had any place that I could call my home.

611
00:46:04,677 --> 00:46:06,046
What about this place?

612
00:46:09,846 --> 00:46:12,926
Can this place be your new home?

613
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,406
I understand you might think that everyone here hates you,

614
00:46:22,942 --> 00:46:28,846
but everyone came today to help you with Darin.

615
00:46:29,238 --> 00:46:30,686
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

616
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,886
I didn't force anyone to do that.

617
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:45,206
Are they all gone?

618
00:46:45,366 --> 00:46:46,646
Yes.

619
00:46:52,135 --> 00:46:56,246
This kingdom is mine again.

620
00:46:57,846 --> 00:47:00,846
This is so comfortable.

621
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,446
Wi.

622
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:05,286
Please be quiet.

623
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,486
Wi, Sita.

624
00:47:13,686 --> 00:47:14,806
Why are you here?

625
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:17,606
I'd like to thank both of you.

626
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:27,926
You don't have to thank me.

627
00:47:28,366 --> 00:47:31,046
I just helped you because I feel bad.

628
00:47:31,596 --> 00:47:33,766
Before you go to Mr. Phudin,

629
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:35,926
you should know about this first.

630
00:47:36,181 --> 00:47:37,446
What's that?

631
00:47:37,782 --> 00:47:40,966
Not only does Ms. Darin use Ms. Apo like a servant,

632
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,206
but she also uses violence against her.

633
00:47:46,941 --> 00:47:51,166
Sita and I hate violence the most.

634
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:53,726
That's right.

635
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,926
I can't stand seeing a woman get harmed.

636
00:47:59,374 --> 00:48:00,686
Also,

637
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,726
I'll never let your aunt swindle money out of us.

638
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:06,806
Yes.

639
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:10,926
I'm really sorry about that.

640
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:13,326
There's another reason.

641
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:15,366
Even Mueang helped you.

642
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,606
I just can't stand still then,

643
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:19,566
can I?

644
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:28,046
(Where is Mueang right now?)

645
00:48:28,877 --> 00:48:30,446
(Mueang has gone home.)

646
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:51,646
If you don't want it anymore,

647
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:53,397
I'll throw it away.

648
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:13,566
Mueang.

649
00:49:14,006 --> 00:49:15,206
Mueang.

650
00:49:18,757 --> 00:49:20,486
Are you here, Mueang?

651
00:50:16,957 --> 00:50:18,046
Mueang.

652
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,326
Mueang.

653
00:50:21,806 --> 00:50:23,206
If you want it, get it back yourself.

654
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:40,966
Is Mueang here?

655
00:51:41,206 --> 00:51:42,886
He's not here. He hasn't come back.

656
00:51:44,006 --> 00:51:46,446
Please tell me when Mueang is back.

657
00:51:46,693 --> 00:51:47,846
Of course.

658
00:51:54,288 --> 00:51:56,366
- I'll help you. - Thank you.

659
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,966
Thank you.

660
00:52:00,086 --> 00:52:01,326
Have a safe drive.

661
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:05,406
Why is she in such a hurry?

662
00:52:15,462 --> 00:52:18,086
Why is she in such a hurry?

663
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:27,486
We shouldn't live our lives in a hurry.

664
00:52:28,126 --> 00:52:29,566
We should slow down.

665
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:31,653
Wait, where did he come from?

666
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:36,046
Hey, you're back?

667
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:39,446
That's good. I have to tell Ms. Apo.

668
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,677
Tell her what?

669
00:52:43,046 --> 00:52:47,126
She was here to see you. She told me to tell her when you're back.

670
00:52:47,453 --> 00:52:48,726
Don't tell her.

671
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:51,006
I don't want to see her face now.

672
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:58,046
My friend is really the king of being dramatic.

673
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:00,310
What are you sulking about this time?

674
00:53:06,486 --> 00:53:09,486
- Poe, Ging. - Ms. Stepmother?

675
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:11,726
Where did you come from?

676
00:53:12,877 --> 00:53:14,606
Have you seen Mueang?

677
00:53:15,766 --> 00:53:17,686
We haven't seen him, Ms. Stepmother.

678
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:20,766
You haven't even seen him for just a second?

679
00:53:21,086 --> 00:53:23,606
Are you playing hide and seek with him?

680
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:28,206
Who's playing what? Can't you see that she's serious?

681
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:29,526
You're useless.

682
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:32,886
Who knows? Someone is hiding while another one is a seeker.

683
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,446
If it's not that, what would it be?

684
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:37,766
You're always playing around like this.

685
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:40,166
Please don't fight.

686
00:53:40,405 --> 00:53:42,405
If you see Mueang,

687
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:43,694
please tell me.

688
00:53:43,782 --> 00:53:45,406
- Of course. - Roger that.

689
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:46,566
Thank you.

690
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:09,366
- Oh, Ms. Stepmother, hello. - Hello.

691
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:15,606
What are you standing here for?

692
00:54:15,854 --> 00:54:18,486
- Have you seen Mueang? - Young Master?

693
00:54:18,918 --> 00:54:20,366
The park is almost closed.

694
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:22,326
He usually wouldn't be here at this time.

695
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:26,186
By the way, he isn't at Bo Phloi either.

696
00:54:26,454 --> 00:54:28,726
The employees are trying to find him.

697
00:54:29,286 --> 00:54:33,726
Did your young master go out to fight with someone again?

698
00:54:33,846 --> 00:54:36,326
My young master isn't a delinquent.

699
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:39,926
- He seemed scary recently. - Don't say that.

700
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,126
Is anything the matter, Ms. Stepmother?

701
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:44,446
Well, there's a little bit.

702
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:47,646
It's fine. You should continue with your work.

703
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:51,206
- Okay. - If there's anything we can help with, please let us know.

704
00:54:51,302 --> 00:54:53,326
- You can tell me. - You can tell me as well.

705
00:54:53,445 --> 00:54:54,644
Boem, that's enough.

706
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:55,933
You talked badly about him.

707
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:59,421
Young Master is weird. I saw him have a fight with a shrine the other day.

708
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:01,326
- Stop talking about that. - Fine.

709
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:11,886
Why hasn't he answered my call?

710
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:25,965
My heart is still trembling when I try to stop it.

711
00:55:26,046 --> 00:55:29,246
Why does it have to be like that?

712
00:55:29,351 --> 00:55:32,606
I'd like to erase the feeling

713
00:55:32,687 --> 00:55:35,366
that I have with you.

714
00:55:35,447 --> 00:55:38,686
The more I hurt, the more I love you. I don't understand.

715
00:55:38,822 --> 00:55:42,179
The more I hate you, the more I see you.

716
00:55:42,294 --> 00:55:44,326
Why do I have to love you?

717
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:49,126
I can only ask myself. Why does it have to be like that?

718
00:55:49,494 --> 00:55:51,246
I can understand you.

719
00:55:51,366 --> 00:55:53,686
But why are you like that too?

720
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,189
Phing...

721
00:55:57,382 --> 00:55:58,846
Please don't go.

722
00:55:58,966 --> 00:56:00,886
Please come back.

723
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:02,965
Aum.

724
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,766
She isn't yours, remember that.

725
00:56:06,046 --> 00:56:07,686
She is with the others.

726
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:10,286
It's written on the stove. Here.

727
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:14,006
- It hurts. - It's fine. Just eat this to heal your heart.

728
00:56:14,142 --> 00:56:16,606
- Isn't it good? - It's hot.

729
00:56:18,886 --> 00:56:20,926
I'm sorry. I forgot to blow it first.

730
00:56:21,366 --> 00:56:24,526
What's wrong with you? We're just starting. Why do you already seem drunk?

731
00:56:24,694 --> 00:56:26,046
What's wrong with that?

732
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:27,566
You have to support us.

733
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:29,446
Let's sing our second song, Aum.

734
00:56:29,654 --> 00:56:31,486
- Let's continue our concert. - Yes.

735
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:33,926
One, two, three.

736
00:56:34,014 --> 00:56:37,806
How would I live

737
00:56:37,949 --> 00:56:40,806
without you?

738
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:46,446
I probably have to live like I was dying.

739
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:49,366
My life

740
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:52,420
only needs you.

741
00:56:52,527 --> 00:56:57,846
I want you to understand.

742
00:56:57,927 --> 00:57:03,646
Who would I hug if I didn't have you anymore?

743
00:57:04,117 --> 00:57:09,966
Who would I kiss if I didn't have you?

744
00:57:10,701 --> 00:57:13,566
It's because you're you.

745
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:17,126
No one can replace you

746
00:57:18,661 --> 00:57:20,486
ever

747
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:24,446
again.

748
00:57:26,153 --> 00:57:27,646
Phing...

749
00:57:40,189 --> 00:57:41,646
Always dramatic.

750
00:57:52,374 --> 00:57:54,646
(Mueang, where are you?)

751
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:56,326
(Are you alright?)

752
00:57:56,645 --> 00:57:58,646
(Can you tell me what happened to you?)

753
00:58:04,117 --> 00:58:05,726
(Please answer me when you're free.)

754
00:58:05,998 --> 00:58:08,486
(I want to talk to you about my MP3 player.)

755
00:58:52,813 --> 00:58:53,966
Tin.

756
00:58:55,229 --> 00:58:57,646
Do you remember Po's MP3 player?

757
00:58:57,806 --> 00:58:58,966
Yes.

758
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:00,846
You kept it as a hostage.

759
00:59:01,148 --> 00:59:03,781
I know how important it is to Po.

760
00:59:04,212 --> 00:59:05,322
How?

761
00:59:05,403 --> 00:59:06,886
His brother said that...

762
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:09,046
It's Apo's late mother's MP3 player.

763
00:59:09,301 --> 00:59:11,526
She kept it with her all the time.

764
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,606
Every time when she was discouraged,

765
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:16,806
she'd turn it on to listen to the voice in it.

766
00:59:18,046 --> 00:59:21,086
I was curious about what was in there, so I turned it on.

767
00:59:22,566 --> 00:59:24,766
Do you know what that voice is?

768
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:26,206
How would I know?

769
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,486
It's her mother's voice.

770
00:59:48,806 --> 00:59:49,966
(Every day, )

771
00:59:50,326 --> 00:59:52,526
(when Apo came home, )

772
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:55,566
(her mom would be playing piano for her.)

773
00:59:56,973 --> 00:59:58,526
(She'd ask her...)

774
00:59:58,877 --> 01:00:01,446
How are you? Are you tired, my daughter?

775
01:00:01,606 --> 01:00:03,166
I'm not tired, Mom.

776
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:05,126
You should sit with me.

777
01:00:05,566 --> 01:00:07,126
I'll play it for you.

778
01:00:20,933 --> 01:00:22,166
(Some days, )

779
01:00:23,029 --> 01:00:25,046
(Apo came back home sad)

780
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:26,886
(as she was bullied.)

781
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:29,566
Mom.

782
01:00:35,582 --> 01:00:37,806
It's fine, my daughter.

783
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:41,406
My daughter is the best. Don't cry, alright?

784
01:00:52,503 --> 01:00:53,846
And you know what?

785
01:00:54,806 --> 01:00:57,526
The voice in that player is still as clear as crystal.

786
01:00:59,182 --> 01:01:01,086
Technology is really good.

787
01:01:04,496 --> 01:01:06,126
Let me hit you once.

788
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:08,446
Why did you hit me?

789
01:01:08,726 --> 01:01:10,446
You should give it back to her.

790
01:01:10,694 --> 01:01:12,366
It's really important to her.

791
01:01:13,926 --> 01:01:15,286
I already did.

792
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:17,326
Because if it's my mom's voice,

793
01:01:17,749 --> 01:01:20,126
I'd never let it disappear from this world.

794
01:01:21,566 --> 01:01:22,766
Good boy.

795
01:01:24,422 --> 01:01:25,806
Good job, my friend.

796
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:33,086
But...

797
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:37,366
But it's the last time I'll be kind to her.

798
01:01:37,749 --> 01:01:38,926
From now on,

799
01:01:39,311 --> 01:01:41,086
I won't feel bad for her again.

800
01:01:42,886 --> 01:01:44,326
You're acting tough.

801
01:01:45,246 --> 01:01:46,646
There's no way you can do it.

802
01:01:54,606 --> 01:01:55,726
Hey.

803
01:01:56,534 --> 01:01:57,686
Mueang,

804
01:01:58,518 --> 01:02:01,406
don't be quiet. Talk to me. I'm lonely.

805
01:02:21,053 --> 01:02:22,406
Tin.

806
01:02:26,726 --> 01:02:28,366
I think it's time.

807
01:02:57,462 --> 01:02:58,686
(Hello?)

808
01:02:58,966 --> 01:03:00,166
(Hello?)

809
01:03:06,926 --> 01:03:08,086
(It's me.)

810
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:13,306
(I don't want your apology)

811
01:03:13,726 --> 01:03:15,326
(or your gratitude.)

812
01:03:17,718 --> 01:03:19,126
(I gave it back to you)

813
01:03:20,126 --> 01:03:22,606
(because I don't want you to be involved with me anymore.)

814
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:27,206
(There's a saying that)

815
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:30,966
(you never realize the value of something until it's gone.)

816
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:33,686
(That's probably true.)

817
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:36,406
(I got my important treasure back today.)

818
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:42,646
(But in exchange, )

819
01:03:43,326 --> 01:03:45,286
(something else has disappeared.)

820
01:03:47,326 --> 01:03:50,846
(Seventy-two hours later.)

821
01:05:01,926 --> 01:05:03,166
(Strange.)

822
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:04,806
(It's too strange.)

823
01:05:04,997 --> 01:05:08,766
(It's strange that the person I see every day...)

824
01:05:13,584 --> 01:05:15,406
(The person I see at the dining table, )

825
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:22,366
(at the front of the house, )

826
01:05:25,224 --> 01:05:26,766
(at the corner of the house, )

827
01:05:35,254 --> 01:05:37,806
(the person I see when I open the door of my room, )

828
01:05:48,757 --> 01:05:50,406
(it seems like he disappears.)

829
01:06:08,129 --> 01:06:09,686
(Where has he gone?)

830
01:06:22,877 --> 01:06:24,126
Excuse me,

831
01:06:24,957 --> 01:06:26,326
well...

832
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,486
Have you seen Mueang?

833
01:06:28,661 --> 01:06:31,486
Young Master hasn't been here for two days.

834
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:33,726
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

835
01:06:38,183 --> 01:06:39,606
He isn't at the park.

836
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:41,546
Where has he gone?

837
01:06:43,246 --> 01:06:44,486
Is he sick?

838
01:06:57,686 --> 01:07:00,486
Probably not. He looks healthy.

839
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:02,541
Is it...

840
01:07:02,823 --> 01:07:04,086
My child...

841
01:07:04,539 --> 01:07:06,126
This world is cruel.

842
01:07:07,511 --> 01:07:09,166
People are cruel.

843
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:21,366
I...

844
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:24,726
Oh, no.

845
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,846
That can't happen.

846
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:30,886
Do I have to file a missing person report?

847
01:07:41,486 --> 01:07:42,846
It looks like you have competition.

848
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,486
- What competition? - There's another person who likes Ms. Apo.

849
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:46,646
Who?

850
01:07:46,766 --> 01:07:49,566
I finally got Apo's number.

851
01:07:49,686 --> 01:07:53,406
Please break up with Uncle Din and date me instead.

852
01:07:54,693 --> 01:07:57,397
You've never come to my store before.

853
01:07:57,495 --> 01:07:59,806
Are you trying to hide your face from someone?

854
01:08:02,477 --> 01:08:03,646
Mueang.

855
01:08:04,685 --> 01:08:06,766
I'll get going now if there's nothing else.

856
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:11,766
Let me go.

857
01:08:12,231 --> 01:08:14,726
Listen, although I was being a bit nice to you,

858
01:08:14,878 --> 01:08:15,966
it doesn't mean we're good now.

859
01:08:16,086 --> 01:08:18,566
- This can easily end when you and Mr. Phudin talk... - Get out.

860
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:19,686
No!
