1
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:03,726
If you cross my line once again, I'll kick you out of here.

2
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:06,165
Mueang sure is a tricky one.

3
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:08,166
We're starting construction soon,

4
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,806
and he hasn't moved his workers out yet.

5
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:12,726
I'm here to talk about Bo Phloi.

6
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:14,886
What is it? Do you want to kick me out too?

7
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:17,966
Mueang, you need to evacuate your workers by tomorrow.

8
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:19,966
Someone is here to kick us out, Young Master.

9
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:21,166
Did my old man send them?

10
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:23,686
They said Miss Apo sent them.

11
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:25,926
If there's nothing else,

12
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:27,846
I'll get going now.

13
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,046
I think I can't co-exist with Apo anymore.

14
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:36,526
- What do you mean?   - I'll do what I think is the right thing, okay?

15
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:39,326
Get out. I hope we never meet again.

16
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,446
The important thing that I want to do

17
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:46,846
is to clear all the workers from Bo Phloi in three days.

18
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,646
- Understand?   - Of course.

19
00:02:49,013 --> 00:02:51,406
- Mr. Phudin.   - Yes?

20
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,486
What is this, Mueang?

21
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,926
Do you really want it that badly?

22
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,486
Bo Phloi has to be closed down.

23
00:03:09,677 --> 00:03:10,846
I won't close it down.

24
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,686
Even if you bring your own people here again, I won't close it.

25
00:03:13,798 --> 00:03:16,804
Listen, it's time for you to grow up, Mueang.

26
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,566
Everything has to change.

27
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:22,006
When something changes, it should be for the better, not worse.

28
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,135
What did I do to make it worse?

29
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:26,886
You didn't think of other consequences.

30
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:30,966
We've talked about this several times.

31
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:34,126
What the consequences of changing the landscape of that area are.

32
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:40,046
I'll give you your last chance.

33
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:41,886
Change your mind,

34
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,126
or we'll become strangers.

35
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,686
You shouldn't have sent your people there.

36
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:07,006
I was too impatient.

37
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:10,926
If you keep pushing this and keep forcing him,

38
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:13,486
you won't get what you want.

39
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,926
I'm sorry,

40
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:17,766
but I didn't ask for your opinion.

41
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:21,526
But I want to offer my opinion.

42
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:24,286
You're going in the wrong way.

43
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:27,646
The relationship between you two will only get worse.

44
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:31,766
Your duty is to do as I say, not to give me an order.

45
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,846
I just can't do as you say.

46
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:37,766
How could you expect something new

47
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,126
by doing the same old things?

48
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,286
Thank you for your concern.

49
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:43,591
However,

50
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:45,513
I know Mueang better than you.

51
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:48,246
So, I know how to handle him.

52
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,046
How would you know

53
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:55,606
that you know Mueang the best?

54
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,926
There might be other things that you didn't know about.

55
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:18,726
(Although Mueang might seem fine outside,)

56
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:21,486
(he's actually hurt deep inside.)

57
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:36,886
How would you know?

58
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:40,126
I just felt like he's lonely.

59
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:43,646
He actually wants you deep down.

60
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:48,886
(Why do you think)

61
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:50,726
(we still)

62
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:54,006
(dream of the things we want to forget the most?)

63
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,246
(Is it because we hate it so much?)

64
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,366
(or is it because we love it so much?)

65
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:05,086
(The time of incident, 3 am)

66
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:06,006
(The time of incident, 4.45 am)

67
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:27,566
Mueang.

68
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:31,438
Why are you standing there?

69
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:41,246
Sleepwalking?

70
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,366
Dad.

71
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,229
Dad.

72
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:37,526
Mueang.

73
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,806
It's fine.

74
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:13,086
(It'd be nice if we could choose what other people would dream about.)

75
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:18,246
(I'd like him to have a good dream instead of a nightmare.)

76
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:28,862
(If I could calm you down,)

77
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:32,061
(I'd like to do that for you, Mueang.)

78
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:11,846
Mueang.

79
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:35,806
Mueang.

80
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:11,566
Dad...

81
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:14,926
Don't go.

82
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,806
Take in the water and sunlight.

83
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:49,606
Take in the water and sunlight

84
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:53,046
so that you'll grow up. Your leaves will be green.

85
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,006
And a lot of customers will come here to buy you.

86
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:01,286
Why are you here?

87
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,086
I'm here to buy plants.

88
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,126
Do you have that hobby?

89
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:08,166
I'll start today.

90
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:09,447
Is that true?

91
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,953
I won't sell them to you if you leave them to death.

92
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:18,406
I'd like this one.

93
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:24,806
I'd like this, this, this, and this small one as well.

94
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:27,806
This one, and this one.

95
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:30,406
You're pointing at everything. Don't you want to know the price?

96
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:32,126
I can pay for them all.

97
00:14:33,326 --> 00:14:35,206
And...

98
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:37,526
This one too.

99
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:39,606
This one.

100
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:42,486
This one, that one.

101
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,166
This one.

102
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:46,046
And...

103
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:52,686
- This one is good. What is this called?   - That's not for sale.

104
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:54,326
Go look at others.

105
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:58,046
I want this one. Dig it up for me.

106
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:00,726
The last one.

107
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:02,366
- Is that all?   - Yes.

108
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:04,086
Give me the bill.

109
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:05,686
- It's 45,000 baht.   - Huh?

110
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:08,526
This much is 45,000 baht?

111
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,766
Are you scamming me?

112
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:13,286
This is already a good price. You can go to other stores if you want.

113
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,486
I'll call the OCPB.

114
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,086
- Do you want them or not?   - Yes.

115
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,126
- I want them.   - Okay.

116
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:21,406
I'll call my people to help carry them to your car.

117
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:22,646
Wait.

118
00:15:23,014 --> 00:15:24,446
I'm not here

119
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:28,166
to only buy your plants. I have a job offer for you as well.

120
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:31,766
- What job?   - Since you're close to Uncle Din,

121
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:35,446
I'd like to hire you to do anything to get me that necklace.

122
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:39,438
I understand now.

123
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,606
What is this? Where are you going? Let me go.

124
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:53,206
Let me go! Ouch!

125
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:54,942
Hey!

126
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:59,206
Bye. Please go back. You're being nonsense.

127
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,766
I'm your customer.

128
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,766
Go home.

129
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,286
Bye.

130
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,966
Where are you going? Come back here right now. Hey!

131
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:31,086
What is wrong with Din?

132
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:33,326
Why is he not here yet?

133
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:36,286
He had a fight with Mr. Mueang again.

134
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:40,206
Really? I'll check on Din then.

135
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:44,206
No. Mr. Phudin doesn't want to be bothered.

136
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:47,246
But I'm worried about him.

137
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,206
Please hold it for now.

138
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:51,046
We have to leave Mr. Phudin alone for now.

139
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,886
Don't be in a hurry to score points with him.

140
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,870
Please sit down.

141
00:17:01,109 --> 00:17:02,606
That's a bit much.

142
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:30,086
(Mueang, turn it around. Turn it around like this. Good.)

143
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,246
(It'll clean the dirt on it.)

144
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,326
(Yes, turn it around like that.)

145
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,646
Dad, am I good at panning gems?

146
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,886
Mueang, you're really good at it

147
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,566
but not as good as I am.

148
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,046
I'm still the best.

149
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,926
If you want to be better than me,

150
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:48,726
should we compete to see who's better?

151
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:54,446
The one who finds a pink gem first is the winner, alright?

152
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:56,286
- Okay.   - Sure.

153
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:02,126
- I'll win against you anyway.   - Really? I won't lose against you.

154
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:11,566
(These two are really having fun.)

155
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:15,846
- (Hey, Mueang.)   - (Mueang.)

156
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:17,766
(Give me a nice smile.)

157
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,286
(Mueang and Din, please bring me a lot of gems.)

158
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:34,520
- (We'll make this place full of happiness.)   - (This gem is big.)

159
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:37,006
(It's going to be the happiest place.)

160
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:52,246
He actually wants you deep down.

161
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:54,646
I don't feel that.

162
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:59,886
Every child wants love and understanding from their parents.

163
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,326
I think you should be gentle to Mueang for once.

164
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:07,406
Why don't you tell Mueang to be gentle to me?

165
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:10,646
If you two think like that,

166
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,806
there's no way you two can talk.

167
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:18,566
What do you want me to do?

168
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,646
Slow down The Maze Project.

169
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:25,806
I have a way to make both of you talk without fighting.

170
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:27,286
What way?

171
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:29,006
Please trust me, Mr. Phudin.

172
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:32,646
My way will make your dream come true.

173
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,406
Why are you here?

174
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:58,126
Mr. Phudin sent me to learn about work in Bo Phloi.

175
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,206
No way.

176
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,526
Go back. I don't want to see your face.

177
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:07,126
Mr. Phudin agreed to slow down this project for you.

178
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:10,646
You and your workers don't have to move away.

179
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:14,046
What trick is he using this time? Are you lying?

180
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:16,806
This is the document showing that he's slowing down The Maze

181
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,526
with his signature.

182
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:21,705
(Notification of Slowing Down of The Maze Project)

183
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:24,046
(Mr. Phudin Phuwanat, President of Phudin Park)

184
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:27,366
If you agree to teach me,

185
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,646
this document will be effective immediately.

186
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:33,726
If not, this document will be voided.

187
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,926
Why do you want me to teach you? Are you that free?

188
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:42,486
What trick are you trying to pull again?

189
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:47,046
You want me to send you to Bo Phloi?

190
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:51,246
Yes, if I learn how Bo Phloi works,

191
00:20:51,702 --> 00:20:54,286
I'll be able to find a solution for The Maze.

192
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:59,086
I'm not here to play tricks.

193
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,206
I'm here to do what my mind wants me to do.

194
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:19,686
What do you say? Will you teach me? Or will you throw that paper away?

195
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,206
Can you wait? Let me think for a bit.

196
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:52,206
- Hey, hold on.   - You said you wanted a bit of time. This is too long.

197
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:53,861
This is serious stuff.

198
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:56,006
I have to be careful, especially with you,

199
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:57,686
since you're a trickster.

200
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,366
Don't you want to close it?

201
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:03,086
Don't be a coward.

202
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:04,926
Just wait outside.

203
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:07,086
I can't think if you're close to me. Leave.

204
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:09,597
Leave.

205
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:11,886
- Don't close the doors.   - Leave.

206
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,206
Leave. Go wait outside.

207
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:21,806
Don't take too long.

208
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,486
Why is he taking so long?

209
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,646
So, what do you think?

210
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:55,646
I think

211
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:57,205
I'll teach you.

212
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,326
- Yes!   - But I have one condition.

213
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:02,086
What condition?

214
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:03,726
I don't like you to be close,

215
00:23:03,886 --> 00:23:07,046
so you have to keep a gap of one meter from me.

216
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,206
Okay.

217
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:18,110
Hold it. Hold it for me.

218
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:26,886
It's this much.

219
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:29,086
You have a measuring tape with you?

220
00:23:30,438 --> 00:23:33,046
I have it to measure tables or sofas that I like

221
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,446
or check the size of tiles.

222
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:36,886
You're weird.

223
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,566
Okay. That's the deal.

224
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:40,126
Do what you want.

225
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:42,846
When will we begin to work?

226
00:23:43,317 --> 00:23:44,686
What about right now?

227
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,966
Okay.

228
00:23:46,318 --> 00:23:47,646
We'll begin.

229
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:56,566
This Bo Phloi is owned by my mother's side of the family.

230
00:23:56,806 --> 00:23:58,406
They've been mining in it for over 100 years.

231
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,766
Other places use machines like my dad's mine.

232
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,926
For this place, we still conserve the traditional mining technique.

233
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:09,006
Are you trying to possess me?

234
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:10,806
Didn't we agree to stay one meter apart?

235
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:19,206
How would you know where to mine?

236
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:22,406
If we want to find a tunnel, we'll dig on each side.

237
00:24:23,686 --> 00:24:26,246
We'll go to the side where there's a lot of gems.

238
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,166
Follow the gems.

239
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:31,686
I'll let you go in that pit today.

240
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:39,766
You aren't trying to kill me, right?

241
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,166
Change your shoes and follow me.

242
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:52,846
Palm.

243
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:55,526
- Give me a bucket.   - Yes, Young Master.

244
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,717
- What is this?   - Wear it on your head.

245
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,206
Sorry.

246
00:25:34,694 --> 00:25:36,126
Someone's calling me.

247
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:50,726
Gouge the soil out like this, okay?

248
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:52,766
When it's out, we'll pick it up

249
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:56,006
and put it in this bucket like this.

250
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:58,646
Now, try it.

251
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:01,006
Okay. Like this.

252
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:05,926
Do you only have this much strength?

253
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:07,926
Give it more.

254
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:14,102
I can't see the soil coming out. Stronger.

255
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:16,470
Like this. See?

256
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:18,566
Stab it in and twist it.

257
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:21,246
Stab it in and twist it. You can't just stay still.

258
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:26,486
Pick the soil up.

259
00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:30,486
Are you already tired?

260
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:37,806
Hey, there's soil on your face too.

261
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:49,806
Stab it in and twist it.

262
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,259
Twist it.

263
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:54,104
What?

264
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,966
- I found it.   - What did you find?

265
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,534
Let me see.

266
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:06,566
Oh!

267
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:09,606
This isn't a gem. It's a rock.

268
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,566
You're bad at this.

269
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:26,333
What do I have to do next?

270
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:33,006
I'm fighting for life, but life fights back.

271
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,646
What do I have to do next?

272
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:37,806
You'll pan the gems next. Go.

273
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:56,286
You're panning the gems. You don't need your hips.

274
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:02,966
For this step, you have to be watchful.

275
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:09,646
Found it.

276
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:12,286
What do they call this?

277
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:14,846
It's amethyst.

278
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:16,446
Is it expensive?

279
00:28:16,717 --> 00:28:19,286
What? Do you want to mine gems to pay off your debt?

280
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,206
I was just asking.

281
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:27,806
It's a small one. It wouldn't be that much.

282
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,846
However, the value of it isn't up to the price.

283
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,606
These gems had been crystallized for hundreds or thousands of years.

284
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:36,286
The true value of it

285
00:28:36,742 --> 00:28:38,486
depends on the moment we find it.

286
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:55,566
It's a rare item, get it?

287
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:15,286
Hey.

288
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:20,526
Hey.

289
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,326
What?

290
00:29:25,437 --> 00:29:27,286
I asked if you understand it's a rare item.

291
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:33,166
I get it. I know it's hard to find.

292
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:34,726
That's it.

293
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,926
What are you standing still for?

294
00:29:38,534 --> 00:29:40,566
We'll continue. Keep that on you.

295
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,654
What are you looking at? Just pan the gems.

296
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,806
Was everything alright while I wasn't here?

297
00:30:56,918 --> 00:30:58,246
There was no problem, Ms. Ing.

298
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,686
What about the production team?

299
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:03,806
They're here, but they'd like to brief you about the script.

300
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:06,526
- You can let them come in.   - Of course.

301
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:23,326
Please come in.

302
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,006
Please wait here for a moment.

303
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:30,486
Thank you.

304
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,406
The fact that Jiratcha is selling in over 120 countries,

305
00:31:38,517 --> 00:31:40,517
what do you think is the strength of the brand?

306
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:43,126
Our strength is our idea.

307
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:46,206
Usually, when Thai brands are imported overseas,

308
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:48,206
they put emphasis on the uniqueness of Thailand.

309
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:50,326
For our brand, we put emphasis on concepts.

310
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:52,566
We try to make it fit the international standard

311
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:55,486
so that overseas customers understand and relate to it.

312
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:59,606
When I design the products, I'd like them to be used in daily life.

313
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:02,166
Our necklace has a lot of different styles,

314
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,246
such as this one. It can be worn in different styles.

315
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:08,966
If we wear it like this, it'll have a luxurious vibe to it.

316
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:14,006
If we let it out like this, it'll have a wild vibe, perfect for parties.

317
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:18,606
Do you have any tips that you'd like to tell our viewers?

318
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:22,446
Do it with passion, or don't do it at all.

319
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:25,846
My tip is to do everything with passion.

320
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:28,206
If you don't, it'll be for nothing.

321
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:29,766
With today's interview,

322
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,006
you probably get some inspiration from this beautiful and successful woman.

323
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:34,979
Thank you for today, Ms. Ing.

324
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,406
- You're welcome.   - Thank you.

325
00:32:36,502 --> 00:32:37,566
Please come this way.

326
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:39,326
- Thank you.   - Thank you.

327
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:41,206
We're done, right?

328
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,294
Ms. Ing, I'd like the microphone back.

329
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:48,229
I almost forgot. Thank you.

330
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:04,286
Why did you follow me here after this morning?

331
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:07,326
You always like to say I like to follow you around.

332
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,686
My mom asked me to get her the necklace.

333
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:12,486
She also asked me to talk about the gem festival with you.

334
00:33:12,886 --> 00:33:15,846
Wait a second. Do I have to work with you from now on?

335
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,806
Why? Did your parents ask you to help with their job?

336
00:33:23,406 --> 00:33:26,606
My mom just asked me to run errands for her.

337
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:28,245
Do you have a problem?

338
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,766
Not really.

339
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:31,244
Good.

340
00:33:31,647 --> 00:33:36,006
I thought you were a different person from the one who was interviewed.

341
00:33:36,102 --> 00:33:39,966
Who is different? That's my true self.

342
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:44,286
How is it? Don't I look smart?

343
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:46,566
Yeah. You're smart.

344
00:33:47,197 --> 00:33:48,566
I like it.

345
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:58,606
But we have a lot of those people.

346
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:02,006
I like smart people who are compassionate more.

347
00:34:03,077 --> 00:34:06,406
Are you trying to say I'm not compassionate again?

348
00:34:07,273 --> 00:34:11,406
Listen, when I do something for someone, it's not like I announce it.

349
00:34:11,846 --> 00:34:13,606
- Really?   - Yes.

350
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:15,726
I really like to help others.

351
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:18,006
That's good. Now then,

352
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:20,646
if you agree to accompany me to one place tomorrow,

353
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:24,006
I'll help you with Mueang's mom's necklace.

354
00:34:26,453 --> 00:34:27,886
Really?

355
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:29,589
Yes.

356
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:32,358
Let's continue with our business.

357
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:41,502
- My Ging.   - You're pretty.

358
00:34:41,591 --> 00:34:43,366
You're so beautiful today.

359
00:34:43,502 --> 00:34:45,486
I don't think you'll get any sleep today.

360
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:48,566
- Please turn around.   - One, two...

361
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,206
- Just like that.   - Wow.

362
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:53,366
Oh wow, Ms. Stepmother.

363
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:58,766
Ms. Stepmother.

364
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:00,246
Just like that.

365
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,046
So beautiful.

366
00:35:03,222 --> 00:35:05,366
- What is that one?   - The biggest one.

367
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:10,726
- I'm here. Ta-da.   - Wow.

368
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:13,791
We'll have another pose. Like this.

369
00:35:13,877 --> 00:35:15,922
Another one. Like that.

370
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:18,086
Another pose. Like this.

371
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:28,748
Thank you. Thank you so much.

372
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:31,846
These costumes are gorgeous, Boem. It's really nice.

373
00:35:33,053 --> 00:35:35,286
Thank you for your praise, Ms. Stepmother.

374
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:40,086
Ms. Stepmother, do you think I can have my own clothing brand?

375
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:47,366
(Boem, Soraphong Ngammak, 30 years old.)

376
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,486
(My dream is to establish my own brand of clothing)

377
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,686
(that destroys the limit of beauty standards.)

378
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:59,006
No matter your size, you can be a princess in your own way.

379
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:01,926
Real-size beauty.

380
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:05,806
Of course. You can do it now. What are you waiting for?

381
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,046
There's just one thing.

382
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:10,846
- What?   - I don't have money.

383
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:15,086
Well, dreams cost money.

384
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:18,406
Yes. That's why dreams are things that only rich people can have.

385
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:21,166
Hey, Ging. That's not true.

386
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:24,620
No matter if you're poor or rich, everyone can have a dream.

387
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,119
It's up to your determination.

388
00:36:27,205 --> 00:36:30,006
Who would have an easy dream like you, Son?

389
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:31,326
What?

390
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,046
- Is it tight now?   - Yes.

391
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:41,486
My name is Son, Surasak Maniphak.

392
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,766
My dream is to become the employee of the year of Phudin Park.

393
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:50,286
(It's not that big of a dream, but I'll go all in for it.)

394
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,092
A round of applause, please.

395
00:36:58,046 --> 00:37:00,206
Make it louder.

396
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:05,006
Look at me.

397
00:37:06,454 --> 00:37:10,166
It's not wrong for Son to dream of becoming the employee of the year.

398
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:13,326
But among us,

399
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:15,366
Ging's and my dreams

400
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,166
are the most difficult ones.

401
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:29,900
I'm Poe, Suphaphon Jaijo.

402
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,606
I'm 27 years old. I'm a cute Thai lesbian.

403
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:37,652
I'm Ging, Gingkaew Sukjaijang, 25 years old.

404
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:39,806
I'm a Thai woman with cool tastes.

405
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:43,806
We believe our true love has no limit.

406
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:46,726
Our dream is to get married.

407
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,446
- This is real.   - We didn't print it.

408
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:02,726
You want to get married with equal standing?

409
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:05,086
I don't know that,

410
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:07,966
but what I know right now is Poe hasn't proposed to me yet.

411
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,286
I've been waiting.

412
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:12,566
Hey, I told you I was saving up money.

413
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:15,646
As your future husband, I've been making our life plan.

414
00:38:15,948 --> 00:38:18,846
You should be proud of me.

415
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,406
Before you get married,

416
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:26,566
can you stop fighting first?

417
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:27,766
Yes.

418
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,526
Can I ask you something?

419
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:34,726
Does this place not offer much salary?

420
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:36,760
It's not that.

421
00:38:36,886 --> 00:38:40,510
We feel like we're oppressed. Isn't that right, Son?

422
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:42,766
Boem, watch your words.

423
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,246
I'm already being nice here. If I have to say it clearly,

424
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:49,126
your young master is power-crazy.

425
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:52,006
He thinks he's always right. Don't you remember last year?

426
00:38:52,126 --> 00:38:55,086
He fought with his workers, and then he fired them.

427
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:10,798
Do you think you can do anything when you're our superior?

428
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,326
I won't stand it anymore.

429
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:13,966
If you can't stand this,

430
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:15,886
leave my gang now!

431
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:51,406
Leave my gang now!

432
00:39:51,613 --> 00:39:53,446
Yeah. He was exactly like this.

433
00:39:53,597 --> 00:39:56,526
- Is that true? Is Mueang that bad of a delinquent?   - Yes.

434
00:39:56,629 --> 00:39:59,846
Yes. Aum has told me that Young Master

435
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:01,606
was really naughty when he was young.

436
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:03,940
(First Net@Games)

437
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:06,286
You two are asking for trouble.

438
00:40:06,398 --> 00:40:08,006
Your shirt is asking for trouble.

439
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,486
Should we get them?

440
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:13,286
Let's get them.

441
00:40:15,486 --> 00:40:17,046
(Mueang, the rubber band master.)

442
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,206
- Did you just shoot me?   - Yeah.

443
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,166
Tin.

444
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:30,366
(Tin, the broken glasses.)

445
00:40:30,582 --> 00:40:31,966
You broke my glasses.

446
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:33,766
You...

447
00:40:34,374 --> 00:40:36,486
- You...   - Get him.

448
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:41,766
Tin, get here.

449
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:47,046
- Our finishing moves.   - What is that?

450
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:48,590
- Yeah!   - Yeah!

451
00:40:55,573 --> 00:40:58,486
Why does Mueang's story sound like a legend around here?

452
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:01,286
Well, he has done a lot of stuff.

453
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,486
So, did those workers get fired?

454
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:07,846
What do you think? Of course, they got fired,

455
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:12,046
but they still come here to try to provoke Young Master.

456
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:13,886
Isn't that right?

457
00:41:14,246 --> 00:41:15,526
Yes.

458
00:41:20,446 --> 00:41:22,606
- Young Master?   - Yeah.

459
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:28,806
You can ask me what you want to know. I'm here for you.

460
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:33,726
I'll just go watch Hone-Krasae.

461
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:35,966
That show airs at 12.30 pm.

462
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,726
I'll watch the archive. They say this episode is tense.

463
00:41:41,262 --> 00:41:42,806
I won't be able to catch up with my friends.

464
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:53,046
I'll go ask the director to see how we should leave this scene.

465
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:54,806
- Goodbye.   - Goodbye.

466
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,486
- Let's go, Ging.   - Poe, Ging.

467
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:03,646
Ms. Stepmother, I wish you good luck then.

468
00:42:05,382 --> 00:42:07,046
- Son.   - Ging.

469
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:11,206
So?

470
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:14,406
Was the bedtime story fun?

471
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:16,406
What story?

472
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:18,526
Go back to bed.

473
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:22,166
- You have to wake up early to work. Are you going to skip work?   - Roger.

474
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:55,046
Hot cocoa for you, Young Master.

475
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:58,086
Oh? Thank you so much.

476
00:43:07,406 --> 00:43:08,726
Is anything the matter?

477
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:13,606
Did you let Ms. Apo work at Bo Phloi?

478
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:15,446
Yes.

479
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:19,206
I keep her close so I can easily find out about the old man's plan.

480
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:21,366
Is that good?

481
00:43:21,447 --> 00:43:22,766
If you keep her close to you,

482
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:25,046
she can report what she learns to Boss.

483
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:32,566
Young Master, that gang

484
00:43:32,686 --> 00:43:34,219
said they would come to see you tomorrow.

485
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:37,246
Huh? Haven't they learned their lesson?

486
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:38,806
I tried to stop them.

487
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:43,006
Forget it.

488
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:45,246
If they want to come, let them come.

489
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:47,326
I'll show them.

490
00:43:47,466 --> 00:43:49,286
Please calm down, Young Master.

491
00:44:07,428 --> 00:44:11,846
Boem, you told me last night that someone's threatening your young master.

492
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,166
- Is it true?   - It is.

493
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:17,766
I think they've been fighting like this for some time.

494
00:44:18,062 --> 00:44:19,406
Last month,

495
00:44:19,646 --> 00:44:21,526
I saw Young Master's back.

496
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:24,726
There are bruises all over his back.

497
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:26,406
It's so scary.

498
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:41,566
Put it there. We'll have to pan it later.

499
00:44:46,629 --> 00:44:48,126
What is wrong with your back?

500
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:49,886
Why are there a lot of bruises?

501
00:44:52,206 --> 00:44:53,446
That's not your business.

502
00:44:59,606 --> 00:45:04,486
Those people like to watch Young Master near Bo Phloi.

503
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:07,046
You should take a look around there.

504
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:10,046
Young Master always keeps weapons on standby.

505
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:13,926
I'm getting goosebumps.

506
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,686
Is this true?

507
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,846
Hey, have you seen Young Master?

508
00:45:51,406 --> 00:45:52,886
What do you want with him?

509
00:45:53,214 --> 00:45:54,366
We're here to visit him.

510
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:59,366
You're beautiful. Did you just start here? Can I get your LINE account?

511
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:02,286
Young Master isn't here. You should come back later.

512
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:05,406
Wait, where are you going?

513
00:46:06,293 --> 00:46:09,166
We're here to see Young Master. Don't be that angry.

514
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,046
I'm not angry. I just told you he wasn't here.

515
00:46:13,206 --> 00:46:17,406
I don't think we'll get anything from her. We should find him ourselves.

516
00:46:18,435 --> 00:46:20,166
Wait a second.

517
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:22,606
Stop! Stop right there!

518
00:46:23,606 --> 00:46:24,926
He isn't here.

519
00:46:32,798 --> 00:46:33,885
What are you doing?

520
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:36,262
We're here to ask for trouble, Young Master.

521
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:43,286
You'll get what you wish for.

522
00:47:12,782 --> 00:47:15,846
I know that Young Master might not have a good personality.

523
00:47:16,037 --> 00:47:17,686
I know that he can be annoying,

524
00:47:18,278 --> 00:47:21,246
but you don't have to use violence. You guys can talk.

525
00:47:25,446 --> 00:47:27,046
If you want to do something to him,

526
00:47:27,894 --> 00:47:29,486
you have to get through me first.

527
00:47:46,726 --> 00:47:49,526
Young Master, what's wrong with her?

528
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:53,126
Are you misunderstanding something here?

529
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:57,286
Do you think we're here to fight him because we look scary?

530
00:47:57,446 --> 00:47:58,926
That's a stereotype.

531
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:01,446
Hold on. I'm sorry.

532
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:04,406
You probably listened to too much gossip about me.

533
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:07,006
I'm embarrassed for you.

534
00:48:07,825 --> 00:48:11,526
I don't have any problem with them at all.

535
00:48:13,206 --> 00:48:15,166
What about the bloodstained ax?

536
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:17,326
That's rust.

537
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,326
- What about the bruises on your back?   - That's from cupping therapy.

538
00:48:23,228 --> 00:48:25,006
We're here today

539
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,326
because we miss you, Young Master.

540
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:31,446
We don't have any problem with him.

541
00:48:31,877 --> 00:48:33,726
We might have one right now.

542
00:48:34,918 --> 00:48:38,126
If you skipped school to come here, you'll get to learn your lesson.

543
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:41,726
- Hello, Daddy.   - Hello, Daddy.

544
00:48:43,726 --> 00:48:45,126
Everyone.

545
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:46,926
I miss you so much.

546
00:48:56,398 --> 00:48:58,398
You look smart, Ms. Stepmother.

547
00:48:58,494 --> 00:49:00,062
You shouldn't have believed Boem.

548
00:49:01,246 --> 00:49:04,606
If you want to say that much, just stab me with a knife instead.

549
00:49:04,749 --> 00:49:06,366
Please don't believe Boem.

550
00:49:06,517 --> 00:49:09,086
You have to think about what Boem said at least ten times.

551
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:10,766
Who would know that?

552
00:49:10,902 --> 00:49:12,486
I thought he really knew.

553
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:15,246
- I'm leaving.   - Just a moment.

554
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:18,126
So, what's the true story?

555
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:21,046
Please let it continue to be a mystery.

556
00:49:21,718 --> 00:49:24,726
Don't you want to help clear Young Master's name?

557
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:28,686
I don't have to do that. He doesn't care.

558
00:49:29,293 --> 00:49:30,686
He doesn't care what people think.

559
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:33,806
He only cares if people who love him understand him.

560
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:35,406
Wait.

561
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:39,526
Aum, if you know something nice about Young Master,

562
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:40,766
you should tell me.

563
00:49:40,886 --> 00:49:42,805
I can use it to negotiate with Mr. Phudin

564
00:49:42,901 --> 00:49:45,021
and help him protect Bo Phloi.

565
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,813
- I miss you.   - I miss you.

566
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:55,326
Hey, stop hugging me.

567
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:57,726
I'm getting goosebumps from seeing your faces.

568
00:49:57,933 --> 00:50:00,406
We just really miss you, Daddy Mueang.

569
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:03,566
That's enough. I'm just your senior, not your dad.

570
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:06,966
You've been taking care of us.

571
00:50:07,461 --> 00:50:11,406
That's right. If you want anything, you can tell us.

572
00:50:13,646 --> 00:50:15,446
When I'm bedridden in the future,

573
00:50:15,566 --> 00:50:17,166
you'll come get me out of bed.

574
00:50:17,286 --> 00:50:19,006
Please don't die, Young Master.

575
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,106
I'm kidding. Do you have to always play along with me?

576
00:50:24,182 --> 00:50:26,806
Listen, you don't have to do anything for me.

577
00:50:27,021 --> 00:50:28,366
You should study hard.

578
00:50:28,456 --> 00:50:31,566
When you graduate, you can come back to help develop this country.

579
00:50:31,668 --> 00:50:33,086
Okay? Understand?

580
00:50:33,206 --> 00:50:34,403
- Understood.   - Understood.

581
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,846
You can go to someone else now.

582
00:50:39,749 --> 00:50:43,926
Right, before you go back, come see me. I'll treat you to some snacks.

583
00:50:44,046 --> 00:50:45,446
- Of course.   - Of course.

584
00:51:01,294 --> 00:51:02,454
Stop.

585
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:13,006
If you want to do something to him,

586
00:51:13,669 --> 00:51:15,206
you have to get through me first.

587
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:24,926
Why were you acting tough when you're small?

588
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:27,046
You'd be blown away.

589
00:51:43,846 --> 00:51:45,246
Kuk.

590
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:46,926
How is it? How many buckets did you get?

591
00:51:47,077 --> 00:51:48,258
That's not much, is it?

592
00:51:48,413 --> 00:51:50,268
You should get 20 today. Do you think you're up for it?

593
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:52,421
- If you can do that, I will reward you.   - Yes.

594
00:52:05,765 --> 00:52:07,286
How many buckets did you get?

595
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:08,606
I have 25.

596
00:52:08,687 --> 00:52:09,975
- You have 25?   - Yes.

597
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:12,566
He'll get another 20 for you, alright?

598
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:15,686
- Of course.   - We'll get almost 50 today.

599
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:18,040
- We'll get 50?   - You have to treat us to beer today.

600
00:52:18,144 --> 00:52:19,926
- Of course.   - Yes.

601
00:52:20,029 --> 00:52:21,366
Where do you usually buy one?

602
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:25,446
The true story is they actually fought,

603
00:52:25,629 --> 00:52:27,166
but there wasn't any violence.

604
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:29,086
Those three didn't want to study further.

605
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:32,766
Young Master convinced them and sent them off to study in Bangkok.

606
00:52:33,437 --> 00:52:35,886
Is Young Master paying for those three's education?

607
00:52:36,006 --> 00:52:37,326
Yes.

608
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:42,398
Ms. Stepmother, if you actually know him,

609
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,926
you'll realize there's nothing wrong with him at all.

610
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,030
He's just not good at communicating.

611
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:50,406
He only has goodwill. He never has ill will for anyone.

612
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,046
That's full now.

613
00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:42,606
It's so heavy.

614
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:20,726
Let them go.

615
00:55:02,486 --> 00:55:04,126
(He doesn't want Bo Phloi to be closed down)

616
00:55:04,285 --> 00:55:06,926
(because he's worried about the workers and the ecology of the area.)

617
00:55:42,326 --> 00:55:43,766
Where did you bring me?

618
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:45,646
Why does it look so scary?

619
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:49,686
Did you bring me here to prove ghosts exist?

620
00:55:50,269 --> 00:55:51,526
Are you a shaman?

621
00:55:51,638 --> 00:55:53,486
No way. I'm scared of ghosts.

622
00:55:53,614 --> 00:55:55,006
I won't get out.

623
00:55:55,277 --> 00:55:56,427
Just follow me.

624
00:55:56,574 --> 00:55:59,006
Stop. Wait for me.

625
00:56:01,966 --> 00:56:03,286
Hey.

626
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,326
Hey.

627
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:08,246
Hey.

628
00:56:08,382 --> 00:56:09,726
Hey.

629
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,406
You didn't bring me here to sell my kidney or to join a cult, did you?

630
00:56:17,238 --> 00:56:18,486
We're here.

631
00:56:20,846 --> 00:56:22,206
Please come in.

632
00:56:23,686 --> 00:56:25,286
Tin, come here quickly.

633
00:56:25,391 --> 00:56:27,806
- Come here.   - I've already had my food. It's fine.

634
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:32,446
Who is she?

635
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:34,966
I brought my friend here. She's Ing.

636
00:56:35,654 --> 00:56:38,966
- Hello.   - Hello.

637
00:56:40,206 --> 00:56:44,286
Why did you bring me to the party? Didn't you say you want my help?

638
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:45,606
I do need your help.

639
00:56:46,574 --> 00:56:47,806
I want you to help me

640
00:56:47,941 --> 00:56:50,006
with protesting for what's right.

641
00:56:53,646 --> 00:56:54,926
We have a Facebook page called

642
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,806
- "I Can't Die Yet."   - "I Can't Die Yet."

643
00:56:57,366 --> 00:57:01,006
We can't die until we see any change.

644
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:04,566
We're trying to push for changes in society.

645
00:57:05,373 --> 00:57:06,726
The roughness of roads.

646
00:57:06,886 --> 00:57:08,446
The state of footpaths.

647
00:57:08,606 --> 00:57:10,366
There's PM 2.5 dust.

648
00:57:11,086 --> 00:57:13,926
Trees are being cut down. Invasion of the forest.

649
00:57:16,926 --> 00:57:19,006
Supporting gender diversity.

650
00:57:20,629 --> 00:57:23,366
You can be another voice calling for change.

651
00:57:23,509 --> 00:57:24,646
- That's right.   - That's right.

652
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,238
I think I should go.

653
00:57:29,486 --> 00:57:32,526
- Hey. Just a moment.   - What is going on, Tin?

654
00:57:32,846 --> 00:57:34,086
Where is she going?

655
00:57:34,237 --> 00:57:37,086
Hey, you. Come here.

656
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:40,286
Come here. Didn't you say you like to help others?

657
00:57:41,328 --> 00:57:43,806
Let me go. Yes, I like to help others,

658
00:57:43,983 --> 00:57:45,406
but not like this.

659
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:46,846
Like what, then?

660
00:57:48,246 --> 00:57:52,046
I don't know why you would waste your time. You can't change anything.

661
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,286
It's because of people like you that we're still stuck here.

662
00:57:55,429 --> 00:58:00,926
I'm living in real life, not living in ideology like you.

663
00:58:02,806 --> 00:58:05,566
Since you're here, what's wrong with listening to it for a bit?

664
00:58:05,766 --> 00:58:08,326
No, I won't. I'm going home.

665
00:58:09,435 --> 00:58:11,006
You have to listen. Come here.

666
00:58:11,526 --> 00:58:13,686
- I told you I wouldn't.   - Stop.

667
00:58:13,806 --> 00:58:15,044
You should listen to others.

668
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,926
I just said I didn't care.

669
00:58:17,046 --> 00:58:19,046
- I told you I didn't care.   - Just come in.

670
00:58:19,886 --> 00:58:23,766
They're vile. How could they do that to other humans like this?

671
00:58:24,738 --> 00:58:27,572
Why haven't I learned about this news before?

672
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:29,126
Because it's not on TV.

673
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:30,806
That's why it's not known.

674
00:58:31,824 --> 00:58:34,686
No way. We can't let it quieten like this.

675
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:37,886
We have to expose the human trafficking ring.

676
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,206
Ing, we have to share this news.

677
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:45,086
We have to talk about this on X to make it trending.

678
00:58:45,942 --> 00:58:49,166
Of course. You can tell me if there's anything you need my help with.

679
00:58:49,669 --> 00:58:52,806
I'll post it on my Instagram, Facebook, and my secret accounts number one,

680
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:54,326
two, and three.

681
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,796
Everyone must learn about

682
00:58:56,877 --> 00:58:59,166
these cruel stories.

683
00:59:00,646 --> 00:59:02,286
Ing, I'd like your LINE account.

684
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,526
I'll give you the link right now.

685
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:06,646
You can scan my QR code.

686
00:59:06,885 --> 00:59:08,766
Here you are. Scan it.

687
00:59:09,165 --> 00:59:10,846
- It's done.   - Me too, Ing.

688
00:59:11,038 --> 00:59:13,246
- Don't forget to send stickers to me.   - Thank you.

689
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:16,006
Me too.

690
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:20,926
If you're free, you should come to see us on Friday evening.

691
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:24,246
We'll help farmers who are in debt next week.

692
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,966
It'll be a chance for us to spread the news.

693
00:59:26,446 --> 00:59:28,926
Of course. We'll do it.

694
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,286
Young people like us should be the force to change society.

695
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:37,846
Please give a round of applause to everyone here.

696
00:59:37,989 --> 00:59:40,366
Give applause to you and your determination.

697
00:59:40,478 --> 00:59:43,086
Thank you for contributing this much to society.

698
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:46,286
You're the best.

699
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:59,286
Didn't you say you didn't care?

700
01:00:02,126 --> 01:00:04,766
If I didn't care, I wouldn't be human anymore.

701
01:00:06,046 --> 01:00:08,246
I told you to just listen to us for a bit.

702
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:11,526
We can easily put ourselves in their shoes.

703
01:00:11,686 --> 01:00:13,566
Although your life isn't that difficult,

704
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:16,326
you still can fight for those who are in a difficult spot.

705
01:00:17,846 --> 01:00:20,526
Your ideology is really grand.

706
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,086
It's normal.

707
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:24,326
I have a dream

708
01:00:24,526 --> 01:00:26,126
of seeing this world equal.

709
01:00:26,325 --> 01:00:27,806
If I have a child,

710
01:00:27,966 --> 01:00:30,926
I want my child to grow up in a good environment

711
01:00:31,102 --> 01:00:32,846
so that no one can take advantage of my child.

712
01:00:33,605 --> 01:00:36,126
Sure, Mr. Soon-to-be Great Father.

713
01:01:03,361 --> 01:01:04,766
Your hand won't be dirty.

714
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:26,206
Right, what about the necklace? Are you helping me or what?

715
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:30,326
Why would you want that necklace so much?

716
01:01:30,637 --> 01:01:32,366
Can't you design a new one?

717
01:01:32,854 --> 01:01:34,246
It's not the same.

718
01:01:34,406 --> 01:01:37,046
It's also my dream right now.

719
01:01:38,741 --> 01:01:42,446
I want it to be in my collection.

720
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:46,046
So, are you helping me or not?

721
01:01:49,086 --> 01:01:51,646
Well, I want to help you,

722
01:01:52,516 --> 01:01:54,686
but Mueang is really possessive of that necklace.

723
01:01:55,446 --> 01:01:57,766
The only way you can get that necklace

724
01:01:58,086 --> 01:02:00,446
is to make Mueang sell it to you.

725
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:06,766
I won't sell it.

726
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:08,326
Young Master.

727
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:10,806
For these plants,

728
01:02:10,926 --> 01:02:12,526
when influencers take a photo of them,

729
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,326
the price will increase a ton. You know, like Yaya.

730
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,446
I'll give you tons of kicks.

731
01:02:18,246 --> 01:02:19,926
Do you want me to sell my children?

732
01:02:20,094 --> 01:02:21,406
I can't do that.

733
01:02:21,773 --> 01:02:23,886
How could I look at my other children then?

734
01:02:25,262 --> 01:02:27,286
Isn't that right, Thubthim?

735
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,046
Young Master.

736
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:34,446
I was trying to help you make money.

737
01:02:35,021 --> 01:02:38,406
Listen, don't try to steal them to sell them.

738
01:02:38,726 --> 01:02:40,006
These are mine.

739
01:02:41,646 --> 01:02:43,006
Go to bed.

740
01:02:43,286 --> 01:02:46,246
Fine. I'll go to bed. You should sleep a lot as well, Young Master,

741
01:02:46,406 --> 01:02:48,046
since you can communicate with plants now.

742
01:02:51,886 --> 01:02:53,251
Who would sell their own children?

743
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:54,686
Ms. Stepmother?

744
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:03,286
Did I interrupt you?

745
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:04,966
- Not really...   - Yes.

746
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:41,126
What is wrong?

747
01:03:44,437 --> 01:03:46,326
I'd like to apologize to you

748
01:03:47,046 --> 01:03:49,406
for almost destroying your dream.

749
01:03:50,486 --> 01:03:52,126
Your dream

750
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:55,166
is to save Bo Phloi, right?

751
01:03:56,709 --> 01:03:58,006
What is this?

752
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:03,966
That's true, isn't it?

753
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:08,526
Right now,

754
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:12,046
I think I'm getting closer to you 50 centimeters more.

755
01:04:18,141 --> 01:04:21,227
For someone like you, it's not even ten centimeters.

756
01:04:21,335 --> 01:04:24,326
You only get this much closer. Right there.

757
01:04:27,742 --> 01:04:29,766
- Only this much?   - Yeah.

758
01:04:31,598 --> 01:04:32,846
That much.

759
01:04:45,766 --> 01:04:48,086
You'll never know what my dream is

760
01:04:48,846 --> 01:04:50,246
because we're not close.

761
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:57,646
Then, do you want to know what my dream is?

762
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:02,286
My dream is...

763
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:06,726
Is...

764
01:05:07,526 --> 01:05:08,806
Is...

765
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:12,966
I don't have any dreams.

766
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,806
Why would you talk about that then?

767
01:05:19,796 --> 01:05:20,966
Well...

768
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:24,686
I just want to be happy.

769
01:05:25,406 --> 01:05:26,766
And...

770
01:05:27,366 --> 01:05:28,806
I don't have to live alone.

771
01:05:29,886 --> 01:05:33,046
Can that be called a dream?

772
01:05:35,437 --> 01:05:36,846
A dream

773
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,086
can be anything.

774
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:50,326
That's my dream then.

775
01:05:53,926 --> 01:05:56,286
Well, you've already achieved your dream.

776
01:05:57,149 --> 01:05:58,566
You're happy.

777
01:05:59,366 --> 01:06:00,806
You don't have to live alone.

778
01:06:04,774 --> 01:06:06,086
I'm jealous.

779
01:06:06,382 --> 01:06:07,846
There's a person in love here.

780
01:06:08,486 --> 01:06:11,246
Back off from me five centimeters more.

781
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:27,166
Mueang.

782
01:06:27,774 --> 01:06:29,286
From now on,

783
01:06:29,806 --> 01:06:32,486
I'll be the one to protect your dreams.

784
01:07:01,806 --> 01:07:03,046
Tomorrow morning,

785
01:07:03,926 --> 01:07:05,686
please come to the house.

786
01:07:06,566 --> 01:07:08,646
I promise I won't waste your time.

787
01:07:36,246 --> 01:07:37,606
See you next morning.

788
01:08:22,406 --> 01:08:26,526
I'd like to challenge you two to swap your life with another for a month.

789
01:08:26,678 --> 01:08:29,326
Living as Mueang? That's a piece of cake.

790
01:08:29,486 --> 01:08:30,766
Please talk with the plants, Boss.

791
01:08:30,886 --> 01:08:34,084
I haven't talked to Mueang so much that he has to talk to plants?

792
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:36,606
Living as the old man? How would that be difficult?

793
01:08:36,725 --> 01:08:39,806
These are all the documents that Mr. Phudin has to sign.

794
01:08:39,926 --> 01:08:42,566
(He has to sign documents all day long. Doesn't he do anything else?)

795
01:08:42,766 --> 01:08:44,566
I can't fail. I can't lose!

796
01:08:44,743 --> 01:08:46,286
I won't lose my face.

797
01:08:48,205 --> 01:08:49,566
(Before your mom passed away,)

798
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:52,566
(we've already cleared everything up.)

799
01:08:52,686 --> 01:08:54,326
(We agreed to divorce.)

800
01:08:54,438 --> 01:08:56,286
(I've never blamed you for Mom's death.)

801
01:08:56,486 --> 01:08:57,886
(However, after she passed away,)

802
01:08:58,046 --> 01:08:59,846
(have you ever been a good father to me?)

803
01:09:00,077 --> 01:09:02,606
(Where were you when I needed you?)
