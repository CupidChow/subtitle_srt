1
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:01,526
Cancel this project.

2
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,766
I don't think I can do as you wish.

3
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:06,006
Mueang extremely hates me.

4
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:09,180
Mueang hates my guts. He blamed me for his mom being gone.

5
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:11,406
(It must have been really uncomfortable for Mueang.)

6
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,446
I don't want you to misunderstand

7
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,366
that I intend to come here to hurt you.

8
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,126
Even if it's unintentional,

9
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,606
I'm already hurt.

10
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:22,886
How did you grow up? Have you always been like this?

11
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:24,646
How have you survived?

12
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,806
- Where are we going, ma'am? - Phudin Park.

13
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,326
Why am I getting goosebumps?

14
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,149
I need to change my plan.

15
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:32,326
I will drive her out of here.

16
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,006
Everyone, listen carefully.

17
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:35,526
I'll be working here

18
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:37,286
starting from today.

19
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:40,050
You're presenting today. Good luck.

20
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,406
Since it's wrong, should we continue the presentation?

21
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:46,846
Should we cancel the meeting?

22
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,286
Since you decided to work there, you must have a plan, right?

23
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:55,046
Of course.

24
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,549
I'll make Po unable to live here.

25
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,126
How will you drive her out of here?

26
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,286
I can't drive her out.

27
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:06,166
The only ones who can drive Apo out of here

28
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:07,566
are herself

29
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,126
and the old man.

30
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:11,726
What if Ms. Apo doesn't want to leave?

31
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,086
The old man has to drive her out then.

32
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,086
How could that be possible?

33
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:18,486
It's possible.

34
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:19,726
You should know

35
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:21,846
how much of a perfectionist the old man is.

36
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:26,126
"It is easier to do a job right

37
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:28,926
than to explain why you didn't."

38
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:33,246
Martin Van Buren, the eighth US president.

39
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,933
"Don't work for recognition

40
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:40,086
but do work worthy of recognition."

41
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,326
H. Jackson Brown Jr.

42
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,046
"You can't escape the responsibility of tomorrow

43
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,206
by evading it today."

44
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,686
Abraham Lincoln.

45
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:53,766
That's not good enough.

46
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:55,526
Have you used your brain yet?

47
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,526
You need to learn to use your brain. You need to think.

48
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:00,886
I told you to recheck it again.

49
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:03,406
Recheck.

50
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:07,006
There's a lot of typos here. Have you really learned how to write in Thai?

51
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,766
Go back and learn it again.

52
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:12,166
(I have to slowly show my old man that Apo)

53
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:14,166
(can't work efficiently.)

54
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:16,006
(So that he'll fire her.)

55
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:20,406
(Notification of Change in the Plan)

56
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,206
We don't have to cancel the meeting.

57
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:05,806
You can continue your presentation on the concept and case study.

58
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:07,286
Yes.

59
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,006
But for next time,

60
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,686
please read the email carefully. Don't miss it again.

61
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,006
Yes.

62
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:17,166
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:20,006
You're really careless.

64
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:22,726
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:24,246
Let's continue with our meeting.

66
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,806
Mr. Phudin has an appointment with SAO at noon. He might be late.

67
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:29,046
Yes.

68
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:34,566
Next, I'd like to move on to the size analysis.

69
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:37,606
It's about the direction of wind and sunlight.

70
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:39,806
As you can see from the photos,

71
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:44,366
the initial analysis, and the case studies that I've already shown you,

72
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:47,766
if you choose to do a cafe and hedge maze

73
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,406
by using the unique characteristics of the old gem mine,

74
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,166
it should attract more tourists

75
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:55,126
and become a new tourist spot for the town.

76
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:57,686
That's the end of my presentation. Thank you.

77
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,966
Okay. Now,

78
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:03,585
don't forget to change the entrance to the site like I said earlier.

79
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,086
We'll hold another meeting in two weeks.

80
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,655
As for anything else, it's fine.

81
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,726
- Yes. - But I have to leave right now.

82
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:13,086
Thank you, everyone. The meeting is over.

83
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,006
Don't make a mistake like this next time.

84
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:20,606
Din won't be as generous as this time again.

85
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,126
Heh.

86
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:29,127
You can't blame me for this.

87
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:30,726
You didn't check it thoroughly.

88
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:36,086
Please work harder to justify the salary you're receiving.

89
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,366
Din.

90
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,046
You're too generous.

91
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,886
Usually, you'd scold everyone who makes a mistake really harshly.

92
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:04,726
Apo just started working here.

93
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:06,646
I don't want her to be discouraged.

94
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:09,006
You're so unfair.

95
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:14,286
If she can make a mistake with this, what about the more important work?

96
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:18,006
I agree with Mueang and Wi in this case.

97
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:21,286
Mr. Phudin, please think about Ms. Apo's matter again.

98
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,846
It'll affect our work in the long run.

99
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:26,086
Just find someone else to do it.

100
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:27,486
I can recommend someone for you.

101
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:29,366
I'll give her another chance.

102
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:33,606
I feel like there's something suspicious about this.

103
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:37,686
If you can't work together nicely, then you don't have to work.

104
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:41,286
Sita, you stay here. I'll go to my appointment myself.

105
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:47,005
Sita, did you see that?

106
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,646
Din is really unfair.

107
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:00,566
Sita.

108
00:08:00,758 --> 00:08:02,446
Since Apo came here,

109
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:06,046
I've never been calm again.

110
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,046
You should post about Dharma on Facebook to calm yourself then.

111
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:13,566
Dharma...

112
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,326
(Today is a Buddhist holy day.)

113
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:21,926
(Karma is real. I don't have to use my mouth to curse anyone.)

114
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,446
One day, her karma will definitely catch up to her.

115
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:30,206
Please don't curse anyone after you post about Dharma.

116
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:32,086
You won't feel any better.

117
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:38,846
There's no way I'll feel better. I won't be calm anyway.

118
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:43,926
You can make a donation or release some fish online then.

119
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,126
Releasing fish might be nice.

120
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:54,838
Excuse me.

121
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,766
Ms. Apo.

122
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,486
Since when were you here?

123
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:01,046
I just came here.

124
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,646
I want to ask for your help.

125
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:14,846
(This is Mueang's LINE account.)

126
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:17,286
(Don't tell him that you get it from me.)

127
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:25,286
(Mueang. Add Friend.)

128
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,806
(Come meet me.)

129
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,806
(I need to talk to you.)

130
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,206
How did you get my account?

131
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:47,526
You don't like it?

132
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,686
I only use it to talk with my close friends.

133
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:51,926
If you want to get me fired,

134
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:53,886
why don't you tell Mr. Phudin about us?

135
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,126
I don't like to talk about that.

136
00:09:57,686 --> 00:09:58,846
Really?

137
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:01,326
I thought you already told Tin.

138
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,726
Tin only knew that I met you at the sea.

139
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,926
Only two of us knew about that night.

140
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:12,966
You can be pretty manly.

141
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:17,501
Why did you call me here?

142
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:20,046
If you want to be manly,

143
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:22,126
please be manly all the time.

144
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:24,606
Did you call me here for that?

145
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:26,406
No.

146
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:30,366
I understand your loss.

147
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,646
Like I told you,

148
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:34,566
I also didn't have parents.

149
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:37,006
I grew up as a troubled child.

150
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:38,366
But

151
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:40,726
I've never been rude to anyone else.

152
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:44,566
Wow. Thank you for trying to teach me.

153
00:10:44,997 --> 00:10:48,526
Yeah. I know that I was too careless for today's matter.

154
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,766
If I had checked it, I wouldn't have missed it.

155
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,966
Oh, you're aware of that.

156
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,006
If you want to annoy me,

157
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,286
please don't use a child's trick like this.

158
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:04,806
We should compete using our talents.

159
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:09,166
Are you challenging me?

160
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:10,846
That depends on you.

161
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:13,486
If you think you're better than me,

162
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,126
show it then.

163
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:18,646
Show it to me. Show it to your dad. Show it to everyone.

164
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:22,806
Since you took the time to say this, you probably want something for me.

165
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:25,686
You're pretty smart.

166
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,206
Since you're working here now,

167
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:30,846
let's have a competition.

168
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:33,397
If I win your approval,

169
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:36,246
you and I will leave each other alone.

170
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,846
What if you can't do it?

171
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:42,006
I'll find another way to pay off my debt.

172
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:46,966
Are you interested?

173
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:56,646
You can think about it for now.

174
00:11:56,774 --> 00:11:58,326
You can give me an answer tomorrow.

175
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:01,606
I'm not in a hurry.

176
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:15,046
Hey, have you found any evidence for Young Master?

177
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,486
No.

178
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:20,646
But I don't see that Ms. Stepmother is doing anything wrong.

179
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:24,486
- Yeah. - Ging, I told you to stop.

180
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:27,329
- I want the reward. - You have to stop doing this.

181
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,046
- Calm down. - Right.

182
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:34,246
Everyone,

183
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,206
Ms. Stepmother is here.

184
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:43,526
Ms. Stepmother.

185
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:45,086
Ms. Stepmother.

186
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:48,446
When I took you to meet Young Master at Bo Phloi the other day,

187
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:50,246
I'm sorry about that.

188
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:53,006
You don't have to apologize.

189
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,726
It's not your fault, Son.

190
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:57,326
Thank you, Ms. Stepmother.

191
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,926
- Put down your hands. - You're too kind.

192
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,342
Is she going to dance with us?

193
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,366
Probably.

194
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,046
- Did Boss order it? - Yeah.

195
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,806
This is bad.

196
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:14,766
- What? - Look over there.

197
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,806
Everyone, I'll dance with you.

198
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,166
- Oh, no. - What?

199
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:42,446
Young Master is going to dance with us. I think it's the end of the world.

200
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:45,766
What's going on today?

201
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:48,286
Why did everyone decide to come here?

202
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:49,886
I'm so confused.

203
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:51,846
What are you doing here?

204
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:54,686
Form a line, everyone.

205
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:57,486
- Quickly. - Form a line.

206
00:13:57,614 --> 00:13:58,774
Quick.

207
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,326
Come here.

208
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:06,126
- Oh... - What?

209
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,126
- Are you ready? - Yes.

210
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:15,766
- You can start. - You can start.

211
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,486
Let's go.

212
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,526
Ms. Stepmother, you're so cool.

213
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,709
Ms. Stepmother, good job.

214
00:16:04,478 --> 00:16:06,486
Everyone, show them.

215
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,499
They're going to bite each other.

216
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:55,190
Why are we still here, then?

217
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,806
- Let's run away. - Let's go.

218
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:11,455
So, have you thought about it?

219
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:12,726
Yes.

220
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:16,286
Are you going to accept my offer?

221
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,206
Bring it on.

222
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:20,086
Challenge accepted.

223
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,406
Fine.

224
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:15,766
Sita told me that you'll take me to take more photos.

225
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:17,846
Yes.

226
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:19,846
Follow me.

227
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:35,166
Why did you take me here? It's not in the plan.

228
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:38,366
I told the old man that this area could be developed.

229
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:41,086
He asked me to show it to you as you might have some ideas about it.

230
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:48,886
It'll be a little tiring for you. This place is big.

231
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:50,646
Can you walk through it?

232
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:02,566
Sorry. I have an assistant.

233
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:05,206
You can't trick me this time.

234
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,125
Oh, my.

235
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:15,926
Feel free to take a look around yourself.

236
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,806
Do you have that with you all the time?

237
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:23,766
I'm a professional.

238
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,126
Are you surprised?

239
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:18,286
I'm going first.

240
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:19,886
Where did you get that from?

241
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:21,566
Do you think you're the only one who has it?

242
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,086
Hello, Ms. Apo.

243
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:27,686
Did you just warp here?

244
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:30,486
Where do you want to take the photos?

245
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,975
If you want to help me, you can just take photos of this area.

246
00:20:58,068 --> 00:20:59,726
You don't have to follow me.

247
00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:01,069
Where are you going?

248
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,846
To that rain tree.

249
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:21,886
Why are you following me?

250
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,126
The one who reaches there first is the winner.

251
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:28,693
- Do your best, Young Master. - Sure.

252
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,806
- I know that. - Young Master.

253
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:32,957
- Young Master. - The wind is strong today.

254
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:36,112
- Don't jam it into me. - Ms. Apo, come on.

255
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:40,086
- Ms. Apo, show him. - Young Master, hang in there.

256
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:45,166
- Young Master. - Ms. Apo, do your best.

257
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:47,806
- Young Master. - Why... No.

258
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,925
- Young Master. - Ms. Apo.

259
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:54,826
- Young Master, keep fighting. - Ms. Apo.

260
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:56,486
Young Master, show her.

261
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:02,566
Do you want to fight?

262
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:04,589
I'm ready to fight.

263
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,862
Aum, they'll crash into each other.

264
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:58,606
No...

265
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,526
Aum, what happened next?

266
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:02,806
Did they crash and fall down?

267
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,286
What do you think?

268
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,286
Since it's come this far, how could they not fall down?

269
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,045
How could they fall down?

270
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,726
Aum, from what I heard from you,

271
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:14,326
it's like they aren't Young Master and Ms. Stepmother.

272
00:23:14,446 --> 00:23:17,526
It's like they're drone racers or something.

273
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:21,886
Yes, our young master is the best. He's not clumsy like you.

274
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,326
What's with you?

275
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:24,966
I didn't talk about you.

276
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:28,166
- Why did you say that then? - Don't flatter yourself.

277
00:23:28,277 --> 00:23:32,090
- Can you two stop arguing for once? - You're always flattering yourself.

278
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:34,486
Aum, so did they fall down or not?

279
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,086
Let me continue.

280
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:42,506
- This is the climax of the story. - Wow.

281
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:47,966
(When the drones are flying toward each other...)

282
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:53,046
- You won't dodge? - (Ms. Stepmother's drone)

283
00:23:53,396 --> 00:23:55,093
(and Young Master's drone...)

284
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,938
(They dodged just right in time.)

285
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:00,686
- What a close call. - Who's the winner?

286
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:16,606
- No one. - What?

287
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:20,566
- What's with you? - They crossed the line at the same time. It's a draw.

288
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:23,086
- Darn it. - Useless.

289
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,167
What's this? That's not fun.

290
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:26,900
If you want something fun, go watch a drama.

291
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:29,726
- Stop giving me a punchline. - Or do you want me to punch you?

292
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:32,806
Aum, I understand

293
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:36,606
that Young Master and Ms. Stepmother are competing for their jobs.

294
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,446
But from what I've seen,

295
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:40,006
it's more than that.

296
00:24:40,102 --> 00:24:43,446
Wow. What did you see, Boem?

297
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,166
Aum, when did your story happen?

298
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,486
- Hurry up. - Yes, Young Master.

299
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:53,220
Here you are, Young Master.

300
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:54,581
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

301
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:59,526
Around 9 or 10 am.

302
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:03,126
Good. I'll continue the story for you.

303
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:08,046
What I saw happened around 11 am.

304
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:11,606
(I was on my way to the toilet.)

305
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:14,566
(While my stomach was acting up, )

306
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:18,046
(I saw something. What I saw was...)

307
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:20,206
Ms. Stepmother.

308
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:22,766
Ms. Stepmother.

309
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:26,566
Oh, Young Master?

310
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:30,566
What are they doing here?

311
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:34,606
My stomach, please calm down.

312
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:37,126
What are they doing?

313
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:41,246
They bumped into each other.

314
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:46,246
- Are they racing? - No!

315
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:51,206
Do I have to call the police?

316
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,846
- Come here. - He's pulling her hair.

317
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:58,726
Officer, please help me. I don't know what they're doing.

318
00:26:03,336 --> 00:26:04,686
- I'm here first. - I'm here first.

319
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:15,126
Hey, stop. Hold on.

320
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:16,966
Why are they fighting?

321
00:26:20,022 --> 00:26:22,166
I'm so confused that my poop is gone.

322
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:24,366
Since I'm here,

323
00:26:24,526 --> 00:26:26,326
let's fart a little bit.

324
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:29,166
Let me fart once to relieve my stomach.

325
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:31,766
They can compete however they want,

326
00:26:31,854 --> 00:26:34,246
but they shouldn't race like that.

327
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:38,602
Boem, don't you get it?

328
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:41,206
Two tigers can't share one mountain.

329
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:43,886
Look over there.

330
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:45,366
They're competing again.

331
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:50,646
Speak of the devils. Seriously.

332
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:55,966
But it looks peaceful. They're not pulling each other's hair like you said.

333
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:59,006
Let them rest for once.

334
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:00,966
I'd like two eggs for my khai phalo.

335
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:03,406
I'd like three.

336
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:07,406
I'd like four eggs instead.

337
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,766
I'd like five.

338
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:10,846
Six for me.

339
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:14,446
Give me seven.

340
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:16,566
Give me eight.

341
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:18,846
Give me nine.

342
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:20,006
Give me ten.

343
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:26,006
Give me 11, 12, 13, 14, or even 15 eggs.

344
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:28,446
Please.

345
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:31,646
Make it 20 for me, please.

346
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:49,406
They really won't rest?

347
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:51,086
I don't think so.

348
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,566
Do you think they can eat them all?

349
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:59,006
I'm not sure. But please don't challenge me to that, Ging.

350
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,686
Do they really have to do this much?

351
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:07,446
That's because he's my young master.

352
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:11,286
- Two minutes. - What do you mean?

353
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:14,046
That's my record for finishing ten eggs.

354
00:28:15,637 --> 00:28:17,086
Ten eggs?

355
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:20,926
I can eat 15 eggs in two minutes.

356
00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:29,766
Looks like a champ is going down today.

357
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,526
You talk big. Win first, talk later.

358
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:38,446
I'm not joking. Do you want to try me?

359
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:42,006
- Aum. - Yes, Young Master.

360
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:43,926
- Prepare a timer. - Yes.

361
00:28:50,446 --> 00:28:52,166
- Are you ready? - Yes.

362
00:28:53,637 --> 00:28:54,766
Begin.

363
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:01,646
- Young Master, come on. - Oh.

364
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,086
Young Master, do your best.

365
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,360
Young Master, swallow it.

366
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:08,166
- Chew it. That's right. - Oh, my.

367
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:12,046
- Young Master, don't give up. - Wow.

368
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,765
They can compete however they want...

369
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:17,586
But they can't compete in eating eggs like this.

370
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,566
Will my young master die?

371
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,606
Cholesterol...

372
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,533
- Young Master, don't give up. - No...

373
00:29:24,614 --> 00:29:27,846
- Young Master, hang in there. Wow. - Get it in.

374
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,286
Young Master, come on. Hang in there.

375
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:36,246
Don't eat it too quickly, please.

376
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:39,766
- Ms. Stepmother. - Young Master, swallow it.

377
00:29:42,437 --> 00:29:44,005
- Very good. - Young Master.

378
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:48,884
- Hang in there, Young Master. - Ms. Stepmother.

379
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:53,467
- It's almost gone. - It's almost gone. Just a little bit more.

380
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:57,165
- Young Master, don't give up. - It's almost gone.

381
00:29:57,246 --> 00:30:00,446
- Young Master, show her. - Young Master.

382
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:13,606
What's this again?

383
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:21,766
What's wrong with you? Why did you have an eating competition with him?

384
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:26,166
It's because of me.

385
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:28,686
- I was the one who challenged him first. - Huh?

386
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:30,606
What does that mean?

387
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,926
Well, I...

388
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:37,246
I challenged him to see who was better at doing their jobs,

389
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:40,926
but he decided to challenge me at every turn instead.

390
00:30:41,302 --> 00:30:43,486
Hang on. It's about work, isn't it?

391
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:45,766
Does Mueang even know how to work?

392
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,164
No.

393
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,486
If he knew, his dad wouldn't be this worried.

394
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:53,326
Why did you challenge him to that, then?

395
00:30:55,573 --> 00:30:58,126
I want to prove my talents to him

396
00:30:58,246 --> 00:30:59,944
to stop him from looking down on me.

397
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:02,686
- I get it. - I get it.

398
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,206
Honestly,

399
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:10,985
I think he challenged me today just to distract me.

400
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:14,446
He's scared I'll know that he's good for nothing.

401
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,397
Num, we should go.

402
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:23,806
The smell of eggs from her is too much.

403
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:27,326
- Too stinky. - Yeah, I can't concentrate on work.

404
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:32,206
No. Just stay with this smell by yourself.

405
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:34,926
We'll be back when it's better.

406
00:31:42,086 --> 00:31:45,286
Young Master, are you alright? Do I have to call an ambulance?

407
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:48,534
Here's your water.

408
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:55,966
Young Master, are you alright?

409
00:31:57,246 --> 00:31:58,646
In Apo's stomach,

410
00:31:59,246 --> 00:32:02,206
there must be a black hole...

411
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:05,006
Young Master, calm down.

412
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:07,366
We can't underestimate a small woman.

413
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:10,086
Young Master, here's your towel.

414
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:16,526
I can't bear it anymore. I want some fresh air.

415
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:18,566
Be careful, Young Master.

416
00:32:20,452 --> 00:32:22,886
Young Master, be careful.

417
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:25,686
Are you alright, Young Master?

418
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:29,126
This is the first time

419
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:30,806
I've seen this kind of crazy person.

420
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:34,486
It should have been a competition about work. We competed in everything.

421
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,326
You're as crazy as her.

422
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:37,726
I can hear you.

423
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:43,246
At least, it's a draw today.

424
00:32:43,342 --> 00:32:45,286
No one is a winner or a loser.

425
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:47,846
I think...

426
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:50,486
She tries to compete against me in everything today

427
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:51,886
to hide her flaws.

428
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,686
She's probably scared

429
00:32:53,878 --> 00:32:56,686
that I'll know that she doesn't know how to work.

430
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,246
That's possible, Young Master.

431
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,326
Tomorrow,

432
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,046
I won't challenge her.

433
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:07,126
I'll focus on work. Work is my number one priority.

434
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,242
I don't know what you're thinking,

435
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:13,006
but I'm ready to help you with everything you want me...

436
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:17,886
I have to go now.

437
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:21,486
The number one unfortunate person is me.

438
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:31,606
Darn...

439
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,086
Please brush your teeth, Young Master.

440
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:39,324
Here you are.

441
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:50,406
This is the work of top Thai landscape architects.

442
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:53,886
Just in case.

443
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,286
Mr. Phudin.

444
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:30,206
Your personality is always the same, no matter how much time has passed.

445
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:31,806
What personality?

446
00:34:32,326 --> 00:34:35,526
You always think that you're better than me.

447
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:38,806
I've never thought I'm better than you.

448
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,166
No, you did.

449
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:42,686
You always think you know better than me.

450
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:45,046
Although you didn't say it, your eyes say it.

451
00:34:45,837 --> 00:34:50,886
I'm sorry if my goodwill annoys your ego.

452
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,086
When will you stop judging me?

453
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:57,646
Will the day that you respect my decision

454
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:59,406
and let me do whatever I want to ever come?

455
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:01,766
You've always been doing whatever you want.

456
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:04,446
Or else, Ms. Nu wouldn't...

457
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:09,606
I told you. If you hate me that much,

458
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:11,766
you can leave whenever you want.

459
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:15,086
I also told you I wouldn't go anywhere.

460
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:19,126
I'll stay here as a mirror that reflects the truth for you.

461
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:21,886
I also believe that Ms. Nu would want that.

462
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:28,006
I don't know what the real reason you decided to take Ms. Apo here is.

463
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:33,326
I want you to think about it again to see if it's truly the right decision.

464
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:04,286
What's up? What's the challenge this time?

465
00:36:05,452 --> 00:36:07,846
- Didn't you have enough yesterday? - Not really.

466
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:09,366
- Are you up for it? - Are you?

467
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:10,646
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

468
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:11,966
- Bring it on. - Bring it on.

469
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:14,806
- Bring it on. I think that's enough. - Bring it on.

470
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,526
I'm tired.

471
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:22,446
From now on, I'm serious. Please stop your nonsense.

472
00:36:23,654 --> 00:36:24,966
I'm also tired.

473
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:26,766
Although I won't challenge you,

474
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:28,486
it doesn't mean our war is over.

475
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,126
Of course. But there's one thing I want to tell you.

476
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:32,846
Don't use a dirty trick on me.

477
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:35,182
For someone weak like you,

478
00:36:35,398 --> 00:36:37,566
another meeting is enough.

479
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:39,486
In two weeks,

480
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:41,526
we'll see.

481
00:36:49,605 --> 00:36:50,766
Gosh.

482
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:53,766
Hang in there, lady.

483
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:07,076
Hey.

484
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,446
Why did you come in here?

485
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:12,886
Are you sure the door is at the right place?

486
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:17,766
It is if someone doesn't cheat again.

487
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:19,806
Who cheats?

488
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:22,006
Are you really saying that?

489
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:24,366
You're in my way.

490
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,806
Continue with your work. It isn't done.

491
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:43,886
Mueang.

492
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:47,126
It hurts.

493
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:15,061
Get out right now. Get up. Get up immediately.

494
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:18,486
Get out. Get out of here.

495
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:20,286
Get out.

496
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:25,796
- This is still wrong. Fix it. - Get out.

497
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,237
Darn it.

498
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,646
Hey, I saw you.

499
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:46,477
I saw you. Don't try to act like you're small. Get out.

500
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:15,966
What?

501
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,446
Did you intentionally bring my drone down?

502
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:26,246
Serves you right.

503
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:29,806
Since you want to fly as low as possible, that serves you right.

504
00:40:30,062 --> 00:40:31,326
Bye.

505
00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:49,766
Eat your food.

506
00:40:53,606 --> 00:40:55,286
I told them I didn't want bean sprouts.

507
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:04,646
Why aren't you eating it?

508
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,526
I lose my appetite when I see your face.

509
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,926
Don't you have anything else to do?

510
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:29,326
I'm praying for your downfall.

511
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:31,206
Waiting for somebody to be fired.

512
00:41:32,476 --> 00:41:35,046
Get out of here right now. Leave.

513
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:46,853
Do you want some? Are you sure? I'll give it to you.

514
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,886
He's not even brave enough.

515
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:06,846
She only has two weeks to fix her work. How could she fix it in time?

516
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,886
There's no way.

517
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,326
Do I have to call any paramedics for today's presentation?

518
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:39,846
(You're the one who needs paramedics. What can you do anyway?)

519
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,966
You're cursing me in your mind, right?

520
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:45,886
Don't worry about it. I'll go easy on you today.

521
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:48,486
Are you sure that it'll be a success?

522
00:42:48,662 --> 00:42:50,686
Yes. I'm extremely sure about it.

523
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:52,886
(You don't know me well enough.)

524
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:56,006
(Today, it's game over for you.)

525
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:58,526
Are you cursing me in your mind?

526
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,366
I hope that

527
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:18,526
there won't be any mistakes today.

528
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:22,846
(I can't make a mistake again. I can't.)

529
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:26,366
(This is Murphy's law.)

530
00:43:26,566 --> 00:43:29,526
(Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.)

531
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,406
(If something has a chance to go wrong, )

532
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:37,246
(it often goes wrong. For example, )

533
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:39,846
(you're scared that you'll make a mistake today.)

534
00:43:39,957 --> 00:43:41,606
(No matter how hard you try, )

535
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:43,526
(you'll make a mistake anyway.)

536
00:43:44,678 --> 00:43:47,606
Please begin your presentation whenever you're ready.

537
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,486
(You're worse than I thought.)

538
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:53,966
(Just get ready to pack your stuff.)

539
00:43:57,766 --> 00:43:59,046
Good morning, everyone.

540
00:43:59,254 --> 00:44:02,686
I'll provide you with an update on the project today.

541
00:44:03,126 --> 00:44:04,726
For today's presentation,

542
00:44:04,837 --> 00:44:07,006
I've made a framework with some details

543
00:44:07,126 --> 00:44:10,203
to show you the concept, the application of the land,

544
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:13,046
and the photos of the landscape.

545
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:14,726
I'll show them to you.

546
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:17,446
(Why is it like this?)

547
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:20,326
I'd like to talk about the concept.

548
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:21,966
For the hedge maze,

549
00:44:22,047 --> 00:44:24,526
I get inspiration from Siamese rubies.

550
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,366
I'll make the maze into an oval shape

551
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:32,366
- to make it the same as the ruby... - Wait.

552
00:44:33,566 --> 00:44:36,846
You call it a ruby when it's just oval-shaped?

553
00:44:37,046 --> 00:44:38,486
Isn't it too convenient?

554
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,326
People might see it as a chicken egg.

555
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:43,406
It won't be like a chicken egg.

556
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:45,686
Aside from the oval shape,

557
00:44:45,814 --> 00:44:47,966
since ruby has a convex shape,

558
00:44:48,054 --> 00:44:50,206
we can make the maze

559
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:51,646
on a slope

560
00:44:51,727 --> 00:44:53,606
to increase and decrease the elevation.

561
00:44:53,718 --> 00:44:55,126
From the side, the maze

562
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:56,727
will look like it has more depth.

563
00:44:56,846 --> 00:44:58,046
Hang on a moment.

564
00:44:58,206 --> 00:44:59,966
You're making it into a slope?

565
00:45:00,085 --> 00:45:04,366
Doesn't it use too much money? Do you know how much it cost?

566
00:45:05,181 --> 00:45:08,095
Mr. Phudin already told me

567
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,205
that there's a plan to dig up a new mine

568
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,526
near your mine in the area.

569
00:45:12,741 --> 00:45:16,053
Since we're moving a lot of soil from the area, it is possible

570
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:19,613
for us to use the soil from the mine so that we don't have to buy soil.

571
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:21,486
There might be

572
00:45:21,598 --> 00:45:23,206
some transportation costs.

573
00:45:26,886 --> 00:45:28,366
There's no problem.

574
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:37,133
We can also use tree trimmings to increase and decrease the elevation.

575
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:39,046
We don't have to use soil.

576
00:45:41,861 --> 00:45:43,806
I'd like to continue with my presentation.

577
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:48,926
As for the maze, we'll use this pattern.

578
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:51,406
(You're acting like you're indifferent.)

579
00:45:51,606 --> 00:45:54,286
The outside area will be the maze.

580
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,286
As for the inner center,

581
00:45:56,398 --> 00:45:59,317
I'll design it into a triangular shape

582
00:45:59,398 --> 00:46:02,086
to make it look like a sparkle of ruby.

583
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:07,526
As for this area, I'll use shrubs

584
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:11,326
that have gray and silver leaves to make it look like a ruby sparkle.

585
00:46:11,622 --> 00:46:14,646
As for the maze, I'll make it look like a Siamese ruby.

586
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:25,646
(Since it's come to this...)

587
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:30,726
(It's time for sudden questions.)

588
00:46:31,406 --> 00:46:33,126
What tree are you going to use?

589
00:46:33,454 --> 00:46:34,886
Probably not banyan trees.

590
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:37,446
I don't think their leaves will be red all year.

591
00:46:38,806 --> 00:46:41,766
As for this, I'll use Christina trees.

592
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,926
The tip of their leaves is red.

593
00:46:44,045 --> 00:46:47,246
We can decorate it like we can do with banyan trees.

594
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:49,926
But from your presentation, we have to look down from a top-down view.

595
00:46:50,055 --> 00:46:51,406
That's right.

596
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:55,646
I'd like to propose that the center of the maze should be the scenic spot.

597
00:46:55,766 --> 00:46:59,166
We can put kiosks in the lower area and sell snacks to people.

598
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:02,326
If there's a store, have you thought about the service entrance?

599
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:06,646
We can use this spot as a shortcut for the exit.

600
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,086
What about safety?

601
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:11,526
The height of the maze is 2.5 meters. People might get stuck inside.

602
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:15,086
Thank you for that question. Another benefit of the scenic spot

603
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:18,086
is employees can go up there before closing down the area for the night.

604
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:22,126
Another benefit is that we can see the maze from there.

605
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:28,366
But you want the cafe to be minimal. It doesn't match the area, though.

606
00:47:28,493 --> 00:47:30,326
I've told the architect

607
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,886
that I wanted it to match the area as it used to be Bo Phloi.

608
00:47:34,094 --> 00:47:35,542
You wouldn't use a real gem, right?

609
00:47:35,638 --> 00:47:39,246
No. We'll only use the color and characteristics of gems

610
00:47:39,327 --> 00:47:41,045
to decorate the area.

611
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:44,126
The materials we'll use are terrazzo.

612
00:47:46,627 --> 00:47:48,926
- You can only do that much? - I still have more.

613
00:47:49,044 --> 00:47:52,697
We can also add more cool things like the bamboo tray

614
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:55,846
that's used for gems panning. We can make it into a sculpture.

615
00:47:55,966 --> 00:47:57,805
The sunken seat is like a hole.

616
00:47:57,886 --> 00:48:00,686
The people who sit there might only see feet.

617
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,067
For that, I'll use shrubs

618
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:05,246
to increase privacy and comfort.

619
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:08,646
To make it look like you're in Bo Phloi as the concept.

620
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:11,526
I think our target audience is too wide.

621
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:13,846
Our project doesn't have a target audience.

622
00:48:13,926 --> 00:48:17,006
We want to welcome as many tourists as possible.

623
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:20,085
Many tourists? But there are only two-seater tables in the plan.

624
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,726
We can easily add more tables and chairs

625
00:48:24,886 --> 00:48:28,766
for the customers who require them. That's more flexible.

626
00:48:28,894 --> 00:48:31,685
Why don't you just use movable chairs, then?

627
00:48:31,766 --> 00:48:36,366
I recommend fixed sofas for the area next to the wall.

628
00:48:36,486 --> 00:48:38,046
It'll make it look more cosy.

629
00:48:38,174 --> 00:48:42,326
It'll also make the layout of chairs and tables more organized and tidy.

630
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,966
(What's this?)

631
00:48:44,366 --> 00:48:46,286
(Is she Apo from a parallel universe?)

632
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:48,406
Are there any more questions?

633
00:48:52,245 --> 00:48:54,646
Didn't you say you'd destroy her?

634
00:48:54,886 --> 00:48:57,126
How could you make her look better?

635
00:48:59,526 --> 00:49:02,446
What's the matter? Do you have any more questions?

636
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,589
Mueang, you can do it. Hang in there.

637
00:49:12,421 --> 00:49:14,286
What do you say, Mueang?

638
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,646
Do you have any more questions?

639
00:49:16,766 --> 00:49:19,326
If not, Apo will continue her presentation.

640
00:49:23,686 --> 00:49:26,166
What about...

641
00:49:28,046 --> 00:49:30,246
No. I have no more questions.

642
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:33,326
If that's the case,

643
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,486
I'd like to continue my presentation.

644
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:43,686
Good job.

645
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:45,806
You really put Mueang in his place.

646
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:49,206
You're exaggerating.

647
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:51,965
I'll also say that...

648
00:49:52,046 --> 00:49:56,366
The maze is good. The cafe is good.

649
00:49:57,406 --> 00:50:00,726
About the cafe, the credit has to go to the architects.

650
00:50:00,846 --> 00:50:03,286
They've done exactly what I've briefed them on.

651
00:50:03,525 --> 00:50:06,126
It means that you're good at briefing them.

652
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:08,046
That's why it comes out good.

653
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,606
You're flattering me too much.

654
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,687
How could I not flatter you?

655
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:15,206
You didn't have any confidence the other day.

656
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:19,126
But today, it's like you've leveled up.

657
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:22,197
I've really leveled up.

658
00:50:22,574 --> 00:50:27,147
I've never done any presentations on this kind of big project before.

659
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:28,798
I was so nervous.

660
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:30,606
- Really? - Yes.

661
00:50:31,646 --> 00:50:35,606
I was scared that I might make a mistake again, so I've been practicing.

662
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:22,366
I know that I'm not that talented.

663
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,766
I have to admit that to myself first.

664
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:30,166
If we don't acknowledge our flaws first, we can't learn anything.

665
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:32,326
I don't know

666
00:51:32,629 --> 00:51:36,046
what the real reason you decided to take Ms. Apo here is.

667
00:51:36,446 --> 00:51:37,766
I want you

668
00:51:37,949 --> 00:51:38,949
to think about it again

669
00:51:39,086 --> 00:51:41,446
to see if it's really the right decision.

670
00:51:42,894 --> 00:51:44,366
This means

671
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:46,846
that I wasn't wrong about you.

672
00:51:48,236 --> 00:51:53,166
A lot of people want to tell me that I made the wrong decision.

673
00:51:53,925 --> 00:51:56,686
When I think about it, I think that this time,

674
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:59,566
this is my most correct decision so far.

675
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:02,126
Thank you.

676
00:52:02,397 --> 00:52:06,926
You made me see various possibilities that I've never seen before.

677
00:52:07,486 --> 00:52:09,726
You gave me hope.

678
00:52:11,406 --> 00:52:14,766
I'll help to make your hope come true.

679
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:16,646
I'll wait for that day.

680
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,406
But before that day comes,

681
00:52:20,174 --> 00:52:22,166
I have another thing to ask you.

682
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:39,766
Does that kind of person really exist in this world?

683
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:42,374
I also have the same question as you.

684
00:52:43,862 --> 00:52:46,966
It's scary enough to think that we have to live

685
00:52:47,461 --> 00:52:48,524
with them in this world.

686
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:51,046
Yeah. I still remember her face.

687
00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:55,166
(It wasn't just my fault.)

688
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:58,126
(It's my fault for looking at my phone, but it's the road's fault too.)

689
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:03,126
Even if that woman stabbed me with a knife,

690
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:04,646
she wouldn't think she was wrong.

691
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:06,286
She'd think she just slipped.

692
00:53:06,461 --> 00:53:09,260
Just think of it as an unfortunate event.

693
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:18,806
What's with him again?

694
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:21,566
That one was pretty unfortunate as well.

695
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:23,126
What?

696
00:53:24,582 --> 00:53:25,926
It's Ms. Apo.

697
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:30,126
I heard Young Master was humiliated in the meeting room.

698
00:53:30,325 --> 00:53:31,406
Really?

699
00:53:43,907 --> 00:53:45,126
Where is he going?

700
00:53:45,246 --> 00:53:47,166
He might try to humiliate her back.

701
00:53:55,136 --> 00:53:56,766
I really pity myself.

702
00:53:57,148 --> 00:53:59,148
Is there anything easy in my life?

703
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:05,206
Can I have something easy for once?

704
00:54:05,397 --> 00:54:06,646
Something easy.

705
00:54:08,229 --> 00:54:09,686
You've got skills.

706
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,646
So, why don't you work to pay off the debt?

707
00:54:12,646 --> 00:54:14,166
Why are you getting married to pay it off?

708
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:17,606
How many years do I have to work to pay off my debt fully?

709
00:54:18,998 --> 00:54:20,246
Then...

710
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,846
You can work for me. I'll hire you.

711
00:54:30,926 --> 00:54:33,886
How much does my dad give you? How much money do you need per month?

712
00:54:35,326 --> 00:54:36,406
Wait a second.

713
00:54:37,006 --> 00:54:38,606
Are you hiring me?

714
00:54:39,717 --> 00:54:42,446
If you can work, you can just work to pay off your debt.

715
00:54:45,046 --> 00:54:46,166
What do you say?

716
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:48,686
If you think you want to hire me,

717
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:50,767
does it mean you finally approve of me?

718
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:53,206
No.

719
00:54:53,862 --> 00:54:56,046
I just think that you have potential.

720
00:54:56,245 --> 00:55:00,046
That's why I'm so confused why you decided to marry my dad.

721
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:02,926
You probably have a lot more choices than this.

722
00:55:03,046 --> 00:55:05,886
I think we should stop talking about this.

723
00:55:06,966 --> 00:55:09,206
I just want to remind you one last time.

724
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,686
My answer is still the same.

725
00:55:15,637 --> 00:55:18,366
I knew it. I knew that I couldn't change your mind.

726
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:19,846
I shouldn't have come here.

727
00:55:20,197 --> 00:55:21,366
Mueang.

728
00:55:22,726 --> 00:55:24,166
It's good that you're here.

729
00:55:24,606 --> 00:55:26,646
I have something to tell you.

730
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:29,686
What?

731
00:55:30,366 --> 00:55:32,406
Do you want to say you're happy that you humiliated me?

732
00:55:32,557 --> 00:55:35,366
Or do you want to say I was too nosy?

733
00:55:37,669 --> 00:55:38,966
I'm sorry.

734
00:55:39,646 --> 00:55:40,806
Huh?

735
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:45,566
This is what I want to tell you.

736
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:48,949
Why are you apologizing to me?

737
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,606
I was looking down on you.

738
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:55,206
But you aren't the same as I thought.

739
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:01,646
(Before that day comes, )

740
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:03,917
(I have another thing to ask you.)

741
00:56:04,182 --> 00:56:06,566
Is that so? Just say it, then.

742
00:56:07,821 --> 00:56:11,566
I know that Mueang was trying to harass me in the meeting room.

743
00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:13,126
But if you think about it,

744
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:14,790
some of his questions

745
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,606
are the questions that people who know how to work would ask.

746
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:21,446
The questions are important and beneficial.

747
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:25,726
I think Mueang has done enough research on this project.

748
00:56:25,886 --> 00:56:27,926
I don't think he's good for nothing.

749
00:56:29,718 --> 00:56:32,406
Have I told you that he's good for nothing?

750
00:56:33,206 --> 00:56:36,006
Actually, Mueang is pretty talented.

751
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:38,446
That's why I want him to help with my work.

752
00:56:38,894 --> 00:56:40,286
But anyway,

753
00:56:40,486 --> 00:56:43,246
he and I have never been on the same page.

754
00:56:43,574 --> 00:56:47,206
It means that Mueang can work.

755
00:56:47,597 --> 00:56:48,766
Yes.

756
00:56:48,918 --> 00:56:50,326
Honestly,

757
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:52,526
he's a talented man.

758
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:54,886
But he's as stubborn as me.

759
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:04,166
I'm really sorry, Mueang.

760
00:57:05,414 --> 00:57:07,366
I used to look at you

761
00:57:07,654 --> 00:57:09,886
as a spoiled son of a rich guy

762
00:57:10,046 --> 00:57:11,326
who can't do anything.

763
00:57:11,446 --> 00:57:13,566
When you're in trouble, you go surfing.

764
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:16,726
I looked at you like that.

765
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:20,846
I didn't think you'd think of me like that.

766
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:23,846
Sorry.

767
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:27,377
Forget it.

768
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:29,326
Let's just say we're even now.

769
00:57:33,526 --> 00:57:34,806
I...

770
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:38,086
I'm also sorry for looking down on you.

771
00:57:39,093 --> 00:57:40,246
You...

772
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,006
You're good enough to survive.

773
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,886
My experience taught me how to survive in this world.

774
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,606
You said it like you've been through a lot.

775
00:57:48,687 --> 00:57:50,406
I've been through a lot.

776
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,966
I'm already over 20 years old.

777
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:55,566
How could you know my life better than me?

778
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:59,646
- That's true. - I'll tell you.

779
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,406
There's a lot of things you don't know about me.

780
00:58:03,886 --> 00:58:06,006
There are also a lot of things you don't know about me.

781
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,326
If that's the case,

782
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:14,069
shall we get to know each other once again?

783
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:29,286
Didn't you say we'd just leave each other alone?

784
00:58:29,492 --> 00:58:33,406
Well, I thought that would be better earlier.

785
00:58:34,366 --> 00:58:35,686
But right now,

786
00:58:36,742 --> 00:58:39,126
I think if we try to accept each other,

787
00:58:39,605 --> 00:58:41,046
it'll be better.

788
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:51,686
Nice to meet you once again, Mueang.

789
00:58:59,614 --> 00:59:01,126
I don't care.

790
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,086
Well,

791
00:59:15,374 --> 00:59:18,806
I have a favor to ask you. I don't know if it's too much.

792
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:20,486
What is it?

793
00:59:21,206 --> 00:59:24,526
I want you to get to know Mueang better.

794
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:27,446
The reason is...

795
00:59:28,126 --> 00:59:30,406
If you know him well enough,

796
00:59:30,926 --> 00:59:33,726
you'll be a perfect stepmother for him.

797
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,446
A perfect stepmother?

798
00:59:40,822 --> 00:59:42,206
Me?

799
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:45,166
I'm getting goosebumps.

800
00:59:51,446 --> 00:59:52,446
Fine.

801
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:54,246
Let's do it.

802
01:00:10,991 --> 01:00:12,734
Birthday...

803
01:00:22,966 --> 01:00:24,589
I don't know anything at all?

804
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:33,686
How could I become a perfect stepmother?

805
01:00:45,782 --> 01:00:48,246
Mueang...

806
01:01:03,014 --> 01:01:04,846
It really looks like him.

807
01:01:14,006 --> 01:01:17,606
(Right, I think I saw Mueang rub his eyebrows a lot.)

808
01:01:18,534 --> 01:01:21,766
I'm also sorry for looking down on you.

809
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,006
You...

810
01:01:24,366 --> 01:01:25,806
You're good enough to survive.

811
01:01:27,173 --> 01:01:28,506
(What does that mean?)

812
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,246
If that's the case,

813
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,686
shall we get to know each other once again?

814
01:01:43,846 --> 01:01:45,446
Didn't you say we'd just live our lives?

815
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:49,486
Well, I thought that would be better earlier.

816
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:51,766
But right now,

817
01:01:52,006 --> 01:01:54,046
I think if we can accept each other,

818
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,846
it'll be better.

819
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:05,526
Nice to meet you once again, Mueang.

820
01:02:26,037 --> 01:02:27,286
Just tell me about it.

821
01:02:28,646 --> 01:02:30,046
The night is still young.

822
01:02:33,726 --> 01:02:34,966
I'm annoyed.

823
01:02:36,373 --> 01:02:37,566
What are you annoyed about?

824
01:02:38,518 --> 01:02:40,086
I'm annoyed that I feel like

825
01:02:40,686 --> 01:02:42,406
I don't know her at all.

826
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:45,446
You should get to know her once again then.

827
01:02:48,086 --> 01:02:49,966
If you get to know her better,

828
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,886
it might be easier for you to give up on her.

829
01:02:53,606 --> 01:02:54,966
If not,

830
01:02:55,245 --> 01:02:57,406
you might understand her more than this.

831
01:02:57,805 --> 01:03:01,686
Then, you'll be able to finally answer that question on your mind

832
01:03:02,405 --> 01:03:05,526
about why she chose to marry Uncle Din to pay off her debt.

833
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:08,406
Would I really be able to understand that kind of person?

834
01:03:11,726 --> 01:03:13,966
Before you can understand someone,

835
01:03:14,326 --> 01:03:16,806
you have to live their life first.

836
01:03:17,429 --> 01:03:19,806
If not, you'd only be able to look from an outsider's perspective.

837
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:24,646
Trust me.

838
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:26,726
You have nothing to lose.

839
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:28,535
Just try it.

840
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:34,637
Unless you'll like her more after you get to know her more.

841
01:04:17,781 --> 01:04:19,206
Please wake up.

842
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:21,566
No, I don't want to wake up now.

843
01:04:24,966 --> 01:04:27,486
Please just leave me be. I want to sleep.

844
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:30,006
I just want to die in my sleep.

845
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:34,726
I don't want to live and see the successful life of the person I hate.

846
01:04:35,206 --> 01:04:37,086
I can't accept it.

847
01:04:38,718 --> 01:04:43,206
I want the world to end so that it'll be all over.

848
01:04:44,894 --> 01:04:46,766
You can't die now.

849
01:04:47,005 --> 01:04:51,686
Didn't you say you'll wait to see the fall of the person you hate?

850
01:04:52,206 --> 01:04:54,126
It's because the person I hate

851
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:56,230
looks like she's too tough to kill.

852
01:04:57,134 --> 01:04:58,766
Please don't give up.

853
01:04:59,086 --> 01:05:01,206
You have to continue to live for your vengeance.

854
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,926
For my vengeance?

855
01:05:05,886 --> 01:05:07,006
Yes.

856
01:05:08,957 --> 01:05:10,093
That's true.

857
01:05:10,357 --> 01:05:12,157
I have to live for my vengeance.

858
01:05:13,886 --> 01:05:16,406
Thank you so much for reminding me of that, Sita.

859
01:05:16,565 --> 01:05:17,806
It's alright.

860
01:05:18,142 --> 01:05:22,206
Now, please wake up and live your life. It's already getting late.

861
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:25,966
I'll continue to live for my vengeance against Apo

862
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:29,326
until she finally gets out of this house.

863
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:33,926
For vengeance.

864
01:05:46,684 --> 01:05:48,286
I used my eyes too much.

865
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:15,286
(The albums and files on Mueang that you requested.)

866
01:06:23,526 --> 01:06:27,886
His education is good. Why is his personality so bad?

867
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,166
So cute.

868
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:43,223
Some people should have remained as a child.

869
01:07:04,366 --> 01:07:07,686
(If Mueang knows that I've dug up a lot of information on him, )

870
01:07:08,446 --> 01:07:10,206
(will he be scared of me?)

871
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:26,806
It said Mueang's zodiac sign would encounter a big disaster.

872
01:07:28,505 --> 01:07:30,886
Oh my god. What?

873
01:07:31,086 --> 01:07:32,446
Please take a look at Tin.

874
01:07:32,566 --> 01:07:34,326
- What's wrong? - Tin's in a bad shape.

875
01:07:34,446 --> 01:07:36,246
- Take a deep breath. - Tin.

876
01:07:36,475 --> 01:07:38,245
Now, let's go.

877
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:39,606
Hello.

878
01:07:39,813 --> 01:07:40,966
I'm here to see Mr. Phudin.

879
01:07:41,047 --> 01:07:44,606
Although you don't like me, you still feel bad for me.

880
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:46,322
You're really kind.

881
01:07:46,449 --> 01:07:51,046
You have to stop being kind to Apo, understand?

882
01:07:51,173 --> 01:07:54,046
Who's that man?

883
01:07:54,222 --> 01:07:56,726
Did someone do something to annoy you today, Young Master?

884
01:07:56,837 --> 01:07:58,646
(If God really exists, )

885
01:07:58,727 --> 01:08:03,526
(I'd like to ask what more you have in store for me.)
