1
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:02,326
I'm glad I met you, Mueang.

2
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:07,966
Find out your answer in there.

3
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,046
Even if you're View

4
00:02:12,686 --> 00:02:14,006
or Apo,

5
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:15,486
I like both of them.

6
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,486
We're in a relationship now.

7
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:19,726
Since we agree,

8
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:21,126
then...

9
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,526
- Let's break up for now.   - Let's break up for now.

10
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:25,846
You know, in your life so far,

11
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:29,366
I think this is the best decision you've ever made.

12
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:31,686
What's dead now?

13
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:33,646
The love between you and Miss Apo!

14
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:35,262
Before we officially date,

15
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:38,646
can I be your first candidate for a boyfriend?

16
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:40,014
Okay.

17
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:42,766
Hello, everyone. Right now,

18
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,486
I'm at Phudin Park, Chanthaburi...

19
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:46,606
Hey.

20
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,886
- I'm sorry.   - It's alright.

21
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:53,966
Phing.

22
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:56,766
You didn't tell me you were coming.

23
00:02:57,606 --> 00:03:00,006
I was going to visit Apo for a bit.

24
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:02,486
I'm so glad for that.

25
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:05,037
I'll help you with the recording.

26
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:07,046
Here.

27
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,606
Don't shoot other people's faces. I don't want to get sued.

28
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:14,286
Understood.

29
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:17,486
Why did I have to see him?

30
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,046
- We'll follow you there.   - Let's go.

31
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:22,621
Thank you.

32
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,726
You won't be bothered anymore.

33
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,846
The mission is finally over.

34
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:28,166
I...

35
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,990
I'll go back to Bangkok now.

36
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,126
I'm happy for you.

37
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,846
Excuse me, I'd like you to take it again.

38
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,046
Fine. You're really a lot.

39
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:41,246
- Yes, like that.   - You can pose now.

40
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,166
Please check it again.

41
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,166
How is it?

42
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:50,672
There's nothing good.

43
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,446
Just use the app.

44
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:55,686
Are you saying

45
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:57,846
it's my face's fault?

46
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:00,766
I'll take it for her.

47
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,166
I'm leaving.

48
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,557
Thank you for trying.

49
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,526
Aren't you going back to Bangkok?

50
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:12,326
I want to cherish my last day in Chanthaburi first.

51
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:18,006
Give me your phone and pose for me. I'll take it for you.

52
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:24,046
I want an upward angle. I look too large when it's a straight angle.

53
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:26,286
- I know that.   - Is it good?

54
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,726
One, two... Changing the pose, huh?

55
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:31,646
Okay.

56
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:51,302
Let me see.

57
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:00,366
Good.

58
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:02,206
I'm in the middle.

59
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:05,006
My head is all intact.

60
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:06,806
My double chin doesn't show.

61
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,446
How is it? Am I good enough?

62
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:12,606
What a professional.

63
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,446
Where are you going next?

64
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:20,326
I don't have a plan. Do you have a recommendation?

65
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:22,846
Sure.

66
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,926
We're here. This is the store I told you about.

67
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,126
- Should we go in?   - Follow me, please.

68
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:39,006
- The view is really good.   - Where?

69
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:46,046
Isn't it good?

70
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:48,246
Yes.

71
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:49,606
Mueang.

72
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,486
Let's go to other stores.

73
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,406
This store is fine.

74
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,486
- Hello, Tin. Hello, Ing.   - Hello.

75
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,086
- Have a seat.   - Yes.

76
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:16,086
- Let's begin.   - Hey.

77
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,169
- Stop.   - What?

78
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,686
Wait a bit.

79
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:21,806
Hold on. Your hands.

80
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:24,206
- Ouch.   - Take it away.

81
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:27,446
(Ing, the photo maniac)

82
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,326
- Can I eat it now?   - It's time.

83
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:30,486
Okay.

84
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:32,006
Let's dig in.

85
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:49,412
(Mueang, the one who'll take care of others)

86
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:58,406
(Apo, the one who only eats, not talks)

87
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:04,326
- I was there first.   - I was there first.

88
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,606
- I already... I'll get it now.   - Hey.

89
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:11,726
Tin. Hey, Tin.

90
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,766
- Hey!   - That's it. It's that easy.

91
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:18,806
It's good.

92
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:20,606
It's 651 baht.

93
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,406
How should we pay for it?

94
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,526
Please handle it for me. I'm not good at this.

95
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:27,831
You're the one who ate the most. You should pay.

96
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:29,566
Give me that.

97
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:31,286
Divide it by four.

98
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:35,606
Okay. Each one will pay 162.75 baht.

99
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,446
(Tin, the calculator)

100
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,406
I'll pay. You transfer the money to me later.

101
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,686
I'll transfer it to you.

102
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,406
- Okay.   - Okay.

103
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:48,686
It's nice when we have it together. It's cheap.

104
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,086
- We'll come here together next...   - Hold on.

105
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,566
Is there still a next time?

106
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:55,526
Once is already enough for me. This is the last supper.

107
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:58,926
Well, it's kind of fun.

108
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:01,926
Really? Okay. We'll come here together again.

109
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:04,166
That's okay. Yeah.

110
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:05,886
We can come here several times too.

111
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:08,126
We can even go to the other stores.

112
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:12,686
Aren't you confused?

113
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:14,999
He's different from earlier.

114
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:20,206
Tin is pretty kind.

115
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,806
Ing is also funny in a weird kind of way.

116
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:26,366
If you find it funny, that's good.

117
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,406
At least you're happy.

118
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,006
What's the matter?

119
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:42,326
I want to be happy.

120
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,326
I really want to, but...

121
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:46,126
It's difficult.

122
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,726
Why can't we be as easily happy as when we were children?

123
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:52,566
We'd already be happy with this ice cream alone.

124
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,606
Well...

125
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:59,166
It's the taste of living as adults.

126
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,526
A child doesn't have much to think about.

127
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,806
It's painful when we grow up, isn't it?

128
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:10,006
Yes.

129
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:12,326
It's painful when we grow up.

130
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:17,846
Thank you

131
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,446
for making it through your life until you met me.

132
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:25,606
From now on, you won't have to suffer alone anymore.

133
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,286
We'll grow together.

134
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,446
You'll grow with me?

135
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,206
Yes.

136
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:37,126
We'll grow together.

137
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:39,646
We aren't children anymore, though.

138
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,262
Can we still use the word "grow?"

139
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:42,726
We should say...

140
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:44,846
We'll get older together.

141
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,886
We can still use that. We're still late teenagers, you know?

142
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:54,046
Okay, late teenagers.

143
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:58,126
Then, let's grow together.

144
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,205
This is the end of today's video.

145
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,126
You can comment where you want me to go next

146
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,081
under this video.

147
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:42,456
Please click the like button, subscribe, and share the video.

148
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:45,126
I'll take my leave here. Bye-bye. See you later.

149
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,646
It's done, Phing.

150
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,846
- Thank you, Aum.   - You're welcome.

151
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:54,326
I'll get going now.

152
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,046
Phing.

153
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:01,406
You...

154
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,886
I won't give up on you easily.

155
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:08,046
I'm ready to fight. Please wait for me.

156
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,886
I'll fight for you, Phing.

157
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:18,886
I can do everything for you.

158
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:33,006
I'll probably miss the smell of the sea when I go back.

159
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:37,486
Come back here if you miss it.

160
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,126
I just realized why we like to laze around and look at the sea.

161
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,326
It can be even more beautiful.

162
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,286
What are you doing?

163
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:04,206
This is so beautiful.

164
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:05,686
Try it.

165
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:08,606
- Are you joking with me?   - No. Try it.

166
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:28,526
It's really beautiful.

167
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:32,286
This is why

168
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,486
I want to protect it.

169
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:37,486
At first, I thought

170
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:42,733
you'd be like an ideologist who doesn't care about reality.

171
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,646
This world needs people like you, though.

172
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:50,406
I hope you can achieve the world you want to see.

173
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:14,926
Is this what they call

174
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,446
being so cute it makes my heart hurt?

175
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:22,806
How is it? What's the progress today?

176
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:25,046
Aum, look at this.

177
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:28,646
Ta-da.

178
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:30,566
My new wallpaper.

179
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,606
Wow. You process the photos really fast.

180
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:35,126
Of course.

181
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,646
And that's it?

182
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,046
It's not just this.

183
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:42,206
I got to know her more today.

184
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:44,926
Whenever I feel happy,

185
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:48,326
something bad will always happen.

186
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:52,126
Would the tip I gave her work?

187
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,366
What's this?

188
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,086
If you feel like being happy is difficult,

189
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:14,286
you should start

190
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,646
by being happy with something small first.

191
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:27,526
Being happy with something small?

192
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:47,006
Good job, Apo. It's in the bin. I'll give you a round of applause.

193
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,886
She's crazy.

194
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:22,886
Why are you in an artistic mood when it's two in the morning?

195
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:25,406
I want to sleep.

196
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,006
Din has already told me about you and Mueang.

197
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:02,446
- Okay?   - I feel bad for you,

198
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:05,486
but if you want to be my niece-in-law,

199
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,446
you have to get through me first.

200
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:12,806
You don't have to go through anyone.

201
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,406
Din.

202
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:18,286
Who're you?

203
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:20,806
They're in love. Or are you dating them as well?

204
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:24,846
I'm only trying to do my job as her aunt.

205
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,686
Just do your job as an employee first.

206
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:30,046
Sita, prepare the car for me.

207
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:31,693
The car is ready.

208
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:33,795
Then, let's go to the office.

209
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:35,846
That's too much.

210
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:52,966
Finally, we're back to normal.

211
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,566
It's so cool.

212
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,006
Congratulations,

213
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:01,446
the swapped life is over.

214
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:05,166
I don't have to be in hell anymore.

215
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:10,606
Isn't Mueang going to attend the meeting today?

216
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,886
Why does Mueang have to attend the meeting?

217
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:18,006
Wait. Didn't you want Mr. Mueang to inherit your business?

218
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:19,446
Yes.

219
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:21,246
But from now on,

220
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:23,486
I won't force him anymore.

221
00:17:23,606 --> 00:17:25,046
I'll let him do what he wants.

222
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,286
Oh, Mueang?

223
00:17:37,517 --> 00:17:38,806
Why are you here?

224
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:42,446
I'm here to help solve the problems.

225
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:44,397
Help solve the problems?

226
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:48,086
Yes. If I let you do this alone, we'll go bankrupt.

227
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:49,566
That's why

228
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:51,886
I'm here to help.

229
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:55,486
Mueang, are you serious right now?

230
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:56,886
Yes.

231
00:17:57,204 --> 00:18:00,166
From now on, I'll start to work here in the office.

232
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:02,846
Mueang.

233
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:06,726
I'm really happy that you finally came through.

234
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,166
Please help with your dad's work.

235
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:14,006
Should we celebrate?

236
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:18,726
That's enough. Don't try to act like this is a touching moment.

237
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,446
Mueang, thanks.

238
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,006
I told you this isn't a touching moment.

239
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:30,446
Well, let's talk about the celebration later.

240
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:35,246
I'll be the host for that.

241
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:37,126
Yes.

242
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:38,766
Forget about the celebration.

243
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:41,046
The future of the company is more important.

244
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:42,686
Let's begin.

245
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:46,526
Of course. We'll begin.

246
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,566
Okay.

247
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:50,709
The project I'd like to present...

248
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:53,406
- It's good.   - She hasn't talked.

249
00:18:57,718 --> 00:19:01,206
Well, about the project I'd like to present today,

250
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:03,766
I'd like to develop The Maze project

251
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,526
into a learning center of Bo Phloi.

252
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:07,717
We can make it into conservation tourism

253
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:09,726
by letting tourists mine gems in the traditional way.

254
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:13,006
We can put a cafe and homestay there

255
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:14,916
so that you don't have to close Bo Phloi down.

256
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,886
We can make money from this as well.

257
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,526
What do you think about it?

258
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:34,046
That's a yes from me. Good job.

259
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:37,766
You're a genius. A gift from the god.

260
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:40,966
You're praising her too much.

261
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:43,086
It's the honeymoon period.

262
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,126
It's interesting.

263
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,846
If you agree with it, I'd like to continue to develop it further.

264
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:00,326
I approve.

265
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:25,106
You've been trying to find a way not to close down Bo Phloi?

266
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:29,086
When I went to learn about Bo Phloi,

267
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:31,646
I did that to gather information to talk with Mr. Phudin.

268
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,366
Excellent.

269
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,046
I'm not that great.

270
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:41,646
That's your charm.

271
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:47,326
You always think of other people.

272
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:52,566
I just think that what Mr. Phudin was doing isn't right.

273
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,366
We should conserve the traditional way of mining gems

274
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:57,126
so that the young generation can learn.

275
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:58,766
Thank you.

276
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,246
Thank you for protecting my dream.

277
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:04,702
Thank you.

278
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:08,726
I already thought I liked you enough.

279
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,726
You made me fall for you even harder.

280
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:15,886
How could you do that?

281
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:17,366
You're too good.

282
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:21,886
Mueang, you're really exaggerating.

283
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:24,406
I'm not. I'm being serious.

284
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,806
I have a gift for you.

285
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:30,766
I made it last night. I don't know if you'll like it.

286
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:47,606
What's that?

287
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:49,101
Open it.

288
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:11,606
Do you like it or not?

289
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,286
I like it.

290
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,206
I really like it.

291
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,206
Can I wear them now?

292
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:20,446
Can I wear them now?

293
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,126
Hey.

294
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,126
You're cute.

295
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,846
- Do you want it?   - Yes.

296
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:40,046
- Okay.   - Hello, Boem.

297
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:44,683
I wish you a good day. Have a nice day.

298
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:45,766
Sorry.

299
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:48,406
That smile...

300
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:50,606
Was it for me?

301
00:22:51,164 --> 00:22:53,046
Hey. Hi, bro.

302
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,566
Hi, bro.

303
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:58,806
Young Master greeted me.

304
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:01,241
- What's the number?   - Did you dream of soulmates?

305
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:03,806
No. You have to interpret your dream to get the number.

306
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:07,406
I hope you'll enjoy your work. Please do your best, ladies.

307
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:09,686
- Of course.   - Hang in there.

308
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,086
- Did Young Master just motivate us?   - Yes.

309
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:16,886
That has to be the eighth wonder of the world for me.

310
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:27,406
Hello. You're not hungry, right?

311
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:32,566
Isn't that hot? You can do it under shade.

312
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:36,886
Everyone.

313
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:40,166
If you're tired, you can get off early today.

314
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:41,845
It's a free day.

315
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:43,246
Huh?

316
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,766
Free day?

317
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,046
It's not even noon yet.

318
00:23:55,344 --> 00:23:57,918
What's wrong with him today?

319
00:24:01,313 --> 00:24:02,766
What's going on?

320
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:13,326
What's wrong with Young Master?

321
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:17,166
He's strange today. He's in a good mood.

322
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:23,646
What's that?

323
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:41,966
This is bad.

324
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:44,806
No...

325
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,086
Young Master.

326
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:50,086
Young Master!

327
00:24:50,461 --> 00:24:51,686
What is it?

328
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:54,126
There's a dead body over there!

329
00:24:55,382 --> 00:24:56,486
What?

330
00:24:56,686 --> 00:24:57,886
This way, Young Master.

331
00:24:58,078 --> 00:24:59,246
This way.

332
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:01,076
It's right there.

333
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:32,446
Isn't he the one who accompanied Ms. Ing on Ms. Apo's birthday?

334
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:38,726
He's not dead.

335
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,566
We should take him to the hospital.

336
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:45,886
Let him stay there.

337
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:47,566
You can't do that, Young Master.

338
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:50,406
If he dies here, we'll be in trouble.

339
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:01,726
He's too heavy, Young Master.

340
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,677
One, two, three.

341
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:12,046
He looks really bad.

342
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:14,486
Should we tell someone?

343
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:17,046
No. I can handle this myself.

344
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:18,494
Yes.

345
00:26:21,598 --> 00:26:22,806
Wake up.

346
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:44,846
My small happiness of today.

347
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:56,246
You.

348
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,286
How did I get here?

349
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,806
You're already dead.

350
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:06,686
Dead?

351
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:10,286
- I'm dead?   - Just kidding.

352
00:27:10,822 --> 00:27:13,286
I saw you lying there, so I picked you up.

353
00:27:16,838 --> 00:27:18,286
I had a little trouble last night.

354
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,606
I didn't ask.

355
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,326
Since you're awake now,

356
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:23,646
you can leave.

357
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:25,366
Hold on.

358
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,606
You can't tell Po about this.

359
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:30,286
Fine. I won't tell her.

360
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:34,206
Don't tell Po that you found me in this state.

361
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:36,286
I know that.

362
00:27:37,077 --> 00:27:38,526
Wait.

363
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,046
Do you have clothes for me?

364
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,686
Go back with what you have.

365
00:27:44,006 --> 00:27:46,846
Hey, I'll return them to you.

366
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:09,566
Take this,

367
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,406
and don't give it back.

368
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:20,886
That's the exit for you.

369
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:27,806
Game?

370
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,526
Mueang?

371
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:47,246
Why are you here, Game?

372
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:49,766
Just tell her.

373
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:53,606
- Can you get out first?   - No.

374
00:28:59,222 --> 00:29:00,326
Mueang.

375
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:03,086
Can I talk to Game first?

376
00:29:03,262 --> 00:29:04,526
So that it'll be over.

377
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:09,726
Fine.

378
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:11,806
Don't take too long.

379
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:29,326
Just tell me.

380
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:31,246
Mueang helped me.

381
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:33,006
Mueang helped you?

382
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:37,126
Do you have some time, Po?

383
00:29:37,262 --> 00:29:38,886
It's a long story.

384
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,606
My life is like an epic story.

385
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,949
I don't have time for you.

386
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,566
Just give me the main story, please.

387
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:50,886
(Hello, I'm Game. Do you still remember me?)

388
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:52,166
You're talented.

389
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,566
But if I had to compare you, I think I could find someone better than you.

390
00:29:55,822 --> 00:29:57,260
You can't do this to me.

391
00:29:57,397 --> 00:29:58,606
I can.

392
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,766
I'll pay your compensation.

393
00:30:00,894 --> 00:30:02,526
You're using money to silence me?

394
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:04,086
And would it work?

395
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,526
(After I was insulted that much,)

396
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:11,166
(how could she dare to try to silence me with money?)

397
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:14,886
(I'm so furious. What do you think I would do next?)

398
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,406
(I'm running away, of course.)

399
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:18,966
(I got a lot of money.)

400
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:21,446
(I can live my own life again.)

401
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:24,166
(This is Kirati,)

402
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:26,646
(my only supporter.)

403
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:29,046
How much do you want?

404
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:32,246
That's up to you, Kirati.

405
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,366
(The good thing about her is she transfers the money quickly.)

406
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:36,726
Check it.

407
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:44,046
(A total of 100,000 baht has been transferred to your account.)

408
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:47,366
(Honestly, I don't mind if I don't have work.)

409
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,606
(If Kirati can pay me, I can live my life comfortably.)

410
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:52,046
(However,)

411
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:54,686
(I'm not the god's favorite child.)

412
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:56,833
Miss.

413
00:30:56,918 --> 00:30:59,446
Yes, I won't take care of you anymore.

414
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,966
Why is that? Did I do something wrong?

415
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:05,006
You didn't do anything wrong, but I was just bored.

416
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:09,166
When you said I was thick-skinned, you're also extremely boring.

417
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,886
Don't you know how bored I was when I was with you?

418
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:16,766
(At that moment,)

419
00:31:17,164 --> 00:31:19,486
(I started to believe in karma.)

420
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:22,326
Take care of yourself. I'm leaving.

421
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,766
Miss.

422
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:30,366
You can't replace me like this.

423
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:36,806
Miss...

424
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:41,646
Excuse me, I don't want to hear a story about ladies from you.

425
00:31:43,773 --> 00:31:44,775
Sorry.

426
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:48,006
Since I have to tell you, I want to tell you everything.

427
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:51,766
(After I was dumped, I had to find a job.)

428
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,886
(The only thing that makes me want to continue my life is alcohol.)

429
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,486
Cheers.

430
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:05,526
(I work in the morning and party at night.)

431
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,838
(I work in the morning and party at night.)

432
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:12,086
(I work in the morning and party at night.)

433
00:32:13,326 --> 00:32:14,806
(I work in the morning)

434
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,766
(and party at night.)

435
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,366
(I work in the morning and party at night.)

436
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,006
(I work in the morning and party at night.)

437
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:30,006
(I work in the morning and party at night.)

438
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:33,366
(I work in the morning and party at night.)

439
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:35,686
(I work in the morning and party at night.)

440
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:38,086
(I work in the morning and party at night.)

441
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,486
(I work in the morning and party...)

442
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:41,366
(I work in the morning and party at night...)

443
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:44,296
(I work in the morning... In the end, I was fired.)

444
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:47,394
I went drinking after I got fired yesterday.

445
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:50,046
When I woke up this morning, I was already at Mueang's house.

446
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:52,766
Was your life that bad?

447
00:32:53,246 --> 00:32:55,926
I didn't want you to see me in this state.

448
00:32:57,774 --> 00:32:59,606
I know

449
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,966
that I have no right to ask for your help.

450
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,286
But I don't have any cash with me at all.

451
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:09,526
Can I at least borrow money from you for my transportation?

452
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:12,246
Game.

453
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:20,486
Mueang.

454
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:23,086
Can you drive me to the office?

455
00:33:23,486 --> 00:33:24,606
Sure.

456
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:27,166
What about that four-eyed man?

457
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:30,686
Take him with us.

458
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:33,846
I'm going to take him to Mr. Phudin.

459
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:35,486
Why would you do that?

460
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,646
I'll tell you about it in the car.

461
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,042
Game, please wait in this room.

462
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,726
I'll talk with Mr. Phudin first.

463
00:33:57,846 --> 00:33:59,366
I'll tell you what we'll do.

464
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,526
I talked with Mr. Phudin.

465
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:27,846
He'd consider you as a candidate.

466
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:31,792
Is that good?

467
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:34,246
- You can go back if you don't think so.   - Yes.

468
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:38,726
Game, Mr. Phudin didn't want to accept you.

469
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:40,926
He knows what you did to me.

470
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:43,566
However, I asked him not to think of private matters.

471
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:47,206
You have to use your own talent to convince him yourself.

472
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,246
- Thank...   - Hey.

473
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:57,246
You don't have to thank me. I helped you because I felt pity.

474
00:34:57,773 --> 00:34:59,606
It was too pathetic when I saw you in this state.

475
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:06,166
Game, go see Mr. Phudin.

476
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:17,166
You...

477
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:19,606
Why did you feel bad for him?

478
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,686
I didn't feel bad for him.

479
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:23,606
I pitied him.

480
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,686
You shouldn't have lowered yourself to get involved with him.

481
00:35:26,886 --> 00:35:32,006
If I had known, I'd have let him get bitten by worms and ants.

482
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:34,486
Mueang.

483
00:35:34,822 --> 00:35:36,126
I'm okay with this.

484
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,886
Think of it as making merits.

485
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:41,094
With that bad of a person?

486
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,366
I only helped him once.

487
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:45,126
It's up to him from now on.

488
00:35:45,222 --> 00:35:46,926
He has to struggle by himself.

489
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:50,006
I think you're too kind.

490
00:35:51,974 --> 00:35:53,726
Didn't you say

491
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:56,846
I was cute because I was always kind to other people?

492
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:01,046
I was talking about myself when I said that.

493
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:05,406
Listen,

494
00:36:06,486 --> 00:36:08,366
can't you be kind to me alone?

495
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,526
Mueang.

496
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,406
I'm the kindest to you.

497
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,206
Don't worry.

498
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,677
You're my first candidate to be my boyfriend.

499
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:28,046
- Okay.   - Okay?

500
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:36,846
Young Master.

501
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:38,726
Is that man

502
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:40,806
really Miss Apo's ex?

503
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:43,606
He is.

504
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:45,166
That's too bad.

505
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:46,966
What's bad?

506
00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:48,966
Don't you know what they say, Young Master?

507
00:36:49,149 --> 00:36:51,686
Exes are the most dangerous sorts of people.

508
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,606
Every time when everything goes well,

509
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:02,646
this part of our lives always likes to come back.

510
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,526
I think it comes at a really wrong time.

511
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:10,166
You almost get to begin your new life with Ms. Apo.

512
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:11,966
Who knows?

513
00:37:12,423 --> 00:37:14,286
Ms. Apo might have helped him

514
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:18,286
because she still feels something for him.

515
00:37:20,168 --> 00:37:23,366
Why are you trying to fan the flames? Do you want me to stab you?

516
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:25,196
I'm not doing that, Young Master.

517
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:28,246
You must be careful right now, Young Master.

518
00:37:28,635 --> 00:37:29,646
Don't forget

519
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:33,006
that you're just a candidate, not her boyfriend.

520
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:37,046
You might lose Ms. Apo to him at any time.

521
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:41,166
Apo won't be that stupid to get tricked again.

522
00:37:41,286 --> 00:37:45,286
Young Master, an old flame easily catches fire, you know?

523
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:56,446
Seriously, Young Master,

524
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,206
aren't you jealous at all?

525
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,326
No.

526
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:01,886
I'm not!

527
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:13,926
Can I go in?

528
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:24,526
Mr. Phudin will hire me until I find a new job.

529
00:38:25,877 --> 00:38:27,966
Just don't ruin my name.

530
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:32,246
Po.

531
00:38:32,926 --> 00:38:35,238
I want to apologize for everything,

532
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:38,446
and I want to thank you for helping me.

533
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,646
I won't accept your apology and gratefulness.

534
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:43,566
I haven't forgiven you.

535
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:44,886
I helped you

536
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:47,846
because I felt bad for you as a fellow human.

537
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,726
I understand.

538
00:38:50,485 --> 00:38:52,246
But I really want to thank you.

539
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:56,166
Po, you're the only one who helps me when I'm in trouble.

540
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:59,366
- I'm so touched...   - Game.

541
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:01,206
Don't act like you're touched.

542
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,286
Just work hard for Mr. Phudin

543
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,166
and don't get in trouble again.

544
00:39:05,317 --> 00:39:06,566
Okay?

545
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,366
Okay.

546
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,246
How is it, Game? Did you get a raise?

547
00:39:41,365 --> 00:39:42,926
Looking at my face, what do you think?

548
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:46,366
It's fine, Game.

549
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:49,166
It'll be your year next year.

550
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,486
Don't say anything. I want to be alone.

551
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:53,886
You should go back.

552
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:17,166
Are you still here?

553
00:40:18,037 --> 00:40:19,717
You're waiting for me until it's night?

554
00:40:23,236 --> 00:40:24,486
Are you free or what?

555
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:26,926
I told you to go home.

556
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:29,886
If you want some motivation,

557
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:32,126
I'll always be here for you.

558
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:35,566
Game.

559
00:40:35,862 --> 00:40:36,926
Remember this.

560
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:39,446
No matter what you have to go through,

561
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,126
I'll always support you, Game.

562
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,806
Is there anything else?

563
00:40:53,025 --> 00:40:55,326
- No.   - Please go out then.

564
00:41:30,637 --> 00:41:33,726
I'm shaking. I might have had too much coffee.

565
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:41,246
What? No...

566
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:46,566
No. It can't be. There's no way.

567
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:49,566
No. That must be it.

568
00:41:55,374 --> 00:41:58,166
Honey, why is Tin talking by himself?

569
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:01,406
Did we let him stay with Mueang too much?

570
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:04,406
Something must have made him distracted.

571
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:06,989
Let's go.

572
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:15,566
Tin.

573
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:17,357
Are you alright?

574
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:23,846
Dad, Mom.

575
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:26,006
Can I ask you something?

576
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:29,646
Can we really love the person we used to hate?

577
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:31,406
Of course, we can.

578
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:33,645
When you first hated them,

579
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:36,446
it was because you had too much prejudice against them.

580
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:39,446
When you finally know that they're not as bad as you think,

581
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:41,846
your feelings can change to liking them instead.

582
00:42:43,246 --> 00:42:45,566
Are you talking about Ing?

583
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,526
Are you crazy? It's not her.

584
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:49,846
Oh?

585
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,526
It's not her. I told you it was not like that.

586
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:55,846
If you like her, just hit on her.

587
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:58,846
She wouldn't know if you stayed still.

588
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:02,806
That's enough. Stop teasing me.

589
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,686
Don't be stubborn.

590
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:07,766
You always try to use your brain too much.

591
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:09,446
You should learn to use your heart.

592
00:43:12,192 --> 00:43:16,646
Go order the coffee in the cafe. I'll follow you there when I'm done here.

593
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:19,486
I have to pack them up.

594
00:43:48,486 --> 00:43:50,126
It's done.

595
00:43:51,486 --> 00:43:53,966
For my lady.

596
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:56,046
Thank you.

597
00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:06,406
How is it?

598
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,094
It's good.

599
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:16,486
I don't have any cash with me at all.

600
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:19,846
Can I at least borrow money from you for my transportation?

601
00:44:20,769 --> 00:44:22,526
Are they really the same person?

602
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:28,646
Serves him right. Finally, his life taught him a lesson.

603
00:44:42,373 --> 00:44:43,590
I'll accompany you.

604
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:46,926
It's fine. I can stay here by myself.

605
00:44:49,558 --> 00:44:51,806
This building is haunted, you know?

606
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,966
I haven't seen any ghosts since I started working here.

607
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,806
Let me accompany you.

608
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,606
If you're that free, fine.

609
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,006
Someone told me I'm the god's favorite child with this kind of face.

610
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:47,366
What do you think?

611
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:56,006
Am I not handsome?

612
00:45:58,437 --> 00:45:59,606
You're handsome.

613
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:12,086
You can look.

614
00:46:12,886 --> 00:46:14,126
I don't mind.

615
00:46:18,062 --> 00:46:21,126
(What's with him? Why did he just praise himself?)

616
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:24,526
- Aum.   - Yes?

617
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:27,686
If I want Apo to only pay attention to me,

618
00:46:27,902 --> 00:46:30,006
- what do I have to do?   - Seduce her a lot, Young Master.

619
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,701
You have to make Ms. Apo

620
00:46:31,782 --> 00:46:33,366
fall for you alone.

621
00:46:34,398 --> 00:46:36,486
- Please try it. Yes.   - Like that?

622
00:46:42,742 --> 00:46:44,366
(What is he doing?)

623
00:46:47,782 --> 00:46:50,846
Don't you think it's hot in this room?

624
00:46:59,197 --> 00:47:00,566
I'm all wet.

625
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:02,686
(Why is he showing it to me?)

626
00:47:02,773 --> 00:47:03,926
Hey...

627
00:47:07,511 --> 00:47:11,808
You should take photos of me. You can look at them when you miss me.

628
00:47:12,453 --> 00:47:14,717
(Did I fall in love with a narcissist?)

629
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:23,926
I can take it. I'll send it to you.

630
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:26,126
I'll count.

631
00:47:32,189 --> 00:47:33,526
Come here.

632
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:39,886
- Phing.   - Hm?

633
00:47:40,246 --> 00:47:41,646
I know

634
00:47:41,853 --> 00:47:43,686
that Mueang probably thinks that he's handsome.

635
00:47:43,886 --> 00:47:45,846
I heard him praise himself,

636
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:49,446
but I didn't think he would be this narcissistic.

637
00:47:50,406 --> 00:47:53,126
It might be a curse of a good-looking person.

638
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,846
Should I

639
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,966
be happy that he's that confident with his face?

640
00:47:59,742 --> 00:48:01,046
Apo.

641
00:48:01,374 --> 00:48:03,374
Confidence and overconfidence

642
00:48:03,606 --> 00:48:04,926
are different.

643
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:07,166
- Right?   - Yes.

644
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:08,406
Po.

645
00:48:18,205 --> 00:48:20,806
Game, what are you doing here?

646
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:24,006
How did you know I'm here?

647
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:26,126
People in the office told me.

648
00:48:26,286 --> 00:48:29,286
I just want to give you something to thank you.

649
00:48:29,742 --> 00:48:30,966
Thank her for what?

650
00:48:31,126 --> 00:48:32,806
Didn't Po tell you?

651
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:35,206
She asked Mr. Phudin to hire me.

652
00:48:35,966 --> 00:48:37,086
Is that true?

653
00:48:38,006 --> 00:48:39,006
Yes.

654
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:41,446
Are you crazy? Why?

655
00:48:43,366 --> 00:48:44,726
Don't blame Apo, Phing.

656
00:48:45,301 --> 00:48:48,326
She just helped me as a fellow human.

657
00:48:48,566 --> 00:48:49,926
- Isn't that right?   - Game.

658
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:51,646
I told you we're done

659
00:48:51,734 --> 00:48:53,326
after I helped you.

660
00:48:53,502 --> 00:48:54,870
Don't bother me.

661
00:48:54,959 --> 00:48:58,766
I'm not bothering you. I only want to cook your favorite food.

662
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,286
Young Master, where are you?

663
00:49:11,445 --> 00:49:13,166
- Where's Young Master?   - He's here.

664
00:49:13,278 --> 00:49:14,366
Young Master.

665
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,966
- What's wrong?   - Please get up here right now.

666
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:20,486
- Aum, hurry up. Quick!   - Yes, Young Master.

667
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:22,047
You're too slow.

668
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,597
- Hey.   - What's this?

669
00:49:25,678 --> 00:49:27,766
Phing, what about Game and Ms. Apo?

670
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:30,846
- They're inside.   - How could you leave them alone?

671
00:49:30,981 --> 00:49:33,246
I was going to find you. Why are you so slow?

672
00:49:33,326 --> 00:49:35,086
I'm here. Tell me what happened.

673
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,686
You know about Game, right?

674
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,920
Yes.

675
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:39,646
From the look of him,

676
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,726
I think he wants to make up with Po.

677
00:49:41,807 --> 00:49:43,326
I knew it.

678
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:48,526
He'll never even get to touch Apo's elbows.

679
00:49:48,677 --> 00:49:49,806
Mueang.

680
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:52,006
You and I have to stop fighting for a day.

681
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:55,810
We have to work together to chase Game away for now.

682
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:59,166
Okay. Why didn't Apo just chase him away?

683
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:01,926
Are you sure you really know Po?

684
00:50:02,037 --> 00:50:04,926
She's quick to feel sympathy for others.

685
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:06,853
Even if someone stabbed her with a knife,

686
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:08,246
if they're dying,

687
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:10,246
she'll help them anyway.

688
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,366
If you don't want her sympathy to develop further,

689
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:16,086
all three of us have to work together.

690
00:50:17,325 --> 00:50:19,086
Okay. I'm in.

691
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:21,149
- I'm in.   - Let's go.

692
00:50:21,775 --> 00:50:25,926
Here we are. I know you like spicy and sour salad.

693
00:50:26,406 --> 00:50:29,966
I was afraid it might not taste good, so I'll cook it for you right now.

694
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:33,765
Does Apo like spicy and sour salad?

695
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:36,206
I haven't seen her had one before.

696
00:50:36,606 --> 00:50:40,606
He's trying to bring back the memory with that.

697
00:50:41,653 --> 00:50:45,006
Game, take them all away, and please go home.

698
00:50:45,446 --> 00:50:46,686
I won't go.

699
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:49,566
Let me do something to repay you.

700
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:52,166
If not, I don't think I can die peacefully.

701
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,646
Game.

702
00:50:54,806 --> 00:50:56,966
I don't want to know

703
00:50:57,062 --> 00:50:58,286
if you'll die peacefully or not.

704
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,926
I don't care.

705
00:51:00,142 --> 00:51:03,286
But I already bought them. Just let me cook it for you.

706
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,606
Just leave the ingredients here.

707
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:08,126
As for you, you should go back.

708
00:51:08,264 --> 00:51:11,286
I already lost my appetite from seeing your face.

709
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:13,246
You don't want to see my face that much?

710
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,526
Yes.

711
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,886
Okay.

712
00:51:20,934 --> 00:51:22,254
Today,

713
00:51:25,807 --> 00:51:27,606
I'll cook something as well.

714
00:51:31,908 --> 00:51:33,173
I also want to know

715
00:51:33,326 --> 00:51:34,846
which one Apo likes better.

716
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:36,206
Mueang.

717
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:40,326
If you lose, you'll leave and rot away in your house.

718
00:51:40,622 --> 00:51:43,406
And don't appear in front of Apo ever again.

719
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:46,086
Fine.

720
00:51:46,613 --> 00:51:48,126
I accept your challenge.

721
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:53,006
What's wrong with them?

722
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:02,046
Phing.

723
00:52:02,526 --> 00:52:04,766
You did something to Mueang, right?

724
00:52:04,934 --> 00:52:06,126
Calm down.

725
00:52:06,262 --> 00:52:07,566
You should just stay still.

726
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:10,246
Let both men fight each other.

727
00:52:12,878 --> 00:52:14,030
Don't stop them.

728
00:52:14,111 --> 00:52:17,006
Listen, don't you want to pay back Game at all?

729
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:20,846
Don't you want to crush his pride with our own hands?

730
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:22,446
See? Right?

731
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,486
(You have to think of that day.)

732
00:52:27,717 --> 00:52:30,046
(The taste that Apo liked.)

733
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:38,134
(I can only use premium ingredients.)

734
00:52:41,974 --> 00:52:43,126
Hello.

735
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:48,126
Lobster.

736
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:49,526
Do you know it?

737
00:52:51,566 --> 00:52:52,686
Don't you think it's too much?

738
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:54,006
I can do it.

739
00:52:54,142 --> 00:52:55,246
Hello.

740
00:52:58,406 --> 00:53:00,566
Taraba King Crab.

741
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:02,006
Are you trying to compete?

742
00:53:03,038 --> 00:53:04,446
Well, that's my forte.

743
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:13,846
- Mueang, do your best.   - Get him, Young Master.

744
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:40,006
Good job, Young Master. Like that, Young Master.

745
00:53:56,013 --> 00:53:58,206
When two people who like to be exaggerated meet each other...

746
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,766
We won't know

747
00:53:59,877 --> 00:54:01,206
where it's going to end.

748
00:54:02,278 --> 00:54:04,278
Let everyone try it.

749
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,006
Come on.

750
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:10,086
- Let's go.   - Let's go.

751
00:54:12,694 --> 00:54:15,606
- Please come here.   - Vote for number two if you like mine.

752
00:54:15,687 --> 00:54:17,501
- Lobster spicy salad.   - Taraba crab.

753
00:54:17,582 --> 00:54:19,486
Don't forget to vote for number two. Vote for Game.

754
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,886
- If you like this one, please vote for number one.   - Taraba crab.

755
00:54:22,974 --> 00:54:25,726
- Please make way.   - Vote for number one.

756
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,406
- Come here.   - Wow.

757
00:54:27,526 --> 00:54:30,006
I like men who sell spicy and sour salad.

758
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:32,246
Did Young Master open an almshouse or what?

759
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,646
Are there any important events today?

760
00:54:34,923 --> 00:54:36,198
They told us to try their food.

761
00:54:36,326 --> 00:54:37,526
Don't forget to vote.

762
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,166
- Okay.   - Okay.

763
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:40,966
- Let's go to Young Master first.   - Sure.

764
00:54:41,047 --> 00:54:42,646
I'd like to jump the queue.

765
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:45,048
- Take it.   - Vote for number two if you like mine.

766
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:47,867
- Here you are. Don't forget, it's number two.   - Delicious.

767
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:52,086
Hey, Poe, Son. This way.

768
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,206
- Young Master, I'll definitely vote for number one.   - Two!

769
00:54:55,357 --> 00:54:58,446
- Aum, you have to record it for me.   - Phing, what should we do?

770
00:54:58,542 --> 00:55:00,366
This is almost a festival now...

771
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:01,606
Hang on. I have to do my job.

772
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:06,457
Everyone, there are men selling spicy and sour salad behind me.

773
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:08,726
We'll see what is spicier here...

774
00:55:08,837 --> 00:55:12,926
- The shrimp is as big as this. Look.   - Vote for number two.

775
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:14,486
- Wow.   - Oh my.

776
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:16,766
- Come here.   - The Taraba crabs are as big as my face.

777
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:18,886
I'm so done.

778
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:22,766
There's a macho man on your left side...

779
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,126
Young Master, Ms. Apo has disappeared.

780
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:28,806
I think we overdid it.

781
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:31,686
Apo is probably annoyed. She doesn't like chaos.

782
00:55:32,613 --> 00:55:34,846
So, who's the winner here?

783
00:55:35,783 --> 00:55:36,846
Let me check.

784
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:38,355
- How is it?   - Hold on.

785
00:55:38,462 --> 00:55:39,686
The website is down?

786
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,286
It's down?

787
00:55:44,744 --> 00:55:47,126
Nothing. This is all for nothing.

788
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,526
A waste of time.

789
00:55:48,766 --> 00:55:49,966
Why did you challenge me?

790
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:52,846
Hey, it takes two to tango.

791
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:56,786
If you ask me which one is more delicious,

792
00:55:56,868 --> 00:55:58,846
I'll say Mueang's one is more delicious.

793
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:01,526
See?

794
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:04,406
Yes. Yours is really bad, Game.

795
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,926
How could you say that?

796
00:56:07,007 --> 00:56:08,606
- It's not good.   - Yes.

797
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:14,326
Oh, Po's here.

798
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,926
Mueang, come here.

799
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:33,206
Mueang.

800
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:35,606
Why did you have to compete with Game?

801
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:39,246
I want to prove and see who's better.

802
00:56:39,781 --> 00:56:41,366
And so what?

803
00:56:41,612 --> 00:56:42,814
So that he'll be ashamed

804
00:56:42,895 --> 00:56:45,606
and won't bother you again.

805
00:56:45,766 --> 00:56:47,126
Didn't you want that?

806
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,966
Can I be honest with you?

807
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,446
Don't do this again.

808
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:57,046
I don't like it.

809
00:57:03,446 --> 00:57:05,366
(Don't do this again. I don't like it.)

810
00:57:05,447 --> 00:57:09,386
(Don't do this again. I don't like it.)

811
00:57:24,046 --> 00:57:25,326
It's your turn now.

812
00:57:34,453 --> 00:57:36,526
What about the two of us?

813
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:38,486
We might get called by her too.

814
00:57:38,718 --> 00:57:40,100
We should leave.

815
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:42,126
Hey, be careful.

816
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:47,126
Game, from now on, don't come to see me again.

817
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,667
Po, please listen to me.

818
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:52,926
I know you're still mad at me,

819
00:57:53,502 --> 00:57:55,606
but I really feel guilty for you.

820
00:57:56,718 --> 00:57:58,646
I don't want to know

821
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,246
if you feel guilty.

822
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:02,766
I...

823
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:06,246
I just want to be your friend.

824
00:58:07,997 --> 00:58:09,246
Friend?

825
00:58:09,668 --> 00:58:13,446
Are you afraid it won't look good because you already have a husband?

826
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,406
It's not related to that.

827
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:20,446
Mr. Phudin and I don't have that deep of a relationship.

828
00:58:20,661 --> 00:58:23,326
I only marry him to pay off my debt with certain conditions.

829
00:58:23,454 --> 00:58:25,126
Everything is already over.

830
00:58:25,597 --> 00:58:27,246
So, right now,

831
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,686
you're single?

832
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,846
I really made a mistake

833
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,406
by helping you because I pitied you.

834
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,446
Leave!

835
00:59:09,277 --> 00:59:10,566
You got told off, didn't you?

836
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:12,366
Serve you right.

837
00:59:18,629 --> 00:59:19,726
Can I ask you something?

838
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:21,606
Apo and Mr. Phudin

839
00:59:22,213 --> 00:59:23,566
don't have a relationship anymore?

840
00:59:25,102 --> 00:59:26,326
Why do you want to know?

841
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,646
I'm just curious.

842
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,326
No.

843
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:33,566
They've never had anything.

844
00:59:38,029 --> 00:59:39,126
What are you happy for?

845
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:41,406
It means I still have a chance.

846
00:59:42,062 --> 00:59:43,246
What chance?

847
00:59:43,886 --> 00:59:45,946
A chance for me to make up with Apo.

848
00:59:47,422 --> 00:59:48,886
Don't think about it.

849
00:59:49,806 --> 00:59:51,126
Why can't I think about it?

850
00:59:51,366 --> 00:59:52,446
You know,

851
00:59:52,606 --> 00:59:55,206
Apo is still the same.

852
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:57,686
Her personality, her manners.

853
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:01,086
She's still the same as the first day I met her.

854
01:00:01,549 --> 01:00:03,406
I'm the one who has changed.

855
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:05,766
No matter how much I've changed,

856
01:00:06,046 --> 01:00:07,766
she's still the same person.

857
01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:11,326
The person that I always see when I turn back.

858
01:00:13,886 --> 01:00:16,166
We used to be each other's happiness.

859
01:00:16,823 --> 01:00:18,286
She can't forget me.

860
01:00:18,686 --> 01:00:20,446
I really came back at the right time.

861
01:00:22,294 --> 01:00:24,286
(We used to be each other's happiness.)

862
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,662
(We used to be each other's happiness.)

863
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,726
(We used to be each other's happiness.)

864
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:31,446
(We used to be each other's happiness.)

865
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,446
(We used to be each other's happiness.)

866
01:00:41,182 --> 01:00:42,342
You...

867
01:00:43,661 --> 01:00:44,886
How dare you?

868
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:47,166
Each other's happiness?

869
01:00:47,445 --> 01:00:48,726
Don't you know

870
01:00:48,807 --> 01:00:51,046
that you're the one who made Apo afraid of happiness?

871
01:00:51,283 --> 01:00:54,126
How could you dare come back to rob her happiness away?

872
01:00:55,414 --> 01:00:56,766
What a selfish man.

873
01:00:56,997 --> 01:00:58,686
You're not worthy of her.

874
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:01,126
What's with you?

875
01:01:01,246 --> 01:01:02,606
You're being nosy again.

876
01:01:02,885 --> 01:01:05,366
What's your relationship with her? Why are you mad on her behalf?

877
01:01:06,286 --> 01:01:08,006
Tell me. What are you?

878
01:01:08,286 --> 01:01:11,606
You're just an outsider. Don't get nosy.

879
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:22,341
Don't touch Mueang.

880
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:28,846
I was being patient with you.

881
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:31,286
But my patience

882
01:01:31,566 --> 01:01:33,446
has finally reached its limit.

883
01:01:39,206 --> 01:01:40,446
Po, calm down.

884
01:01:41,286 --> 01:01:42,686
He was looking for a fight first.

885
01:01:42,926 --> 01:01:44,406
I heard everything.

886
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,486
Don't think about it.

887
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:48,566
Why can't I think about it?

888
01:01:48,846 --> 01:01:52,286
You know, Apo is still the same.

889
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:54,606
Her personality, her manners.

890
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:58,046
She's still the same as the first day I met her.

891
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:00,486
I'm the one who has changed.

892
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:02,686
No matter how much I've changed,

893
01:02:02,982 --> 01:02:07,526
she's still the same person. The person that I always see when I turn back.

894
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,846
We used to be each other's happiness.

895
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:13,966
She can't forget me.

896
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,559
I really came back at the right time.

897
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,086
Game, listen,

898
01:02:20,252 --> 01:02:22,846
I've never liked to have the spicy and sour salad. Never.

899
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:27,566
Didn't you say you liked to have my spicy and sour salad?

900
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:28,966
I said that

901
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,886
because it was the only meal you've ever cooked for me.

902
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:35,966
Honestly, the taste was just so bad.

903
01:02:36,149 --> 01:02:37,246
When you said

904
01:02:37,406 --> 01:02:39,526
you always saw me when you turned back,

905
01:02:39,638 --> 01:02:40,846
have you thought about it?

906
01:02:40,927 --> 01:02:42,966
It means you always left me behind.

907
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:44,566
Whenever I needed you,

908
01:02:44,647 --> 01:02:46,966
you've never been there for me.

909
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:49,246
But for Mueang,

910
01:02:51,597 --> 01:02:53,989
he's always been there for me.

911
01:02:54,902 --> 01:02:58,406
So, don't think you can compare yourself to Mueang.

912
01:03:02,093 --> 01:03:03,206
You're crazy.

913
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:05,766
Why do you have to protect him?

914
01:03:06,013 --> 01:03:07,926
It's because he's my ally.

915
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:12,046
Oh?

916
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:14,806
What's him to you?

917
01:03:15,037 --> 01:03:17,166
I can't say what I am to him,

918
01:03:17,286 --> 01:03:20,366
but what I can say to you right now is thank you.

919
01:03:20,677 --> 01:03:23,326
Thank you for coming back and making me feel sure

920
01:03:23,742 --> 01:03:25,646
that I chose to like the right man.

921
01:03:32,381 --> 01:03:34,381
And remember this.

922
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:37,006
You can be rude to me,

923
01:03:42,934 --> 01:03:45,406
but you can't be rude to Mueang.

924
01:04:32,806 --> 01:04:34,246
Game has left.

925
01:04:40,966 --> 01:04:42,126
What?

926
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:52,366
Since I was born, I've never felt so small before.

927
01:04:55,478 --> 01:04:56,838
You were so cool.

928
01:04:58,326 --> 01:04:59,526
How was I cool?

929
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:01,966
Everything.

930
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:05,166
I thought I would record it, but it's too late.

931
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:07,566
Thank goodness for that.

932
01:05:08,366 --> 01:05:09,726
Was that your final form?

933
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:13,806
It can't be compared to yours, though.

934
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,726
You're really narcissistic.

935
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:20,566
Me?

936
01:05:20,647 --> 01:05:21,806
Yes.

937
01:05:21,926 --> 01:05:25,046
You praised yourself for hours yesterday.

938
01:05:27,446 --> 01:05:28,446
Well...

939
01:05:29,189 --> 01:05:31,629
I thought you'd fall for my charm yesterday.

940
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:36,086
I did that

941
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,966
because I wanted you to pay attention to only me.

942
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:42,209
I didn't want you to pay attention to your ex.

943
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:49,806
Are you jealous?

944
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:53,486
Are you jealous?

945
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,326
Yes.

946
01:06:05,277 --> 01:06:06,646
Don't you trust me?

947
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:08,126
I trust you,

948
01:06:08,294 --> 01:06:09,926
but I don't trust him.

949
01:06:11,366 --> 01:06:13,006
If you trust me,

950
01:06:13,245 --> 01:06:15,086
you have to let me handle it.

951
01:06:16,259 --> 01:06:18,086
It seemed like you couldn't handle it.

952
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:20,046
You're the one who couldn't handle it.

953
01:06:20,237 --> 01:06:24,006
If you hadn't challenged him, he would have left earlier.

954
01:06:24,126 --> 01:06:26,186
- Really?   - Yes.

955
01:06:27,326 --> 01:06:29,726
I'll never let him take advantage of me again.

956
01:06:31,664 --> 01:06:34,406
I'm afraid you'd feel bad for him again.

957
01:06:36,206 --> 01:06:38,486
No one can be the same forever.

958
01:06:38,974 --> 01:06:40,246
Today,

959
01:06:40,854 --> 01:06:42,326
I think I've grown.

960
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:46,166
I'll keep my sympathy for only people who deserve it.

961
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,926
Apo, you're so cool.

962
01:07:37,565 --> 01:07:40,926
You can't leave this disease alone. How do you want me to help you?

963
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:42,766
Let's go to the hospital.

964
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,606
Po, please help me.

965
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:46,006
What's wrong, Om?

966
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:51,006
Go back. Go back to live your happy life in that house.

967
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,606
I'll go back, Aunt Da,

968
01:07:52,782 --> 01:07:54,606
after we talk about this.

969
01:07:54,782 --> 01:07:58,246
- No.   - Mom, don't do this.

970
01:07:58,327 --> 01:07:59,413
I'm in,

971
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:01,069
but there's a little trouble.

972
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:04,046
This is getting fun.

973
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:07,286
I'm not a representative or agent of anyone.

974
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:12,046
I'm only using my talents for Mr. Phudin, who has hired me.

975
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:13,726
Someone must have sent Game here.

976
01:08:13,807 --> 01:08:14,992
I think so.

977
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:16,366
Should we get him?
