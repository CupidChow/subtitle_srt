1
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:03,766
Since you're working here now, let's have a competition.

2
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:04,893
Are you challenging me?

3
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:07,366
(I challenged him to see who's better at doing their jobs,)

4
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:10,966
(but he decided to challenge me at every turn instead.)

5
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:13,006
Don't you have anything else to do?

6
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:14,366
I'm praying for your downfall.

7
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:16,166
Waiting for somebody to be fired.

8
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:24,006
(You've got skills. So, why don't you work to pay off your debt?)

9
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,320
Why did you get married to pay it off?

10
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:27,446
I think if we try to accept each other,

11
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,126
it'll be better.

12
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:31,086
I don't know her at all.

13
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:33,886
You should get to know her once again then.

14
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:37,766
(If Mueang knows that I've dug up a lot of information on him,)

15
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:40,046
(will he be scared of me?)

16
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:59,366
(Detective Piti, he's good.)

17
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,806
(Personal History)

18
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:18,526
(Personal History)

19
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:33,726
Okay. I'll check the place out while I wait.

20
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:36,286
You can tell me when you're ready.

21
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:41,646
I have to go now, Mr. Phudin.

22
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:46,429
Get him some rest.

23
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,206
Be a good stepmother.

24
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:54,046
Let's go.

25
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,486
Have you been busy, Young Master? You haven't seen Kaykay in a while.

26
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:02,166
I've been quite busy.

27
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,046
You can go now.

28
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:05,206
Yes, sir.

29
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:06,966
Mueang.

30
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,086
What are you doing here?

31
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:13,086
I won't tell you.

32
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:15,566
On a date with Tin?

33
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:17,086
How did you know?

34
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,926
You like to hang out with him.

35
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:21,846
Don't act like you know me.

36
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,606
See? You're doing that again.

37
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:28,046
Doing what?

38
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:29,846
You rubbed your eyebrow.

39
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,606
Don't you realize you often do that?

40
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:39,926
It was itching.

41
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:43,646
No, I think it means something.

42
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,846
I'm trying to figure it out.

43
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:48,046
Why would you?

44
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,086
I'm trying to get to know you.

45
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:56,046
Don't you want to try to get to know me?

46
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,846
No. You're too complicated.

47
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:04,046
I can't deny that.

48
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:09,126
Look, rather than spending the time to get to know me,

49
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,006
you should get to know my dad instead.

50
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:12,886
Or you might make another mistake.

51
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:15,766
What do you mean I made a mistake?

52
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,486
Well, it's nothing specific.

53
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:21,486
I'm just worried my dad would trick you.

54
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,126
My dad is not the good man he appears to be.

55
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:30,126
Are you saying your dad is not a good "fiancé?"

56
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,006
I'll let you know something.

57
00:05:34,142 --> 00:05:37,686
Nobody in this world is worse than my ex.

58
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:49,526
This is bad, guys.

59
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:52,166
Mrs. Sita!

60
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:54,766
- What is it?   - My zodiac sign,

61
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:56,206
your zodiac sign,

62
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:59,046
Din's zodiac sign, and also Mueang's

63
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:01,806
would encounter a big disaster.

64
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:03,566
Here.

65
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:08,715
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

66
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:11,326
They're cursing nearly all the zodiac signs.

67
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:13,166
Do you believe this?

68
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,326
I do.

69
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:16,886
This one has been spot on!

70
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:19,246
What do you think

71
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:21,166
we're going to encounter?

72
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:23,366
A meteor crashing down on Earth?

73
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,046
Be serious, please, Mrs. Sita.

74
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:29,126
Maybe chaos is upon us here.

75
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:33,074
What chaos now?

76
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:37,006
It's bad enough that Apo came in.

77
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:38,686
Perhaps

78
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:41,526
another secret character will show up.

79
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,077
A secret character?

80
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,206
Who is it?

81
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:49,980
Spoil me.

82
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,486
I don't know.

83
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:57,205
Mrs. Sita, a spoiler, please.

84
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:58,446
- No.   - Please.

85
00:06:58,527 --> 00:06:59,766
No.

86
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:02,886
Good morning.

87
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,646
We're here to see Mr. Phudin.

88
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:17,686
It's you, Ing.

89
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,767
I almost didn't recognize you.

90
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,366
(Who the heck is this old hag?)

91
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:23,046
(Why does she know me?)

92
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:29,246
I get it. I have trouble remembering faces too.

93
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:33,526
Please tell your parents I said hi.

94
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:34,812
Okay.

95
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:36,966
So

96
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,406
who is that?

97
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:39,766
Your boyfriend?

98
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,726
No.

99
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:43,566
He's my employee.

100
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:48,406
I'm a gemologist.

101
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:51,326
Gemologist?

102
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:55,686
We're here on time. Can we go straight in?

103
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,786
Not yet. Mr. Phudin is in a meeting. He'll be ready in half an hour.

104
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,766
Half an hour?

105
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,606
We apologize for your inconvenience.

106
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:11,246
Should we check out the place while we wait?

107
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,686
I think you should look around outside.

108
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:19,686
Take some photos with cute animals and flowers.

109
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,566
Okay.

110
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,357
When Din is ready,

111
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,486
Mrs. Sita will call you, okay?

112
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,366
Okay. Thanks.

113
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,286
She's still arrogant, like she was as a kid.

114
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:40,086
Right?

115
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:42,227
No comment.

116
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,126
Mrs. Sita.

117
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,686
Come on, Ms. Ing.

118
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:53,846
- Don't get upset.   - He knows I don't like to wait.

119
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:55,886
Don't think of it as waiting.

120
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,741
Think of it as our date.

121
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:02,726
Is it far away?

122
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:06,406
The entrance is probably that way.

123
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:07,886
Let's go.

124
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,326
- I'm not going.   - Why not?

125
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:17,286
It's hot. Just get me an iced lemon tea. Be quick.

126
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:26,846
What was her childhood like?

127
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,886
She's so hard to please.

128
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:36,926
Why does it keep twitching?

129
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,606
- Here.   - Thank you.

130
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:07,206
Hey, I think I'm seeing things.

131
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,166
When I parked, I saw

132
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:12,846
that trash-talking woman

133
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:14,326
at your dad's office.

134
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,086
How can that be?

135
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:33,606
Is our world that small?

136
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,526
You weren't listening.

137
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,366
Sorry.

138
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:41,926
When you talk,

139
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:43,766
I always listen.

140
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,246
Come on. I said sorry.

141
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:49,166
What's on your mind?

142
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:54,526
I'm just thinking that the world makes no sense.

143
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:56,806
Some people only get good things.

144
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:59,446
Others only get bad things.

145
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,286
That's just how it is.

146
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:03,166
There's nothing we can control.

147
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:04,557
There!

148
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:07,646
God up there is controlling everything.

149
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,886
(Sometimes, I wonder)

150
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,046
(if we're in a reality show)

151
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,206
(or a video game where someone is controlling us.)

152
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:21,126
Wait and see

153
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:23,006
what God has in store for you.

154
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:42,166
(Personal History)

155
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:48,726
(Game used to date Apo.)

156
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:52,646
(They used to show their relationship on Facebook three years ago.)

157
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,206
(Game has just shown his profile as "single" recently.)

158
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,806
(According to those close to Game,)

159
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:03,606
(he has other women throughout his three years with Apo.)

160
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:05,806
(He also has a rich widow sugar mommy.)

161
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,406
(Her name is Lady Keerati,)

162
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:09,326
(a prominent person in jewelry.)

163
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,406
(Lady Keerati has always been supporting Game financially.)

164
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:16,446
(Apo never knew about any of this.)

165
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:22,606
(Personal History)

166
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,446
(That's right.)

167
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:45,286
(Sometimes, God brings those we hate)

168
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:46,846
(back into our lives.)

169
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,126
I'll let you know something.

170
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:52,886
Nobody in this world is worse than my ex.

171
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:56,486
Is your ex that bad?

172
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:01,566
What do you think is one of the reasons I ran away to the beach?

173
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,686
Since we've opened up a bit,

174
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,390
I'll tell you in short.

175
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:13,886
I saw him in bed with another woman.

176
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,366
(That's why I left his life that day.)

177
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,846
(If possible, I don't want to see him ever again.)

178
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,526
(I didn't know what made me walk up to her.)

179
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:42,206
(I just felt that if I could change the world,)

180
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:43,926
(it would be great.)

181
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,606
Whoa! Watch where you're going!

182
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:52,926
Sorry.

183
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:55,486
It's crowded here. Let's talk somewhere else.

184
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:03,566
What are you doing?

185
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:18,126
(I did it.)

186
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:21,086
(I can't believe I've changed this!)

187
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,326
(I really can turn this around.)

188
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:28,566
What the heck are you doing?

189
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,206
What the heck did you do?

190
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:33,046
- Do you want to fight?   - Let's do one-on-one!

191
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:35,166
- Are you high?   - Game!

192
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:36,606
Game!

193
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,326
Where have you been?

194
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,406
Sorry, Ms. Ing.

195
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,246
This guy picked a fight with me.

196
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,446
Where is my drink?

197
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:50,646
I spilled it.

198
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,246
This is for your drink. Don't ever step foot here again.

199
00:14:58,686 --> 00:15:01,126
No! It's not worth it.

200
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,646
Yes, ma'am.

201
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:05,326
Game?

202
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:07,766
Apo?

203
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:19,006
(At that moment,)

204
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,966
(I realized I couldn't change anything at all.)

205
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:29,669
It's you?

206
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:34,846
It's you?

207
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:44,366
(If God really exists,)

208
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:48,509
(I'd like to ask)

209
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:52,606
(what more you have in store for me.)

210
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,286
Are you here for a trip?

211
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,326
What a coincidence.

212
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:05,166
Yeah. What a coincidence.

213
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:11,166
Sorry.

214
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:18,126
Happy anni...

215
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,926
So, are you dating that woman?

216
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:31,125
I'm not asking because I felt anything.

217
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:34,006
I just wanted to make sure I was right to break up with you.

218
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:36,166
I'm happy you can move on.

219
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,606
Me too.

220
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,526
I thought it would be harder.

221
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,446
Maybe because you got someone else, I got over you so easily.

222
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,846
You're over me. That's good.

223
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:49,429
I think you look well.

224
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:52,486
I've been well. Really well.

225
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,566
So we parted on good terms, right?

226
00:16:56,061 --> 00:17:00,766
Wait. Who said that? Who parted on good terms? Have you lost your mind?

227
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:03,926
If you hate me that much, the next time you see me,

228
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:06,027
don't even say hi. Pretend I don't exist.

229
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,926
- Just walk past by.   - Okay. Fine. I will do that. Like we never met.

230
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,086
Good. That's it.

231
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,886
I'm sorry, okay?

232
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:21,766
I'm sorry for making you feel bad.

233
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,126
I have to go now.

234
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:25,006
The owner of this place is expecting me.

235
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:27,486
Wait.

236
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:30,086
The owner of this place? Who are you talking about?

237
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,286
Is she not picking up?

238
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:39,966
No. Ms. Ing won't pick up.

239
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:43,046
I think she's busy taking photos.

240
00:17:45,684 --> 00:17:46,969
That's what you would do.

241
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:50,046
I wasn't talking about myself.

242
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:53,766
You know what? Take her to the lounge when she gets here.

243
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:55,806
Yes, sir.

244
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:03,446
I think she's taking photos for her Instagram.

245
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,086
I really think so.

246
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:11,166
I told her to do that.

247
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,006
So, where have we met?

248
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:24,806
The parking lot.

249
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:26,726
You tripped and bumped into me.

250
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:28,366
I don't remember.

251
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,646
Don't play dumb.

252
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:34,606
I'm not. I meet a lot of people. Do you expect me to recognize them all?

253
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:36,886
You really don't remember my face?

254
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,886
- I don't.   - I don't believe you.

255
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:42,926
I'm not asking you to believe me.

256
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,366
Who are you? Why do I need to recognize you?

257
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:48,126
I'm telling you right now. I'm your victim.

258
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:51,286
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ms. Ing.

259
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:55,726
Do you recognize this man?

260
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,646
I don't.

261
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:03,646
Is my face that forgettable?

262
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:06,926
He said he met me at a parking lot.

263
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,406
Where?

264
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,926
So it's you.

265
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:13,326
That's better.

266
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,566
The guy who made your high heels dirty.

267
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:19,901
It's you!

268
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,606
Wait.

269
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:27,086
You got it all wrong. You bumped into me. That's what you should remember,

270
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,966
not that I ruined your shoes.

271
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:32,566
What a waste of time. Let's go.

272
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,046
Hey! Are you really going to just leave?

273
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:40,726
Seriously?

274
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,406
Is he following us?

275
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:51,046
He's not.

276
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:54,246
My mom said the world gets smaller as you get older.

277
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,966
Am I really getting old?

278
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:59,166
How can you be old? You're too gorgeous.

279
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:01,086
Don't flatter me.

280
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:03,926
You are gorgeous.

281
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:08,686
It's good you don't recognize that guy.

282
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:10,486
It's a waste of your memory.

283
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:12,966
Who said I don't recognize him?

284
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:16,286
How could I forget him? He pointed at my face and called me names.

285
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:18,206
How have you survived?

286
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:25,126
So that was...

287
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:27,766
Yes. I was acting.

288
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:30,366
I don't want to deal with him. He's annoying.

289
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:33,566
You sure can act.

290
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:35,286
You deserve an Oscar.

291
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:39,446
Can we please move on from this?

292
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:41,406
Okay, ma'am.

293
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:43,406
How was it with your ex?

294
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:46,149
Well, it was nothing.

295
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,486
It's just a coincidence. I don't think I'd see her again.

296
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:50,086
Okay.

297
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:10,606
(Mr. Phudin)

298
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:17,566
The owner? Do you mean Mr. Phudin?

299
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:18,686
That's him.

300
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,458
Do you know him?

301
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:25,446
I read his interview somewhere.

302
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:28,870
I have to go. I have some work to do.

303
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,094
(Mr. Phudin)

304
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,486
(Where are you? Why are you not picking up?)

305
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,286
(The people I'd like you to meet are here waiting for us.)

306
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:54,477
Hi.

307
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:57,566
Are you done talking to him?

308
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:04,566
Who's that man?

309
00:22:05,094 --> 00:22:07,446
Why did you ask? You already knew.

310
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:09,846
Why would I know?

311
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,246
Well, you warned me.

312
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,880
Look, rather than spending the time to get to know me,

313
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:20,590
you should get to know my dad instead.

314
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:22,006
Or you might make another mistake.

315
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:24,926
What do you mean I made a mistake?

316
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:27,686
Well, it's nothing specific.

317
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,510
I'm just worried my dad would trick you.

318
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:33,926
My dad is not the good man he appears to be.

319
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:35,966
I figured you had

320
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,446
dug up about my ex.

321
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:43,406
Are you mad? Who would have time to spy on you?

322
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:46,366
You would!

323
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:49,246
You were stalking me just now.

324
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:02,686
I saw you.

325
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:08,366
I saw him looking suspicious, so I followed him.

326
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:09,846
I didn't know who he was.

327
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:13,366
Anyway, that's him,

328
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:15,206
the ex I told you about.

329
00:23:15,406 --> 00:23:17,606
Oh! So it's this guy?

330
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,646
He shows up right when you talk about him.

331
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,246
Do you think this is the afterlife?

332
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:26,566
What?

333
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:28,566
Where are you coming from?

334
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:30,566
Maybe I'm dead,

335
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,766
and this is hell.

336
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:36,166
Yeah. This is hell.

337
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:37,886
If not, how would Game and his new girl

338
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:39,766
meet Mr. Phudin?

339
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:41,157
Wait.

340
00:23:41,693 --> 00:23:42,966
What does this have to do with my dad?

341
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,486
You know what?

342
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:47,846
Mr. Phudin wants me to meet his friend's daughter.

343
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:50,726
She's taking over her family's jewelry business.

344
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:52,926
It seems his friend's daughter

345
00:23:53,046 --> 00:23:54,846
is Game's new girlfriend.

346
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,166
What? Are you serious?

347
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,086
I am.

348
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,766
Does my old man know about your ex?

349
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:09,286
Mr. Phudin wants me to meet Game and his new girlfriend now.

350
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:13,326
I don't want to go.

351
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,766
Mueang, what should I do?

352
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:18,126
What should you do?

353
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:20,566
Wait a sec. Let me think.

354
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:24,086
We have to figure out if you go and if you don't,

355
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,246
what's going to happen, both good and bad.

356
00:24:26,574 --> 00:24:28,726
If we figured that out, we'd know what to do.

357
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,181
Mueang.

358
00:24:34,554 --> 00:24:37,886
Sorry. I shouldn't ask for your advice about this.

359
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:40,766
I'll figure this out myself.

360
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:44,846
Hey, wait.

361
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:54,807
(Bike For Rent)

362
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,126
Get on.

363
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:09,846
Get on.

364
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,446
- Where are you going?   - Come on. Just get on.

365
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:13,966
Okay.

366
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,646
- Ready?   - Never.

367
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:20,086
Let's go.

368
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:24,461
Mueang, where are you taking me?

369
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:26,126
I won't tell you.

370
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,086
Where are you taking me?

371
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:31,166
To my old man.

372
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:34,326
No, I'm not going. Stop!

373
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:35,606
I won't!

374
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:38,366
I don't want to go, Mueang.

375
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:42,486
Why? Are you embarrassed your new boyfriend is old?

376
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:45,446
You said it was your life choice. Why would you be embarrassed?

377
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:48,726
The one who should be embarrassed is your ex.

378
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,246
Let's show him

379
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:53,246
how much your life is better than when you were with him!

380
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,286
Look, although my dad is not as nice and handsome as I am,

381
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:01,206
I'm confident he is at least richer than that guy.

382
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,206
Show him who's boss!

383
00:26:43,237 --> 00:26:45,326
Now, let's go!

384
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,446
It's odd.

385
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:01,926
It's really odd.

386
00:27:02,277 --> 00:27:03,406
How is it odd?

387
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:06,326
She texted me at 2.13 pm.

388
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:09,006
I replied at 2.14 pm, but she hadn't read it.

389
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,486
She won't pick up my calls.

390
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:13,326
It looks like

391
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:16,446
she just died right there while texting you.

392
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,366
Are you saying my girlfriend was in an accident?

393
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:23,246
No, Uncle. I think she just doesn't want to meet me.

394
00:27:24,221 --> 00:27:25,566
Why would you say that?

395
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,126
I just sense it.

396
00:27:29,142 --> 00:27:32,206
I don't think so. I think she has something to do.

397
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:34,502
Let's talk about our business at hand.

398
00:27:34,717 --> 00:27:37,006
Why do you want to see me, Ing?

399
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:43,246
I need you to mine Siamese ruby for me, Uncle.

400
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,566
I have to refuse.

401
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:52,446
Why not? Did someone take my deal?

402
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:55,766
No. You're still the priority deal.

403
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:58,047
It's just that our mines

404
00:27:58,128 --> 00:28:00,695
only contain small pieces of Siamese ruby.

405
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,686
We haven't seen a big piece in a long time.

406
00:28:04,206 --> 00:28:06,286
Just because you haven't seen one doesn't mean it's not there.

407
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:10,206
Maybe you haven't been mining in the right places.

408
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,733
Your name is Game, right?

409
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:14,086
Yes, sir.

410
00:28:16,086 --> 00:28:20,206
A few months ago, a foreigner sat here.

411
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,886
He said the same thing you said.

412
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,766
Let me give you the very same answer.

413
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,606
I have been in the mining business for over 30 years.

414
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:34,886
Nobody knows these mines as well as I do.

415
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:39,246
I'm not saying I know better than you do, sir.

416
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:42,806
I'm just commenting based on my experience.

417
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:45,926
I'm sorry if I offended you.

418
00:28:46,646 --> 00:28:49,646
It's fine. You can share your opinions.

419
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:52,046
But it's up to you if you would listen, right?

420
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:55,006
That's right. You do know me well, Ing.

421
00:28:56,686 --> 00:29:00,206
You really won't mine for me, Uncle?

422
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,726
Ing, I'm sorry.

423
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:07,246
Okay. If you change your mind, just call me.

424
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,166
I won't.

425
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:12,686
Who knows? I might be able to change your mind.

426
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:16,086
It's fine. I'll just leave for now.

427
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:17,646
- Goodbye.   - Goodbye.

428
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:18,926
Goodbye.

429
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:30,286
Sorry, I'm late.

430
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:39,446
Why is your hair messed up?

431
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:46,606
I rushed here on a bike. I had no time.

432
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:51,086
I forgot to introduce her.

433
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,326
This is Apo, my soon-to-be bride.

434
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:05,366
Good afternoon.

435
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,126
Yes!

436
00:30:17,428 --> 00:30:18,566
Yes!

437
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:26,890
This is Ing, my friend's daughter.

438
00:30:27,046 --> 00:30:29,446
This is Game. He works for Ing.

439
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:31,006
Good afternoon.

440
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:32,806
Good afternoon.

441
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:36,726
I'm sorry I wasn't here to welcome you guys.

442
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:40,126
I got caught up in something.

443
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,966
I ran into someone I knew in the park.

444
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,046
Really? Who was it?

445
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:50,526
My old enemy.

446
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,206
Old enemy?

447
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:59,006
I'll tell you later.

448
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:02,526
I really have to go now.

449
00:31:02,766 --> 00:31:04,166
Hey, wait, ma'am.

450
00:31:04,317 --> 00:31:06,126
Where are you going? Are you in a rush?

451
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:09,566
I have a lot of things to talk to you guys.

452
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:13,766
It's fine. We have a reservation.

453
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,406
What a shame!

454
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:19,526
Rain check, then?

455
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,406
See you, Ms. Ing.

456
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,790
And you, Mr. Game.

457
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,166
(Are you messing with me?)

458
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:28,966
(I'm dreaming. I'm surely dreaming.)

459
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:32,880
I'll walk you to your car. This way, please.

460
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:34,480
- No need.   - No need.

461
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:40,086
Excuse me.

462
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:43,966
We'll see you when we hand out the invitation.

463
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,486
Of course. I have to go now. Goodbye.

464
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,689
- Goodbye.   - Bye-bye!

465
00:31:54,784 --> 00:31:57,366
Bye!

466
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:05,486
- Ms. Ing, wait.   - Let's talk in the car!

467
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,006
I really didn't know about this!

468
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,366
I'm sorry.

469
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:28,326
You said I should act like your lover.

470
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:31,926
You don't have to try that hard.

471
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,486
You can touch me. I'm not a monk.

472
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:38,366
Your old enemy.

473
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:40,486
What's your story?

474
00:32:41,846 --> 00:32:44,006
I'll be back and tell you later.

475
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:45,526
Why? Where are you going?

476
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:47,646
I'll be back in a minute.

477
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:49,486
- I need to hurry!   - Apo.

478
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:32,766
Mueang.

479
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:42,046
How did it go?

480
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:47,086
Those two couldn't wait to leave.

481
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,326
See? I thought it would work.

482
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,206
Guys like your ex have a fragile ego.

483
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:55,966
Serves him right.

484
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:58,606
Mueang.

485
00:33:59,693 --> 00:34:01,966
What? Why do you keep saying my name?

486
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:06,406
Why did you help me?

487
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:09,086
What help?

488
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:12,566
Everything you did,

489
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:15,366
from the moment you called me onto your bike,

490
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:18,166
you gave me a pep talk, you took me here.

491
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:22,886
Who took you here? You rode that bike yourself.

492
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:26,166
Don't deny it.

493
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,126
You were obviously helping me.

494
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:31,326
I just can't stand seeing you playing the victim.

495
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:35,606
You need to show him you're fine without him.

496
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,846
That's the best revenge.

497
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:46,886
Mueang.

498
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,766
You're actually kinder than I thought.

499
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:14,406
What now?

500
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,646
Well...

501
00:35:18,757 --> 00:35:20,566
Although you don't like me,

502
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:24,726
you still feel bad for me.

503
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,526
You're really kind.

504
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:33,206
Thank you, Mueang.

505
00:36:10,764 --> 00:36:11,764
Stop!

506
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:15,606
I said stop!

507
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:17,286
Stop what?

508
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:20,166
Stop giving me that look.

509
00:36:22,086 --> 00:36:23,326
What look?

510
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:35,166
The teary, almost crying look that you don't give to just anyone.

511
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:43,646
What's that?

512
00:36:44,405 --> 00:36:46,166
- What?   - Listen.

513
00:36:47,294 --> 00:36:49,966
Stay like this. Don't turn around.

514
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,086
- Don't turn around.   - Oh?

515
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:54,646
- Mueang...   - Hey!

516
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:57,326
Like this. Don't! No!

517
00:36:58,061 --> 00:36:59,326
If you turn around,

518
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,486
I'll...

519
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:04,566
I'll...

520
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:05,846
You'll...

521
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,686
Oh, hey! Mueang!

522
00:37:16,505 --> 00:37:18,246
What's wrong with him?

523
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,446
You're really kind.

524
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:36,166
Thank you, Mueang.

525
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:39,726
(You're really kind. Thank you, Mueang.)

526
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:42,750
(You're really kind. Thank you, Mueang.)

527
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:01,566
Stop!

528
00:38:02,277 --> 00:38:03,365
Stop what?

529
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:05,886
Stop giving me that look.

530
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:07,726
What look?

531
00:38:19,943 --> 00:38:22,486
Look at you!

532
00:38:26,758 --> 00:38:30,286
You have to stop being kind to Apo,

533
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:31,726
understand?

534
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,406
Understand?

535
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:35,366
Do you understand?

536
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:40,806
Young Master! Please take a look at Tin.

537
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,902
- What's wrong?   - Tin's in a bad shape.

538
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:44,646
Quick, Young Master!

539
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:48,726
Tin, calm down!

540
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:55,806
Is he possessed?

541
00:38:57,286 --> 00:38:58,286
Hey.

542
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,566
Who are you?

543
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:02,886
Did you eat my friend?

544
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:07,566
Come on. Spit him out! Spit him out now!

545
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:11,206
It's me!

546
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:13,246
Did you just yell at me?

547
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:15,286
Why are you so fierce, Tin?

548
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,446
Hey, Tin.

549
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:20,166
You can't be fierce like this.

550
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:21,606
That's my character.

551
00:39:21,687 --> 00:39:23,566
We can't play the same role, okay?

552
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:25,486
Tin?

553
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:27,766
Please turn away from the dark side early.

554
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:29,246
I beg you.

555
00:39:29,397 --> 00:39:31,397
Dealing with Young Master is hard enough.

556
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:34,126
I can't deal with you too.

557
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:36,446
Yeah, I agree.

558
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:39,686
I don't want to feel this way. I'm mad at myself too.

559
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:42,446
Just don't let that woman control you!

560
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:45,606
I'm trying, but just seeing her face

561
00:39:45,813 --> 00:39:47,846
makes me so frustrated!

562
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:51,886
Hey! You know what? Wait a sec.

563
00:39:52,053 --> 00:39:54,526
Young Master? Where are you going, Young Master?

564
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:57,508
Here you are.

565
00:39:58,037 --> 00:39:59,366
Look at this.

566
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:02,206
Look at Lisa's MV. Keep watching it.

567
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:05,206
Look at her cute face and forget that woman's face, okay?

568
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:07,886
I'll show you how to dance.

569
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:31,046
Hey!

570
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:36,006
If I can't escape her in this life,

571
00:40:36,862 --> 00:40:39,806
please put Lisa's album in my coffin.

572
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:43,326
- Tin!   - Help him!

573
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,246
Revive him!

574
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:50,246
- For god sake!   - Tin, wake up!

575
00:40:50,566 --> 00:40:51,566
Tin, please be okay.

576
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,446
- Do it properly!   - How, Young Master?

577
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:57,526
How? Take a deep breath.

578
00:40:57,646 --> 00:41:00,326
Tin, wake up!

579
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,166
Yeah. Call me if you feel bad.

580
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,326
Stop thinking about it.

581
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:12,646
Just sleep.

582
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,726
Read these.

583
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:23,406
In the future, you will have to help in my gemstone business.

584
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:27,046
Okay. I'll start reading these tonight.

585
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:31,006
Don't rush it. It's late. Just get some rest.

586
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:33,006
I'm not tired yet.

587
00:42:34,566 --> 00:42:35,926
Go to bed.

588
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,606
Okay, sir.

589
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:59,126
- Good night.   - Good night.

590
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,486
Sleep. Stop reading Twitter.

591
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:17,676
I need to set my alarm.

592
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,246
Close your eyes.

593
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,270
Good. You're all here.

594
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:03,606
- Why did you summon us here?   - Why did you summon us here?

595
00:44:06,606 --> 00:44:08,006
What now?

596
00:44:08,662 --> 00:44:09,846
And what's this?

597
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:12,486
(Meet me at the office at 11 pm.)

598
00:44:12,614 --> 00:44:14,286
(From PD.)

599
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:18,077
Don't pull this again, Din. I got spooked.

600
00:44:18,164 --> 00:44:22,686
I opened my door and saw this with no one. It was scary.

601
00:44:23,214 --> 00:44:25,214
I thought I got haunted.

602
00:44:25,334 --> 00:44:28,686
Well, you guys sure get scared easily.

603
00:44:30,526 --> 00:44:32,566
Stop! No! Don't!

604
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:39,206
All of you get scared easily.

605
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,286
Well, let's get to business. It's almost midnight.

606
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:49,246
Tomorrow, we have an important mission.

607
00:45:22,462 --> 00:45:23,806
It's gone.

608
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:41,526
This mission can't fail, Aum.

609
00:45:41,662 --> 00:45:44,126
- Make it perfect, okay?   - Yes, sir.

610
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:48,364
Everything is step-by-step. Don't make a mistake.

611
00:45:49,702 --> 00:45:50,926
Boss.

612
00:45:51,693 --> 00:45:52,766
What's wrong?

613
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:54,486
Are you having a seizure?

614
00:45:56,729 --> 00:46:00,086
Thanks, Aum. You can go now.

615
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:04,966
Apo, what's wrong? Why the long face?

616
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:08,366
I lost something.

617
00:46:08,447 --> 00:46:10,886
You did? What did you lose? Maybe I've seen it.

618
00:46:11,517 --> 00:46:13,166
My MP3 player.

619
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,686
I always carry it with me.

620
00:46:14,774 --> 00:46:16,086
Have you seen it?

621
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,086
No. Do people still use one of those?

622
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:22,661
I think I left it in my office.

623
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:25,246
- I have to go now.   - Okay.

624
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:39,046
Sis said this place will be expanded so that we can see better views.

625
00:46:39,246 --> 00:46:41,526
- Sis, good morning.   - Good morning.

626
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:13,365
- Num, May.   - Yes?

627
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:15,246
Have you seen my MP3 player?

628
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,806
MP3?

629
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:18,886
It's small. There are white earbuds attached.

630
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,566
We've only seen this. It's a measuring tape.

631
00:47:26,373 --> 00:47:28,846
What tape? She's looking for a pair of earbuds.

632
00:47:35,006 --> 00:47:36,206
Where is it?

633
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,286
What are you doing?

634
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:09,006
Mueang.

635
00:48:09,414 --> 00:48:11,526
Have you seen my MP3 player?

636
00:48:16,422 --> 00:48:17,646
It looks like this.

637
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:21,206
Why would I have?

638
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,686
Are you still using one of those?

639
00:48:24,966 --> 00:48:27,726
I think I dropped it when you took me here yesterday.

640
00:48:29,126 --> 00:48:31,006
I told you I didn't take you here.

641
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,030
What do I do?

642
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:39,046
Is it really gone?

643
00:48:42,278 --> 00:48:44,326
Have you asked the Lost and Found booth at the park?

644
00:48:45,046 --> 00:48:46,566
I have. It's not there.

645
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,566
Just buy a new one.

646
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,806
Some things have a sentimental value.

647
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,046
Nothing can replace them.

648
00:48:55,277 --> 00:48:58,006
If you remember anything, tell me.

649
00:48:59,876 --> 00:49:01,126
Hey!

650
00:49:01,335 --> 00:49:02,806
Are you using me again?

651
00:49:03,606 --> 00:49:06,806
Don't play dumb. I'm not helping you this time.

652
00:49:16,173 --> 00:49:19,166
Did someone do something to annoy you today, Young Master?

653
00:49:19,526 --> 00:49:23,526
Number one, Boss. Or number two, Ms. Step...

654
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:25,326
Ms. Apo.

655
00:49:25,486 --> 00:49:26,566
Do you have a number three?

656
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,726
- As you wish, sir.   - Yeah, it's number three.

657
00:49:29,822 --> 00:49:31,086
Both of them.

658
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,966
You can talk to me. I won't tell anyone.

659
00:49:37,173 --> 00:49:38,526
Are they crazy?

660
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,326
They are having a huge event in this economy.

661
00:49:41,526 --> 00:49:45,446
Boss probably wants a small party before the wedding.

662
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:49,206
- You know about it?   - Of course I do.

663
00:49:49,326 --> 00:49:50,806
I've been helping Boss.

664
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:52,326
You've been helping him?

665
00:49:52,438 --> 00:49:53,846
I've been getting free meals too.

666
00:49:57,686 --> 00:50:00,686
Why did you sell yourself so easily?

667
00:50:01,054 --> 00:50:03,078
I said I would reward you,

668
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:06,046
but no one gave me a good report on Apo.

669
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:10,846
I haven't seen anything wrong from Ms. Apo, Young Master.

670
00:50:10,979 --> 00:50:13,463
Go away! Get your butt out of here!

671
00:50:14,046 --> 00:50:16,086
Wait, Young Master.

672
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:19,486
Are you coming to the party this evening?

673
00:50:20,974 --> 00:50:22,974
Look at my face.

674
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:25,806
Do I look like I'm in the mood for a party?

675
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,646
I'm not going!

676
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:30,206
Yes, sir.

677
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:33,286
You're not going. I get it. Just say it nicely.

678
00:50:33,446 --> 00:50:35,406
- I'm leaving.   - Yeah.

679
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:55,286
(If someone sees an MP3 player,)

680
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,126
(please let me know.)

681
00:50:57,984 --> 00:50:59,606
(Okay!)

682
00:51:07,476 --> 00:51:08,806
Ms. Apo.

683
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:13,526
What's this?

684
00:51:14,926 --> 00:51:17,086
Mr. Phudin sends your outfit for the party.

685
00:51:17,926 --> 00:51:19,126
Party?

686
00:51:19,805 --> 00:51:21,206
What party?

687
00:51:21,406 --> 00:51:23,966
Don't you know we're having a party?

688
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:26,006
I don't.

689
00:51:26,646 --> 00:51:28,726
Judging by how serious this is,

690
00:51:29,317 --> 00:51:33,326
I bet someone just gave birth or came back from abroad.

691
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:37,446
You will find out at the party. I'll send you the location.

692
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,086
Please check it out.

693
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:47,646
This... Whoa! This is...

694
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:50,486
What kind of party is this for?

695
00:51:54,521 --> 00:51:55,966
I almost forgot.

696
00:51:58,046 --> 00:52:00,006
You need this to complete your get-up.

697
00:52:55,846 --> 00:52:58,446
Welcome to the survival game.

698
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,886
If you don't want to die,

699
00:53:01,093 --> 00:53:02,806
prepare your weapons.

700
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:06,686
From this moment on, it's about your own survival.

701
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,166
Ready!

702
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:17,886
Go!

703
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:52,566
Phing?

704
00:53:55,846 --> 00:53:57,046
Om?

705
00:55:58,246 --> 00:56:01,086
Hey, everyone looks so cool!

706
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:03,346
Well done!

707
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:07,166
- You like it. We're happy!   - You like it. We're happy!

708
00:56:08,173 --> 00:56:10,131
Phing, I missed you.

709
00:56:10,212 --> 00:56:11,912
I missed you more.

710
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:13,406
I missed you too.

711
00:56:13,518 --> 00:56:15,518
Why didn't you tell me before you came back?

712
00:56:16,326 --> 00:56:20,286
Mr. Phudin wanted to surprise you. We couldn't tell.

713
00:56:20,722 --> 00:56:22,286
How was it?

714
00:56:23,686 --> 00:56:25,726
Did you like it?

715
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:29,846
Phing said you liked survival movies, so I did this.

716
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:31,526
See? How was it?

717
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,099
I like it.

718
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:37,726
What are we celebrating anyway?

719
00:56:39,806 --> 00:56:42,526
You don't know what this party is about?

720
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,726
It's your birthday, Apo!

721
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:47,646
- Yeah!   - Whoa!

722
00:56:47,806 --> 00:56:49,166
How did you forget?

723
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,928
Really? Is it my birthday today?

724
00:56:52,015 --> 00:56:55,678
Yeah! What day else could it be?

725
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:57,766
Can you forget your own birthday?

726
00:56:58,126 --> 00:56:59,406
You can, I guess.

727
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,820
Why did you?

728
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:03,885
It's just who she is. It's normal. She forgets everything.

729
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:07,926
I've been so busy I haven't looked at the dates.

730
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:12,326
It's not the first time my sister forgets her own birthday.

731
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,681
It's not important. It's just a birthday.

732
00:57:17,486 --> 00:57:21,446
Ever since I lost my parents, I have never celebrated my birthday.

733
00:57:25,701 --> 00:57:29,086
I really didn't expect this party to be for me.

734
00:57:29,507 --> 00:57:34,046
Don't tell me I was the first one to throw you a birthday party.

735
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:38,046
Really?

736
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:41,926
If I had known, I would have made it even bigger!

737
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,486
- Awesome!   - More!

738
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:53,846
This is already huge.

739
00:57:54,038 --> 00:57:56,526
I'm so touched. Thank you so much, Mr. Phudin.

740
00:57:57,486 --> 00:58:01,086
- Thank all of you too.   - Welcome.

741
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:02,366
Do you like it?

742
00:58:02,447 --> 00:58:06,526
If you do, I'll dance ten more rounds. I love it! When I dance...

743
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:08,406
Boem, you liar!

744
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,725
Ms. Stepmother, he misses every rehearsal.

745
00:58:10,806 --> 00:58:12,166
I only missed one!

746
00:58:12,247 --> 00:58:14,247
We didn't miss a single rehearsal.

747
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:20,646
Guys! It turned out awesome because I choreographed the entire thing.

748
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:23,326
You're taking the credit again!

749
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:26,446
Let me shine for once.

750
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:32,086
Here comes the Queen!

751
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:54,550
Hello.

752
00:58:54,646 --> 00:58:58,246
Wi? Why are you dressed as Nakhee?

753
00:58:58,335 --> 00:59:00,966
- No! She's Dae Jang Geum.   - No! She's Dae Jang Geum.

754
00:59:01,094 --> 00:59:02,886
No!

755
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,846
We've got a new show now.

756
00:59:07,734 --> 00:59:10,566
I'm the Zombified Queen.

757
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:12,886
Scary!

758
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:14,206
Araji?

759
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:16,366
Jee, my butt!

760
00:59:17,255 --> 00:59:20,886
Din! I spent a long time getting dressed.

761
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,990
I was the last to make my entrance.

762
00:59:24,182 --> 00:59:26,886
You shouldn't have come.

763
00:59:27,144 --> 00:59:31,966
I'm sorry. Wi is family, so I invited her.

764
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:35,206
It's good you invited Ms. Wi and Mrs. Sita.

765
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:37,086
This is going to be so much fun.

766
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,790
Is everyone here?

767
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:42,566
No! More people are coming.

768
00:59:42,678 --> 00:59:44,046
- More?   - Yeah.

769
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:46,966
Happy birthday, Ms. Apo.

770
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:11,846
Ing and Game said they were still in town,

771
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,446
so I invited them.

772
01:00:13,768 --> 01:00:18,726
We're really sorry. We had one day to get costumes. We weren't prepared.

773
01:00:19,206 --> 01:00:21,046
Game, you fiend!

774
01:00:25,086 --> 01:00:26,646
Sorry!

775
01:00:26,726 --> 01:00:30,926
My friend is too drunk. She's going to vomit.

776
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,766
I'll sober her up!

777
01:00:32,926 --> 01:00:34,446
That way, ma'am.

778
01:00:37,586 --> 01:00:39,726
- When did she get drunk?   - I don't know.

779
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,166
What did she drink?

780
01:00:44,573 --> 01:00:46,966
Why didn't you let me smack him in the face?

781
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:49,926
- Calm down.   - Yeah, Apo. Let me give it to him!

782
01:00:50,007 --> 01:00:52,406
Calm down, both of you.

783
01:00:53,246 --> 01:00:55,286
Mr. Phudin doesn't know about us.

784
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:57,566
So how did they come to your party?

785
01:00:59,246 --> 01:01:01,566
Game's new girlfriend knows Mr. Phudin.

786
01:01:01,678 --> 01:01:02,926
What?

787
01:01:04,141 --> 01:01:06,886
The woman with him is his new girlfriend?

788
01:01:07,878 --> 01:01:09,886
- This just gets good.   - Hey!

789
01:01:10,078 --> 01:01:11,246
Calm down!

790
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:13,646
Phing, listen to me.

791
01:01:14,566 --> 01:01:17,166
I know you don't want to do as I'm about to ask,

792
01:01:17,293 --> 01:01:20,766
but please act like you don't know Game.

793
01:01:20,926 --> 01:01:23,585
- Are you mad?   - Om, you too. Please?

794
01:01:23,674 --> 01:01:26,646
- What's wrong?   - Please?

795
01:01:26,806 --> 01:01:28,526
I don't want to ruin the mood.

796
01:01:28,612 --> 01:01:31,387
The mood was ruined the moment Game stepped foot in here, dude.

797
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:32,646
That's right!

798
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:34,246
It's my fault.

799
01:01:34,454 --> 01:01:36,766
I should have told Mr. Phudin about Game.

800
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:41,326
I was just afraid it would affect his business.

801
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:44,166
So, you let it affect your life instead?

802
01:01:44,253 --> 01:01:46,686
Why are you always like this?

803
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:48,320
You care about others,

804
01:01:48,401 --> 01:01:51,126
and it ruins you every time.

805
01:01:52,382 --> 01:01:53,526
I promise.

806
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:57,246
After this party, I'll tell Mr. Phudin about Game.

807
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,886
Do you promise you'd tell him?

808
01:02:02,757 --> 01:02:03,886
Fine.

809
01:02:04,725 --> 01:02:06,526
Because if you don't,

810
01:02:06,757 --> 01:02:09,286
I'll tell him myself.

811
01:02:10,406 --> 01:02:11,646
Deal.

812
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:13,966
I want to smack his face so badly.

813
01:02:15,885 --> 01:02:17,646
Who was that woman?

814
01:02:18,326 --> 01:02:19,726
She's Apo's best friend.

815
01:02:20,286 --> 01:02:21,366
She probably knows about us.

816
01:02:23,486 --> 01:02:25,246
What the heck is this?

817
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:27,006
Did we make a mistake coming here?

818
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:29,886
We didn't. Don't forget our objective.

819
01:02:30,285 --> 01:02:32,006
Repeat it.

820
01:02:33,246 --> 01:02:36,606
Find out how Apo got together with Mr. Phudin.

821
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,126
That's right.

822
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:41,726
But Ms. Ing, this is not the place and time to do it.

823
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:45,206
Apo might have told Mr. Phudin about us.

824
01:02:45,534 --> 01:02:48,086
No! I think she hasn't told him yet.

825
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:50,206
He wouldn't have invited us if she had.

826
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:53,206
He might have invited us to make a fool of us.

827
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:56,046
Uncle Phudin and I have always been on good terms.

828
01:02:56,127 --> 01:02:59,525
It's you that might have been the reason he refused to mine Siamese ruby.

829
01:02:59,606 --> 01:03:02,126
You must figure it out with Apo. Is that clear?

830
01:03:27,334 --> 01:03:28,566
Who is that?

831
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:03,686
Do you think I'm scared of you?

832
01:04:04,502 --> 01:04:06,166
Zombie Mueang.

833
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:10,566
What kind of person likes to watch zombie movies?

834
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:11,926
What did you say?

835
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:15,446
What kind of person likes to watch zombie movies?

836
01:04:20,741 --> 01:04:25,326
What kind of person likes to watch zombie movies?

837
01:04:26,942 --> 01:04:28,686
My kind, that is.

838
01:04:29,926 --> 01:04:32,006
Scary.

839
01:04:32,918 --> 01:04:34,526
It's not scary.

840
01:04:35,117 --> 01:04:37,606
It's fun. It's like watching my own life.

841
01:04:38,198 --> 01:04:39,198
Why?

842
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,406
Hey, you can talk normally.

843
01:04:48,213 --> 01:04:52,086
No, I need to stay in character.

844
01:04:57,183 --> 01:05:00,286
Thank you for coming to my birthday party.

845
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:05,126
I think this look suits you better than your usual look.

846
01:05:07,872 --> 01:05:09,126
Really?

847
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:24,126
For your sore throat.

848
01:05:32,941 --> 01:05:34,246
Thanks again.

849
01:05:58,853 --> 01:06:00,046
Wait.

850
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:03,526
Apo!

851
01:06:03,686 --> 01:06:05,366
What are you doing here?

852
01:06:05,454 --> 01:06:07,366
Everyone is looking for you. Come on!

853
01:06:07,447 --> 01:06:08,726
It's time. Come on!

854
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,966
- Come on!   - Wait.

855
01:06:11,646 --> 01:06:14,206
Wait for what? Nothing's there. People are waiting.

856
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,646
Come on!

857
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:21,446
Slow down. You will trip.

858
01:06:29,142 --> 01:06:33,566
- Happy birthday to Apo!   - Happy birthday to Apo!

859
01:06:47,926 --> 01:06:49,766
Thank you, Mr. Phudin.

860
01:06:50,126 --> 01:06:53,366
Thank you everyone.

861
01:06:54,237 --> 01:06:56,406
You've finally found happiness, Apo.

862
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,326
Thanks, buddy.

863
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:02,206
This is a present from me.

864
01:07:03,726 --> 01:07:05,006
Take it.

865
01:07:09,214 --> 01:07:12,806
I don't know if it can make up for your lost MP3 player,

866
01:07:12,997 --> 01:07:15,126
but you can listen to music on that one.

867
01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:18,526
Thank you.

868
01:07:18,846 --> 01:07:21,566
I know it can't replace that one.

869
01:07:21,766 --> 01:07:25,486
You're attached to something because of your memory.

870
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:29,246
Even if we have lost the item,

871
01:07:29,926 --> 01:07:32,846
the memory is still there.

872
01:07:36,879 --> 01:07:40,886
At first, I was sad that it was lost,

873
01:07:40,967 --> 01:07:42,286
but

874
01:07:42,742 --> 01:07:44,366
it's probably for the best.

875
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:47,286
It will help me let go of old things

876
01:07:47,766 --> 01:07:49,446
and have a fresh start.

877
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,886
Awesome. Fresh start.

878
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,286
Let's give a round of applause for Apo's fresh start.

879
01:07:59,846 --> 01:08:03,766
- Fresh start!   - Fresh start!

880
01:08:03,886 --> 01:08:07,086
- Fresh start!   - Fresh start!

881
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:11,726
- Fresh start!   - Fresh start!

882
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:17,046
- Fresh start!   - Fresh start!

883
01:08:17,286 --> 01:08:22,366
- Fresh start!   - Fresh start!

884
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:42,886
Everyone here knows who this necklace belonged to!

885
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:44,366
This necklace is mine!

886
01:08:44,494 --> 01:08:46,006
I can give it to whomever I want!

887
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:49,446
- Go on.   - I'm here to buy your Siamese ruby necklace.

888
01:08:49,527 --> 01:08:51,246
If I could give you this necklace, I would,

889
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,966
but I can't because your dad told me to treasure it.

890
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:55,686
I can't let this go.

891
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:58,526
This is a must-have.

892
01:08:58,607 --> 01:09:00,646
If I have something important to you to trade with it,

893
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:02,486
would you go against my dad's wish?

894
01:09:02,734 --> 01:09:03,806
What's that something important?

895
01:09:03,902 --> 01:09:07,086
Meet me at my house at four. Bring the necklace.

896
01:09:07,326 --> 01:09:08,646
Since you're cruel to me,

897
01:09:09,174 --> 01:09:10,886
I don't have to be kind to you!

898
01:09:14,086 --> 01:09:15,286
Mueang!

899
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,086
- Apo!   - Apo!
