1
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,360
Our workers are gossiping

2
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:06,326
that a dad and his son have the same wife.

3
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:08,806
Those guys in the park said

4
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,286
Ms. Stepmother seduced you.

5
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,846
- Ouch!   - Young Master!

6
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:16,846
You can't change people's opinions.

7
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:18,726
Don't get hurt over something like this again.

8
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:21,565
Apo and Mueang are genuinely in love.

9
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:22,846
Therefore,

10
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:24,446
I ask all of you

11
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,966
to stop the rumors.

12
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:30,926
I analyzed his food and his fitness routine these days.

13
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:32,806
It's possible

14
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,269
Young Master's "down there" is not functioning.

15
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:37,046
No matter what's wrong with you,

16
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:39,406
I still like you the way you are.

17
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,086
(Debt Clearing Document)

18
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:52,686
It's done.

19
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,286
Thank you so much, Mr. Phudin,

20
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,086
for signing this document for us.

21
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,493
From now on,

22
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,078
we aren't a creditor and debtor anymore.

23
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,606
Are you glad that you don't have any burden anymore?

24
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:13,846
I'm really glad.

25
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,526
You told me your life goal is to pay off all of your debt.

26
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:20,326
You don't have a debt anymore.

27
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:22,046
What are you going to do?

28
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,646
I don't know either.

29
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:28,766
I've only thought about how to make money to pay off my debt.

30
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,326
Well, you can use this time to think about it.

31
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,246
What about you?

32
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:36,246
Give me a good answer.

33
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:41,286
I'll work hard and save money.

34
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:42,686
So that when I get older,

35
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,806
I don't have to bother my children.

36
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:48,126
I hope you can do it.

37
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:50,846
What about you?

38
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:56,846
I'll peacefully live my life after retirement.

39
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:01,886
(Hello.)

40
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:04,286
(I'm Wi.)

41
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:09,966
(Today, I have something to tell you. I have a crush on a man.)

42
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:12,493
(He's Din.)

43
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:17,166
(My first impression of Din.)

44
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:18,766
(He's tall)

45
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:20,926
(and has a wide shoulder.)

46
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:23,126
(He can take care of me.)

47
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:24,686
(He's my type.)

48
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:27,286
Are you alright? You almost fell down.

49
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,806
I'm alright.

50
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,886
(On that day, I thought)

51
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,446
(this man should be my future husband.)

52
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,486
(However, my dream is broken.)

53
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,126
(In the end,)

54
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:40,494
(he decided to date my older sister.)

55
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,846
(After I was heartbroken from him,)

56
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:46,446
(I've been trying to find my true love,)

57
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:48,206
(but my heart knows)

58
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,206
(there's no one who can compare to Din.)

59
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,846
I'm sorry for dragging it this long, Job,

60
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,366
but I can't feel that way.

61
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:00,126
Are you going to dump me?

62
00:05:00,326 --> 00:05:01,606
Goodbye.

63
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:06,606
Wi.

64
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:14,366
(I thought I would be single all my life.)

65
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:17,726
Goodbye...

66
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,566
(But after my older sister just passed away,)

67
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:22,909
(I found out I had ovarian cysts.)

68
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,886
I don't want to die now.

69
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:40,166
(Death is so close to me,)

70
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,526
(but I can't just die without love.)

71
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,126
(From that day on,)

72
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:48,397
(I promised myself that)

73
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,366
(I'd become Din's number one fan.)

74
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:57,526
(However, today, my duty as a fan is over.)

75
00:05:57,654 --> 00:06:00,446
(I'm going to confess my love to Din.)

76
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,206
(Please support me.)

77
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:05,806
Din.

78
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:07,286
What?

79
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,846
I don't want to die without

80
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:14,606
confessing my feelings to you.

81
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:19,046
- Din, I like...   - Stop right there.

82
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,966
Do you think I don't know how you feel towards me?

83
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:26,166
We've been able to live together

84
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,126
because I pretended like I didn't know.

85
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:30,766
If you want to stay in this house,

86
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,646
keep your feelings to yourself.

87
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:35,606
Don't say it, understand?

88
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:37,926
I like you, Din!

89
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:41,446
I really like you.

90
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:43,406
I like you so much.

91
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,846
But you don't have to like me back.

92
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:50,566
I only want to tell you my feelings for once.

93
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:52,966
I'm already happy enough

94
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,806
when I get to tell you this.

95
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:57,886
Please keep your happiness to yourself, then.

96
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:10,046
Din, you're so mean.

97
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:18,566
Why do I have to love a mean person like you?

98
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,374
You're so mean.

99
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,686
Mr. Phudin.

100
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,406
Not now.

101
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,286
I'm here to tell you I'm quitting.

102
00:07:58,614 --> 00:07:59,886
Why are you quitting?

103
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:02,486
My duty here is over.

104
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:04,926
I stayed here

105
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,166
because I was worried about you and Mr. Mueang.

106
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:10,086
I also thought Ms. Nudi would want me to stay.

107
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,686
But right now,

108
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,126
you and Mr. Mueang have already mended your relationship.

109
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:16,086
There's nothing for me to worry about anymore.

110
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:17,846
Does Wi know about this?

111
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:19,326
No.

112
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:23,446
Please don't tell Wi or the others right now.

113
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:25,846
I'll work here for 30 more days

114
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:27,406
per the company's rules.

115
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,886
During that time,

116
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,967
I don't want anyone to cry

117
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,326
or to try to stop me.

118
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,406
I'm not good at saying goodbye.

119
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:42,766
Are you sure about this decision?

120
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:44,086
Yes.

121
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,086
Please respect my decision.

122
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,526
From now on, please call me President

123
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:01,006
and be formal with me as well,

124
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:03,126
because we have to respect this meeting room.

125
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:05,546
- Yes, President.   - Yes, President.

126
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,806
It hasn't been long, but he's already drunk with power.

127
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:15,446
Let him be for a day.

128
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:19,685
I invite Rita, Darin, and Om to today's meeting

129
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,326
because you have just begun your work here.

130
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:26,046
As for Phing, she's a special guest I invited.

131
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:27,805
You all probably have seen some flaws

132
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:30,726
and have some suggestions that can help us.

133
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:34,606
Excuse me, President.

134
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:38,726
I'd like to suggest we should reset the PR system here.

135
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,286
And we should begin with resetting Ms. Wi's train of thought.

136
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:46,726
If it's really good, people will talk about it and spread word of mouth.

137
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:51,126
You don't have to hire influencers, YouTubers, or TikTok influencers.

138
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:54,606
Ms. Wi's train of thought isn't good.

139
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,886
The world nowadays has already developed too fast.

140
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,486
We can't just wait for word of mouth.

141
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,886
We should hire famous people to promote Phudin Park.

142
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,101
We just have to choose the right people.

143
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,846
Agree.

144
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:09,206
I think my aunt is withholding the PR budget.

145
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:11,246
It's time for us to get it out.

146
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,886
Excuse me, President.

147
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:16,726
I'd like to talk about IT security.

148
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:19,405
I'd like to suggest that we should change the entire system.

149
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,150
The old system is just not good.

150
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:24,126
Change the IT system?

151
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:26,422
Okay.

152
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,806
- Next one.   - President,

153
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:31,806
my daughter and I have the same problem.

154
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:34,166
- You say it, my child.   - It's like this.

155
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:36,278
When we get off work at five,

156
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,286
Mom and I always get off at five.

157
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,367
However, some people like to stare at us.

158
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,686
How are we wrong to get off work immediately?

159
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:44,566
You aren't wrong to get off work when it's time,

160
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:48,766
but you're wrong when you leave your work for others to handle.

161
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,446
And it's about kindness as well.

162
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:54,526
Have you thought about helping with your coworker's work?

163
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:57,086
Your superior has told me all about it.

164
00:11:00,574 --> 00:11:01,606
President,

165
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:06,526
I think we should separate Darin and Rita from this question for now.

166
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:09,246
I'd like to represent other people who aren't in this room.

167
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,059
People who get off at five,

168
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:13,086
it doesn't mean they aren't kind.

169
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,206
They might actually have a personal matter to attend to.

170
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:17,526
And it's already after work hours,

171
00:11:17,662 --> 00:11:20,486
but we can't leave because our superior wouldn't allow it.

172
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:25,046
They have different ideas, I see.

173
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,246
The superior is really dedicated to the company,

174
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:30,486
while subordinates clearly separate the private and work matters.

175
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,846
That's right.

176
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,046
When we have to continue to work,

177
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:35,806
this will also be a problem.

178
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:37,310
We work overtime,

179
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:40,446
but we don't get overtime pay accordingly.

180
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:44,046
Was the former President that stingy?

181
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,006
We could get sued.

182
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,206
Before this, I thought

183
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,865
that working hard would make us feel like we have value.

184
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:53,606
When I think about it again,

185
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:54,926
President,

186
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:58,326
when we have to work until we die,

187
00:11:58,557 --> 00:11:59,998
was that really a thing to be proud of?

188
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:02,176
In the end,

189
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,886
both sides have to respect each other.

190
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:07,626
Employees have to do their best to do their work,

191
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,806
while the company has to treat the employees with respect.

192
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,060
If they finish their work and want to leave, that's their right.

193
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:16,726
If they have to work overtime,

194
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:19,686
they deserve overtime pay accordingly.

195
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,286
This is the standard of a good company.

196
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:24,997
If you can change this part,

197
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:26,326
I'm confident

198
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:28,966
that every employee will have their motivation back.

199
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:32,446
Okay.

200
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,146
We have a lot of things to adjust to. Thank you, everyone.

201
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:36,606
So,

202
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,806
we'll fix that problem first.

203
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:43,766
At five o'clock today, everything must change!

204
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:54,526
Everyone. If you're done with your work, you can go home.

205
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,246
Why are you standing still?

206
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:01,846
You can get off work.

207
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,294
If you have to work overtime,

208
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:09,006
you'll get the pay in accordance with the laws.

209
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,686
That's the deal.

210
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:13,653
Okay.

211
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:19,006
Come on.

212
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:28,166
Let's go!

213
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:20,293
Are you still working?

214
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:24,766
Yes. My store closes at seven.

215
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,846
Oh? Hey.

216
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:41,406
Where are you going?

217
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,046
Hello, Master.

218
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:47,046
I have something to consult you about.

219
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:50,866
I'm really anxious about this.

220
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:52,966
I really need you, Master.

221
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:55,206
Are you available?

222
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,206
What master?

223
00:14:57,334 --> 00:15:00,126
There's someone I like,

224
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,806
but I don't know if we'll end up together.

225
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:04,686
That one is called Tin.

226
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:11,606
Tin, it's spelled as T-I-N.

227
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:14,246
Yes, T-I-N.

228
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:18,326
Yes, with an N. That's right.

229
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:21,206
What?

230
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:25,326
His birth date?

231
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:27,486
Hold on.

232
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,166
What master is this?

233
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:30,926
I have to find out about it first.

234
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:33,326
I'll send it to you as soon as I can.

235
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:39,086
Yes. Please check the fortune for me as soon as you can.

236
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:43,166
Yes. Thank you.

237
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,278
I miss you. Yes.

238
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,926
Goodbye.

239
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:52,086
Your master...

240
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,166
Is he a fortune teller?

241
00:15:58,142 --> 00:15:59,406
How long have you been here?

242
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,366
Well, I've been here since when you said

243
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:05,926
you liked me.

244
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:09,286
Hey, how could you eavesdrop on someone like that?

245
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:10,846
I wasn't eavesdropping on you.

246
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,926
You were really loud.

247
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:14,686
My plants might be deaf now.

248
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:20,006
Listen, let me tell you.

249
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,766
You don't need to ask a fortune teller to have a boyfriend.

250
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:25,206
You can ask me.

251
00:16:27,246 --> 00:16:29,486
Are you playing with my feelings?

252
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,566
You confessed to me first, but you have done nothing.

253
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,926
You only smile at other women.

254
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,526
Is it fun to see me concerned like this?

255
00:16:39,077 --> 00:16:40,246
No.

256
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,006
I don't know how to start.

257
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:46,086
If you want to be my boyfriend, why didn't you ask me?

258
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,556
Because I don't know if you really like me.

259
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:51,206
You already know now.

260
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:55,088
Then...

261
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:09,686
Please be my girlfriend.

262
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:25,126
Stop being mad.

263
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:31,406
We'll go on a date when my work is done.

264
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:47,902
I'm ready.

265
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,166
It smells so good.

266
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:13,686
You're quick.

267
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:15,246
My mind is already here.

268
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:19,166
So, where should we go?

269
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:20,885
My pretty lady?

270
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:24,326
Are you embarrassed?

271
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:26,886
I like to praise myself usually.

272
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,486
No one really praises me that much.

273
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:35,126
Well, I'll call you pretty often.

274
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:37,046
Isn't it nice?

275
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:39,526
Yes.

276
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,686
I feel so pretty now.

277
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:49,686
Should we find something nice to eat?

278
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:04,126
Do you still want to go somewhere?

279
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:08,238
Should we just have instant noodles here?

280
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:30,046
Here?

281
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,406
Are you up for it?

282
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,606
Let's go in a room.

283
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:48,446
Honey,

284
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:51,726
Tin would be mad if you came to visit him without telling him first.

285
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,486
Tin didn't come home yesterday.

286
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:55,006
He didn't answer my call either.

287
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:56,422
I'm worried.

288
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:57,806
Tin.

289
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,526
Tin, are you here?

290
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:01,006
Tin.

291
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:02,966
Tin.

292
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:04,726
Where has he gone?

293
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,766
Are you full from this morning's breakfast?

294
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:12,206
Yes. You really cook delicious food. Thank you.

295
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,166
Someone just praises me.

296
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,846
Usually, the man has to send the woman off.

297
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,206
You're sending me off to my store.

298
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,646
Are you jealous of others or possessive of me?

299
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:25,606
Both of them.

300
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:28,006
If I could keep you at my house, I'd do it already.

301
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:31,166
That much, huh?

302
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:34,486
Please work hard.

303
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,046
Well,

304
00:21:37,605 --> 00:21:39,446
see you again this evening.

305
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:54,606
Honey, look at them.

306
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:58,166
- Oh my.   - Tin is kissing a woman.

307
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,806
Dad, Mom?

308
00:22:07,054 --> 00:22:08,446
Hello.

309
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,846
Did you stay at Ing's house last night?

310
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:17,486
Why would you ask me that? That's my private business.

311
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:20,966
She asked you that because she was worried.

312
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:23,606
You didn't come back home last night.

313
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:26,206
- Right, honey?   - Yes.

314
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:28,668
You would call us if you don't come home usually.

315
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:31,246
You just disappeared last night.

316
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:36,446
Mom, why are you laughing?

317
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:38,046
Anyway,

318
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:41,366
since you already know about us,

319
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:43,966
I think we should make it right.

320
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:45,406
What?

321
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:47,966
Please don't worry.

322
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:50,486
- I'll take responsibility for Tin.   - Hey...

323
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:53,886
From now on, Tin doesn't have to work anymore.

324
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:57,286
- You can take him.   - You can take him.

325
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,766
Stop, both of you. That's enough.

326
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,126
Dad, Mom.

327
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:10,486
Well, Ing and I...

328
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,886
We're dating.

329
00:23:13,286 --> 00:23:14,686
I'm serious about her.

330
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:16,326
I'll just tell you that.

331
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:22,046
Oh my, Tin.

332
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:23,766
I'm so glad

333
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,886
that you finally have a girlfriend.

334
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,286
Ing, do you know

335
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:31,526
how long we've waited for this day?

336
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:32,862
No.

337
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:37,286
Tin, come here. Let me hug you.

338
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:44,406
Hey, Mom. Why are you crying?

339
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:48,366
I'm just so touched. Ing, let me hug you as well.

340
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:49,726
Okay.

341
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,726
Let me hug you as well. We'll hug each other.

342
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,126
I wish you two good luck. Tell us when you'll marry.

343
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,406
Mom.

344
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:06,606
Can I hold a big wedding for us?

345
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,606
Sure. I'll pay for it.

346
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:10,982
- Dad, not you too.   - Thank you.

347
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:13,750
Honey, I'll have a daughter-in-law now.

348
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:16,366
- Me too.   - Such a great daughter-in-law as well.

349
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,806
Ing, you're funny. I like it.

350
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:27,246
You're so cool yesterday, Young Master.

351
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:30,166
You already made a legend on your first day.

352
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,486
Well, I have a good motivator here.

353
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,166
Hey, what about me?

354
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:40,006
I helped you a lot yesterday, President.

355
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:44,926
Oh, okay. Please don't sulk. It'd be bad if I didn't have you.

356
00:24:45,596 --> 00:24:47,166
Thank you, Master.

357
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:49,622
That's alright, my disciple.

358
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:53,126
What are you going to do next, Young Master?

359
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:54,646
So I can support you.

360
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:56,046
I...

361
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:58,286
I'll revive Phudin Park.

362
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:00,526
- Revive it?   - Yes.

363
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,806
I'll make everyone come here again.

364
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:06,966
Honestly, it's difficult.

365
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:09,726
People don't like to go to theme parks now.

366
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:11,366
I'll try to find a way.

367
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:15,006
I think we should ask Phudin Park's employees about this.

368
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:17,646
They might have some ideas about the change we could make.

369
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:19,646
That's a good idea.

370
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:21,766
I'll tell them for you.

371
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:24,846
Good.

372
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,486
Everyone,

373
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:29,606
finally, our chance is here.

374
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:30,846
What chance?

375
00:25:30,974 --> 00:25:32,286
The chance to make a complaint.

376
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,486
What?

377
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,326
With whom? The Prime Minister?

378
00:25:35,422 --> 00:25:36,646
Young Master.

379
00:25:36,775 --> 00:25:38,254
Young Master?

380
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:40,286
This isn't a trap, is it?

381
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:42,846
Aum, don't joke with us, or I'll hit you.

382
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,246
I'm not joking.

383
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:47,406
Young Master told you to send a representative to see him.

384
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:51,005
You can let out all of your frustration

385
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:52,446
however you want.

386
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:54,366
- Really?   - Really?

387
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:56,326
- Is this true?   - Yes.

388
00:25:57,062 --> 00:25:58,526
These are the representatives?

389
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,606
Yes, Young Master.

390
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:04,104
Why are there only familiar faces here? Did you nominate yourself?

391
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:05,628
We didn't do that.

392
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:07,326
Our friends voted for us.

393
00:26:07,407 --> 00:26:10,613
We are the complainers of Phudin Park.

394
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,766
Well, not many people listen to us.

395
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,246
We'll be the voices of the employees.

396
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:18,966
- Okay.   - Fine.

397
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:20,646
Let's start with you.

398
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:24,206
I'm Boem, the first representative of Phudin Park.

399
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:26,126
I'd like to talk about the toilet.

400
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:28,166
It's old, like it's from the World War era.

401
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:32,046
- Understood.   - The goods at the store are so expensive.

402
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,397
Eggs, pork, and instant noodles are all expensive.

403
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,726
The tampons are even more expensive, Young Master.

404
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:40,446
When Boss constructs anything, he lowers the budget.

405
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,766
That's why the materials are bad. It's dangerous, Young Master.

406
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,800
I think this place is haunted.

407
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:49,526
We should have an exorcist unit.

408
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:53,926
Young Master, I think we should have an infirmary service.

409
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:57,046
Our salary is like a change. It's too low.

410
00:26:57,166 --> 00:27:00,326
We also have to send some of it to our parents every month.

411
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:03,646
We have to invest in increasing the safety for tourists.

412
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,406
If you can change this, everyone will be happy.

413
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:08,540
We've heard you.

414
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:11,149
We'll slowly solve your problem one at a time.

415
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:13,926
- Thank you.   - Thank you.

416
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:16,246
We're really happy.

417
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:18,966
No one has actually listened to us like this before.

418
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:21,326
I want you to work comfortably.

419
00:27:21,566 --> 00:27:22,926
Just tell me if there's anything.

420
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,086
Yes.

421
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:27,246
I have to apologize as well

422
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,606
for misunderstanding you and Madam.

423
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:32,886
I have to apologize as well.

424
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:34,286
Me too.

425
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,206
- Me as well.  -  Me too.

426
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:39,406
It's fine, everyone.

427
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:41,966
It's good enough that you understand it.

428
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,726
Wait. What did you just call me, Boem?

429
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,126
Madam.

430
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:50,270
- Madam?   - We're the ones who came up with that.

431
00:27:50,381 --> 00:27:53,286
Well, Young Master has to have his Madam by his side.

432
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,637
That's a nice one.

433
00:27:57,784 --> 00:27:58,919
I like it.

434
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:03,046
Well, we're not used to it yet.

435
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:06,126
Usually, we would call her Ms. Stepmother. I guess we have to

436
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,246
call her Madam until we're used to it.

437
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:11,006
Now, now.

438
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:12,646
Since you've spoken your mind,

439
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,110
I'd like to ask for your help.

440
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:15,566
Say it, Young Master.

441
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,126
I want all of us to cooperate

442
00:28:18,286 --> 00:28:20,846
to revive Phudin Park once again.

443
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:23,206
Can you help me?

444
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:25,606
- Yes, Young Master.   - Yes, Young Master.

445
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:27,126
Let's do this.

446
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,286
- Let's go.   - Yes.

447
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:32,046
Should we do some cheer?

448
00:28:32,463 --> 00:28:33,806
You can lead, Boem.

449
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,366
Sure. But we have to be serious.

450
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,566
Everyone put your arm around others.

451
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:42,446
Three, four. Phudin.

452
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,258
- Park. Park.  - Phudin. Phudin.

453
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:46,606
- Phudin. Phudin.   - Park, Park, Park.

454
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:47,846
Everyone.

455
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:05,086
Mueang.

456
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:06,766
Are you still

457
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,526
stressed about that?

458
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,246
What are you talking about?

459
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,366
ED.

460
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:21,526
What the heck, Apo?

461
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:23,246
Are you crazy? What are you talking about?

462
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:26,086
It's still working, though.

463
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:28,566
- Is that true?   - It's from Aum, isn't it?

464
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,326
What else did Aum say? Tell me.

465
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,578
- No. It's not Aum.   - It has to be Aum.

466
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:34,726
- It's not Aum.   - I have to handle him first.

467
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:36,526
- Mueang.   - Aum.

468
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:37,926
- Mueang.   - Darn it.

469
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:39,966
He's looking down on me.

470
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,126
So, what's going on?

471
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:52,326
Your coffee is here. Yes.

472
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:59,566
So, what do you want to consult me about?

473
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,966
It's about Mueang.

474
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:04,846
I think you probably know him the best.

475
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:08,966
I've talked about this with Aum earlier,

476
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:11,366
but it seems like he's being nonsense again.

477
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:14,886
He's always being nonsense.

478
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,406
You can ask me, Ms. Apo.

479
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:21,206
Does Mueang have something that he doesn't want to tell me about?

480
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:24,326
What do you mean by that, Ms. Apo?

481
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,206
Can I get more details?

482
00:30:34,854 --> 00:30:35,966
What's up?

483
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,606
Why haven't you gone home?

484
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,781
I'm working.

485
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:41,766
You're really...

486
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:45,166
Do you know how much you make Ms. Apo worry about you?

487
00:30:45,814 --> 00:30:48,486
If you're talking about that, I've already talked with her.

488
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:52,163
Aum was being nonsense, saying I have ED.

489
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:54,426
He's looking down on me.

490
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:56,406
I don't even want to brag.

491
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,206
It's like he knew. He has already disappeared.

492
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:01,126
It's not about Aum.

493
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:03,766
Why didn't you tell Ms. Apo

494
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:05,406
about the fact you went to the hospital?

495
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:07,286
(How long will you hide it from her?)

496
00:31:07,453 --> 00:31:10,646
(Ms. Apo is stressed because she's worried about you.)

497
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:14,286
I told her as much as I could.

498
00:31:14,677 --> 00:31:16,926
You have to talk to her after this.

499
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:21,526
Wait. Is Po with you?

500
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:22,806
(She isn't here now.)

501
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,286
(She came to see me though.)

502
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:26,246
(She called me around one.)

503
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:28,406
Why did you only call me now?

504
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:30,246
I want you two to talk by yourselves.

505
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:33,046
I didn't want to get involved, you know?

506
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,446
Why didn't you think about this more quickly?

507
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,566
You bad friend.

508
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,446
What? Mueang?

509
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,414
- Po.   - Mueang.

510
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:02,926
I'm sorry for coming in without your permission.

511
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:05,126
You don't have to scold Aum for this.

512
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,270
I forced him to open the doors for me.

513
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:09,326
I didn't say anything.

514
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:12,726
Do you like it?

515
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:16,126
I want to redecorate your room

516
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:20,806
so that you feel warm and relaxed and make you fall asleep easier.

517
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:26,166
Po.

518
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:29,166
I'm sorry for not telling you this.

519
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:32,524
I thought it was a small matter. I didn't want you to worry.

520
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:39,246
Mueang.

521
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:42,606
Can you tell me about your condition?

522
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,406
(If you've been following my life,)

523
00:32:48,606 --> 00:32:49,886
(you probably know)

524
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:51,566
(that I'm a light sleeper.)

525
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:56,726
(Actually, it's a result of my depression.)

526
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:00,766
(Every day,)

527
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:03,686
(I feel like I've been broken thousands of times.)

528
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:08,526
(When my head hits the pillow, I always think of those bad thoughts)

529
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:11,486
(and I can't fall asleep.)

530
00:33:29,422 --> 00:33:30,606
(One day,)

531
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,399
(I didn't wake up from the place I actually fell asleep.)

532
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:38,486
(Yes.)

533
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:40,286
(I was sleepwalking.)

534
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:46,526
(But I'm not sure how bad it is until...)

535
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:50,966
Since that day, I've decided to cure my sleepwalking condition seriously.

536
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,286
I also went back to see a psychiatrist.

537
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,926
My condition has been better, and right now,

538
00:33:56,821 --> 00:33:58,086
I don't sleepwalk anymore.

539
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:01,446
It's good that you take care of yourself.

540
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:04,766
But if possible,

541
00:34:06,726 --> 00:34:08,606
I also want to take care of you.

542
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:11,726
From now on, if there's anything,

543
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:13,646
please don't hide it from me.

544
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,246
I won't hide it anymore.

545
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:19,526
Mueang, don't be afraid I'll be too worried,

546
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,406
or I won't understand you.

547
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,966
I understand all of your conditions.

548
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:27,846
I used to have those depressing moments.

549
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:30,806
When I worked with Mr. Phudin,

550
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,926
it hurt you a lot, didn't it?

551
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:39,246
You didn't hurt me, Po.

552
00:34:39,564 --> 00:34:41,686
You made me stronger instead.

553
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:45,486
I want to be healthy so that I can live with you for a long time.

554
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:47,766
Is it still hard to fall asleep?

555
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,646
Sometimes.

556
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:54,766
Is there anything I can help you with?

557
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:00,726
You don't have to do anything.

558
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:03,126
No.

559
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:05,046
We're dating.

560
00:35:08,926 --> 00:35:11,326
Then, can you go into the house with me?

561
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:14,022
Actually,

562
00:35:14,436 --> 00:35:16,846
I've prepared something for you.

563
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,086
Here. You've been working hard recently.

564
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:29,806
If you want to rest, you can watch your favorite survival series here.

565
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:34,046
Oh, right.

566
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:36,486
Or do you want this?

567
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:40,686
We're going overseas with that.

568
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,886
Or like that?

569
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:48,286
You can watch this repeatedly to calm your mind.

570
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:56,006
Look. The sky is like the sky from when we first met.

571
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:06,566
From that day to today,

572
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:08,846
I feel like

573
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:11,286
I'm the only one who receives from you.

574
00:36:11,966 --> 00:36:14,486
It's like I can't help you at all.

575
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:18,326
That's not true.

576
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:21,566
You help me. You've helped me a lot.

577
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,166
Do you know?

578
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:28,326
On the night we were together at the beach

579
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:32,286
and the night we were stuck together in the storeroom

580
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:35,254
and I got to sleep near you,

581
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:37,886
they're the two nights that I feel like

582
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:40,486
it's the most peaceful sleep I've ever had.

583
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,366
Is that true?

584
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,846
Therefore,

585
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,006
if you want to help me...

586
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,086
Should I...

587
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:56,646
- Sleep with me.   - Sleep with you?

588
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:00,206
Every night.

589
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:03,126
Okay.

590
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:06,486
I'll sleep with you every night.

591
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:08,406
Then...

592
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:21,246
Can we move on to the next step?

593
00:37:23,822 --> 00:37:25,126
Shall we?

594
00:37:33,558 --> 00:37:35,486
Should we start it tonight?

595
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:23,006
Tomorrow,

596
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:25,526
you won't disappear like that day again, right?

597
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,966
I won't let you run away anymore.

598
00:41:02,966 --> 00:41:04,366
Why are you smiling?

599
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:07,446
I'm just happy that I see you when I wake up.

600
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:09,806
Is it still haunting you?

601
00:41:10,686 --> 00:41:12,086
Yes.

602
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,646
You left me alone on that day.

603
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,566
You wouldn't understand.

604
00:41:26,678 --> 00:41:29,286
Stop. Stop right there.

605
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,646
What's with you? Do you want to eat me or what?

606
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:36,446
- Just a bit.   - Just a bit?

607
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:44,486
- Hey.   - Take this.

608
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:46,766
- I give up.   - Take this.

609
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:53,166
I give up. That's enough.

610
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:55,126
Should we do it again?

611
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:00,806
No.

612
00:42:01,446 --> 00:42:02,926
We have to work.

613
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:06,166
I won't let you go.

614
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:09,546
Mueang, I have to do my work.

615
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:12,006
You also have your work to do.

616
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:24,926
Fine. I'll go.

617
00:42:25,078 --> 00:42:26,286
But tonight,

618
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:29,206
I won't stop easily.

619
00:42:34,037 --> 00:42:35,206
Please?

620
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:37,126
Please.

621
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:38,575
Please.

622
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:41,326
Hey.

623
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:46,926
I'm here to tell you I'm quitting.

624
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:50,526
Why are you quitting?

625
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,846
Does Wi know about this?

626
00:42:52,982 --> 00:42:56,406
No. Please don't tell Wi or the others right now.

627
00:43:18,757 --> 00:43:21,134
(Hello, I'm Phudin.)

628
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:23,677
(Today, I have something to tell you.)

629
00:43:24,366 --> 00:43:28,326
(You see, I've been a cool guy since I was born.)

630
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:29,646
(No matter what I do,)

631
00:43:29,742 --> 00:43:31,366
(it'll always look cool.)

632
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:32,606
(Turn left,)

633
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:33,846
(turn right,)

634
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:35,286
(walk straight,)

635
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:36,726
(walk backward,)

636
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:39,246
(turn around 360 degrees.)

637
00:43:39,646 --> 00:43:42,686
(Even if I squint my eyes, I still look cool.)

638
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,406
(Therefore, I've never had to make up with anyone.)

639
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:48,986
(And the thing I'd like to tell you is that)

640
00:43:49,246 --> 00:43:51,566
(please understand that)

641
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,646
(I'm not trying to make up with her.)

642
00:43:53,853 --> 00:43:56,326
(I'm only approaching her because)

643
00:43:56,726 --> 00:43:59,286
(I have something urgent to tell her.)

644
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:00,966
(You understand now, right?)

645
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,366
Hey.

646
00:44:07,726 --> 00:44:09,726
I called you. Didn't you hear me?

647
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,166
I'm busy.

648
00:44:11,444 --> 00:44:14,406
I'm looking at the performance of my 12th husband.

649
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:16,726
So, are you sulking now?

650
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:19,686
Not like that.

651
00:44:19,998 --> 00:44:22,366
I'm just staying still

652
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,926
in my own world

653
00:44:24,102 --> 00:44:26,102
like you told me to.

654
00:44:26,222 --> 00:44:28,686
You dare to argue with me now?

655
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:32,126
I'll tell you something.

656
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:34,486
I can even do more than this.

657
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:39,286
Really? Then do it. Don't just run your mouth. Do it.

658
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:43,246
Are you sure you won't get hurt?

659
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:45,686
Someone like you

660
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:47,966
can't hurt me.

661
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,366
I can.

662
00:44:51,846 --> 00:44:57,286
- Noen!   - What?

663
00:44:58,286 --> 00:45:00,566
You know my old name?

664
00:45:03,422 --> 00:45:05,006
Did you forget

665
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:10,126
that I was your number one fan, Din?

666
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,246
I know everything.

667
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,085
This isn't true.

668
00:45:16,078 --> 00:45:17,206
Noen

669
00:45:17,846 --> 00:45:20,446
Doensaduak.

670
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:23,429
You changed your name to Phudin

671
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:26,886
because you wanted to make it sound more magnificent, didn't you?

672
00:45:26,998 --> 00:45:31,246
My old name isn't suitable for my handsome face. Wi.

673
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:34,286
You won't tell anyone, right?

674
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,366
Wi, I...

675
00:45:40,326 --> 00:45:41,606
Please?

676
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:43,406
Oh my.

677
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:48,046
I've never seen you be so gentle with me before.

678
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:50,166
Wi, please. Wi.

679
00:45:50,926 --> 00:45:52,926
You won't tell anyone, right?

680
00:45:54,494 --> 00:45:56,966
I don't know.

681
00:45:58,101 --> 00:45:59,206
Wi.

682
00:45:59,477 --> 00:46:03,246
- Wi.   - I don't know.

683
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,886
Noen

684
00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:06,606
Doensaduak.

685
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,726
It's haunting me again.

686
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:11,006
Do you know

687
00:46:11,165 --> 00:46:15,243
that this place used to have a grand festival 20 years ago?

688
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:20,086
Yes. If I can bring that kind of atmosphere back to this place,

689
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:21,766
what do you think?

690
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:24,966
Wow! I'm so excited!

691
00:46:25,063 --> 00:46:28,246
I really love that kind of festival. Please bring it back.

692
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,326
I love that as well. Should we invite a lot of idols to come here?

693
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:33,126
So that there'll be a lot of tourists here.

694
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:35,846
I think your idols might be expensive for us.

695
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:38,406
Young Master, how much of the budget do we have?

696
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:41,486
Young Master, that's already 20 years ago.

697
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:44,446
But if no one comes this year, it'll be over.

698
00:46:46,046 --> 00:46:49,446
- That's true.   - We have to do this to make it exciting.

699
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:50,684
- It's fun as well.   - Yes.

700
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:53,726
- We'll have fun as well.   - If not, it'll be boring

701
00:46:53,807 --> 00:46:55,487
just listening to the sound of lions and peacocks.

702
00:46:55,518 --> 00:46:57,478
- Yeah.   - Please.

703
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:00,646
Are you sure

704
00:47:00,806 --> 00:47:02,286
you'll use the last batch of money

705
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:05,646
to hold a festival, even if you don't know if it will succeed?

706
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:07,606
Why don't you do something easy?

707
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:10,126
It's better than doing something difficult like this.

708
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:13,646
That's true.

709
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,886
But if we do it easily,

710
00:47:16,286 --> 00:47:17,726
it won't be memorable.

711
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:22,086
I don't want you to be sad, Mr. Mueang.

712
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:24,766
I'll be sad if it fails.

713
00:47:25,036 --> 00:47:26,646
However, I'll be sadder

714
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:28,326
if I don't try it.

715
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:32,046
Oh my.

716
00:47:33,914 --> 00:47:36,166
Thank you for worrying about me, Ms. Sita.

717
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:39,806
From now on, I probably need to borrow your karma for this.

718
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:43,486
- Everyone.   - Yes?

719
00:47:43,685 --> 00:47:45,886
Tell everyone in the park and the office

720
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:47,746
to come up with a theme.

721
00:47:48,355 --> 00:47:50,366
I'll give you a reward if you have good ideas.

722
00:47:51,475 --> 00:47:54,926
- Of course, Young Master.   - I'll think about it right now.

723
00:47:55,118 --> 00:47:57,766
Hello, Paeng. How are you?

724
00:47:57,957 --> 00:47:58,995
(I'm fine.)

725
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:02,966
(I'm back in Thailand. Where are you working now?)

726
00:48:03,806 --> 00:48:05,166
I'm in Chanthaburi.

727
00:48:05,646 --> 00:48:09,446
(Is that so? I was going to invite you to work in my office.)

728
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:11,126
(They're open for recruitment.)

729
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:15,046
(You can send them a portfolio. You can do an online interview as well.)

730
00:48:15,398 --> 00:48:17,526
(I remember you wanted to go to Canada.)

731
00:48:17,726 --> 00:48:19,126
(Are you still interested?)

732
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:22,486
(Hello, Po?)

733
00:48:23,357 --> 00:48:24,446
(Po.)

734
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,006
(Are you there, Po?)

735
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:32,046
Yes, Paeng. We'll talk about it later.

736
00:48:32,206 --> 00:48:34,606
- (Sure.)   - Goodbye.

737
00:48:43,077 --> 00:48:44,686
Hello, my friend.

738
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:49,646
I sent you the list of interesting influencers.

739
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:53,326
You should take a look to see who you like, okay?

740
00:48:54,036 --> 00:48:57,806
Thank you so much. You help me even though you still have your channel.

741
00:48:57,917 --> 00:48:59,366
It's alright.

742
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:01,966
Right, I forgot to tell you something.

743
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:04,006
I haven't really worked on my channel recently.

744
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:10,766
I feel like I have a creative block. I think I need a break.

745
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,646
I can't take a long break anyway. My money will run out first.

746
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:16,846
I understand.

747
00:49:17,886 --> 00:49:19,166
It's the same for me.

748
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:21,686
Well, we have to continue to work anyway.

749
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,886
Why did you say that? What's the matter?

750
00:49:25,325 --> 00:49:27,206
You just paid off your debt.

751
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:29,766
You have to celebrate. You have to have fun.

752
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,166
I don't know.

753
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:35,286
I feel like I'm lost recently.

754
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,926
I don't know what I want to do next.

755
00:49:38,085 --> 00:49:40,006
Your love life is still going well, isn't it?

756
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:44,446
There are some other parts of my life that I feel lost about.

757
00:49:46,446 --> 00:49:48,526
You can let it be sometimes.

758
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:53,526
It's not like our life needs to always be straightforward.

759
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:58,246
You can take a detour and stray from the main route.

760
00:49:58,477 --> 00:50:00,406
From the look of your face,

761
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:03,766
I already know you're really tired right now.

762
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,806
Po, you should ask yourself.

763
00:50:06,957 --> 00:50:09,126
When was the last time that you actually got to rest?

764
00:50:18,354 --> 00:50:19,886
Phudin Park.

765
00:50:20,942 --> 00:50:22,286
Phudin Park.

766
00:50:23,966 --> 00:50:26,664
Phudin Park has been here for a long time.

767
00:50:26,745 --> 00:50:28,966
You should come to Phudin Park.

768
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:32,126
Phudin Yo!

769
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:34,886
Phudin Park.

770
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:37,286
Phudin Park.

771
00:50:38,486 --> 00:50:39,886
Come in.

772
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,686
Phudin Park.

773
00:50:42,718 --> 00:50:44,166
Phudin Park.

774
00:50:45,926 --> 00:50:47,666
Did you call me, President?

775
00:50:47,855 --> 00:50:50,766
President called for Madam? Park!

776
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,798
That's enough.

777
00:50:54,478 --> 00:50:56,433
Well, I like it.

778
00:50:56,514 --> 00:50:58,486
But I think it can get even more exciting.

779
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,806
More? I think I already put everything into it.

780
00:51:01,886 --> 00:51:03,846
Boem, you're on the right track.

781
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:05,966
Think about it more and present it to me again.

782
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:10,486
Of course. I really think hip-hop is trendy right now.

783
00:51:10,646 --> 00:51:12,646
We should hold a hip-hop festival.

784
00:51:12,765 --> 00:51:14,686
That's what I want you to think more about.

785
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:16,006
Yes.

786
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:18,626
I'm leaving.

787
00:51:19,403 --> 00:51:21,726
If I leave, please don't do anything inappropriate.

788
00:51:21,807 --> 00:51:23,246
Get out.

789
00:51:26,805 --> 00:51:28,246
Phudin Park. Yo...

790
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,926
President, why did you call me here?

791
00:51:44,149 --> 00:51:46,726
We're alone. Just call me like normal.

792
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:51,886
Mueang, why did you call me here?

793
00:51:53,494 --> 00:51:55,086
I miss you.

794
00:51:56,358 --> 00:51:58,806
Listen, I'm busy right now.

795
00:52:00,246 --> 00:52:02,366
I can't wait for tonight.

796
00:52:03,462 --> 00:52:04,726
Are you crazy?

797
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,286
Be patient.

798
00:52:09,678 --> 00:52:11,126
You're mean.

799
00:52:13,022 --> 00:52:14,966
People will see us.

800
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:16,326
So what?

801
00:52:17,086 --> 00:52:18,966
We're just expressing our love.

802
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:23,366
Mueang, this is the office. Don't lose your concentration.

803
00:52:32,006 --> 00:52:33,246
Okay.

804
00:52:33,582 --> 00:52:35,486
Okay. I'll try.

805
00:52:37,046 --> 00:52:38,606
Good job.

806
00:52:39,677 --> 00:52:41,006
Then...

807
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:42,766
I'll get going.

808
00:52:49,145 --> 00:52:50,846
People will see us...

809
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:56,606
You!

810
00:52:57,046 --> 00:52:58,366
I'm leaving.

811
00:52:59,438 --> 00:53:00,646
I'm leaving.

812
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,230
Is this alright?

813
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,686
Let me see.

814
00:53:23,086 --> 00:53:26,126
You have talent. I think you're a fast learner.

815
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:28,846
- I'm great.   - Here.

816
00:53:30,558 --> 00:53:32,046
Yeah, you're great.

817
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:36,486
Right, when will Kit and Jiab come back?

818
00:53:37,286 --> 00:53:38,566
I want to introduce myself to them.

819
00:53:39,246 --> 00:53:40,526
I don't know.

820
00:53:40,942 --> 00:53:42,686
Mom didn't tell me about her flight.

821
00:53:52,822 --> 00:53:54,126
Speak of the devil.

822
00:53:54,701 --> 00:53:56,966
Let me answer my call for a second.

823
00:54:02,831 --> 00:54:05,286
- Hello?   - See you tomorrow.

824
00:54:06,646 --> 00:54:07,966
See you, Ing.

825
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:18,846
They'll be back tomorrow.

826
00:54:19,157 --> 00:54:20,286
That's good.

827
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:23,046
No, I don't want to see my parents.

828
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:34,766
It doesn't mean I don't want to introduce you to my parents.

829
00:54:35,693 --> 00:54:38,806
I just have a bit of a problem with my parents.

830
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,606
Well, not a bit.

831
00:54:42,253 --> 00:54:43,766
It's a big problem.

832
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:46,246
What are you scared of?

833
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:47,606
I'm with you.

834
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,606
You don't understand.

835
00:54:50,782 --> 00:54:53,366
My parents aren't as kind as yours.

836
00:54:54,581 --> 00:54:55,726
Ing,

837
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:58,486
I think it might be time.

838
00:54:59,326 --> 00:55:00,646
What time?

839
00:55:01,126 --> 00:55:02,926
The time to stop running away from problems.

840
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:13,886
I'll go see your parents with you.

841
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:33,206
Mueang, you're really warm.

842
00:55:34,573 --> 00:55:36,013
Am I like a heater?

843
00:55:40,298 --> 00:55:41,766
I can also adjust the heat.

844
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:44,806
This is the first level.

845
00:55:49,022 --> 00:55:50,366
Second level.

846
00:55:55,282 --> 00:55:56,806
Third level.

847
00:55:57,774 --> 00:56:00,166
What an advanced heater I have here.

848
00:56:00,326 --> 00:56:01,766
Of course.

849
00:56:04,526 --> 00:56:07,926
You can relax your arms a bit. I can't breathe.

850
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,926
Oh, sorry.

851
00:56:23,405 --> 00:56:24,486
So,

852
00:56:25,078 --> 00:56:26,686
is there any problem with your festival?

853
00:56:26,956 --> 00:56:28,166
It's pretty smooth.

854
00:56:28,477 --> 00:56:29,966
There's no problem.

855
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,750
Because you're the best.

856
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:35,486
Of course. I'm the best here.

857
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:38,166
I'm the top talent of Phudin Park.

858
00:56:50,293 --> 00:56:51,606
We're out of money?

859
00:56:52,262 --> 00:56:53,526
Who used it?

860
00:56:57,406 --> 00:56:58,686
Is it you?

861
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,246
It's me.

862
00:57:04,894 --> 00:57:06,477
Yes.

863
00:57:06,919 --> 00:57:09,246
Actually, we're not out of money yet.

864
00:57:09,774 --> 00:57:11,326
That's a little misleading.

865
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:14,606
Right now, you're using a lot of money to cover a lot of stuff.

866
00:57:14,813 --> 00:57:17,486
I'm afraid if this continues,

867
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:19,126
you'll be bankrupt soon enough.

868
00:57:23,518 --> 00:57:26,446
What could I do? I have to use it.

869
00:57:27,686 --> 00:57:31,406
I think we should lower the scale of the festival.

870
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:33,406
Make it a small festival.

871
00:57:34,078 --> 00:57:35,566
Don't let us go into the red.

872
00:57:42,133 --> 00:57:43,606
You're late, Ing.

873
00:57:44,821 --> 00:57:46,086
I'm sorry.

874
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:48,446
You shouldn't have come all the way here.

875
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:51,006
I can just visit you in Bangkok.

876
00:57:51,182 --> 00:57:54,406
It's fine. We also want to take some rest.

877
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:58,126
And who's this?

878
00:58:01,806 --> 00:58:04,246
Hello, I'm Tin.

879
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:06,006
I'm her boyfriend.

880
00:58:09,022 --> 00:58:10,182
Boyfriend?

881
00:58:13,086 --> 00:58:15,166
How did you two meet each other?

882
00:58:16,278 --> 00:58:17,806
We met through Uncle Din.

883
00:58:21,446 --> 00:58:24,606
And have you seen what Ing could do?

884
00:58:25,238 --> 00:58:26,766
I'll tell you

885
00:58:26,926 --> 00:58:28,406
my daughter is special.

886
00:58:32,662 --> 00:58:35,566
He means Ing is sometimes hard to understand.

887
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:38,846
Not really.

888
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:41,437
I think she's easy to understand.

889
00:58:41,606 --> 00:58:44,006
I just have to try to understand her for a bit.

890
00:58:44,726 --> 00:58:47,206
Also, Ing is really cute.

891
00:58:49,989 --> 00:58:51,206
Oh my.

892
00:58:51,366 --> 00:58:53,606
I feel better now when I heard you say that.

893
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,430
You seem fatter recently.

894
00:59:03,887 --> 00:59:05,886
You always like to eat what you want.

895
00:59:06,766 --> 00:59:08,366
Try to control your diet.

896
00:59:08,886 --> 00:59:10,126
Dad.

897
00:59:10,494 --> 00:59:12,966
My weight has been decreasing.

898
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,726
Really?

899
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,646
I think you should stop talking about that.

900
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:20,206
Ing might not feel good about it.

901
00:59:22,606 --> 00:59:24,086
You don't feel good?

902
00:59:29,006 --> 00:59:30,806
Tin, you might not be used to it yet.

903
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,326
In our family,

904
00:59:32,566 --> 00:59:34,486
we usually talk like this.

905
00:59:38,486 --> 00:59:40,246
How is your work?

906
00:59:42,053 --> 00:59:43,166
It's good,

907
00:59:43,366 --> 00:59:47,286
but I'd like more time to design the new collection.

908
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:49,166
More time?

909
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:51,366
How much more?

910
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:54,086
The brand of Ms. Saisamon's child

911
00:59:54,374 --> 00:59:56,046
has surpassed you by miles.

912
00:59:57,006 --> 00:59:58,406
What's her name?

913
00:59:59,101 --> 01:00:00,326
Cindy?

914
01:00:00,822 --> 01:00:02,006
Yes.

915
01:00:02,836 --> 01:00:06,446
Cindy could go like that because her boyfriend has a lot of connections.

916
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,566
You should try to learn about something like that then.

917
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:12,206
You've grown up and studied with her,

918
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:14,526
but you can't be compared to her at all.

919
01:00:23,877 --> 01:00:26,406
Please don't try to bring up serious topics here.

920
01:00:26,573 --> 01:00:28,246
Tin might be uncomfortable.

921
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,526
Just say what you want, Dad.

922
01:00:31,773 --> 01:00:34,406
I think I know why you're back.

923
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:36,926
Ing, don't be rude here.

924
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:38,846
Tin is sitting right there.

925
01:00:39,374 --> 01:00:40,846
It's fine.

926
01:00:41,406 --> 01:00:44,126
Tin, please bring some food from the kitchen for us.

927
01:00:48,142 --> 01:00:49,846
I want Tin to stay with me.

928
01:00:50,478 --> 01:00:51,806
You should go, Tin.

929
01:00:57,366 --> 01:01:00,126
If Ing wants me to stay, I'll stay.

930
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,166
Fine.

931
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:04,246
It's fine if you want that.

932
01:01:04,845 --> 01:01:07,549
I'll finally get to tell you what I need to tell you.

933
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:12,326
I'll get someone to help you manage the company.

934
01:01:12,814 --> 01:01:14,846
You can still show your face.

935
01:01:14,974 --> 01:01:17,766
Why? Her performance is already good enough.

936
01:01:17,862 --> 01:01:19,406
It's not good enough.

937
01:01:20,966 --> 01:01:22,606
Your secretary told me

938
01:01:22,814 --> 01:01:25,206
that you're also sick.

939
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:28,006
You should rest.

940
01:01:28,606 --> 01:01:29,966
Did you know about that?

941
01:01:30,134 --> 01:01:32,631
I don't know what problems you have

942
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:35,006
but don't try to ruin your life,

943
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:37,446
because it'll affect me.

944
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,326
Excuse me, I don't think I can just listen to you.

945
01:01:42,517 --> 01:01:45,646
I think the person who's ruining her is you.

946
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:47,806
Ing fell sick

947
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:50,206
because you always put pressure on her with everything.

948
01:01:50,366 --> 01:01:51,806
Don't you realize?

949
01:01:52,365 --> 01:01:53,966
It's not your business.

950
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:56,566
Ing's business is like my business.

951
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:59,206
I can't stand my girlfriend being hurt.

952
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:02,966
Ing, are you going to let your boyfriend

953
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:05,262
rebuke your dad like that?

954
01:02:05,374 --> 01:02:06,686
I didn't rebuke you.

955
01:02:06,917 --> 01:02:08,206
I'm just telling the truth.

956
01:02:08,365 --> 01:02:09,517
Ing.

957
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,046
Why are you staying still?

958
01:02:13,198 --> 01:02:15,446
Tin was right, Dad.

959
01:02:15,973 --> 01:02:18,566
I'm like this because of you.

960
01:02:18,966 --> 01:02:22,286
You always said that I wasn't good enough.

961
01:02:22,517 --> 01:02:26,286
How would I do anything well when I didn't dare to do anything?

962
01:02:26,662 --> 01:02:28,326
Don't try to blame us.

963
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,606
You're like this

964
01:02:30,766 --> 01:02:33,366
because you can't endure it enough.

965
01:02:33,486 --> 01:02:35,566
What do you want me to endure?

966
01:02:35,766 --> 01:02:38,566
I've been enduring it enough.

967
01:02:39,158 --> 01:02:41,158
I don't want to live like this anymore.

968
01:02:43,486 --> 01:02:45,566
From now on, I'll do what I want.

969
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:48,006
I'll never care if people want to judge me.

970
01:02:48,317 --> 01:02:52,326
I'm here today to tell you that

971
01:02:52,509 --> 01:02:55,366
you can take everything back. Do what you want.

972
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:58,326
- I'll build my own thing myself.   - Ing!

973
01:02:58,653 --> 01:03:00,846
- Don't do this to our child.   - What?

974
01:03:01,151 --> 01:03:03,126
I told you to look after her.

975
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,366
Why is she like this?

976
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:07,846
Both mother and her daughter are just good for nothing!

977
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,958
This whole family is good for nothing.

978
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:12,286
Can't you see how bad our family is?

979
01:03:12,886 --> 01:03:15,046
Stop right now. Sit down!

980
01:03:15,261 --> 01:03:16,446
No.

981
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:18,206
I won't stand it anymore.

982
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:21,166
I'll stop living this kind of life.

983
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:23,846
Let me go.

984
01:03:24,766 --> 01:03:26,606
Do you think that someone like you

985
01:03:27,398 --> 01:03:29,326
can do anything by yourself?

986
01:03:30,246 --> 01:03:31,246
Go.

987
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:32,926
Get out!

988
01:03:35,453 --> 01:03:36,926
I think Ing can do it.

989
01:03:37,126 --> 01:03:38,726
She can do it well.

990
01:03:42,421 --> 01:03:44,566
This is a medical certificate from her doctor.

991
01:03:44,781 --> 01:03:46,606
You should try to research her condition.

992
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:51,886
If you think you can't take care of Ing,

993
01:03:52,197 --> 01:03:53,726
I'll take care of her myself.

994
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:03,341
Don't try to come back then.

995
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:13,966
It's over.

996
01:04:14,542 --> 01:04:16,926
No one can hurt you anymore.

997
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:21,566
Thank you

998
01:04:21,974 --> 01:04:23,974
for making me brave enough to walk out.

999
01:04:25,646 --> 01:04:28,086
You did well today, Ing.

1000
01:04:29,854 --> 01:04:31,006
No.

1001
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:34,966
I thought my talk with Dad would be better than this.

1002
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,126
He wouldn't listen to me.

1003
01:04:45,309 --> 01:04:46,526
It's fine.

1004
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:50,406
Although everything didn't go as we wished,

1005
01:04:50,966 --> 01:04:54,246
we at least got to say what we wanted to say.

1006
01:04:58,582 --> 01:05:00,206
It's a relief.

1007
01:05:01,342 --> 01:05:04,486
It felt good, actually.

1008
01:05:05,246 --> 01:05:07,686
It's like I'm free of a burden.

1009
01:05:09,957 --> 01:05:12,406
I'm still confused about it right now, though.

1010
01:05:12,757 --> 01:05:14,757
I don't know where I should go.

1011
01:05:17,861 --> 01:05:19,326
You'll stay with me.

1012
01:05:20,446 --> 01:05:22,766
Dad and Mom are ready to welcome you.

1013
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:34,646
Let's stay together.

1014
01:05:38,478 --> 01:05:40,366
Can I stay with you?

1015
01:06:16,942 --> 01:06:18,286
You seem stressed.

1016
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:21,166
Didn't you say there's no problem with work?

1017
01:06:22,486 --> 01:06:25,966
If it's work, of course, there'll be some problems.

1018
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:28,926
What's the matter?

1019
01:06:31,646 --> 01:06:32,832
Po,

1020
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:35,846
do you know why I want to make this place

1021
01:06:36,157 --> 01:06:37,926
lively again?

1022
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:44,326
Because this place is full of good memories from when you were a child.

1023
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:46,006
Because of that too.

1024
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:49,366
It's not just that.

1025
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:52,206
In your mind, what is

1026
01:06:52,669 --> 01:06:53,726
a theme park?

1027
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:57,686
It's a place for children, maybe.

1028
01:06:58,461 --> 01:07:00,646
But I think it's not just a place for children.

1029
01:07:01,846 --> 01:07:03,886
It should be everyone's place.

1030
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:08,646
I want it to have something that everyone can enjoy together.

1031
01:07:09,422 --> 01:07:11,966
There are not that many places like that nowadays.

1032
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:14,486
Right now,

1033
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:16,886
I'm not sure if I can do it.

1034
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,246
Why do you think like that?

1035
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,606
I don't know.

1036
01:07:27,606 --> 01:07:29,046
I might be paranoid.

1037
01:07:34,326 --> 01:07:35,486
Mueang.

1038
01:07:37,213 --> 01:07:38,966
I believe you can do it.

1039
01:07:42,086 --> 01:07:43,246
Is it true?

1040
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:44,726
It's true.

1041
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,646
You should listen to the advice from someone who had a difficult life.

1042
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:52,206
If we encounter crazy stuff,

1043
01:07:52,487 --> 01:07:54,126
we also just need to be crazy about it.

1044
01:07:57,212 --> 01:07:58,486
Okay.

1045
01:07:59,486 --> 01:08:00,686
Are you ready?

1046
01:08:03,357 --> 01:08:04,606
Are you ready to get crazy?

1047
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:10,846
Okay.

1048
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:12,686
I'm ready.

1049
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:39,246
We'll take everyone back through time.

1050
01:08:39,343 --> 01:08:42,286
- Yeah!   - Yeah!

1051
01:08:47,214 --> 01:08:48,646
I love you, Mueang.

1052
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,766
I love you, Po.

1053
01:08:52,355 --> 01:08:53,566
Po.

1054
01:08:54,822 --> 01:08:55,966
Let's get married.

1055
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:59,686
Our relationship is a matter between us.

1056
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:01,406
We have to adjust it ourselves.

1057
01:09:01,627 --> 01:09:02,832
We can't.

1058
01:09:02,926 --> 01:09:05,406
If we could, you wouldn't come back this late.

1059
01:09:05,686 --> 01:09:06,926
Are you trying to pick a fight?

1060
01:09:07,597 --> 01:09:10,446
I've been enduring a lot of things as well.

1061
01:09:10,566 --> 01:09:11,886
Should we end it then?

1062
01:09:12,005 --> 01:09:13,829
Are you breaking up with me?

1063
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,846
If you're that tired about it,

1064
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,246
we should just break up.
