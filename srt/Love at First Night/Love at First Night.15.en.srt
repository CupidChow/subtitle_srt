1
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:01,846
I talked with Mr. Phudin.

2
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:03,695
He'd consider you as a candidate.

3
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:07,412
You might lose Ms. Apo to him at any time.

4
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,846
- Young Master. Aren't you jealous at all?   - I'm not!

5
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:12,845
If you lose, you'll leave and rot away in your house

6
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:15,342
and won't appear in front of Apo ever again.

7
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:17,966
I trust you, but I don't trust him.

8
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,918
If you trust me, you have to let me handle it.

9
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:22,205
You're being nosy again.

10
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:24,846
What's your relationship with her? Why are you mad on her behalf?

11
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:27,926
Don't touch Mueang.

12
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:30,125
He's always been there for me.

13
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:33,206
So, don't think you can compare yourself to Mueang.

14
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:36,106
If you like her, just hit on her.

15
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:39,162
She wouldn't know if you stayed still.

16
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,846
(Mom)

17
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:26,411
(Mom)

18
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:34,926
(Mom)

19
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:56,646
(Your dad and I will be back in Thailand at the end of this month.)

20
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,206
Hey, you!

21
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,406
Are you okay?

22
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,646
Are you alright?

23
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:59,366
I'll take you to the hospital. Come with me.

24
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:02,406
Just get me out of here.

25
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:11,606
Let's go.

26
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:21,726
Easy.

27
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:23,486
Sit down.

28
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:36,286
How are you feeling?

29
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,966
I'm feeling better.

30
00:05:41,286 --> 00:05:42,766
Are you sure you don't want to see a doctor?

31
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:49,366
I'm just hungry.

32
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,806
I think I'll be better after a meal.

33
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:56,549
Wait here. I'll be back.

34
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,206
Hey, you.

35
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:51,326
Are you crying?

36
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,446
I'm just hungry.

37
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,646
I don't think that is it.

38
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:02,646
I'm fine.

39
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,886
I'm really fine.

40
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:06,726
I was just

41
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:09,926
having a panic attack.

42
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,062
What? What did you have?

43
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:15,446
A panic attack.

44
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:18,126
Hey, a panic attack is not a "just."

45
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:19,966
I know,

46
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:21,566
but

47
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:23,446
right now, I'm still fine.

48
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,686
Something just triggered me. That's all.

49
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:31,166
Look. It's serious.

50
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:33,286
You can't leave this disease alone.

51
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,006
How do you want me to help you?

52
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:36,766
Let's go to the hospital.

53
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:41,446
I feel better now. I just want to sit here.

54
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,646
Can I?

55
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:49,726
You can.

56
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:55,246
If you

57
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:57,670
feel anything is wrong or not okay, let me know.

58
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:08,646
It's weird.

59
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,326
It should have been people close to me

60
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,126
who were here for me.

61
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,566
It's you that has been here for me.

62
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:24,286
Those people don't even know they did this to me.

63
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:30,046
Who are you talking about?

64
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,926
Those people who want me to be perfect.

65
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:39,686
Is family your safe zone?

66
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:44,206
I don't think that's the case for everyone.

67
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,206
So,

68
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:52,446
find your safe zone somewhere else.

69
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,366
Like me.

70
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:01,366
If you have something on your mind, you can talk to me.

71
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:07,566
Don't you hate me?

72
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:11,166
I don't.

73
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:14,646
I'm here to see you today

74
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:16,886
because I wanted to apologize.

75
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,166
I'm not really a good person.

76
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:24,846
I just like to play a moral police

77
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,246
to pick on you.

78
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,550
If anything happens, you can call me.

79
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:35,126
Okay?

80
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:41,766
I don't want to bother you. You live far from me.

81
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:44,206
If I want to come,

82
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:46,326
Bangkok is just one call away.

83
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:20,462
Lots of bubbles.

84
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,406
Spicy salad refill, please!

85
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,486
Boem, it's over there. Take it.

86
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:27,886
Take as much as you like.

87
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,397
This will fill us up!

88
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:41,366
Hey, stop...

89
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:44,766
What's that?

90
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,166
Sorry.

91
00:10:58,062 --> 00:10:59,846
That's a strange chemistry.

92
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:02,526
How did it get on my head?

93
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:06,926
Did you put this on me?

94
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:08,926
I didn't. Did you eat carelessly?

95
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:13,246
No! It's from one of these dishes.

96
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,126
Here.

97
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:18,646
Okay. I'll stop.

98
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:23,526
That's an affair! That's so not good!

99
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:27,726
I'll drop you off at the old man's after the meeting.

100
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:29,006
Okay.

101
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:30,766
Are you hungry?

102
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:32,326
What are you going to cook for me?

103
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,606
Just an omelet.

104
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:39,086
Omelet you in my heart.

105
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:56,006
(I got fired yesterday, so I got drunk.)

106
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:29,191
Here.

107
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:30,886
Right here.

108
00:12:58,766 --> 00:12:59,766
Okay.

109
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,746
I'm in, but there's a little trouble.

110
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:10,406
This is getting fun.

111
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:19,566
I think one of Phudin Park's weaknesses is PR.

112
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,926
Oh. It's because of Wi. She does nothing

113
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,686
but stick her nose in other people's business.

114
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:25,966
So,

115
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:28,325
should we get Phing to help with this?

116
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:31,646
If your friend's okay with that, I'm okay.

117
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:35,406
Okay. Get Phing to do the PR. Of course.

118
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:05,766
What else do you think we missed?

119
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:12,886
Well, there's nothing.

120
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:16,366
Why are you eating your own lip? Are you hungry?

121
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,246
I am.

122
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:23,166
If you are, we can get something to eat.

123
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:37,702
What is it, Om?

124
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:39,326
Sis, help me.

125
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,286
What's wrong, Om?

126
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:44,686
I can't live in this house anymore.

127
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:46,246
What's going on?

128
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:50,366
Left flank. I'll go right. There's one. Did you see them?

129
00:14:50,462 --> 00:14:53,686
Yeah, shoot them. Nice. There you go. Hey!

130
00:14:55,086 --> 00:14:57,606
What's that? What's wrong?

131
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,646
Oh, man.

132
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,046
What's going on?

133
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:06,046
I'm in the middle of a match.

134
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:18,006
Mom? Ri?

135
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:26,126
Mom? Ri?

136
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,206
Did anyone notice the power's out?

137
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:32,766
Mom?

138
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,206
Ri?

139
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:40,246
Mom? Ri?

140
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,126
It's me. Why are you screaming?

141
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,526
I thought you were a ghost!

142
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:49,646
Does my face look gray?

143
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:52,166
Yeah. Your face is paler than your neck.

144
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:56,526
Whoa! I can't help it. I did my makeup in the dark!

145
00:15:57,445 --> 00:16:00,035
So what happened? Did the transformer explode again?

146
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,646
I think Mom didn't pay the bills.

147
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:05,286
What? Mom didn't pay the bills?

148
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:11,566
I had to pay the bills to get power.

149
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,806
(Sis, I can't take this anymore.)

150
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:18,006
I gave Mom some of my streaming earnings,

151
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:19,926
but it's not enough.

152
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,261
It's never enough with Aunt Da.

153
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:30,406
You're right. I'm so fricking sick and tired.

154
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,283
I really didn't want to bother you,

155
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,326
but darn! I can't take it anymore.

156
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:38,566
(I don't know who to talk to.)

157
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:40,406
Calm down.

158
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,886
Tell me what Aunt Da did.

159
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:46,821
(I'll tell you one by one.)

160
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:48,726
She's been shopping online every morning.

161
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:50,126
She said

162
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:53,086
she didn't have money to pay the bills, but she's shopping?

163
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,606
(Is that acceptable?)

164
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,366
(I'm lost for words.)

165
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:16,726
Are you okay?

166
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,046
Are you alright?

167
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:23,206
How is she doing?

168
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:31,766
If I want to come,

169
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:33,941
Bangkok is just one call away.

170
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:47,086
I'll go home.

171
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:50,166
Are you okay now?

172
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:54,246
I'll give you a ride home.

173
00:18:00,837 --> 00:18:02,006
Hey!

174
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:07,566
Watch out.

175
00:18:10,286 --> 00:18:11,606
Thanks.

176
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:14,206
Didn't you see the step?

177
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,006
Don't be an idiot.

178
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,933
Watch where you're going. Don't use your phone.

179
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,525
I would have slapped you on any other day.

180
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:37,046
Is she just a silly girl?

181
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,806
Did she fall on her face?

182
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,646
That was close!

183
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:56,734
Let's go.

184
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:04,006
It's more serious than I thought.

185
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,886
Apo, are you really going home?

186
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,806
I am. I'm worried about Om.

187
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:15,446
I haven't talked to Aunt Da and Ri since that incident.

188
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:17,446
You really don't need me to come with you?

189
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:18,846
Don't come.

190
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:20,486
Stay here and do your work.

191
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:22,566
I'll leave the PR with you.

192
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:24,686
Fine. Don't worry about that.

193
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:26,206
Just come back soon.

194
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:28,246
I hope it goes well.

195
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,126
Amen.

196
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:32,486
They're going to get it this time.

197
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,726
I'll be there with you as soon as my work is done.

198
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:45,926
No need. I'm fine by myself.

199
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,806
I'm worried.

200
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:51,566
Mueang, I'm going home, not to war.

201
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:53,846
It's the same.

202
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,526
You know what? I'll keep you updated, okay?

203
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:01,206
Okay.

204
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:06,006
Be careful until you see me, okay?

205
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,126
Roger that.

206
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:21,966
Thank you.

207
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:33,486
Drive safely.

208
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,910
Yes, Young Master.

209
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,246
Have a safe travel.

210
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,526
I'm going now.

211
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,766
Wait.

212
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:52,726
Before you go,

213
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:57,006
can I hug you?

214
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:02,246
You can.

215
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,126
It's a hand hug.

216
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:14,566
Oh.

217
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:17,886
Hand hug.

218
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,286
Be back soon.

219
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:36,766
Text me when you get there.

220
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:38,846
I will.

221
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:41,206
I'm off.

222
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,926
Apo!

223
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:27,686
Thanks for coming.

224
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:32,326
Where is Aunt Da?

225
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:33,846
She's in her room.

226
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,366
I told her you're coming,

227
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:39,926
but she doesn't want to see you.

228
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,566
Why are you here?

229
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,526
I thought we were strangers.

230
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,126
Ri!

231
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:49,846
She's here to help us.

232
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:52,926
To help or to rub salt in our wounds?

233
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:56,446
We'll talk about us later.

234
00:22:58,046 --> 00:22:59,486
I'll go and see Aunt Da.

235
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:13,406
Aunt Da, it's me, Apo.

236
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:22,328
Aunt Da, please come out.

237
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:24,086
I need to talk to you.

238
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:26,366
Aunt Da.

239
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:29,006
She won't come out no matter how you call. Just leave.

240
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,526
Ri, be quiet!

241
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:36,773
Aunt Da!

242
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:42,518
Aunt Da?

243
00:23:57,573 --> 00:23:58,766
Mueang.

244
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:01,102
What?

245
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,886
I asked you to check something out.

246
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,406
How did it go?

247
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:09,526
It's done.

248
00:24:09,974 --> 00:24:13,166
- I have made contact.   - Good. Let's do this.

249
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:24,926
My dad said you were so interested in Siamese ruby.

250
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:26,646
According to my study,

251
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:27,966
I think

252
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:30,966
there are large pieces of Siamese ruby here.

253
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:34,966
In my dad's mines?

254
00:24:35,086 --> 00:24:36,126
No.

255
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:38,166
In your Bo Phloi.

256
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:42,966
Hey. I don't think that's possible.

257
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:45,246
Let me prove it to you then.

258
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:50,326
Do you know there are foreign gem traders

259
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:54,046
willing to pay to support your mining activities?

260
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:57,526
Do you mean those who want us to mine for them for cheap?

261
00:24:57,966 --> 00:25:02,886
Not those guys. I mean those who want to do fair business with you.

262
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:05,366
You sound like someone's agent.

263
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:09,566
I'm not a representative or agent of anyone.

264
00:25:10,229 --> 00:25:12,886
I'm only using my talents

265
00:25:13,006 --> 00:25:15,086
for Mr. Phudin, who has hired me.

266
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,726
If you guys don't believe me

267
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,686
and still use your bias against me,

268
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:23,326
I can do nothing.

269
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,606
Someone must have sent Game here.

270
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,206
I think so.

271
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:39,806
He passed out near my Bo Phloi all of a sudden.

272
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,566
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

273
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,286
Should we get him?

274
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:46,446
Right now, he can still talk his way out.

275
00:25:46,926 --> 00:25:48,766
Let him show his colors first.

276
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:53,686
Good. When he does, I'll wash them out.

277
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:56,406
And I'll erase him.

278
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,526
Are you still here?

279
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:55,366
I won't leave until I get to talk to you.

280
00:26:57,461 --> 00:26:59,461
I don't want to talk to you.

281
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:02,823
Aunt Da, wait.

282
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:05,526
Aunt Da, talk to me.

283
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,086
I don't want to!

284
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,806
But you have to.

285
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:10,982
I found out from Om.

286
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:12,726
You can't live like this.

287
00:27:12,861 --> 00:27:13,861
Why can't I?

288
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,526
I'm old, and I can die anytime.

289
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:19,526
Can't I spoil myself?

290
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:23,188
You've been spoiling yourself all your life, haven't you?

291
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:26,446
It's all of us who have been living your life.

292
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:33,185
You have to start thinking about Om and Ri more.

293
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,566
If you don't save money,

294
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:38,119
it won't be just the power next time. You'll get your house seized!

295
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,726
Don't lecture me!

296
00:27:40,637 --> 00:27:42,286
I didn't want to lecture you,

297
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:45,661
but there's no way except to say this to your face.

298
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:49,227
- The banks will come and...   - Shut up!

299
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:51,525
Go away! Go back to where you came from!

300
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:53,086
- Aunt Da.   - Mom!

301
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,966
- Let's talk.   - Go! Get out!

302
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:58,286
- I won't talk! Get out!   - Mom!

303
00:27:58,367 --> 00:27:59,806
I said leave!

304
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,230
- Get out of my house!   - Aunt Da!

305
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:04,406
- Get out!   - About this...

306
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:07,892
- We need to talk, Aunt Da.   - I won't talk to you!

307
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:09,046
Mom!

308
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:11,222
- Aunt Da!   - Go!

309
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:12,316
Stop, Mom!

310
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
- Aunt Da, listen.   - No!

311
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:15,926
- Just get out!   - Mom!

312
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:22,246
Go back.

313
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,726
Go back to live your happy life in that house.

314
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,765
I'll go back, Aunt Da,

315
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:28,766
after we talk about this.

316
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:31,286
So you're the smart one now?

317
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:33,286
You won't listen to me now, will you?

318
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:36,846
Mom! Just talk nicely. She came all the way here.

319
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,646
I didn't ask her to come!

320
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:39,846
Calm down, Mom.

321
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:41,966
I know you're angry, but you can drop your act.

322
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:44,166
You two look at her!

323
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:45,446
Look in her eyes!

324
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:47,566
Look how she looks at us with disdain.

325
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,406
Aunt Da.

326
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:51,766
When will you stop seeing me in a bad way?

327
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:53,886
Can't you see the good things I did?

328
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:56,037
You've lived your life comfortably until now,

329
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:58,246
partly because of what I did, right?

330
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:01,406
- You!   - Mom!

331
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:02,926
Are you saying I owe you?

332
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,966
How does it feel, Aunt Da?

333
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:08,446
What's it like getting told you owe someone?

334
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,828
Aunt Da.

335
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,293
I used to want to be your family,

336
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:13,966
but if it's impossible,

337
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:15,806
I don't want to force it anymore.

338
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:17,606
You don't have to love me.

339
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:19,749
You don't have to see me as family,

340
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:23,566
but please see me as a human.

341
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,406
Apo, that's too far!

342
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:26,806
It's not too far at all, Ri,

343
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:29,406
compared to what you and Aunt Da did to me.

344
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:32,886
I graduated and got a salary of 15,000 baht.

345
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:34,766
I had to earn more money.

346
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:37,846
I tried to do everything to repay you.

347
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,846
You think I don't want to take care of you.

348
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:43,686
You think I don't want to repay you for raising me. I do!

349
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:47,326
I tried everything a girl can do.

350
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,086
But you and Ri,

351
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,846
you never appreciated what I did!

352
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,406
The only one who appreciated what I did was Om.

353
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:59,166
Today, I'm here for him.

354
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,006
If you and Aunt Da could recognize,

355
00:30:03,293 --> 00:30:04,686
if you could realize you were wrong,

356
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,006
I'll help you.

357
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:08,926
If you can't, I'm taking him with me today.

358
00:30:09,061 --> 00:30:12,206
You and Ri can survive on your own.

359
00:30:12,606 --> 00:30:15,766
Hey, are you trying to leave us too?

360
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:17,766
Do I have a choice?

361
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,646
Get out! I said get out!

362
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,126
- Mom!   - Mom!

363
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:29,846
So you still don't realize?

364
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:35,406
Om, pack your bags.

365
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:38,006
Don't go, Om!

366
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:41,108
Leave! I told you to leave!

367
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:44,086
- Why are you still here? Leave!   - Om!

368
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:46,006
Come. Come to Chanthaburi with me today.

369
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:48,046
No, Om! Don't go!

370
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:49,366
You go!

371
00:30:49,454 --> 00:30:51,726
You won't leave? You're defying me, right?

372
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:56,526
Don't go, Om.

373
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:58,206
Let me go, Ri.

374
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:05,486
(I used to believe time could change things.)

375
00:31:06,606 --> 00:31:07,886
(But)

376
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:22,086
(some things in my life)

377
00:31:23,526 --> 00:31:26,846
(feel like they're stuck in the same never-ending loop.)

378
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,286
(Now,)

379
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:45,086
(have I)

380
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,888
(finally escaped that loop?)

381
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:13,446
- Mom! Stop!   - Mom!

382
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:18,126
- Mom!  - Mom! Stop!

383
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:19,526
That's enough, Mom!

384
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:24,446
How did you get here?

385
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:26,246
I told you I'd come.

386
00:32:28,086 --> 00:32:29,886
How did you get into my house?

387
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:31,526
It wasn't locked.

388
00:32:38,326 --> 00:32:40,126
You guys really won't learn your lesson?

389
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:42,086
What are you going to do to me now?

390
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,190
I'm old enough to be your aunt!

391
00:32:44,308 --> 00:32:45,340
So what?

392
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,966
You have to respect me!

393
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:51,086
I only respect age with wisdom, not age with stupidity.

394
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:52,486
Stop!

395
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,886
You're looking to sell a building, aren't you?

396
00:32:58,021 --> 00:33:00,126
- How did you know?   - I saw the notice.

397
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:02,166
Right, Tin?

398
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,566
I was the one who contacted you earlier.

399
00:33:15,258 --> 00:33:16,686
I asked you to check something out.

400
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:18,166
How did it go?

401
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,446
It's done.

402
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:21,046
I have made contact.

403
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:25,326
I thought I would help. I got money.

404
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:28,326
Seeing this now, I'd rather not.

405
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,486
You won't learn your lesson.

406
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:33,766
What should we do?

407
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,766
Should we demolish the building?

408
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:40,486
Who are you guys?

409
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:42,606
Are you mafias or something?

410
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:44,646
Why are you so cruel?

411
00:33:45,838 --> 00:33:47,086
Me?

412
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,686
I'm the ghost that haunts you!

413
00:33:58,022 --> 00:34:00,926
When someone gives you a chance, you should learn to take it.

414
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,006
Someday, your chance is going to run out, you know?

415
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:08,366
Make your decision carefully, old lady.

416
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,406
Yeah.

417
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,246
If you get this decision wrong, your life will never be the same.

418
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,166
Thugs invaded my house! Help!

419
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,244
Thugs invaded my house! Help!

420
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,486
Help! Please help!

421
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,766
Thugs invaded my house!

422
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:35,566
Why are you keeping your umbrella up? Do you think it blocks sunlight?

423
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,886
You're lucky

424
00:34:38,046 --> 00:34:39,606
I brought this umbrella with me.

425
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:41,566
That's how you got that nice scene.

426
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,566
You won't leave?

427
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,086
We're here.

428
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:15,926
We got here on cue.

429
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:18,266
Yeah, we did.

430
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:22,806
What's taking her so long?

431
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:26,966
Why don't we go inside?

432
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:29,046
They can arrest me for trespassing.

433
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:32,846
Whoa, is that too late? You made your dramatic entrance like that.

434
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:36,806
You won't dare anymore. These days,

435
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,926
we've really retired from that business.

436
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:43,126
- I won't risk it.   - Yeah. That business...

437
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:45,086
What business?

438
00:35:51,071 --> 00:35:52,326
You don't have to know.

439
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,806
It's from our childhood.

440
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:56,406
Ms. Apo's here. I have to go.

441
00:35:56,606 --> 00:35:57,926
Thanks.

442
00:35:59,214 --> 00:36:00,214
I'll be on my way.

443
00:36:00,382 --> 00:36:01,646
Thank you.

444
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:29,286
Why are you looking at me like that?

445
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,326
I'm not familiar with this look.

446
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:39,246
You in a suit look like you're from another universe.

447
00:36:41,126 --> 00:36:42,166
What universe?

448
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:43,406
Well,

449
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:45,526
it's a universe where you're more dramatic.

450
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,486
Am I usually not dramatic?

451
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:51,086
Usually? You're funny.

452
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:53,526
Do you think funny is the only thing I am?

453
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:59,166
I can be something else too.

454
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:07,566
We should talk about Aunt Da.

455
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:12,006
She said she needed a night to sleep on it.

456
00:37:12,846 --> 00:37:14,526
She seems really scared of you.

457
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:18,846
Am I scary?

458
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:25,206
Well, you look like a former thug. Were you one?

459
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:29,406
Let's say I had a rough time in my childhood.

460
00:37:30,686 --> 00:37:33,006
So what Boem told me was true.

461
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:35,606
You were a nasty kid, weren't you?

462
00:37:37,246 --> 00:37:38,446
A little.

463
00:37:38,862 --> 00:37:40,326
I made my life worth living.

464
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,486
But don't worry.

465
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,766
I've long retired from that life.

466
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:47,966
I said I'd demolish the building. That was an empty threat.

467
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:49,406
You were convincing.

468
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:53,886
So won't you let me in?

469
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:57,046
Why would you come in?

470
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,526
You're staying here.

471
00:37:58,854 --> 00:38:01,326
- I'm staying here.   - Then I will too.

472
00:38:04,206 --> 00:38:06,326
How can I leave you alone with those people?

473
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:08,326
Let's go.

474
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:30,686
Mom.

475
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:33,246
Why are we scared of him? Isn't this our house?

476
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:35,886
Is he scary?

477
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:41,926
Very.

478
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:50,886
(So this is the house Apo grew up in.)

479
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,886
Apo's height in first grade and second grade?

480
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:06,286
Mom.

481
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:08,806
Why is he laughing at a column?

482
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:10,446
How would I know?

483
00:39:10,787 --> 00:39:14,365
The column must feel funny to him.

484
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:20,726
Mueang.

485
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:26,726
I got a bed for you.

486
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,526
Can you sleep with Om?

487
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,686
Well, is he okay with that?

488
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:36,486
Okay. Just don't roll me out of bed.

489
00:39:37,014 --> 00:39:38,686
I sleep still like a corpse.

490
00:39:41,486 --> 00:39:44,526
Om, if he sleepwalks, tell me.

491
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:46,406
He sleepwalks?

492
00:39:49,114 --> 00:39:50,286
You two.

493
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:55,726
We'll talk about our deal tomorrow.

494
00:39:57,422 --> 00:39:58,966
- Do we have to talk?   - Do we have to talk?

495
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:00,486
Yeah.

496
00:40:07,974 --> 00:40:09,566
It's done.

497
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:14,486
I hope you can eat it. This is the only thing I can cook.

498
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:17,446
Let's eat!

499
00:40:31,158 --> 00:40:32,846
Is it not good?

500
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:44,926
You

501
00:40:45,086 --> 00:40:47,286
put too much fish sauce in?

502
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,126
Is it too salty?

503
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:54,886
- Give me. Don't eat.   - It's fine. No.

504
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:56,486
I can eat this.

505
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,526
I'm a healthy young man. My kidneys are healthy. I can handle this.

506
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:03,766
Sorry.

507
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:07,366
Don't be. I'm really fine.

508
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,886
Are you really?

509
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:27,189
So,

510
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:32,766
about what I asked. Did you get it?

511
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:36,566
Sorry. I forgot. Wait a minute.

512
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:37,894
Don't eat this.

513
00:41:38,086 --> 00:41:40,206
Really. I'll go get it.

514
00:41:54,290 --> 00:42:00,166
I tried looking for your photos. Is there none?

515
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:04,566
Aunt Da didn't frame my photos.

516
00:42:19,846 --> 00:42:22,406
Whoa! You have an aura since you were a kid.

517
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:27,766
Man...

518
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,926
Were you a beauty queen?

519
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:34,646
Were you a cheerleader? Were you?

520
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:37,246
I didn't really like the school's activities.

521
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,846
Your face looked so bright.

522
00:42:53,229 --> 00:42:54,966
Is this all of your childhood photos?

523
00:42:56,918 --> 00:43:01,206
After my parents died, no one took photos of me.

524
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:02,846
It's good, right?

525
00:43:03,006 --> 00:43:07,726
That wasn't a good time of my life. Why would I keep photos?

526
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:12,086
I wish we had met sooner.

527
00:43:12,765 --> 00:43:15,446
We'd probably have had a better childhood.

528
00:43:16,414 --> 00:43:19,086
I would have taken photos of you.

529
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:51,446
Your bang splits.

530
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,406
- Whoa!   - It's your turn to shower!

531
00:44:11,669 --> 00:44:13,646
- Okay.  - Follow me!

532
00:44:14,046 --> 00:44:16,126
Okay.

533
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:22,246
- Follow me!   - Yeah.

534
00:44:22,886 --> 00:44:25,486
- Is your cousin going to kill me?   - I don't know.

535
00:44:27,446 --> 00:44:28,806
I have to go.

536
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:41,286
Will he make it?

537
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,366
(Is your cousin going to kill me?)

538
00:44:51,766 --> 00:44:53,326
(Is your cousin going to kill me?)

539
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,406
Come in.

540
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:25,046
Where's Mueang?

541
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,726
In the shower.

542
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:31,806
Okay.

543
00:45:31,926 --> 00:45:33,646
- Good night.   - Night.

544
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,086
I got killed!

545
00:45:51,086 --> 00:45:53,606
Apo, I won't kill him.

546
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:55,539
Okay.

547
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:57,966
- I'll leave you be.   - Good night.

548
00:45:58,133 --> 00:45:59,366
Good night.

549
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:13,486
Two in the front. Follow them. Go.

550
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,406
What?

551
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:19,486
- Quick! To your right!   - Are you okay?

552
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:21,206
Two on the right. Look at your map!

553
00:46:21,286 --> 00:46:22,606
I'm okay.

554
00:46:22,717 --> 00:46:25,646
I have to be quiet. Your cousin is streaming.

555
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,366
Hey! I need to concentrate!

556
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:32,446
Sorry.

557
00:46:34,246 --> 00:46:37,246
Follow them up. In your face. Nice!

558
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:38,406
Be careful.

559
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:40,246
Okay.

560
00:46:41,325 --> 00:46:42,846
Good night.

561
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:45,206
Go in! Attack!

562
00:46:46,397 --> 00:46:47,606
Attack!

563
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:52,086
Two on your right. Your right. Open fire.

564
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:07,566
I think he'll be fine.

565
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:12,286
Please survive.

566
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,966
I'm tired.

567
00:47:37,518 --> 00:47:38,798
I have to go to bed.

568
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:46,646
Lights out?

569
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:12,126
Thanks for being there for Apo.

570
00:48:15,406 --> 00:48:18,526
She keeps telling me how nice you are to her.

571
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,046
It's nothing.

572
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,726
I barely did anything, little bro.

573
00:48:25,846 --> 00:48:27,246
Little bro?

574
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:29,286
When did we become friends?

575
00:48:29,526 --> 00:48:30,846
Just now?

576
00:48:32,006 --> 00:48:34,726
Fine. I'll call you bro.

577
00:48:34,975 --> 00:48:36,446
It's easier when we talk.

578
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,046
Okay.

579
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,646
I don't know

580
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:43,206
what it's like between you and Apo.

581
00:48:43,694 --> 00:48:47,286
But if you make my cousin sad, I'll kill you, bro.

582
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:50,334
Yeah, I get it.

583
00:48:52,052 --> 00:48:55,606
So, what stage are you at with her just now?

584
00:48:55,937 --> 00:49:00,286
Just now? Forget it. It's nothing.

585
00:49:01,326 --> 00:49:02,326
What stage?

586
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,461
We're learning about each other.

587
00:49:04,998 --> 00:49:09,206
If you'd be kind, little bro, tell me something about her.

588
00:49:09,773 --> 00:49:11,206
I want to know more about her.

589
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:13,126
Ask me.

590
00:49:13,606 --> 00:49:14,966
I'll answer what I can.

591
00:49:18,742 --> 00:49:21,646
Usually, before she opens up to someone,

592
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:23,653
does it take long?

593
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:27,646
Well, it took her last boyfriend a year.

594
00:49:28,357 --> 00:49:29,494
A year?

595
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,446
Why? Can't you wait?

596
00:49:32,494 --> 00:49:34,606
I can. It's nothing.

597
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:39,566
What next? What does she like to eat?

598
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:43,286
Somtam with crabs and pickled fish, extra spicy.

599
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:45,646
- How spicy?   - How would I know?

600
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:47,686
How many chili?

601
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:50,566
A handful.

602
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:53,126
- Whoa, that's spicy.   - Yeah!

603
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:55,446
- Your anus could hurt!   - Your "stomach!"

604
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:58,366
Are you mad? You can't say that to a girl!

605
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:18,366
Won't you call and ask how I'm doing?

606
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:28,854
Hello?

607
00:50:28,935 --> 00:50:32,486
(Hello, this is a reminder for your overdue payment.)

608
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,276
(You have unpaid credit card spending.)

609
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,226
(Please press nine.)

610
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:44,326
A scammer again.

611
00:50:50,807 --> 00:50:53,358
(Tin)

612
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:56,846
Hello?

613
00:50:58,653 --> 00:50:59,846
Hello?

614
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,926
Bangkok is just one call away.

615
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,206
Are you hungry tonight too?

616
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:25,166
- Yummy.   - How are you?

617
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:28,966
Me?

618
00:51:30,902 --> 00:51:32,246
I'm good.

619
00:51:32,854 --> 00:51:34,166
Let's eat.

620
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,766
I've wanted this for so long.

621
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:45,526
They always have long queues.

622
00:51:47,158 --> 00:51:48,406
I'll eat now?

623
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:54,366
So good!

624
00:52:02,351 --> 00:52:03,406
Hey.

625
00:52:03,814 --> 00:52:05,166
What happened to you?

626
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:08,646
Nothing.

627
00:52:08,846 --> 00:52:11,526
Something happened. You got bruises all over.

628
00:52:11,845 --> 00:52:13,845
I collect bruises as a hobby.

629
00:52:15,046 --> 00:52:16,326
Seriously.

630
00:52:16,557 --> 00:52:17,966
Did someone hurt you?

631
00:52:18,174 --> 00:52:20,326
Tell me. I'll take you to the police.

632
00:52:21,174 --> 00:52:22,926
Ms. Ing, who did this to you?

633
00:52:23,213 --> 00:52:24,701
You can't let them go.

634
00:52:24,782 --> 00:52:25,925
This is assault.

635
00:52:26,006 --> 00:52:28,686
It's violence. Tell me who did this to you.

636
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:29,966
I did.

637
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,686
These are marks of me living a wild life.

638
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:37,822
This one on my leg was from this morning.

639
00:52:37,902 --> 00:52:40,606
The one on my hand was from this afternoon.

640
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:43,246
I got this one this evening.

641
00:52:43,757 --> 00:52:44,966
So,

642
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:47,286
- all of these are...   - Yeah.

643
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:49,406
Accidents.

644
00:52:54,398 --> 00:52:57,806
I didn't think you'd be this clumsy.

645
00:52:59,494 --> 00:53:01,126
Neither did I.

646
00:53:01,302 --> 00:53:03,126
It's like a curse.

647
00:53:03,926 --> 00:53:05,406
Curse, my butt!

648
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:07,646
You just lack focus.

649
00:53:07,773 --> 00:53:10,246
You don't watch where you're going.

650
00:53:10,556 --> 00:53:12,556
You're not me. You don't understand.

651
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:14,446
Where is your first aid kit?

652
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:16,526
Leave me alone. They'll heal.

653
00:53:17,124 --> 00:53:18,326
Where is it?

654
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:25,189
Probably over there.

655
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:26,886
Wipe this off.

656
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:45,126
I'm not dressing my wounds.

657
00:53:45,215 --> 00:53:46,404
I don't like the smell.

658
00:53:46,485 --> 00:53:48,166
It gets on my hands. And now

659
00:53:48,247 --> 00:53:49,926
I'm eating this.

660
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:00,606
Excuse me.

661
00:54:43,356 --> 00:54:44,726
All done.

662
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:47,566
Be careful when you do things.

663
00:54:47,765 --> 00:54:49,406
You're not getting younger.

664
00:54:49,805 --> 00:54:52,366
If you fall and break something, that can be dangerous.

665
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:57,846
You're a serious case.

666
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:01,166
I think you need a personal radar to give you a warning.

667
00:55:02,246 --> 00:55:03,606
Personal radar?

668
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:07,486
For when you walk,

669
00:55:07,828 --> 00:55:09,446
I'll warn you like

670
00:55:09,527 --> 00:55:12,311
"beep" before you hit something.

671
00:55:13,326 --> 00:55:14,606
Is that good?

672
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,686
Good idea.

673
00:55:17,926 --> 00:55:20,046
You just have to be with me all the time.

674
00:55:22,117 --> 00:55:23,366
Do you want me to?

675
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:29,846
If you have time, you can come. I don't mind.

676
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:34,886
Well, I do have time.

677
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:37,126
Should I come and pick you up every day?

678
00:55:48,189 --> 00:55:49,589
It's up to you.

679
00:55:58,097 --> 00:55:59,686
Why is she taking so long?

680
00:56:00,526 --> 00:56:03,206
Rut, you can take a month off.

681
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:05,246
Don't drive for me this month.

682
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:13,526
I called my driver.

683
00:56:18,902 --> 00:56:20,046
Too quick.

684
00:56:21,286 --> 00:56:23,526
You promised me. Keep your promise.

685
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:46,446
The water's finished. I'll go get some.

686
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:55,326
That was two millimeters away from a new bruise.

687
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:30,406
Is he still alive?

688
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:41,686
I'm coming in.

689
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:54,206
They get along better than I expected.

690
00:58:07,253 --> 00:58:08,766
Are you up?

691
00:58:11,046 --> 00:58:12,326
Get up.

692
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:25,646
Morning.

693
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:35,206
Matching shirts?

694
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:40,486
What? What matching shirts? It's all I have. My clothes are in the laundry.

695
00:58:44,661 --> 00:58:47,326
Apo said you asked for a night.

696
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:48,806
Have you come to a decision?

697
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:50,126
Well...

698
00:58:50,501 --> 00:58:53,326
If you want to buy my building,

699
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,206
we can talk.

700
00:58:57,382 --> 00:58:58,566
I'm not buying.

701
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:03,846
Come to think about it, you'd just spend all the money you make.

702
00:59:05,606 --> 00:59:08,646
So what? You said you'd give us a chance.

703
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:12,846
Only those who appreciate a chance get one.

704
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,006
Mueang.

705
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:22,966
If you don't want to help my aunt, you don't have to.

706
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:25,086
You have tried to help enough.

707
00:59:25,246 --> 00:59:26,926
I'll deal with it myself.

708
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:29,926
Come on, big bro.

709
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:34,206
Mueang, I'm serious.

710
00:59:34,661 --> 00:59:37,166
I don't want you to do something you don't want to.

711
00:59:37,813 --> 00:59:39,246
I won't.

712
00:59:40,966 --> 00:59:42,126
Aunt.

713
00:59:42,886 --> 00:59:44,366
You want money, don't you?

714
00:59:45,709 --> 00:59:47,366
If you do, you have to work.

715
00:59:48,406 --> 00:59:49,806
- Work?   - Work?

716
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:52,326
Yes. Work for money.

717
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:55,246
You can't just sit still and ask for Apo's money.

718
01:00:06,286 --> 01:00:07,686
Aunt Da and Ri.

719
01:00:07,959 --> 01:00:09,959
Pack your bags and come to Chanthaburi.

720
01:00:15,685 --> 01:00:17,126
This is an offer.

721
01:00:17,366 --> 01:00:20,046
Aunt, Rita, and Om.

722
01:00:20,925 --> 01:00:23,286
All of you will work for me starting today.

723
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:47,566
What am I doing here?

724
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,166
I want to go shopping. I want to get my nails done.

725
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,886
I want to sit in a café. I want to go to an omakase.

726
01:00:58,166 --> 01:00:59,526
Ms. Phing?

727
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:01,766
Are you alright, Ms. Phing?

728
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:08,046
I'm bored. What should I do, Aum?

729
01:01:08,342 --> 01:01:09,966
Bored!

730
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:17,486
Eat something. You'll probably feel better.

731
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,726
Food can't save me now.

732
01:01:26,645 --> 01:01:28,286
This family's here again.

733
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:29,766
Are they on good terms now?

734
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:31,926
What's this?

735
01:01:33,302 --> 01:01:34,766
I'll talk to you later.

736
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,846
How did your entire family come here?

737
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:39,926
I'm still confused myself.

738
01:01:40,853 --> 01:01:43,646
- Come with me.   - Come? Okay.

739
01:01:45,606 --> 01:01:47,966
We'll find out who can do what.

740
01:01:48,406 --> 01:01:50,206
What would you like me to do?

741
01:01:50,814 --> 01:01:53,126
Do you want me to wear a mascot costume? It's too hot!

742
01:01:53,207 --> 01:01:56,486
Gosh, that's the job? I can't do that. I'm old. I'm going to faint.

743
01:01:56,686 --> 01:02:00,086
Whoa. Are you still picky? Just do what you can do.

744
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,566
What's going on with Young Master?

745
01:02:04,366 --> 01:02:07,886
I wonder. Someone like Mueang is helping Aunt Da?

746
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:10,646
I can't believe it. Has he gone too soft?

747
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,406
He is soft.

748
01:02:14,926 --> 01:02:17,766
I think when you like someone,

749
01:02:18,062 --> 01:02:20,766
you want to seem gentle in their eyes.

750
01:02:22,096 --> 01:02:23,446
You're right.

751
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:27,966
Is this the time to start dating?

752
01:02:28,834 --> 01:02:31,406
Is that right?

753
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,925
No, I can't. I can't work outdoors!

754
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:42,566
Me too! What if I get skin cancer?

755
01:02:42,647 --> 01:02:46,606
Whoa! Ladies.

756
01:02:46,814 --> 01:02:51,126
We have something called "sunblock."

757
01:02:51,999 --> 01:02:54,086
A sunblock? Does it really work, right?

758
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:58,125
- It gets sticky on the skin.   - Do we have to wear sunblock all day long?

759
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,477
That's right. It's the age of the Korean trend.

760
01:03:00,566 --> 01:03:04,966
- What if we get suntan?   - No! I don't want dark skin!

761
01:03:05,054 --> 01:03:07,822
Is sunblock going to work?

762
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:11,726
Yeah. Even if it does, we won't look natural.

763
01:03:21,701 --> 01:03:24,046
Smell this. It's refreshing.

764
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,086
An inhaler?

765
01:03:26,254 --> 01:03:28,966
Old lady, how old are you?

766
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:32,006
I'm the same age as you, boy.

767
01:03:32,293 --> 01:03:34,846
Smell it. It's really refreshing.

768
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:57,846
I'm really feeling better.

769
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:03,006
Mueang.

770
01:04:04,062 --> 01:04:05,486
Why are you helping Aunt Da?

771
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,366
You want to help her, don't you?

772
01:04:08,486 --> 01:04:10,966
You act like you don't care, but you still do.

773
01:04:11,294 --> 01:04:13,246
Why else would you have gone home

774
01:04:13,334 --> 01:04:15,566
and stood still when she sprayed water at you?

775
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:16,966
Is that right?

776
01:04:19,646 --> 01:04:21,046
You can tell?

777
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:22,486
Of course, I can.

778
01:04:23,022 --> 01:04:24,566
It's like me and my dad.

779
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:27,806
Sometimes, I want to stay away. But other times,

780
01:04:28,661 --> 01:04:30,501
I feel like I can't leave him.

781
01:04:32,566 --> 01:04:34,246
A love-hate relationship.

782
01:04:35,053 --> 01:04:36,109
This

783
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:37,606
is what's called "irony."

784
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,086
Mueang.

785
01:04:41,918 --> 01:04:43,406
Are you crying?

786
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:45,926
Why are you crying?

787
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:51,206
No. I rubbed my eyes with the inhaler on my finger.

788
01:04:57,221 --> 01:04:59,646
So, does it sting?

789
01:05:01,082 --> 01:05:02,926
Wait a second.

790
01:05:04,727 --> 01:05:07,326
Here. Use some tissue.

791
01:05:08,142 --> 01:05:11,606
Please don't cry.

792
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:17,526
There, there. It's as good as new.

793
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,940
Explain what we're seeing in detail.

794
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:26,566
Young Master is crying while Ms. Stepmother is comforting him.

795
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,646
- Really?   - Really?

796
01:05:30,686 --> 01:05:33,806
Poe, could it be what Boem said?

797
01:05:34,926 --> 01:05:37,206
Boem said the other day

798
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:40,406
those two were lovey-dovey in the kitchen.

799
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:44,166
- Could it be?   - Could it be?

800
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:51,390
Feeling better now?

801
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:13,686
(You don't need me to pick you up today?)

802
01:06:18,158 --> 01:06:20,526
(I'm having lunch with my friend.)

803
01:06:28,534 --> 01:06:31,806
(I started working yesterday and got a day off today.)

804
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:37,646
(Don't whine.)

805
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:48,446
(Me? Am I whining?)

806
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:57,846
Sorry.

807
01:06:59,054 --> 01:07:00,166
It's okay.

808
01:07:00,286 --> 01:07:01,726
Your friend is here.

809
01:07:01,807 --> 01:07:03,366
I'll be there.

810
01:07:14,694 --> 01:07:16,366
(Can you sense me?)

811
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:28,926
Who do you think Tin is talking to?

812
01:07:29,606 --> 01:07:31,406
He's been smiling alone for half an hour.

813
01:07:32,206 --> 01:07:33,606
Girlfriend?

814
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:37,646
Girlfriend? Tin has a girlfriend?

815
01:07:37,727 --> 01:07:40,926
He seems really happy!

816
01:07:55,214 --> 01:07:57,606
We think Game, your ex-boyfriend,

817
01:07:57,821 --> 01:07:59,046
is suspicious.

818
01:07:59,374 --> 01:08:00,766
It's like someone sent him here?

819
01:08:00,966 --> 01:08:02,526
There's one more thing that's suspicious.

820
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:03,661
What is it?

821
01:08:03,742 --> 01:08:07,166
Do you think your aunt and cousin agreed too easily?

822
01:08:07,277 --> 01:08:09,493
If what you said is right,

823
01:08:09,726 --> 01:08:11,126
we have to be really careful.

824
01:08:11,207 --> 01:08:12,846
Mueang, Apo.

825
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:14,446
Follow and keep an eye on Game.

826
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:15,717
Roger.

827
01:08:17,195 --> 01:08:18,446
I like you,

828
01:08:20,046 --> 01:08:24,326
but if you conspire with him against my best friend, I can't go on.

829
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:32,206
Something just dropped on its own.

830
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:33,606
That means...
