1
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,646
Everyone here knows who this necklace belonged to.

2
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:04,126
(This necklace is mine.)

3
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,846
(I can give it to whomever I want.)

4
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,677
If I have something important to you to trade with it,

5
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,446
would you go against my dad's wish?

6
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,198
I'm sorry,

7
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:15,086
but I can't really give you the necklace back.

8
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:17,886
You're the same as my dad. You're heartless.

9
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:19,326
If you want it, get it back yourself.

10
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:23,846
I'm the best at enduring.

11
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:26,206
I just have to endure it again,

12
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,908
and this too shall pass.

13
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:30,646
How could a human be heartless like this?

14
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:32,587
They say everything

15
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,206
like they don't have any feelings.

16
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:38,366
- Hi, Apo! - Hi, Apo!

17
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,046
That hurts. Mom, Ri, stop!

18
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:48,829
You deserved it for telling Mom and me you were visiting your friend.

19
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,367
That's right. I'm going to cut down your allowance this month.

20
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:55,646
Whoa, Mom! I didn't invite you and Ri

21
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,277
because I was afraid you'd feel bad Mr. Phudin didn't invite you.

22
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:59,966
Then tell him to invite us.

23
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,206
How could I tell him?

24
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:05,166
Aunt Da and Ri, how did you guys know Om was here?

25
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,126
I saw Phing's Instagram story.

26
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:09,446
Oops.

27
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:12,126
I forgot to hide it from Ri.

28
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:13,686
Sorry, girl.

29
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:15,006
Fine.

30
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:18,126
Aunt Da and Ri, what are you guys doing here?

31
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,035
- We're here to see you. - To see me?

32
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:22,246
Why not? Can't I come here to see you?

33
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:27,006
You can! I thought something had happened.

34
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:31,126
Something happened? Did something need to happen for me to see you?

35
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:34,246
I'm your aunt. Have you forgotten that?

36
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:39,086
I'm so sick of kids who made it big and forgot their families.

37
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:41,724
I'm more sick of someone else.

38
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,366
Who's that someone else?

39
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:52,406
Someone who borrowed my money

40
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:54,206
a long time ago and hasn't paid me back.

41
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,006
Someone who's addicted to social media.

42
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,486
All they do is post

43
00:03:57,582 --> 00:04:01,726
on Instagrom, TikTak, Facebuzz, Twittoo.

44
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,086
They only show the good and fancy life.

45
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:12,366
Oh, no! I dropped my ring.

46
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:15,685
- Ri, help me look for it! Quick. - Mom!

47
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,446
Oh gosh! Where is it? Do you see it?

48
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,926
- I'm in trouble. My ring! - Under there?

49
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:25,006
- Under the table? Under the couch? - Get down, Mom!

50
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:29,006
Where is it? Get down and look!

51
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,446
- Why are you so clumsy, Mom? - So what?

52
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:33,726
Would you like me to kick them out?

53
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:35,855
No, sir.

54
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,446
Honestly?

55
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:39,886
You don't need to kick them out.

56
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:41,166
Is that okay?

57
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:43,126
It is.

58
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,006
Do you really want them to be here?

59
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:52,406
It's up to you to decide

60
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:55,006
whether you'd welcome Aunt Da and Ri.

61
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:56,686
I don't want to.

62
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,225
Okay, I'll go and tell them right now.

63
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:03,366
No! It's up to you. They're your family.

64
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:07,526
I just don't want to let random people in again.

65
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:10,766
Aunt Da and Ri are my family.

66
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:12,606
They're not like Game.

67
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:15,646
Okay. Then you need to decide.

68
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,806
Aunt Da and Ri traveled all the way here.

69
00:05:21,262 --> 00:05:23,006
Would you let them stay?

70
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,006
I would.

71
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:28,806
Thank you.

72
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,046
I need you to watch the house for me. I'm going to Bangkok.

73
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:35,246
I'll be back tomorrow evening.

74
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,446
I will. Have a safe travel.

75
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:40,566
Okay. Thanks a lot.

76
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,626
You murderer.

77
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:03,206
You murdered a snail.

78
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,726
I apologize on Aunt Da's behalf

79
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,206
about that snail.

80
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,766
She probably didn't see it.

81
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:14,646
Saw it or not, she shouldn't have driven fast on someone's property.

82
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,006
Where is the body?

83
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,006
You're not invited to the funeral.

84
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:21,126
I've buried it.

85
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:24,606
Your job is to tell your family to go home.

86
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:27,726
I won't.

87
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:30,646
Mr. Phudin said Aunt Da and Ri could stay.

88
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:32,686
Hey, wait!

89
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,966
I won't let them stay here.

90
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,366
There's nothing you can do.

91
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:41,086
What's wrong?

92
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:42,646
I bit my mouth ulcer.

93
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,406
Serves you right!

94
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:50,166
I'm hurting!

95
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:54,006
Are you acting?

96
00:06:54,134 --> 00:06:58,046
I'm not acting. I got four of them. See?

97
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:00,686
Four?

98
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:02,966
You didn't get enough sleep, did you?

99
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:04,606
Drink a lot of water, and put gel on them.

100
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:07,766
What else can heal you? Yeah, gotu kola,

101
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,686
Chinese herbal tea, ginkgo, and what else?

102
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:14,326
So you're not mad at me anymore?

103
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:17,246
Who said that?

104
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:18,446
Who said I'm not mad?

105
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,806
I didn't say that.

106
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,006
You

107
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,446
told me to

108
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:23,629
drink water

109
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,966
and put gel on my ulcers.

110
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:31,926
If you're mad, you won't wish me well. You'd wish me a painful death.

111
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,006
Someone like you won't get to die so easily.

112
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:40,126
You need to get well and fight me on equal terms.

113
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:43,286
With your mouth ulcers, all you do is cry in pain.

114
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,126
I can't have a smooth fight, got it?

115
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,166
Get well soon and fight me again.

116
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,446
I get it!

117
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,789
If your murderous relatives don't go home,

118
00:07:54,398 --> 00:07:55,646
I assure you there'll be a problem.

119
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:11,806
Please pick up...

120
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:15,406
She rejected it again!

121
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:20,086
She won't pick up my calls, reply to my text, or even read her DM.

122
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:21,966
What do I do?

123
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:24,366
A pigeon?

124
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:29,446
Game, have you lost your mind?

125
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:37,126
(Our past won't affect your job.)

126
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:38,926
(Stop contacting me.)

127
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,326
Ms. Ing!

128
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:46,726
Ms. Ing! I got some good news!

129
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:53,406
Ms. Ing, I have good news for both of us.

130
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,406
Ms. Ing.

131
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:58,926
Ms. Ing.

132
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,006
From now on,

133
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:06,606
I don't want to work with Game again.

134
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:18,326
Ms. Ing. If you hear this, you'll surely praise me.

135
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,406
Ms. Ing? Are you okay?

136
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,886
I thought something was wrong.

137
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:33,406
What's the good news?

138
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:36,526
I talked to Apo. She said not to worry.

139
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,486
- That's good. - You can rest assured.

140
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,486
Yeah. I have a favor to ask.

141
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:47,406
What is it? Tell me.

142
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,526
- Please resign. - Resign?

143
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:50,726
Yes.

144
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,526
If I fire you,

145
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:54,126
you can sue me.

146
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:56,326
Why would you want me to quit?

147
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:58,446
You're getting me in trouble.

148
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:02,246
I talked to Apo. She said she wouldn't stab me in the back.

149
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:04,966
This is not about your ex.

150
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:07,006
It's about Uncle Din.

151
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:11,086
If I keep you around, I might not get what I want.

152
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:13,286
Are you getting rid of me just like that?

153
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,726
It's not just like that.

154
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,086
You're capable,

155
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:19,686
but when I think about it, I think I can find someone more capable.

156
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:21,486
You can't do this to me.

157
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:22,806
I can.

158
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:25,166
I'll compensate you.

159
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:27,726
Do you think money can buy me?

160
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:29,566
Can it?

161
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:33,246
Don't think I don't know

162
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,726
that you don't like me. You just like my money.

163
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,646
I'm paying you to quit.

164
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:49,526
Look, you're getting a lot of money.

165
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:52,246
This is a year's worth of your salary.

166
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,966
Don't you want it?

167
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:56,366
If I were you, I'd take the deal.

168
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,446
If you won't,

169
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,166
I'll just feed this to termites.

170
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:16,348
Bye.

171
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,526
Mr. Phudin said Aunt Da and Ri could stay.

172
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:40,886
Apo.

173
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:43,246
You should tell them to go home.

174
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:48,406
You know my mom and Ri can ruin the world in a second.

175
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:54,086
I know that. I don't really want them to stay.

176
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:56,566
Why didn't you tell Mr. Phudin that?

177
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,286
He didn't seem to like Aunt Da and Ri.

178
00:11:59,446 --> 00:12:01,966
I don't think he'd want someone he doesn't like in his home.

179
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:04,526
You're right. He didn't want them.

180
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,206
I stuck up for them.

181
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:09,766
- Po! - Po!

182
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:14,526
Aunt Da and Ri carried huge bags here.

183
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:17,445
- It feels wrong to just say, "Go away!" - It's not wrong at all.

184
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:20,286
- If you don't want them here, just say so. - Right.

185
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:23,446
It's not that easy. It's hard for me.

186
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:25,327
Mr. Phudin owns the house.

187
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:27,158
Aunt Da and Ri are my family.

188
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:29,086
This is for the best!

189
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,006
Is this for the best?

190
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:34,726
It's more like "everything is messed up beyond repair."

191
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,126
Agreed.

192
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:37,806
Whoa!

193
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:39,526
You're exaggerating.

194
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:43,326
It's not that bad.

195
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:47,526
- Really? - Really?

196
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,566
- Are they Apo's family? - They are.

197
00:12:55,647 --> 00:13:00,526
- A hot Earl Grey, please. - Hi, guys! Today, I'm at home with my mom.

198
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:03,526
Hi, guys! Here's Mommy.

199
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:06,406
I'm sorry. The house is a bit of a mess.

200
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:10,566
Look at this. It's a beautiful day today.

201
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:14,606
In this good weather, the two of us should be one with Mother Nature.

202
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:19,846
My girl's wearing a flower pattern, and I'm wearing a zebra pattern.

203
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:22,566
So shameless. They act like this is their house.

204
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,405
Apo's family seems like a handful.

205
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:27,886
What are you waiting for?

206
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,726
Let's go!

207
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,086
Excuse me.

208
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:37,646
I need this room.

209
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,886
Are you kicking us out?

210
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:43,726
Yes, I am. I want to watch my TV.

211
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,406
But Apo told us to stay here.

212
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:49,526
Apo doesn't own the house. She doesn't have the authority.

213
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:52,005
I hope you understand what I said.

214
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:53,446
I don't!

215
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,241
Apo is going to be the wife of this house's owner.

216
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:58,406
Technically,

217
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:00,794
she owns this house too.

218
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:05,206
You said Apo is "going" to be his wife.

219
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:08,246
Apo and Mr. Phudin haven't got married yet.

220
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,846
Legally, she's not his wife yet.

221
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,205
But practically speaking,

222
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:14,406
Mr. Phudin brought her here before the wedding.

223
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:15,966
It should be obvious.

224
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:18,166
That's right! Actually,

225
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:20,766
Apo has more authority in this house

226
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:22,606
than an employee

227
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:26,806
or a relative of Mr. Phudin's former wife.

228
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,966
- You! - I'm sorry.

229
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:30,406
I'm really sorry.

230
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,149
I was just speaking facts.

231
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,626
I didn't mean to offend you and Mrs. Sita.

232
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,022
Don't mind my mom, please. She likes to run her mouth.

233
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,526
Please don't get mad, old lady.

234
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:43,946
Old?

235
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,886
Did you call me old?

236
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,886
What show do you watch, old lady?

237
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:51,446
Let's watch it together, come on.

238
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,606
Mom, sit down. Come on.

239
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:56,006
Let's watch some TV.

240
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,966
How dare she call me old?

241
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:07,006
I look younger than her mom.

242
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:09,326
She's just provoking you.

243
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,726
They must have learned about us from Apo.

244
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:17,166
That's how they got on our nerves.

245
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,206
Think about it, Mrs. Sita.

246
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,166
The people who raised Apo

247
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:22,446
are a handful.

248
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:25,486
What about Apo? What is she really like?

249
00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:29,766
I don't really trust Apo's family.

250
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,686
Neither do I.

251
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:33,326
What should we do?

252
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,206
Should we tell Mr. Phudin?

253
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,566
What would Din do?

254
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:41,046
We need to tell someone who can deal with them.

255
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,846
I said I'd never join forces with you again.

256
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:51,492
Please help me.

257
00:15:51,574 --> 00:15:53,406
Our house is getting taken over.

258
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,986
If it's that easy to take over, let them take over.

259
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,204
This is not a joke, Mr. Mueang.

260
00:15:58,285 --> 00:15:59,566
I'm not joking.

261
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:03,166
I told Apo to deal with her family.

262
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,646
Apo won't deal with them.

263
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:08,326
Then who can?

264
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:10,126
The three of us can.

265
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:14,506
Remember when we protested against my old man when I was in high school?

266
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:16,086
Who ruined the plan?

267
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:17,886
This lady.

268
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:21,704
Mrs. Sita, you need to tell her to sit still.

269
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:25,766
If Apo doesn't deal with her family, I will.

270
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,286
Fine! I'll just stay still!

271
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:34,086
But if you wait for Apo to deal with them, it's going to be too late!

272
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:35,686
Don't do anything!

273
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,366
Don't do anything.

274
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:46,326
I acted childish because I wanted you.

275
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,966
I may be annoying, but I just don't want you to leave.

276
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,286
Aren't they too chill?

277
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,006
They sure make themselves at home.

278
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:57,286
They're lucky they don't get kicked out.

279
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,086
- Is that too much, Apo? Look. - I agree.

280
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:07,766
I shouldn't have let them.

281
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,846
Someone's waiting for you there, Ms. Apo.

282
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:16,006
- They're here to see me? - Yes.

283
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,006
- Over there. - Thanks.

284
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:43,246
If you're here to see Mr. Phudin, he's not here.

285
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,526
I'm here to see you, Ms. Apo.

286
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,126
Me?

287
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:53,046
Yeah. I wanted to explain. I really didn't know Game had a girlfriend.

288
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,526
Ms. Ing.

289
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:58,259
You don't have to explain.

290
00:17:58,358 --> 00:17:59,406
I do.

291
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:03,806
I want you to know that when I found out he had a girlfriend,

292
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:05,526
I ended my relationship with him.

293
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:10,166
But Game said he was dating you.

294
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,286
I knew it. I knew he'd lie.

295
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:18,366
Ms. Apo, you know what?

296
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:21,486
He and I were never a couple.

297
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,966
He was just my employee.

298
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:26,006
I swear.

299
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,965
You know what?

300
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:39,126
If you have time, we should talk over coffee.

301
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:43,046
I'm sure there are many things about me that you were misinformed about.

302
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,366
I'm sure of it.

303
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:46,286
Please.

304
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,446
Please. I beg you.

305
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:51,286
Please, Ms. Apo.

306
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:55,312
- Please. - I'm really busy today.

307
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:58,646
- Tomorrow? - Well, tomorrow...

308
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,509
I think I have meetings all day.

309
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,869
- Ms. Apo... - Apo!

310
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:13,586
You're

311
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:15,766
Game's new girlfriend.

312
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,566
I'm not. Let me say it again.

313
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,766
- Ms. Phing, right? - Yeah.

314
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:24,966
I was never Game's girlfriend, okay?

315
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:31,806
Why are you here?

316
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:35,006
I almost forgot.

317
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:40,086
Dude, I'm sorry.

318
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:45,606
The restaurant that hired me needs some content ASAP.

319
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:48,726
It's fine. You should go. I'm okay.

320
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,086
Are you mad?

321
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:51,806
No! Why would I be?

322
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,206
Just go. I'm fine alone. Don't worry.

323
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,446
Sure?

324
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:59,726
Look. Are you sure you're okay alone?

325
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:04,366
Om, I lived with Aunt Da and Ri for over 20 years.

326
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,454
A day is nothing.

327
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:08,040
One more thing.

328
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:11,766
I need to take Om with me. He's my cameraman. Just a day, okay?

329
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:13,126
Okay!

330
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:15,886
Call us if you need anything.

331
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,526
I will. Don't worry. Just go.

332
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:23,166
See? I brought this. My mom's car key. They won't go anywhere.

333
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:24,646
We're ready. Let's go.

334
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:25,926
Well done.

335
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,726
Just ring me up if you need anything.

336
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:31,117
You should go.

337
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:32,686
- Bye. - Bye.

338
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:34,966
I didn't make myself clear.

339
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:37,206
Ms. Apo still misunderstands me, surely.

340
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,806
She sure is hard to reach.

341
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,366
- I need to change my approach. - Why were you bothering Ms. Apo?

342
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,366
When did I bother her?

343
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:51,086
I saw you trying to befriend her.

344
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:54,806
So what? I want to be her friend. Is that wrong?

345
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:57,246
Want to be her friend? Really?

346
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:58,726
What's that got to do with you?

347
00:20:58,838 --> 00:21:00,118
I don't want anything to do with this.

348
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:03,126
It's just too obvious you want something.

349
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,566
Take my advice. Don't be a creep.

350
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,006
You grabbed her hands like you were robbing her.

351
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:16,766
Just change the way you approach someone.

352
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,446
Be more sincere.

353
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,726
Do your best.

354
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:24,406
You can do it.

355
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:37,806
Ms. Apo.

356
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:39,926
Why are you in a hurry?

357
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:41,806
- Hi, Tin. - Hi.

358
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:44,366
Mr. Phudin is not here today.

359
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,686
I'm not here to see Uncle Din.

360
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:48,226
I'm looking for some food.

361
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:51,806
Okay. Please go ahead.

362
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:55,606
- Apo! - Apo! Where are you?

363
00:21:58,206 --> 00:21:59,806
I have to go now.

364
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,966
Apo!

365
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:04,926
Coming!

366
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:10,886
That's Apo's family.

367
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:15,286
Wi and I are watching them.

368
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:17,037
Let's watch them, Tin.

369
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:24,316
- Apo! - Apo!

370
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:26,766
Don't yell, okay? This is not our home.

371
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,486
Where have you been? Mom and I are hungry.

372
00:22:29,606 --> 00:22:32,846
Yeah! This is not enough. Bring a lot more food. We are...

373
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:35,446
- Hungry! - Okay!

374
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:37,446
I'll get something.

375
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,486
- Be quick! - Yeah.

376
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,926
Oh! It's fine. I'll do it.

377
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,566
- Thank you. - It's fine.

378
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:57,246
Is this all?

379
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,566
What more would you eat?

380
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:04,486
We came all the way here. This can't be all of our welcome meal.

381
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:06,686
- Get something more! - Get something more!

382
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,806
That's more like it.

383
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:21,166
Beansprouts?

384
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,086
Apo, you know I don't eat beansprouts,

385
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:25,446
so pick them out.

386
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,686
Don't even leave one. I can't stand them.

387
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:33,806
You know I don't like them. Why didn't you tell your staff?

388
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,046
Pick them all out.

389
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,166
Why are these vegetables so cold?

390
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,806
This is not good.

391
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:44,806
Oh, no! The soup is cold too.

392
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:47,726
Apo, did you forget I only eat my meal hot?

393
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:51,286
This is not good for my health. What if I get food poisoning?

394
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:53,686
- Fix this now. - Okay!

395
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,446
- I'll change them. - Did you already forget what I usually eat?

396
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:23,054
Hot like this. This is good.

397
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:26,606
- Eat up, my girl. - Let's eat, Mom!

398
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:34,246
Apo! Pass me some fish cakes. I can't reach it.

399
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:44,686
Hey, pass me some catfish. All I get is this soup.

400
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:45,966
Pass me that catfish.

401
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:47,366
This is...

402
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:48,886
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

403
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:51,726
Don't judge them yet. Let's wait and see.

404
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,766
- Apo, come here! - Apo, come here!

405
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:58,726
Whoa!

406
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:01,606
- More! - Apo, my turn next, okay?

407
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:03,086
My back hurts.

408
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:16,766
- She's their masseuse. - Apo, hurry up!

409
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:23,566
- Do you feel good, Mom? - It's nice, my girl.

410
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:27,606
Do it nicely.

411
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:32,766
What color should my toenails be?

412
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:35,926
She's their manicurist and pedicurist.

413
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,566
- Apo, take out the trash! - Apo, take out the trash!

414
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:57,366
She's their garbage girl.

415
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:04,706
Apo, no sugar in mine, okay?

416
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:12,586
Apo, you ruined my shirt!

417
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:16,126
Wash it right now. They sent this for review.

418
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:19,166
What if my sponsor stops sending me stuff?

419
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:22,086
Why are you so clumsy?

420
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,706
Mom!

421
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:36,286
Is she their laundry girl too?

422
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:37,846
She does everything.

423
00:26:38,142 --> 00:26:39,606
I think we got it right.

424
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:41,246
They keep using her like this.

425
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,574
- She's obviously their servant. - She's obviously their servant.

426
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:00,206
Is Apo's family gone?

427
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:02,526
Gone where? They're all over your dad's house.

428
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:05,326
I told her to deal with them.

429
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:08,966
You know she can't deal with them. It's too much.

430
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:11,846
- What's too much? - Her family is a handful.

431
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,846
They are using her like a servant.

432
00:27:14,093 --> 00:27:16,886
If she talks to a mouse and sings,

433
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:18,806
I would think she's Cinderella.

434
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,606
You're exaggerating.

435
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:21,966
I'm not.

436
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:24,126
Take a look yourself if you don't believe me.

437
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:30,925
I acted childish because I wanted you.

438
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:35,126
I may be annoying, but I just don't want you to leave.

439
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:39,766
I want you to be with me all day, all night. Would you stay?

440
00:27:39,886 --> 00:27:42,606
Let's watch movies, listen to music...

441
00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:44,166
You're right.

442
00:27:45,085 --> 00:27:46,686
They're from Cinderella, right?

443
00:27:47,318 --> 00:27:50,206
They're like Cinderella's stepsisters who sing badly.

444
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,726
Let's leave. They're hurting my ears.

445
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:54,406
Hey, not yet.

446
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:55,886
Wait and see.

447
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:57,286
See what?

448
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:01,206
Apo, get us some fruits! We're thirsty too!

449
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,886
Coming!

450
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:10,206
- Mom! - Quick.

451
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:13,046
Here you are.

452
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:18,110
Serve us. Don't just stand there.

453
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:31,406
Why is it so bland?

454
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:37,526
Mine is too sour!

455
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:41,526
You know I like it sweet and not too sour.

456
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:43,826
This is bad.

457
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:45,926
Go and get a new one.

458
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:49,645
This is all we have.

459
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:52,686
Oh! Look. Look at her expression.

460
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:55,046
All you need to do is take care of both of us.

461
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:56,586
Is that too hard?

462
00:28:57,086 --> 00:28:59,166
- It's not. - Then go get something.

463
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:06,166
See? My family is a soap opera, right?

464
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:08,286
Not really.

465
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:12,406
Every family has a problem of its own.

466
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:15,606
There you go.

467
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:19,846
Apo's aunt and cousin use her all day long.

468
00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:23,406
Fetch them food. Do their nails. Take out their trash. Do their laundry.

469
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:26,366
They ask Apo for everything.

470
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:30,006
Why don't they ask our staff?

471
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,886
Apo doesn't want to bother the staff.

472
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:36,166
She won't even let me help her.

473
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:42,726
Then it can't be helped.

474
00:29:43,606 --> 00:29:44,886
Can't be helped?

475
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:47,166
Don't you feel bad for her at all?

476
00:29:47,357 --> 00:29:48,766
Why would I feel bad for her?

477
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:50,606
She didn't even feel bad for me.

478
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:54,286
I should just leave. This is a waste of my time.

479
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,806
Hey!

480
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:00,053
What about me?

481
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:05,686
Go! Go get something else.

482
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:15,686
Okay. I'll go see if there's anything else.

483
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:18,246
Mom, I think you shouldn't ask too much of her.

484
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:21,126
She's become a madame. She's not that girl anymore.

485
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,846
What do you mean by that?

486
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,766
I thought you would be working here.

487
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:27,726
Turns out you're being treated like a princess.

488
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:29,726
I think you're mistaken.

489
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:32,086
Whoa! Don't argue.

490
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,926
Apo won't forget who she is.

491
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,206
She knows whom she owes her life to.

492
00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:29,566
It's better than I think.

493
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:31,886
It's good for my heart.

494
00:31:32,006 --> 00:31:36,726
Because of you, my heart is racing.

495
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:40,286
I've been closing myself.

496
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:42,125
In the end...

497
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:43,229
Aum.

498
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:45,766
Yes, Young Master.

499
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:50,846
You told me Apo's problem was because of her family.

500
00:31:51,397 --> 00:31:52,566
What did you mean?

501
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:54,206
I can tell you?

502
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,526
You can speak, can't you?

503
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,166
You know, right?

504
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,578
The one who owes Boss money is not Apo.

505
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:03,326
It's her family.

506
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:05,806
I know that.

507
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,086
Ms. Phing said that

508
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:10,246
Ms. Apo agreed to get married to pay off the debt

509
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:12,446
because her aunt forced her to.

510
00:32:14,206 --> 00:32:16,246
Can you even force someone to do this?

511
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:19,946
Ms. Apo feels responsible somehow.

512
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:22,109
Though she didn't cause that debt,

513
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:25,166
she didn't want her family to suffer.

514
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:28,766
Ms. Phing also said

515
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:30,981
her aunt and cousin

516
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:35,166
always caused trouble, and Apo always had to fix things.

517
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:37,206
What happened?

518
00:32:37,342 --> 00:32:41,246
Her aunt, I heard she's a real gambling addict.

519
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:09,926
Help me! There's a thief!

520
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:13,932
There's a thief! Help!

521
00:33:14,054 --> 00:33:16,846
Help!

522
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:25,004
Apo, that way! Quick!

523
00:33:25,108 --> 00:33:26,709
Wake up! There's a thief!

524
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:31,006
Help! There's a thief!

525
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:33,646
A thief! Help!

526
00:33:33,743 --> 00:33:37,473
- Stop, you fiend! - Where's the thief?

527
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:38,846
That's the thief.

528
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:41,806
Are you crazy? I just came down to drink water.

529
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,126
What's going on? I'm so confused.

530
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:46,646
Ms. Wi said my mom opened the display case.

531
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:49,046
Really, Aunt Da?

532
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,566
Of course not!

533
00:33:50,646 --> 00:33:53,926
I was just looking at these. They're nice.

534
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:57,406
Are you accusing us? My mom is not a thief.

535
00:33:58,277 --> 00:33:59,766
You weren't just looking.

536
00:34:00,077 --> 00:34:02,006
You opened the display.

537
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:04,526
- That's not true. - What's with all the noise?

538
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:11,126
Mueang! Are you here too?

539
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,726
Yeah. I'm here to keep watch.

540
00:34:13,006 --> 00:34:15,686
Good. Help me catch this thief.

541
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:19,350
Mr. Mueang, Ms. Wi said I was stealing things in there.

542
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:23,446
I was just drinking water and looking at nice things. That's all.

543
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:24,966
Drinking water?

544
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:26,566
Where's your glass?

545
00:34:30,646 --> 00:34:32,086
Is anything missing?

546
00:34:32,764 --> 00:34:34,286
I checked. Nothing's missing.

547
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:35,495
See?

548
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:38,326
I told you I'm not a thief.

549
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:40,854
- But... - But?

550
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:42,766
Stop accusing me.

551
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:45,606
Wait! Wait a sec.

552
00:34:46,022 --> 00:34:48,286
If you don't have evidence that she stole anything,

553
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:49,865
I think it's a misunderstanding.

554
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:51,078
It's not a misunderstanding.

555
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,326
Look. You should apologize to me.

556
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:54,926
I won't!

557
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:56,806
I believe what I saw.

558
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,446
I will prove to all of you

559
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:02,406
that you're a thief.

560
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,926
Aunt...

561
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,846
Aunt Da.

562
00:35:10,254 --> 00:35:12,686
You didn't do what Ms. Wi accused you of, right?

563
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,926
Are you crazy? Why would I be a thief?

564
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:17,967
Ms. Wi doesn't like me.

565
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:20,166
That's why she wanted to frame me.

566
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:23,846
Hey, don't gang up on us. Apo, you need to take our side.

567
00:35:24,677 --> 00:35:26,406
You know she doesn't like you.

568
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,966
Don't be suspicious.

569
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:30,366
Why would you come here alone? Wake Ri up and take her with you.

570
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:34,206
You know how deep your sister sleeps. Who could wake her up?

571
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:36,460
Mom! I took your side.

572
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:38,686
I'm your girl, not a trash can. Don't dump me.

573
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:39,848
That's enough.

574
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,446
If it's nothing, go back to sleep. It's late. I'm tired.

575
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:44,966
Let's go. Split up!

576
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:47,613
- I really didn't do... - Mom, let's go back to bed.

577
00:35:47,694 --> 00:35:50,486
- I'm being honest. I'm not a thief. - Take her to bed.

578
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,126
She's getting on my nerves.

579
00:35:55,078 --> 00:35:56,846
I'm sorry for the trouble.

580
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:58,486
Wait.

581
00:36:02,414 --> 00:36:03,606
Let's talk.

582
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,206
Why is your family still here?

583
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:16,686
Mr. Phudin said Aunt Da and Ri could stay.

584
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:19,046
I don't trust your family here.

585
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:21,406
Then talk to Mr. Phudin yourself.

586
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:23,046
You're deflecting it to my dad again.

587
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:24,726
What are you up to?

588
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:27,406
I haven't forgiven you for my mom's necklace.

589
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:31,166
I haven't forgiven you for my MP3 player.

590
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,533
You said you didn't want it.

591
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:35,526
Listen to me, Mueang.

592
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:38,006
I don't have to do as you say.

593
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:43,366
You haven't learned your lesson yet?

594
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:46,526
Why? What are you going to do to me?

595
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,926
Don't you fear me at all?

596
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,966
If you want to do anything to me, go ahead.

597
00:36:57,741 --> 00:36:59,566
I'll tell Mr. Phudin.

598
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:01,566
Fine.

599
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,446
Do you think my dad can protect you?

600
00:37:04,886 --> 00:37:06,206
I'll tell you something.

601
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:09,366
Nobody in this house can protect you.

602
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:32,966
Ready? Go!

603
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,406
One, two, three, four, five!

604
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,846
Six, seven, eight! Woo!

605
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,246
Young Master, are you up?

606
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,006
Young Master?

607
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:50,622
- What's wrong? - Ms. Apo hurt her waist.

608
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:53,566
Look at this.

609
00:37:57,117 --> 00:38:00,486
(Ready? Go!)

610
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:02,981
One, two, three, four, five!

611
00:38:03,062 --> 00:38:04,526
Six, seven, eight!

612
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:15,726
What the heck were they doing?

613
00:38:16,142 --> 00:38:18,286
Ms. Apo was helping her cousin film her content.

614
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:22,486
Weird. People these days are weird.

615
00:38:23,046 --> 00:38:25,526
I gave her some pain relief patches.

616
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:29,326
Her cousin won't let her stop. Why don't you go and stop them?

617
00:38:29,446 --> 00:38:31,726
Why would I stop them? That's nothing to do with me.

618
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:36,566
Don't you have sympathy?

619
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:41,366
I thought of you and bought this.

620
00:38:41,646 --> 00:38:43,566
Thank you, Son.

621
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:45,766
Eat a lot.

622
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:49,846
Apo, make sure I look nice. I need to review this outfit.

623
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,326
Okay?

624
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:54,886
Step back a bit.

625
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:57,706
Ready? One, two, three!

626
00:39:03,413 --> 00:39:04,413
Huh?

627
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:07,446
Young Master? Are you awake? Young Master!

628
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:08,766
- Young Master! - What?

629
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:10,093
What is it this time?

630
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:11,646
Ms. Apo is bleeding.

631
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,806
Look at this.

632
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,806
Step back a bit.

633
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:27,646
Ready? One, two, three.

634
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,893
What the heck were they doing?

635
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,166
It's Ms. Apo's cousin.

636
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:48,565
She asked Ms. Apo to take thousands of photos.

637
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:50,406
I don't know why she needed that many.

638
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,766
Ms. Apo was hurt and bleeding right there,

639
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:54,374
and she didn't stop taking photos.

640
00:39:54,455 --> 00:39:59,246
I volunteered to take photos for her, and she insulted my shooting skills.

641
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:01,413
Please go and help Ms. Apo, Young Master.

642
00:40:01,494 --> 00:40:02,806
Why would I help?

643
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:05,126
Is it my duty to protect her?

644
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:08,486
Whatever happens to her is none of my business. Leave.

645
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,646
Young Master.

646
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,126
Young Master?

647
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,326
Chivalry is dead.

648
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:17,046
Do I look slim?

649
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:19,646
- Do I? - You look good.

650
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:22,966
I'll sip on this.

651
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:31,046
Yeah, that's right. Make my legs look long.

652
00:40:36,193 --> 00:40:38,206
Hey, stop! I think we got it.

653
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:39,686
- Let me see the photos. - Okay.

654
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:50,006
Nice. Nobody can make my legs look long like you do.

655
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,886
I'll get these photos right now.

656
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,926
- Are you done? - Yeah. That's a wrap.

657
00:40:59,238 --> 00:41:00,406
I sent the photos to you.

658
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:08,326
Apo, recharge my phone.

659
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,931
The battery is dead.

660
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:12,606
Here. I have more outfits to review.

661
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:16,086
This place is great. There are so many spots to take photos.

662
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:17,926
It's nice.

663
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:23,486
Apo?

664
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,206
Is she dead?

665
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:29,245
- Young Master! - Young Master!

666
00:41:29,326 --> 00:41:31,006
- Young Master, open up! - What?

667
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,766
I told you that you don't have to tell me even if she's dead.

668
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:38,036
- Ms. Apo is dead! - Ms. Apo is dead!

669
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:47,686
Young Master, wait!

670
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:49,766
Young Master.

671
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:53,046
Is she okay?

672
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:56,126
Hey, you!

673
00:41:57,774 --> 00:41:59,526
Hey!

674
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:16,046
She's not dead.

675
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:20,766
Hey, can you hear me?

676
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:24,766
Hey!

677
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:28,686
I didn't do anything.

678
00:42:28,766 --> 00:42:30,273
I don't know what happened.

679
00:42:30,354 --> 00:42:35,006
I only asked her to recharge my phone, and she just fell.

680
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,926
Did she get fried, Aum?

681
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:40,206
She didn't. It's you.

682
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,286
You overworked Ms. Apo.

683
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:45,646
Hey! Let's take her to a hospital.

684
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:48,566
- Let's... - Ms. Apo.

685
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:09,326
How did I end up lying here?

686
00:43:18,677 --> 00:43:22,686
Ri, did you have her stand in the sun for five hours?

687
00:43:22,823 --> 00:43:25,526
So what? I was with her, and I was fine.

688
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:27,726
She didn't sleep last night.

689
00:43:27,807 --> 00:43:30,286
She slept for about two hours and didn't even have breakfast.

690
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,766
I only had a piece of bread.

691
00:43:31,878 --> 00:43:33,206
But you had something.

692
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,440
If you guys care about her so much, why did you come back so late?

693
00:43:35,483 --> 00:43:37,966
- Are you crazy? What do you... - Stop!

694
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:40,006
Stop arguing.

695
00:43:40,213 --> 00:43:41,566
Mueang is watching.

696
00:43:44,694 --> 00:43:47,006
I'm just here to see how Apo is doing.

697
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:48,566
I don't want someone dying in this house.

698
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:50,126
Yeah!

699
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,606
Won't you see a doctor?

700
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,566
I won't. I just fainted. I'm fine.

701
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:00,566
You should get some rest now.

702
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:06,646
- Let's go. - Stand firmly, please.

703
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,118
- Let's go. - Are you alright?

704
00:44:08,221 --> 00:44:09,606
Stand up firmly.

705
00:44:10,134 --> 00:44:11,486
Tell me if you need anything.

706
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:13,846
- Come and get me. - I know.

707
00:44:37,806 --> 00:44:40,606
If everyone's okay, I'll leave.

708
00:44:44,861 --> 00:44:48,126
Ri, you need to stop using Apo.

709
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:50,646
Yeah! I know!

710
00:44:51,686 --> 00:44:54,045
Move it! You're talking too much.

711
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:55,406
You're annoying.

712
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:15,926
Apo!

713
00:45:16,038 --> 00:45:18,246
Apo, I spilled water. Come and wipe it.

714
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:19,646
Apo!

715
00:45:22,671 --> 00:45:24,046
I called her again.

716
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:26,686
Don't you have hands?

717
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,246
I do.

718
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:32,685
Yeah. Do it yourself, then.

719
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:34,646
You had Apo do everything for you.

720
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:37,526
I'm used to that.

721
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:39,646
You're used to that?

722
00:45:39,997 --> 00:45:41,766
You're not a little brat.

723
00:45:41,847 --> 00:45:43,446
Do something yourself for once.

724
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,606
Your muscles are going to die.

725
00:45:52,941 --> 00:45:56,286
What a trash-talker! That's my type!

726
00:46:31,534 --> 00:46:32,966
Aunt Da!

727
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,166
Why are you searching my room?

728
00:46:44,247 --> 00:46:45,886
I'm looking for something.

729
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:47,086
What thing?

730
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,726
The necklace Mr. Phudin gave you.

731
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:51,966
How did you know about that?

732
00:46:52,334 --> 00:46:54,446
Ri saw Phing's Instagram story.

733
00:46:54,566 --> 00:46:55,806
I asked Om.

734
00:46:55,894 --> 00:46:59,606
Om said it was your birthday present from Mr. Phudin.

735
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:04,206
I get it! You're here because of that necklace.

736
00:47:04,686 --> 00:47:05,726
No!

737
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,126
Honest?

738
00:47:07,254 --> 00:47:10,166
I thought it was nice, so I wanted to see it in person.

739
00:47:10,806 --> 00:47:12,446
You wanted to see it?

740
00:47:12,677 --> 00:47:14,286
Or did you want to steal it?

741
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,046
Last night, when you were at the display case,

742
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,406
were you really trying to steal?

743
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:24,286
Aunt Da, you can go to jail for this.

744
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,486
Yeah! I'm desperate.

745
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,646
Why are you doing this?

746
00:47:29,742 --> 00:47:31,246
Do you need money?

747
00:47:31,606 --> 00:47:33,886
Yeah! I need money.

748
00:47:34,302 --> 00:47:36,366
Would you be kind enough to help me?

749
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,766
How much?

750
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:41,566
- Three million. - Three million?

751
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,526
The interest is high.

752
00:47:46,685 --> 00:47:48,686
Did you take a loan from a loan shark?

753
00:47:50,893 --> 00:47:52,726
Ri and Om don't know, do they?

754
00:47:52,821 --> 00:47:54,946
They don't, but I'll have to tell them.

755
00:47:55,134 --> 00:47:57,446
How bad is it now, Aunt Da?

756
00:47:57,724 --> 00:48:00,006
If I don't pay them soon,

757
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:02,446
the house you lived in as a child

758
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:04,446
will be taken by them.

759
00:48:14,654 --> 00:48:15,750
My type.

760
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,046
He didn't close the door. Is he trying to seduce me?

761
00:48:45,846 --> 00:48:47,286
So hot!

762
00:48:50,086 --> 00:48:52,086
I don't have three million.

763
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,406
I know.

764
00:48:56,606 --> 00:48:59,206
I know who has that much money, though.

765
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:01,526
Are you borrowing Mr. Phudin's money for me?

766
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,046
Are you really going to help me?

767
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:07,406
I don't know if he'll lend me the money or not.

768
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,206
If you ask,

769
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,206
he'll surely lend you the money.

770
00:49:17,503 --> 00:49:18,605
Mueang!

771
00:49:18,686 --> 00:49:20,876
Mueang! Let me go!

772
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:23,285
Mueang! Where are you taking me?

773
00:49:23,366 --> 00:49:26,886
Mueang! What are you doing?

774
00:49:26,982 --> 00:49:29,086
Mueang! Let me go!

775
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,446
Are you crazy?

776
00:49:30,557 --> 00:49:33,326
- Mueang! - Mueang! No!

777
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:35,126
- Ri! - No!

778
00:49:35,326 --> 00:49:37,424
Mueang! Let me go!

779
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:39,525
- Ri! - Mueang! What are you doing?

780
00:49:39,606 --> 00:49:42,308
- Mueang! - What are you doing?

781
00:49:42,389 --> 00:49:47,086
- Ri! - Mueang! What are you doing?

782
00:49:47,246 --> 00:49:51,086
- Mueang! - What are you doing? No!

783
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:56,206
Oh my gosh!

784
00:49:56,534 --> 00:49:59,806
- Ri! - Ri! Are you okay, my girl?

785
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:02,166
Phing, get me a towel!

786
00:50:03,286 --> 00:50:04,771
Hey!

787
00:50:04,895 --> 00:50:06,174
Mueang!

788
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:08,006
Why are you doing this?

789
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,646
Your cousin spied on me getting dressed.

790
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:13,245
I just want to take a little look.

791
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:15,326
You're too shy for a man.

792
00:50:15,566 --> 00:50:18,486
What? What if I spy on you? Would you be okay?

793
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:21,166
I am. If you want to look, come and get me.

794
00:50:21,294 --> 00:50:23,326
Ri! Stop it!

795
00:50:23,407 --> 00:50:24,806
Just get out of there.

796
00:50:24,926 --> 00:50:26,405
- Om, come and help Ri. - Ri!

797
00:50:26,486 --> 00:50:28,485
- Ri, come on up. - Ri, come here.

798
00:50:28,566 --> 00:50:30,006
Stop! Come here!

799
00:50:30,446 --> 00:50:32,486
- That's enough. - Come on.

800
00:50:32,737 --> 00:50:33,966
Come here.

801
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:35,828
Are you okay, my girl?

802
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:38,406
- Come here, my girl. - Mueang, that's enough.

803
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:40,526
- Come on. - Ri!

804
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:45,966
Mueang, I apologize for my cousin spying on you,

805
00:50:46,134 --> 00:50:48,366
but didn't you go too far?

806
00:50:48,806 --> 00:50:49,966
Too far?

807
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,646
This is my house. She's lucky I didn't call the police on her.

808
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:55,806
Hey, we're the ones that need to call the police.

809
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:58,566
What if my sister can't swim and she drowns?

810
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,573
Can she drown in this shallow pool?

811
00:51:00,654 --> 00:51:02,334
- What if she gets cramps? - Just save her then.

812
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:04,166
- You're here anyway. - I won't make it in time.

813
00:51:04,286 --> 00:51:06,086
- Do you want to get wet too? - Om!

814
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,030
Take Ri inside and get her changed.

815
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:10,278
- Apo. - Om.

816
00:51:10,446 --> 00:51:11,446
Go!

817
00:51:11,606 --> 00:51:13,046
What's going on?

818
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:16,726
Why did you get all wet?

819
00:51:21,271 --> 00:51:22,838
How rude.

820
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:25,006
I asked, and you didn't answer.

821
00:51:27,246 --> 00:51:28,926
What happened, Mr. Mueang?

822
00:51:31,765 --> 00:51:35,006
If you don't tell your family to go home, I'll kick them out.

823
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,086
What happened? Mueang?

824
00:51:44,222 --> 00:51:45,406
Mueang?

825
00:51:51,606 --> 00:51:53,846
Did you cause trouble again?

826
00:51:57,469 --> 00:52:00,326
I was away for half a day, and it's gone beyond what I expected.

827
00:52:00,526 --> 00:52:02,526
Are you really going to do nothing?

828
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,686
I need more information.

829
00:52:05,341 --> 00:52:07,766
I don't have proof that her aunt

830
00:52:07,846 --> 00:52:09,086
was really trying to steal.

831
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,326
By the way, those two can help us get rid of Apo.

832
00:52:14,455 --> 00:52:15,566
How?

833
00:52:15,686 --> 00:52:19,126
Maybe they're missing Apo so much

834
00:52:19,245 --> 00:52:23,430
and want to take her home to be their servant.

835
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:31,229
- I'm smart. - Apo, won't you do something about it?

836
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,446
He threw me in a pool.

837
00:52:33,662 --> 00:52:35,926
Why did you spy on him anyway?

838
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,646
I spied on him, but he had no right to assault me.

839
00:52:41,052 --> 00:52:44,126
Yeah, Ri is right.

840
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:46,966
You're taking their side too much.

841
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:49,366
I'm not taking any side.

842
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:51,286
I think you were both at fault.

843
00:52:51,589 --> 00:52:54,846
I don't care. You need to tell him to apologize to me.

844
00:52:56,526 --> 00:52:59,901
No. You need to apologize to him.

845
00:53:00,142 --> 00:53:03,046
No. You tell him to apologize to me first,

846
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:07,566
and I'll consider if he deserves my apology.

847
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:15,206
That thing we talked about,

848
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:16,926
don't forget it please.

849
00:53:25,846 --> 00:53:26,846
Yes?

850
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:29,406
It's something urgent, so I called.

851
00:53:29,766 --> 00:53:31,006
What is it?

852
00:53:31,206 --> 00:53:32,206
Well...

853
00:53:33,886 --> 00:53:35,046
I...

854
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:41,086
I need to borrow your money.

855
00:53:42,526 --> 00:53:44,886
Did Darin ask you to borrow my money?

856
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:48,806
Did she? I'm right, aren't I?

857
00:53:50,086 --> 00:53:51,406
I know

858
00:53:51,574 --> 00:53:54,146
I'm not in a position to borrow your money.

859
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,982
I haven't paid off their old debt,

860
00:53:57,373 --> 00:53:59,646
but Aunt Da is really in trouble.

861
00:54:00,774 --> 00:54:01,926
I won't lend them the money.

862
00:54:02,062 --> 00:54:03,526
(We'll talk about this when I get home.)

863
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:05,526
(I'm already on the way.)

864
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:07,046
(Goodbye.)

865
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:24,806
Did Mr. Phudin lend you the money?

866
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:30,486
That face?

867
00:54:30,806 --> 00:54:33,046
Does that mean he won't lend me the money?

868
00:54:35,101 --> 00:54:38,246
- Whoa! Come with me! - Aunt Da!

869
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:41,566
Aunt Da!

870
00:54:42,982 --> 00:54:44,982
Why didn't he lend me the money?

871
00:54:45,846 --> 00:54:48,726
I don't know. He said we'd talk about it when he comes home.

872
00:54:49,334 --> 00:54:51,206
So you really won't help me?

873
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:53,966
I'm trying to help you, Aunt Da.

874
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:57,486
Have you forgotten how I've helped you all your life?

875
00:54:57,741 --> 00:55:01,606
Without me, you'd have grown up in an orphanage.

876
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:04,686
Maybe my life would have been better then.

877
00:55:05,486 --> 00:55:06,686
What did you say?

878
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:09,446
I said maybe my life would have been better!

879
00:55:09,877 --> 00:55:11,126
You ungrateful brat!

880
00:55:14,085 --> 00:55:16,406
Do you think it's over between us?

881
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:19,606
I'll tell you this. It's not as easy as you think.

882
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:22,726
Even if you get married to pay off your mom and dad's debt,

883
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:26,006
you still owe me for raising you.

884
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:27,846
What you owe me,

885
00:55:27,934 --> 00:55:29,686
Mr. Phudin can't pay it off for you.

886
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,206
Nobody can pay it off for you.

887
00:55:31,342 --> 00:55:34,646
You're the only one who can repay me.

888
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:37,726
Remember! You owe me.

889
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:40,686
(At that moment, my only thought is)

890
00:55:40,846 --> 00:55:43,526
(I want Aunt Da to disappear from there.)

891
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:44,910
(Begone.)

892
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:48,207
I'm saying you owe me.

893
00:55:48,288 --> 00:55:51,926
(Begone.)

894
00:55:52,007 --> 00:55:53,526
(Begone now.)

895
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,246
Leave my house now.

896
00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:38,086
Put these on.

897
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:55,086
I told you

898
00:56:55,406 --> 00:56:56,966
if you won't, I'll kick them out.

899
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:38,126
(I'll tell you something.)

900
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:41,246
(Nobody in this house can protect you.)

901
00:58:34,182 --> 00:58:37,126
Why? Why didn't you fight back? I don't get it.

902
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:40,006
You let them oppress you! If I were you, I'd have fought back long ago.

903
00:58:40,126 --> 00:58:42,126
I told you to tell them to go home. Why didn't you?

904
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,606
Whoa!

905
00:58:44,326 --> 00:58:47,966
You let them abuse and hurt you. I've seen it so many times.

906
00:58:52,758 --> 00:58:53,926
Why are you crying?

907
00:58:56,246 --> 00:58:57,446
Or did I...

908
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:00,046
Are you hurt?

909
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:02,206
I'm not.

910
00:59:02,526 --> 00:59:03,726
Are you sad?

911
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,606
Are you sad because of what she said?

912
00:59:10,486 --> 00:59:12,006
What's wrong? Tell me.

913
00:59:14,853 --> 00:59:16,126
Thank you.

914
00:59:20,301 --> 00:59:22,766
Nobody has ever saved me like that.

915
00:59:30,286 --> 00:59:31,846
Wait. Well...

916
00:59:33,046 --> 00:59:34,366
Are you crying

917
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:36,166
happy tears?

918
00:59:40,134 --> 00:59:41,326
All...

919
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:42,926
All these years,

920
00:59:45,526 --> 00:59:47,886
I've always been dealing with this alone.

921
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,366
Thank you, Mueang.

922
00:59:57,342 --> 00:59:58,806
I'm sorry.

923
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:04,350
I won't cry anymore.

924
01:00:09,422 --> 01:00:10,526
You can cry.

925
01:00:10,846 --> 01:00:13,846
No one can hear you from here.

926
01:00:14,286 --> 01:00:15,446
Cry it out.

927
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:17,406
Really?

928
01:00:18,526 --> 01:00:21,526
I'm really going to cry.

929
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,126
Go ahead.

930
01:00:24,797 --> 01:00:26,997
I'm really going to cry now.

931
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,446
I...

932
01:01:59,654 --> 01:02:01,006
Where is Apo?

933
01:02:01,478 --> 01:02:02,966
She left with Mr. Mueang.

934
01:02:03,102 --> 01:02:04,246
Where did they go?

935
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:07,646
I don't know, sir. I only saw Mr. Mueang grabbed her hand and left.

936
01:02:30,141 --> 01:02:31,326
Mueang.

937
01:02:32,455 --> 01:02:34,646
Are your feet hurt?

938
01:02:42,322 --> 01:02:43,646
My skin is thick.

939
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,286
But they look...

940
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:49,726
You're feeling better, are you?

941
01:02:50,526 --> 01:02:51,686
Want to head back?

942
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:08,061
Let's go.

943
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,468
Where are you taking me?

944
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:21,446
That's how it is.

945
01:04:21,886 --> 01:04:25,166
When you've been dealing with something, you need an escape at some point.

946
01:04:30,726 --> 01:04:32,086
I get it.

947
01:04:33,366 --> 01:04:35,446
I tried to escape once.

948
01:04:39,396 --> 01:04:40,566
At that time,

949
01:04:41,549 --> 01:04:43,526
I wanted to quit being myself.

950
01:04:44,734 --> 01:04:46,326
I didn't want to be Apo.

951
01:04:46,784 --> 01:04:48,406
I'm sorry.

952
01:04:49,246 --> 01:04:50,806
The first time we met,

953
01:04:51,327 --> 01:04:53,334
I told you some random name.

954
01:04:59,413 --> 01:05:00,446
Forget it.

955
01:05:00,766 --> 01:05:01,966
I don't care.

956
01:05:05,862 --> 01:05:06,966
Honestly,

957
01:05:07,086 --> 01:05:10,686
I was so embarrassed when you saw my real life.

958
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,726
You seemed so impressed with the woman called View.

959
01:05:13,999 --> 01:05:16,846
I'm just an ordinary person with nothing special.

960
01:05:30,566 --> 01:05:31,846
That's not what I think.

961
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,806
I'm just saying that

962
01:06:34,501 --> 01:06:36,686
we all are special in our own way.

963
01:06:37,085 --> 01:06:38,686
It's just that you're

964
01:06:38,846 --> 01:06:40,206
special in a weird way.

965
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:48,086
Thank you for today.

966
01:06:48,606 --> 01:06:51,206
I'll repay this favor.

967
01:06:53,726 --> 01:06:54,886
Don't.

968
01:06:55,862 --> 01:06:59,286
- No, I can't let this... - I said don't.

969
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:01,166
What's wrong with you?

970
01:07:01,574 --> 01:07:03,086
Do you like to owe people?

971
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,846
No, but if I do, I need to repay them.

972
01:07:07,142 --> 01:07:08,366
When will you be done repaying?

973
01:07:08,598 --> 01:07:11,566
When your cousin and aunt die?

974
01:07:12,045 --> 01:07:13,126
What about yourself?

975
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:15,166
When will you live your own life?

976
01:07:17,797 --> 01:07:20,366
How did it get to this?

977
01:07:23,696 --> 01:07:26,646
I had been meaning to say this. I was just waiting for the right moment.

978
01:07:30,206 --> 01:07:31,566
You said

979
01:07:32,436 --> 01:07:34,286
you wanted to quit being yourself.

980
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:35,926
Is it because of them?

981
01:07:36,606 --> 01:07:40,286
If it is, there's no need to care. You owe them?

982
01:07:41,246 --> 01:07:42,526
That's nonsense.

983
01:07:43,086 --> 01:07:44,386
I get what you're trying to say,

984
01:07:45,726 --> 01:07:47,406
but they're my family.

985
01:07:47,926 --> 01:07:49,646
You see them as family,

986
01:07:50,085 --> 01:07:51,286
but what about them?

987
01:07:51,878 --> 01:07:53,286
They see you as something else.

988
01:07:56,526 --> 01:07:58,246
Stop living for others

989
01:07:59,086 --> 01:08:01,286
and start living for yourself.

990
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:07,086
I just don't want to be selfish.

991
01:08:08,037 --> 01:08:09,806
I'm not telling you to be selfish.

992
01:08:10,488 --> 01:08:12,646
I just want you to love yourself.

993
01:08:13,887 --> 01:08:15,286
Do you know how to do that?

994
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:19,006
If you don't even know how to love yourself,

995
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:21,126
don't expect to find happiness in this life.

996
01:08:21,406 --> 01:08:22,766
Sleep on it.

997
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:25,486
Stop wasting your life.

998
01:08:44,183 --> 01:08:45,197
Where have you been?

999
01:08:45,278 --> 01:08:46,726
Listen to me, Mr. Phudin.

1000
01:08:46,846 --> 01:08:48,725
I want to listen to my son.

1001
01:08:48,806 --> 01:08:52,844
You still have feelings for Mueang, don't you?

1002
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:54,806
Phing, stop!

1003
01:08:55,086 --> 01:08:58,726
You know what his status is and what mine is.

1004
01:08:58,807 --> 01:09:01,086
I think you did the right thing today.

1005
01:09:01,174 --> 01:09:03,686
Ms. Apo is surely grateful to you.

1006
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:07,166
She isn't. She never even looks at me.

1007
01:09:07,254 --> 01:09:09,254
The people I owe

1008
01:09:09,335 --> 01:09:10,686
are mafia.

1009
01:09:10,782 --> 01:09:14,166
- Mafia? - This is your punishment

1010
01:09:14,286 --> 01:09:15,886
for paying my boss too late!

1011
01:09:15,982 --> 01:09:18,086
- I will never help you again. - Fine.

1012
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:19,846
From now on, we're strangers.

1013
01:09:19,934 --> 01:09:23,006
I don't want an ungrateful niece like you!
