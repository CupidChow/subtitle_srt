Currently, the sales bottleneck of your company

in the company's business capacity.

But now in the company,

86
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,270
there's no product that is worthy of collaboration.

I'm sorry.

104
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,590
The style is different.

105
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,220
But I don't know

106
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,150
what the overall dynamic effects

107
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,500
will be like

108
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,670
after the modeling.

109
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,150
For the dynamic effects of clothes

110
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,150
in the real world,

111
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,970
I'll simulate them well while adjusting

112
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,940

113
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,270
Don't worry about this.

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,570
Besides,

115
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,180
I know your company

118
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,820
you can't find a suitable key animator.

119
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,200
So I made this plan.

120

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,180
I have to meddle in everything.

178
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,980
This is such a good tradition.

179
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,910
We can't lose it.

180
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:31,880
Then...

181
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,720
It's such a bother for you.

182
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,660
Thank you so much.

183
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,660
It's not a bother.

184
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,690
Not at all.

185
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,040
When are you going?

186
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,600
[Ms. Xu (Flower World)]

187
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,780
Hello, Ms. Xu.

188
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,670
Miss Yin.

189
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,020
I can give you

190
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,220
another half an hour.

191
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,780
See you in the company's meeting room.

192
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,110
Okay, Ms. Xu. Thank you.

193
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,020
Miss Yin, this way, please.

194
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,410
Ms. Xu.

195
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,430
Miss Yin is here.

196
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,680
Ms. Xu.

197
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
Sit down and talk.

198
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,300
Ms. Xu.

199
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,860
This is our cooperation plan.

200
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,920
You can take a look.

201
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,420
With the current amount offline,

202
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,660
it's impossible to complete this Valuation Adjustment.

203
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,150
Frank,

204
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,360
I think

205
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,440
you were right about Miss Yin.

206
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,670
Miss Yin can

207
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,820
bring back such a

208
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,660
valuable contract.

209
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,460
It's not easy.

210
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,740
This Valuation Adjustment on the business performance

211
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,070
is not a casual promise.

212
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,160
What happened between SC

213
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,370
and the Flower World last time

214
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,100
caused such a groundswell of public opinion.

215
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,570
In fact, reversely,

216
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,260
it's beneficial

217
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,320
for our publicity.

218
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,020
We also did market research.

219
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,180
The consumers are looking forward

220
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,380
to this cooperation.

221
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,020
So,

222
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,190
we are quite confident in the Valuation Adjustment

223
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,650
on business performance.

224
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,800
You are very confident, Miss Yin.

225
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,380
You impressed me.

226
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,390
Now,

227
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,530
I sincerely hope

228
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,180
your Live Stream Department can do a good job.

229
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,260
If you can do a good job,

230
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
it's like sharing the burden for me.

231
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,120
However,

232
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,780
Frank,

233
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,270
after Ms. Zheng resigned,

234
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,350
the position of marketing director

235
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,310
has been vacant.

236
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,890
Without the director,

237
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
the morale of staff may be unstable.

238
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,150
Mr. Kong.

239
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,220
Don't worry about this.

240
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,850
Our Live Stream Department

241
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,310
won't be affected by this.

242
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,060
In the end,

243
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,660
it'll depend on the business performance.

244
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,610
We should encourage

245
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,700
the morale of the Marketing Department.

246
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,560
How about this?

247
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,940
The whole team of the Live Stream Department

248
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,140
will move back to their original workplace.

249
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,890
Then...

250
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,760
Miss Yin, keep up the good work.

251
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,740
Let the Live Stream Department

252
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,340
set an example for everyone.

253
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,420
It's rare.

254
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,460
It's rare that Frank

255
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,480
should trust you so much.

256
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,380
It depends on yourself

257
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,040
whether it can succeed or not.

258
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,140
Thank you, Mr. Kong.

259
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,870
Do your best.

260
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,540
Stop watching.

261
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,530
She has been there for so long. It must have failed.

262
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,030
Don't be such a doomsayer.

263
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,880
Can you stop making

264
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,780
yourself panic first?

265
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,960
Calm down.

266
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,010
I've thought about it.

267
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:50,990
If I get fired,

268
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,460
I'll open a cafe at my hometown.

269
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,190
You still have that much money?

270
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,250
No.

271
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,630
You've already thought about a way out?

272
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,120
What should we do then?

273
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,160
Yike.

274
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,590
Yike.

275
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,320
Yike.

276
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,630
Yike.

277
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,980
Are we fired?

278
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,340
Yike.

279
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,320
It's okay.

280
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,820
No matter what happens,

281
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,570
we can accept it.

282
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,820
And we'll always follow you.

283
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,580
That's right.

284
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,580
Say something.

285
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,890
Frank asked us to pack up.

286
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,000
I was right.

287
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,960
I quit.

288
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,060
The nail polish I've just bought

289
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,180
will be mailed to our company's address.

290
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,140
Pack up.

291
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,080
He asked us to move back to the 20th floor.

292
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,790
The Marketing Department.

293
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,390
We finally made it.

294
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,260
We can go back.

295
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,820
We made it.

296
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,810
Where is the Marketing Department?

297
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,100
Just come with us.

298
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,570
Yike,

299
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,950
are we going to

300
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,530
have new products?

301
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,020
I've just received a notice from Ms. Xu.

302
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,060
There will be some slight adjustment

303
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,380
for the co-branded skins this time.

304
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,670
We will choose a popular style

305
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,460
and a hidden style among them.

306
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,080
Will the Flower World

307
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,340
send an animator here?

308
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,090
Well...

309
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,790
Just wait and see.

310
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,070
Yibo,

311
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,920
try this.

312
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,810
Have some water.

313
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,220
No, thanks.

314
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,660
Stop reading.

315
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,970
-Xia Xiaomian. -You've been reading for so long. Take a break.

316
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,780
I'm memorizing the words.

317
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,360
I can't memorize them if you're like this.

318
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,820
Just tell me what you want.

319
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,010
If there's nothing special,

320
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,740
just go home.

321
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,670
You don't have to stay here with me.

322
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,770
But...

323
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,100
You study so hard.

324
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,510
If you don't like this,

325
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,040
why do you force yourself?

326
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,080
You don't understand.

327
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,640
I understand.

328
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,660
Anyway,

329
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,820
your dad is fine now.

330
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,890
Besides,

331
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,320
you promised me

332
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,380
to help me improve my live stream knowledge

333
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,780
and collaborate with me in the live stream.

334
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,580
Don't forget.

335
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,610
As for the live stream,

336
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,570
just forget it.

337
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,630
I won't do it again.

338
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,620
Why?

339
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,030
I'm lucky this time.

340
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,020
I can't make my dad angry again.

341
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,340
And I've figured it out.

342
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,310
I should listen to him,

343
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,980
and focus on the postgraduate entrance exam.

344
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,910
I won't do the live stream anymore.

345
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,180
No.

346
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,880
Look.

347
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,780
Your dad has even agreed on

348
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,740
the love relationship between

349
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Guangxi and Yike.

350
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,900
He will agree on

351
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,330
your work on live stream.

352
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,080
Then what?

353
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,840
Make him angry so he has to live in hospital again?

354
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,310
But Yibo,

355
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,740
you are a famous live streamer.

356
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,610
You have so many videos.

357
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,700
You've accumulated these videos and fans

358
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,010
one by one for so many years to get today's results.

359
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,870
They all represent your hard work

360
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,490
and your achievements.

361
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,610
You just give up like this?

362
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,810
What's the use of being a famous live streamer?

363
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,300
My dad doesn't accept it.

364
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,030
We accept it.

365
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,110
During the live stream,

366
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,340
your eyes were sparkling.

367
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,330
I think

368
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,470
you really like this job.

369
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,850
Doesn't your dad know that?

370
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,870
Actually at the beginning,

371
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,280
I wanted to take the advantage of

372
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,270
the good trend of live stream

373
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,700
to earn some extra money.

374
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,420
From a nobody

375
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,920
to a live streamer who had more and more fans,

376
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,330
I don't deny that

377
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
I did feel proud.

378
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,660
When the number of my fans was

379
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,420
getting bigger and bigger later,

380
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,440
I got more and more

381
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,800
proficient in the live stream.

382
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,760
And you know what?

383
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,370
Many foreign brands

384
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,940
didn't plan to

385
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,720
enter the market of

386
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,900
our country at first.

387
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,460
I tried so hard

388
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
to get their products

389
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,530
and gave them to my fans

390
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,490
as gifts.

391
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,400
This way, they could

392
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,460
increase the popularity and open the market in our country,

393
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,260
so they were willing to enter the market.

394
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,880
And when we first cooperated,

395
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,810
it was really...

396
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,140
It was very tiring.

397
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,940
Many of them were in foreign countries.

398
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,980
There was time difference.

399
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,440
I stayed up late to contact them every day.

400
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,210
During that time, I really...

401
00:16:59,210 --> 00:16:59,760
Yes, yes, yes.

402
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,620
I had to study for the postgraduate entrance exam

403
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,680
and do this at the same time, you know?

404
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,640
Yibo,

405
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,670
when you mentioned this,

406
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
you looked very serious.

407
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,910
Very handsome.

408
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,540
So I think your dad

409
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,859
will approve of you.

410
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,660
As the saying goes,

411
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,460
it's like...

412
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,660
Every profession produces

413
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,060
its own topmost "pasta".

414
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,490
Topmost "pasta"?

415
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,140
It's topmost master.

416
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,990
Whatever it is,

417
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,819
anyway,

418
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,619
there is always food

419
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,820
in every profession.

420
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,100
But Xiaomian...

421
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,820
You asked me to have

422
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,740
a heart-to-heart talk with my dad.

423
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,730
Thank you for that.

424
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,050
At first, I thought

425
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,920
you were

426
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,700
a reckless

427
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,220
and careless girl.

428
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,460
Later, I found

429
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,230
you are more insightful than me

430
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,220
on many things.

431
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,780
So I've figured it out.

432
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,190
Don't put a bet on family,

433
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,830
and cherish them.

434
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,100
Yibo.

435
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,130
Stop calling my name.

436
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,700
I'm going back to recite the words.

437
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,130
Besides,

438
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,780
you should go home early.

439
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,620
Be careful.

440
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,860
Thank you, Xia Xiaomian.

441
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,910
This is Dan from Xiafei Road.

442
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,870
Well,

443
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,940
it's been a long time since my last live streaming.

444
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,140
In this live streaming,

445
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,460
I want to tell you something.

446
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:34,900
Well,

447
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,530
I'm going to quit the live stream.

448
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,940
Farewell?

449
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,780
Where are you going?

450
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,260
No way.

451
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,210
It was not easy for me to find

452
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,470
a live streamer I like.

453
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,950
I know you've been with me

454
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,740
during the whole time.

455
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,690
I'm very grateful.

456
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,660
But as

457
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,140
something happened in my family,

458
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,300
I have to focus

459
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,580
a lot of my energy

460
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,910
and time

461
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,140
on that thing.

462
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,900
So I might have to be away

463
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,260
from this for some time.

464
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,970
Don't give me gifts.

465
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
So enthusiastic.

466
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,510
In that case,

467
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,450
I promise you.

468
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,680
After I finish handling

469
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,490
the affairs of my family,

470
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,550
I'll be back, okay?

471
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,470
Of course,

472
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,070
in the last live streaming,

473
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,890
I still remember

474
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,180
you guys, my dear fans.

475
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,530
I'll recommend you...

476
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,780
The latest version of shoes.

477
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,020
Why do I recommend these shoes?

478
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,550
Because first of all, look,

479
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,980
the design of the soles

480
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,660
is very stylish.

481
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,010
And more importantly,

482
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,990
the shoes are of neutral style.

483
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,820
Both men and women can wear them.

484
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,610
Boys wearing them

485
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,800
won't look like a sissy,

486
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,840
while girls wearing them

487
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,390
will look sporty.

488
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,730
And this pair of shoes...

489
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,560
Live stream is really fun.

490
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,850
Look.

491
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,330
He's not usually like this at home.

492
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,760
He's so eloquent.

493
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,370
Yes.

494
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,440
He's quite handsome, too.

495
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,180
Of course.

496
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,330
It feels like stepping on cotton candy, so...

497
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,260
Mr. Yin, look.

498
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:47,970
There are so many people.

499
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,670
They are all

500
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,230
Yibo's fans.

501
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,020
Yibo is

502
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,320
a big star in the live stream room.

503
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,100
Really?

504
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,020
How many people are watching his show?

505
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,620
Look, here is the number of audience.

506
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,140
It means

507
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,330
there are over 300,000 people

508
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,640
-watching Yibo's live stream. -Over 300,000 people are watching it?

509
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,280
This kid

510
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,510
is really amazing.

511
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,720
Well...

512
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,260
This...

513
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,060
What is this yacht

514
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,780
used for?

515
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,390
It represents a gift.

516
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,220
This is a like.

517
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,140
So if you place an order now...

518
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,220
I'll give my son a gift.

519
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,080
Very suitable.

520
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,970
Thank you, Yin...

521
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,440
It costs you money.

522
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,670
How much?

523
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,850
Over 1,000 yuan.

524
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,780
Over 1,000 yuan?

525
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,290
Yin Chenggong.

526
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,510
Yin Yibo, come out!

527
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,670
I have to hang up.

528
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:36,550
Dad.

529
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,110
Come out!

530
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,780
Dad.

531
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,200
You...

532
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:38,980
You...

533
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,760
Why did you give me a yacht?

534
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,210
I…

535
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,120
Xia Xiaomian.

536
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,530
Why are you here?

537
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm teaching your dad to watch live stream.

538
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,650
This...

539
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,560
Give the money back to me.

540
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,190
It cost me half a month's

541
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,690
salary.

542
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,660
A yacht costs over 1,000 yuan.

543
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,620
Listen, you can't accept gifts

544
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,180
during your live stream in the future.

545
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,900
If someone gives you a gift,

546
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,470
return it.

547
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,230
Understand?

548
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,050
Wait, Dad.

549
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,060
You mean my live stream in the future?

550
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,270
Money

551
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,700
doesn't grow on trees.

552
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,700
It's just a small thing, and it costs over 1,000 yuan.

553
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,140
Don't accept this gift. Got it?

554
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,440
Got it.

555
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,100
You mean

556
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,460
I can continue to do

557
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,090
the live streaming?

558
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,250
I didn't say that.

559
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,110
As long as you can pass the postgraduate entrance exam,

560
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,390
with the door of your room closed,

561
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,140
you can do whatever you want.

562
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,670
I'll pretend I see nothing.

563
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,480
Dad, I love you.

564
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,300
Give the money back to me.

565
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,860
I won't love you for now.

566
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,400
Go away!

567
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:30,750
Go away!

568
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,130
Remember to transfer the money back to me.

569
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,860
I'll help you

570
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,990
get your money back.

571
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,000
They look good together.

572
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,220
A yacht costs over 1,000 yuan.

573
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,030
It's so easy to earn money through live stream.

574
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,690
It's much more profitable than driving.

575
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,520
I'll do a live stream tomorrow.

576
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,000
It's okay! It's okay!

577
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,780
Why are you

578
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,800
at our home?

579
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,940
What did you tell my dad?

580
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,950
Why did he watch my live stream?

581
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,790
Nothing.

582
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,780
I taught your dad to watch the live stream.

583
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,870
He supported

584
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
your live stream.

585
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,190
How did you

586
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,590
enter our house?

587
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,220
Xiaomian.

588
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,420
Come on.

589
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,940
Have some watermelon.

590
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,800
Thank you, Mrs. Yin.

591
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,240
Come on. It's sweet.

592
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,710
Come on. Pick a big one.

593
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,780
Aunt Lan.

594
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,160
How did she enter our house?

595
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,380
What did she say to my dad?

596
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,540
Why did my dad

597
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,400
watch the live stream and give me the gift of yacht?

598
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,830
This colleague of Yike's

599
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,650
is too bold.

600
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,300
She just knocked on the door and came in.

601
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,390
As soon as she came in,

602
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,380
she coaxed your father

603
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,500
cleverly.

604
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,940
Your dad was very happy.

605
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:47,940
You know

606
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,900
your dad is stubborn.

607
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,370
He doesn't admit defeat.

608
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,210
Yibo.

609
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,910
Is she

610
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,340
your little girlfriend?

611
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:02,900
Aunt Lan.

612
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Pure friendship.

613
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,860
Trust me.

614
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,740
Trust me. Pure friendship.

615
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,570
Xia Xiaomian.

616
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,670
It's late.

617
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,220
Go back.

618
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,940
Go, go, go.

619
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,020
I haven't finished yet.

620
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,570
-Eat on the way. -Bye, Mrs. Yin.

621
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,740
Be careful.

622
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,600
This kid.

623
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,510
Hello?

624
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,000
You're still working?

625
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,740
Yes.

626
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,180
I have to work overtime tonight.

627
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,040
What about you?

628
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,480
What a coincidence.

629
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,640
I have to work overtime, too.

630
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,580
It seems that

631
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,880
we're in the same boat.

632
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,500
Are you working overtime at home

633
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,830
or in the company today?

634
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,450
Hello, Miss Yin.

635
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,080
Your overtime working partner Xu

636
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,810
is online.

637
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,000
Thank you, Director Xu.

638
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,820
It's late,

639
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,710
and you have to come to my company.

640
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,450
So you finally moved back here.

641
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,660
After we received the Valuation Adjustment Mechanism,

642
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,850
we moved back here.

643
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,220
You're partly credited with this.

644
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,050
Come on.

645
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,120
This is an overtime working small corner

646
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,770
I've prepared for you specially.

647
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,870
So sweet.

648
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,060
I have

649
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,500
a personal reward for you.

650
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,160
Wait for me.

651
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,430
This is

652
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,550
the exclusive coffee for Xu Guangxi.

653
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,910
Do you like it?

654
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,500
This is the best coffee

655
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,530
I've ever had.

656
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,410
The best!

657
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,620
Can I have it every day?

658
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,780
It depends on your performance.

659
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,720
When will we

660
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,600
start working?

661
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,380
I know Ms. Xu has high standard.

662
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,610
I even asked for someone else's help.

663
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,740
What a coincidence.

664
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,690
I've also hired a helper

665
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,420
to assist us.

666
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,120
This is the original flavor.

667
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,120
Thank you.

668
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,620
This

669
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,650
is the cherry blossom flavor.

670
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,600
What else?

671
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,100
Are you here to help

672
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,180
or to eat?

673
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,010
You bought so many snacks.

674
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,620
Of course I'll help.

675
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,270
You'll be hungry during the meeting.

676
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,910
I did the logistics service.

677
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,060
No, I was kind enough

678
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,180
to buy you so much food.

679
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,720
You bought too much.

680
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,490
What are these?

681
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,940
So many snacks and junk food.

682
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,980
Well, you don't eat,

683
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,890
but there are still two other people.

684
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,770
Why are you giving it to me if I don't eat?

685
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,180
Well,

686
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,270
I bought pizza.

687
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,060
I'm sorry.

688
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,280
I'm hungry.

689
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:00,980
Thank you.

690
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,110
Learn from her.

691
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,320
Let's start the meeting.

692
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,890
Sit down.

693
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,020
Start the meeting.

694
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,750
Let's start.

695
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,600
I think

696
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,660
we are working with

697
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,050
an Otome Game.

698
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,180
But we also need to make

699
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,110
a sweet perfume.

700
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,580
Smell of popular co-branded

701
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,350
perfumes in games

702
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,550
all features

703
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,670
strong impulsiveness

704
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,980
and easiness to remember.

705
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,870
The users...

706
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,930
Chen Ye.

707
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,090
I'm sorry.

708
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,570
I'm sorry.

709
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,300
If it's extreme,

710
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,400
can we use

711
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,290
the concept of restless hormone?

712
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,820
Use...

713
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,060
Dad Chen.

714
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,380
Chen Ye.

715
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,710
What are you doing here?

716
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,900
I don't understand your talk.

717
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,660
What do you want me to do?

718
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,580
I'm a little bored.

719
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,780
I really don't know much about perfume.

720
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,620
Dad, pick up the phone.

721
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,930
Dad, pick up the phone.

722
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,110
I'm sorry.

723
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,710
Yu.

724
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,350
Go to sleep.

725
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,720
I'll get home late.

726
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,770
I might put it on the front page.

727
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,810
Like a video.

728
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,110
The details here.

729
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,710
Excuse me.

730
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,010
Yu said he was going to bed.

731
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,120
Could you please

732
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,650
tell him one or two stories?

733
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,270
-Look at these clothes. -Hello.

734
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,590
Mom! Mom!

735
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,490
Yu.

736
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,770
Don't call me mom.

737
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,150
I'll be off work soon.

738
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,870
Tell you a story?

739
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,400
No problem.

740
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,380
How many stories do you want to hear today?

741
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,240
Three?

742
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,080
You have to promise me

743
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
to go to bed first.

744
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,300
Xia Xiaomian.

745
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,430
How did you deal with my father?

746
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,890
That's easy.

747
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
I told him you showed up

748
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,550
at a "clitical" moment

749
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,230
and saved

750
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,680
our entire Live Stream Department.

751
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,610
What do you mean?

752
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,250
At a "clitical" moment?

753
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,500
Xia Xiaomian, it's "at a critical moment".

754
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,530
Can you improve your literacy skills?

755
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,870
It's the same anyway.

756
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,360
Now your dad supports you.

757
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,660
Thank you.

758
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:09,890
What?

759
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,580
Thank you.

760
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,670
Thank me?

761
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,370
Shouldn't you do something?

762
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,340
Don't be so insatiable.

763
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,690
You're lucky this time.

764
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,980
If you sneaks in again

765
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:21,910
and my dad discovers you,

766
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,310
both of us will be doomed.

767
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,450
Your father

768
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,980
isn't angry this time, right?

769
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,420
Besides, he even supports your live stream.

770
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,550
This is a good thing.

771
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,650
What do you mean?

772
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,530
Yibo,

773
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,100
true love can only be discoverd

774
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,970
after going through wind and rain.

775
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,290
Look at us.

776
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,740
You saved me from cyber violence.

777
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,940
I helped you solve the primary problem.

778
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,260
Can we consider it as

779
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,310
going though a typhoon together?

780
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,510
Tornado.

781
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Extra large typhoon.

782
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:50,730
Extra large...

783
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,540
I don't understand.

784
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,940
Speak in human language.

785
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,880
Agree to

786
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,940
my one small request.

787
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:56,910
I see.

788
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,180
You want me to treat you to dinner, right?

789
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,900
No problem.

790
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,100
After you finish the collaborated live stream,

791
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,500
I can treat you to dinner.

792
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,980
Just dinner?

793
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,150
What else?

794
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,500
I'm busy with the postgraduate entrance exam during daytime,

795
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,540
and with the live streaming at night.

796
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,580
I don't have time.

797
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,500
But...

798
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,660
No buts.

799
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,300
This is the best condition.

800
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,580
Besides,

801
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,270
have you finished memorizing the script for your live stream?

802
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,730
You're always thinking about other things.

803
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,670
The script?

804
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,740
I haven't memorized the script yet.

805
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,580
How did you ride your motorcycle?

806
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,410
It scared me.

807
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,250
Are you hurt?

808
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,290
What's wrong?

809
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:29,680
I...

810
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,860
I think I've sprained my ankle.

811
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,520
Well...

812
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,720
Let me carry you.

813
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,050
I'll carry you.

814
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,900
What are you waiting for? Come up.

815
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,430
Hurry up.

816
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,750
Let's go.

817
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,270
Are you out of your mind?

818
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,410
What are you thinking about every day?

819
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,420
Watch out while you're walking.

820
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,150
Understand?

821
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,420
Yibo,

822
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,620
I've made up my mind.

823
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,600
After I finish memorizing the script,

824
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,660
I'll "calibrate".

825
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,540
I said you're not smart.

826
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,070
It's "celebrate", not "calibrate".

827
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,860
I want to "calibrate".

828
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,160
What are you talking about?

829
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,760
By the way,

830
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,060
I've promised you to help you with the lessons.

831
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,190
I'll see you online.

832
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,370
Don't forget to keep your promise.

833
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,710
Is he asleep?

834
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,530
Yes.

835
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,700
Sit down. Let me clean up.

836
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,520
My house is a bit messy.

837
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,160
It's okay.

838
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,620
This is...

839
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,100
I bought it for you.

840
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,630
Thank you for your hard work these days.

841
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,210
I didn't know

842
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,210
you know a lot about this.

843
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,190
I know little about it.

844
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,760
I just searched it online.

845
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,880
You can use it.

846
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,590
Thanks.

847
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,870
You're welcome.

848
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,200
What do you want to drink?

849
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,820
I'll get you some water.

850
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,220
It's okay. Don't bother.

851
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,650
Come on. Have some water.

852
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,980
Do they represent you and Yu?

853
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Custom-made?

854
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,630
No.

855
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,940
I made it myself.

856
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,420
You made it yourself? So brilliant.

857
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,120
No, no.

858
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,660
Come on. Have a seat.

859
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,880
I didn't know

860
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,800
you can do this.

861
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,290
I was forced by the school.

862
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,480
It's the handmade class in their school.

863
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,180
Kids

864
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,310
don't know how to make these things.

865
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,780
They're all made by parents.

866
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,660
In other kids' family,

867
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,020
mothers and fathers made them together.

868
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,820
I did it alone.

869
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,460
I signed up for a class

870
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,750
and learned a few lessons

871
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,610
before I made them successfully.

872
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,620
I made that little wooden man, too.

873
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,060
It's not easy

874
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,300
to be a single father.

875
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,550
It's nothing.

876
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,810
At first, when I had to

877
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,020
look after him by myself,

878
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,260
I was not used to it.

879
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,680
But gradually,

880
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,780
I just learned it.

881
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,490
However, I really think

882
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,510
women are more gifted

883
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,210
for looking after kids than men.

884
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,740
Take myself as an example. I'll play with him,

885
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,710
cook for him,

886
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,410
and make these

887
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,880
little sculptures for him. I can do these things.

888
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,650
But for putting a child to sleep,

889
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,200
you're better than me.

890
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,180
Look. After you came,

891
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,610
he fell asleep so soon.

892
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,550
As for me... Look at these.

893
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,890
I have to tell him so many stories

894
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,030
before he goes to bed every night

895
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,050
so as to make him fall asleep.

896
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,330
It's like my story-telling session.

897
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,300
Enough.

898
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,770
Stop flattering me.

899
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,330
Chen Ye.

900
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,570
You're a boss after all.

901
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,410
You have a house and a car. You have good conditions.

902
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,700
It isn't difficult for you

903
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,440
to find a gentle and considerate

904
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,900
stepmother for Yu, right?

905
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,910
Why do you always

906
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,700
insist on

907
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,760
asking me for help?

908
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,220
As you know,

909
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,020
it doesn't work with me.

910
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,900
As I have

911
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,630
a car and a house,

912
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,030
and my conditions are good,

913
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,160
I still

914
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,930
have these

915
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,740
fantasies.

916
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,520
I'm imagining that,

917
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,560
apart from finding a mother for Yu,

918
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,350
I can also find

919
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,180
someone I like, and live with her

920
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,830
for the rest of my life.

921
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,110
What's wrong?

922
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,340
It suddenly occurred to me

923
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,430
I have something to discuss with you.

924
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,100
Do you think

925
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,060
Qin Yiran and Dad Chen

926
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,610
can be together?

927
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,100
What did you say?

928
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,080
I mean,

929
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,350
although she usually

930
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,140
seems to be carefree,

931
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,360
and always hangs out,

932
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,100
that's because

933
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,100
she hasn't met someone

934
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,260
she really likes.

935
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,380
She's afraid of getting hurt.

936
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,140
Don't worry.

937
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,970
Dad Chen won't let Yiran down.

938
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,940
But you...

939
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,300
Why do you sound like that

940
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,300
you're going to bring your bestie into the pit of love?

941
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,150
Let me tell you a story.

942
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,580
Someone feels guilty like a thief in the middle of the night.

943
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,360
What?

944
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,100
I...

945
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,110
I just want to chat with you.

946
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,370
Four feet.

947
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,000
No.

948
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,500
Two feet.

949
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,140
Two feet. Two feet.

950
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,100
My eyesight has dropped again.

951
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,720
I think I need to get a new pair of glasses.

952
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,210
Xu Guangxi has four feet.

953
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,450
It's you who have four feet.

954
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,130
Your proposal is good.

955
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,770
But there's a pity.

956
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,660
Why didn't Xu Guangxi

957
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,650
come to explain his work to me?

958
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,880
Because it's the cooperation between SC

959
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,200
and the Flower World.

960
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,780
According to the routine, I have to

961
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,980
come to report to you.

962
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,830
Guangxi has something to do at his company today,

963
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,960
but he also asked me to say hello to you.

964
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,440
What if I don't like

965
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,160
his work?

966
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,290
What will you do?

967
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,440
He said you would like it.

968
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,140
He studied me?

969
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,590
But it's useless if I'm the only one who likes it.

970
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,770
Only when the users like it can it be a success.

971
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,740
You are the leading figure

972
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,740
in the Flower World.

973
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,620
The work you like

974
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,210
must be the one

975
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,280
that the core users like.

976
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,020
Yin Yike.

977
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,810
No need to say those flattering words.

978
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,140
It doesn't work with me.

979
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,140
I'm not flattering you.

980
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,410
It's my extremely good comment

981
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,270
on the creator.

982
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,590
Your negotiation skills are really good.

983
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,260
Okay.

984
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,550
Let's work on

985
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,970
the following content quickly.

986
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:36,480
Okay.

987
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,890
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

988
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:46,740
Hello.

989
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,180
How was it? Did it pass?

990
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:48,700
What?

991
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,370
You have no confidence in yourself?

992
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,570
How is that possible?

993
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,010
Thanks to you,

994
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,660
I don't need to modify anything.

995
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,110
Look.

996
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,900
I told you Xu Yuan would like it.

997
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
I didn't expect

998
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,880
you to be so likable to female bosses.

999
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,710
Tell me honestly

1000
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,460
how long you spent on

1001
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,410
studying her.

1002
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,190
I didn't.

1003
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,700
I've worked for other clients for so many times.

1004
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,780
I have insight into what clients like.

1005
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,100
These are basic skills.

1006
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,100
Xu Yuan really thinks highly of you.

1007
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,450
She kept praising you, saying

1008
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,220
you are both handsome and talented.

1009
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,980
How she wishes

1010
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,210
she could make you work in her company now.

1011
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:18,960
Well,

1012
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,110
I have to hang up.

1013
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,320
I've worked for you for a few days,

1014
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,300
and the progress of Fengqi Shendu

1015
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,060
has slowed down.

1016
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,030
I think I have to work overtime tonight.

1017
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,430
You have to go home alone.

1018
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,610
But Guangxi, I...

1019
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,550
I have to hang up.

1020
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,110
I really have to hang up.

1021
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,180
They asked me to work.

1022
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,780
Be careful

1023
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,660
on your way home tonight.

1024
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,010
Bye.

1025
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,750
What's going on?

1026
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,410
Ms. Xu.

1027
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,130
Your Blue Mountain coffee.

1028
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,460
Help me replace it

1029
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,060
with the Geisha beans today.

1030
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,900
Didn't you say that Geisha is too refreshing,

1031
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,980
and not strong enough?

1032
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,230
It's good to change

1033
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,320
the flavor occasionally.

1034
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,490
Okay. I'll change it right away.

1035
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,540
Xu Guangxi.

00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,040
♫Baby, you are the one♫

1045
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,570
♫I secretively in my heart♫

1046
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:30,730
♫Wrote I'm willing to♫

1047
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,520
♫Don't know why. I suddenly♫

1048
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,310
♫Hate to calculate the distance between you and me♫

1049
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,790
♫I fear I cannot see you in the next second♫

1050
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,930
♫My heart is protesting♫

1051
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,720
♫I just feel it too♫

1052
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:46,470
♫It's like the coffee with full caramel milk foam♫

1053
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:51,670
♫The air has the fragrance of missing you♫

1054
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,100
♫Baby, from now on, come to me♫

1055

♫Come to me♫

1056
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,440
♫I want to be an umbrella for you♫

1057
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,900
♫To shield you from rain and wind♫

1058
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,040
♫You are my luck♫

1059
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,380
♫I'm like an ice-cream beneath the sun♫

1060
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,800
♫Melt my heart into love♫

1061
