16
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,300
Dad.

17
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,270
Why are you back so late?

18
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,430
You're still working out at this hour?

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,260
I'm practicing.

20
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,660
If I don't know how to play golf,

21
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,900
when Zelin plays it with me,

22
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,030
I'll embarrass you.

23
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,480
Did you go on a date with Zelin?

24
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,510
No. I was working overtime.

25
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,360
The job is important,

26
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,340
but you also have to consider

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,440
Zelin's feelings.

28
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,630
He went back to Beijing.

29
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,710
He went back to Beijing?

30
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,860
Before he left,

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,290
did he mention marriage to you?

32
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,020
Dad, it's not urgent.

33
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,430
Why not?

34
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,780
How old are you?

35
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,010
Two years ago,

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,260
when you were young,

37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,740
you could be proud, right?

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,660
You could bear it.

39
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,980
Now it's different.

40
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,440
How about this?

41
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,510
You're shy.

42

I'll call Zelin.

43

I'll ask him.

44

Dad.

45
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,180
Don't call him.

46

No.

47
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,430
I'll ask him when he'll be back.

48
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,270
That's a disgrace.

49
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,140
Right.

50
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,350
I won't call him.

51
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,440
That's a disgrace.

52
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,460
By the way,

53
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,460
I just had a discussion

54
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,520
with your Aunt Lan.

55
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,420
We plan to buy you

56
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,680
a house in the suburbs.

57
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,410
When you come back in the future,

58
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,410
you can live in the house

59
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,400
we're going to buy for you.

61
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,180
Dad, let's talk about this later.

62
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,570
I've been busy all day.

63
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,260
I really...

64
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,140
Right. You should take a rest.

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,620
But

66
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,900
check those houses when you have time.

67
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,290
You have to pick one carefully.

68
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,580
Dad, go to bed early.

69
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,020
Pick the one you like.

70
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,110
It's important.

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,820
Ke.

72
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,620
I've heated the milk for you.

73
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,170
Here. Drink it while it's hot.

74
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,840
Thank you.

75
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,600
Let me tell you.

76
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,260
Don't take what your dad said seriously.

77
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,520
Don't feel pressured.

78
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,310
Ke.

79
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,540
Did you quarrel with Zelin?

80
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,280
I saw this package.

81
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,220
Recently,

82
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,000
Zelin hasn't

83
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,890
called us.

84
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,820
He also sent back many packages.

85
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,280
What's wrong with you two?

86
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,420
He asked me to move to Beijing

87
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,420
and live with him.

88
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,350
But I didn't want to go.

89
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,260
Didn't you agree

90
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,660
he would return to Shanghai

91
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,920
after he worked in Beijing for two years?

92
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,860
I don't know

93
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,700
why he and I

94
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,060
became like this.

95
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,680
Ke.

96
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,340
You have to think carefully.

97
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,140
Is it because you don't want to go

98
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,339
or because of the family?

99
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,019
Don't worry about the family.

100
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,290
Your dad has me.

101
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,610
Yibo has grown up.

102
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,170
In fact,

103
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,100
there are many other problems

104
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,430
between me and Li Zelin.

105
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,900
Forget it.

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,390
Let it go.

107
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,130
Aunt Lan,

108
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,790
I broke up with Li Zelin.

109
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,360
Will you support my choice?

110
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,870
As long as you are happy,

111
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,460
I'll stand by your side.

112
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,630
My daughter doesn't have to worry about marriage.

113
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,760
Why do you have to leave Shanghai

114
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,930
and live in Beijing?

115
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,590
Ke.

116
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,900
Your father and I

117
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,420
just want you three

118
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,550
to be safe and sound.

119
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,820
We hope Yibo

120
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,110
can finish his studies.

121
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,180
We hope you can have a good marriage.

122
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,050
In a few years, Guangxi

123
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
can also get married.

124
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,270
We'll be relieved then.

125
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,500
Aunt Lan.

126
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,700
What kind of girl

127
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,670
do you want Guangxi to marry?

128
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,250
Guangxi.

129
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,550
I don't have many criteria.

130
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,750
I just hope they are of the same age

131
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,110
and are happy with each other.

132
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,900
It would be better

133
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,070
to let me have a grandson.

134
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,500
What's wrong with you?

135
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,280
We're talking about you.

136
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
Why did you mention Guangxi?

137
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,200
Yike.

138
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,409
If you believe me,

139
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,409
from now on,

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,300
I'll look for another man for you.

141
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,220
I have many

142
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,980
square-dancing friends.

143
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,720
I'll let them help me

144
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,850
and train the men they know.

145
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,070
We must find someone

146
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,159
who is better than your ex-boyfriend

147
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,530
in terms of income, character

148
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,610
and educational background.

149
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,890
I just broke up.

150
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,340
You want me to marry someone

151
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,180
so soon.

152
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,700
Is it because I'm the third wheel

153
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,780
in this home?

154
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

155
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,890
I'm loath to let you

156
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,050
get married.

157
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,180
I hope you can stay longer in the home.

158
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,010
I want to

159
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,610
cook meals for you every day.

160
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,720
It's been so many years.

161
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,140
Thank you.

162
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,340
Don't mention it. We're family.

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,340
All right.

164
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,610
I'm leaving.

165
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,150
Aunt Lan,

166
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,260
don't tell dad

167
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,990
the things about Li Zelin.

168
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,460
Don't worry.

169
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,980
But...

170
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,190
Ke.

171
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,960
I have to tell you

172
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,040
you must think it through.
