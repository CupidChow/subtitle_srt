00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,140
Aunt Lan,

17
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,479
we're waiting for you.

18
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,400
Coming.

19
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,759
Coming.

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,460
Try it.

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,979
Ke ordered this soup

22
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,310
specifically by herself.

23
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:52,850
I went to the market

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,180
and picked

25
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,500
a nice fork leg.

26
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,580
I stewed it with soy beans for the whole afternoon.

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,330
There must be plenty of collagen in it.

28
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,300
-Help yourself.
-Thank you, Anut Lan.

30
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,870
When did my sister

31
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,800
need collagen?

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,760
Well...

33
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,850
Aunt Lan. Dad.

34
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,890
My company

35
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,030
will go on an outing this week.

36
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,950
I'll go to a camping base

37
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,140
and spend two days and one night there.

38
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,610
I'll be back on Sunday.

39
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,060
What kind of company

40
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,870
would have an outing on weekend,

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,260
even overnight?

42
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,780
We agreed to buy clothes

43
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,310
with Aunt Lan this weekend.

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,579
Can you take a leave?

45
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,500
Yeah.

46
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,090
Sister, you don't look like someone

47
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,800
who would accept this kind of pick-up artist

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,650
on employees.

49
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,579
You're right.

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,900
What's wrong with you?

51
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,460
Do it yourself.

52
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,810
Whenever our daughter talks about hanging out,

53
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,260
you're like stepping on landmines.

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,329
She's tired from work.

55
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,650
It's a rare opportunity for her to take a break.

56
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,140
Look.

57

There are dark circles under Yike's eyes.

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,520

Yes, dad.

Sister, show me some respect please.

61
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,980
Why do you need respect?

62
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,530
Give it to your sister.

63
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,190
Okay.

64
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,020
I'll give the bigger piece to my sister like Kong Rong.

65
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,270
It's good for your health.

66
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,950
This...

67
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,810
Are you really going to spend the night outside?

68
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,130
There must be men and women

69
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,570
in your company, right?

70
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,060
We are all female colleagues.

71
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,420
Well,

72
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,740
the only male colleague is on leave.

73
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,210
See?

74
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,780
You can also take a leave.

75
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,220
You stubborn old man,

76
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,990

77
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,730
Okay, fine.

78

81
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,780
Have a drink with me.

82
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,510
Come on.

83
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,740
Dad, my sister is an adult.

84
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,420
Stop nagging.

85
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,390
Come on.

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,560
Fill the cup up for my girl.

87
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,820
Girls shouldn't drink too much.

88
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,150
Here.

89
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,430
Have more soup.

90
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,240
There you go.

91
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,900
You too. Have some more.

Don't you want some respect?

94
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,150
I have a daughter at home, I have everything in the world.

Here you go.

97
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,690
Take it slow.

98
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,550
Dad, take it slow.

99
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,060
What about having a boy at home, dad?

100
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,980
Hurry up

101
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,300
and pass your postgraduate entrance exam.

102
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,560

105
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,650
Remember.

106
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,280
Come back early on Sunday.

107
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,530
Sister,

108
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,210
I put the milk on the table.

109
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,530
Okay.

110
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,910
Is this the lace?

111
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
When did my sister change her style?

112
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:30,940
No.

113
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,580
Isn't she going on an outing?

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,760
Hello, Xia Xiaomian.

115
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,870
I want to ask you something.

116
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,180
Are you going on an outing this weekend?

117
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,520
Outing?

118
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,020
What outing?

119
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,420
I'm too busy

120
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,750
to have time

121
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,180
to memorize the product instructions.

122
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,970
I don't have time for an outing.

123
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,510
Then whom is my sister going to meet?

124
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,790
An important client?

125
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,020
A client?

126
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,850
I don't think so.

127
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,940
She specifically said

128
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,070
she won't work overtime this weekend.

129
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,300
It's weird.

130
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,180
What happened?

131
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,180
No.

132
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,750
Nothing.

133
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,350
Enjoy your live stream.

134
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm gonna hang up.

135
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,140
I'm too full for dinner.

136
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,070
Let's play basketball together.

137
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,140
Listen.

138
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,860
I have to go home early today.

139
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,120
I have something to do.

140
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,040
Wait.

141
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,690
You're a little weird.

142
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,140
Are you going to confess to me?

143
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,170
Are you insane, Xu Guangxi?

144
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,580
If you don't confess, I'm leaving.

145
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,540
Have a seat.

146
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,170
I have something to tell you.

147
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,110
Do you think

148
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,640
my sister is a little strange recently?

149
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,240
No way.

150
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,460
Did he find out?

151
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,570
Xu Guangxi.

152
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,300
Are you listening to me?

153
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,770
No, I don't think so.

154
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,480
We meet everyday at work.

155
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,380
Sometimes we even

156
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,240
go back home together for dinner.

157
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,180
Isn't everything good?

158
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,450
You're so insensitive.

159
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,180
What I mean is

160
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,400
it seems my sister is having an affair.

161
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,550
No, that's impossible.

162
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,820
How could someone

163
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,940
like Yin Yike cheat?

164
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,220
Why are you panicking?

165
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,060
My sister is not in a relationship with you.

166
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,190
Why are you nervous?

167
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,030
I...

168
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,540
Am I panicking?

169
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,610
I was just wondering

170
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,659
if you have too much time.

171
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,490
Where did you get

172
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,750
these weird thoughts?

173
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,690
No.

174
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,230
Listen.

175
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,420
My sister has been acting strange lately.

176
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,740
She stays in the dressing room

177
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,070
for one hour every night.

178
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,670
She even uses two masks.

179
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,340
She goes out every morning

180
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,220
with her eyebrows in a nice shape.

181
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,400
She shapes them so carefully

182
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,450
that you can clearly see them separately.

183
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,050
Do you think she's cheating?

184
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,420
Someone like Yin Yike

185
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,350
wouldn't cheat.

186
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,730
How can you be so sure?

187
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,770
I saw your sister

188
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,700
quarreling with Li Zelin

189
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,760
outside the building of her company.

190
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,340
They quarreled?

191
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,159
No wonder.

192
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,780
I asked her about her relationship with my brother-in-law.

193
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,060
She didn't answer me

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,190
directly either.

195
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,659
They're not married.

196
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,140
Why are you calling him your brother-in-law?

197
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,220
Xu Guangxi,

198
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,770
it's not the point.

199
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,190
Well,

200
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,780
what's the point?

201
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,500
What's wrong

202
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,880
with a girl

203
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,670
who suddenly wants to dress up?

204
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,159
I'm telling you. I have evidence.

205
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,130
Evidence?

206
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,460
My sister told me

207
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,060
she's going on an outing with her colleagues this weekend.

208
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,420
I asked Xia Xiaomian.

209
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
Xia Xiaomian said

210
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,460
there's no such thing at all.

211
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,120
And you know what the point is?

212
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,380
Before I went out tonight,

213
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,120
I found my sister

214
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,850
packing up her sexy pajamas.

215
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,970
Hey, are you okay?

216
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,410
Are you okay?

217
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,930
Why are you blushing?

218
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm fine. It's too hot.

219
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:16,970
I'm sweating.

220
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,840
Seriously.

221
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,990
I'm telling you

222
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,390
something important.

223
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,020
Tell me.

224
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,610
What should I do?

225
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,780
Yibo,

226
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,990
if your sister

227
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,419
makes an unexpected decision,

228
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,350
will you object?

229
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,860
Of course not.

230
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,830
I will always

231
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,580
be on my sister's side

232
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
and support her unconditionally.

233
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,780
What if she breaks up?

234
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,710
If she breaks up,

235
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:41,460
it must be

236
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
Li Zelin's fault.

237
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,299
That's it.

238
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,880
But

239
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,780
if they really break up,

240
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,920
I have to keep an eye out

241
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,490
for her admirers.

242
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
I'm afraid they'll lie to my sister.

243
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,630
What are you going to do?

244
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,980
I've decided.

245
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,540
I'll sacrifice my weekend for a break

246
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,700
to go camping with my sister together.

247
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,430
I need to see

248
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,580
what kind of person he is.

249
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,550
No.

250
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,700
You can't go.

251
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,380
Why?

252
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,140
Think about it.

253
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,500
Your sister is trying so hard

254
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,820
to hide it from everyone around her

255
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,810
including you.

256
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,690
She must have some reasons

257
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,140
to hide it from her family.

258
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,770
That makes sense.

259
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,800
She must have her reasons

260
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,780
to hide it from her family.

261
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,990
If my dad knows

262
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,140
she broke up with Li Zelin,

263
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,370
our family will be in chaos.

264
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,410
Right?

265
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,420
At this point of time,

266
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,130
as her brother,

267
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,540
instead of covering for her at home,

268
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,210
isn't it inappropriate for you

269
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,800
to be a third-wheel?

270
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,380
You're right.

271
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,510
I shouldn't do that.

272
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,700
Anyway,

273
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,430
if that man

274
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,440
sees me,

275
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,120
he must feel a bit inferior, right?

276
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,420
Yes, he must be very inferior.

277
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,030
So I think

278
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,180
why don't you help your sister

279
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,690
cover it up?

280
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,530
You're right.

281
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,700
All these years,

282
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,630
I've been worried about my sister.

283
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,630
I'd better

284
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,860
protect her secretly

285
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,300
and protect

286
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,680
these weak sparks.

287
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,460
Yibo,

288
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,380
I really think

289
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,750
you're a great brother.

290
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
Really, Guangxi?

291
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,210
I also think you're very considerate.

292
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,300
So are you going to

293
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,500
cover it up with me?

294
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,960
Well,

295
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,380
it's only suitable for one person

296
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,060
to cover it up.

297
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,060
It'll be too obvious for two people to do this.

298
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,180
I won't get involved.

299
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,980
You're right.

300
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,380
I should go back now

301
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,860
to protect my sister.

302
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,100
The "Protect My Sister" plan

303
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
starts right now.

304
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,950
I can do it!

305
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,630
You can do it!

306
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,560
I can do it!

307
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,510
What can this piece cover?

308
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,450
Forget it.

309
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,380
Just wear this.

310
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,190
How's everything going?

311
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,300
I'm done. See you tomorrow.

312
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,100
Baba.

313
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,570
Dad Chen.

314
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,180
We're here.

315
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,980
We're coming!

316
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,360
Coming.

317
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,060
Come over.

318
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Put it here.

319
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:35,750
This coach.

320
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,260
Take a look.

321
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,310
I spent a lot

322
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,100
on this rented luxury coach for you.

323
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,150
A two-day trip.

324
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,260
Are you happy about it?

325
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,210
Yes.

326
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,300
Are you excited?

327
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,470
Yes.

328
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,230
This coach is so cool.

329
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,930
Yeah.

330
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,210
Wait a minute.

331
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,390
Didn't you say you would take girls?

332
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,250
Where are they?

333
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,540
Are they here?

334
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,000
This...

335
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,720
Dad Chen.

336
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,580
We can't take girls

337
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,790
with us easily.

338
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,220
Right?

339
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,980
Yeah.

340
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,270
Look over there.

341
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,170
Those singles also on their own.

342
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,970
Morning.

343
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,380
Baba.

344
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,040
Just the two of you?

345
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,320
You should have told me earlier.

346
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,450
I spent so much money

347
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,380
on renting such a big coach

348
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,540
because you had told me

349
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,370
you would take girls with you.

350
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,340
Otherwise,I wouldn't have rented such a big coach

351
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,740
if it's just for you guys.

352
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,220
I'll deduct the cost from your salary.

353
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,860
Don't.

354
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,230
It's not a waste, Baba.

355
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,220
This coach is useful.

356
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,940
What if we can

357
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,990
bring back some girls?

358
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,670
I asked the fortune teller

359
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,810
before I went out this morning.

360
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,010
I'm lucky in romance.

361
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,710
You're too confident.

362
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,680
Well, Baba.

363
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,980
Actually,

364
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,940
I'm taking someone with me.

365
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,300
I knew you're the best.

366
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:36,980
Who is it?

367
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,940
Guangxi. Who is it?

368
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,390
Sorry, I'm late.

369
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,140
His sister!

370
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,540
Xu Guangxi, you broke the rules.

371
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,620
We agreed to bring a girl.

372
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,550
Why did you bring your sister here?

373
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,590
I don't have

374
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,650
many female friends.

375
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,410
So...

376
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,140
Really?

377
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,060
Guangxi said

378
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,820
every one of you

379
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,980
would take your girlfriend with you,

380
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,710
so I came here

381
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,750
to help him.

382
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,920
Where are your girlfriends?

383
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,850
Hello, mom.

384
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,820
I take the key with me.

385
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,750
Don't worry.

386
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,780
I've prepared everything.

387
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,830
Fortunately,

388
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,700
I've also invited another girl friend of mine.

389
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,540
Otherwise,

390
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,100
there would be too many men.

391
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,710
Who is it?

392
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,590
Who is it, Yike?

393
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,310
Is the wine bad,

394
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,600
or is the clubbing bad?

395
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,980
Why would I agree to go camping with you

396
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,190
in the early morning?

397
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,170
I'm really...

398
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,950
Perfume Queen.

399
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,970
What do you mean?

400
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,420
You don't welcome me?

401
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,040
Welcome to join us!

402
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,950
Welcome to join us!

403
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,590
All right.

404
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,060
It's okay.

405
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,660
It's okay.

406
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,500
As the saying goes,

407
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:50,900
well,

408
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,370
since you're here...

409
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,270
Let's go.

410
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,580
I bought the one-day ticket.

411
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,280
The morning is almost over.

412
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,340
Hurry up. Let's go.

413
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,310
Get on the coach.

414
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,300
Don't waste money.

415
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,460
Take your belongings.

416
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,380
It's been a long time since I went hunting.

417
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,050
Guys,

418
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,330
let's indulge ourselves.

419
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,300
Sunshine!

420
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Forest!

421
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,430
Beer!

422
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,590
Girls!

423
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,950
We're coming!

424
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,380
Get off and get your luggage.

425
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,780
I haven't worked out for half a year.

426
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,710
I'm so tired.

427
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,500
I shouldn't have given up

428
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,870
the part-time job.

429
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,540
I'll earn a few hundred less.

430
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,150
What a tragedy.

431
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,660
I'm really a bad cheese, aren't I?

432
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,510
I see you three

433
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,870
everyday in the office.

434
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,940
Now that we're here, it's still you three.

435
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,420
There's not even a girl.

436
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,420
Boring.

437
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,870
No.

438
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,570
When something is zero,

439
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,300
it has endless possibilities.

440
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,910
I think we are much better

441
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,500
than Xu Guangxi and Dad Chen.

442
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,540
One takes his sister,

443
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,300
the other takes a Manta

444
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,600
that can explode anytime.

445
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
At least they're girls.

446
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,130
It's better to go alone than take one's sister.

447
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,960
Let's go.

448
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,100
Guangxi.

449
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,740
Look, the view is beautiful here.

450
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,750
Yes.

451
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,120
Chen Musen now must think

452
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm boring.

453
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,650
He didn't expect

454
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,380
that you're actually very happy now, aren't you?

455
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,150
Of course.

456
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,150
Super happy.

457
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,220
I guess Dad Chen

458
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,220
is also happy now.

459
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,950
Yin Yike,

460
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:16,950
tell me.

461
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,310
Did you do it on purpose?

462
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,740
Why did you get involved in this kind of trouble?

463
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,020
How am I supposed to assign?

464
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,780
We two can't

465
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,970
group together.

466
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,340
Ms. Qin.

467
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,540
I know you're very unhappy.

468
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,220
Will you please

469
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,050
live with it for now?

470
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,860
For the sake of me

471
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,970
trying so hard to row the boat.

472
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,620
Listen.

473
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,840
Stop bragging.

474
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,620
I'm an independent woman.

475
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,460
I never rely on men.

476
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,510
Ms. Qin, you're so strong.

477
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,980
Their characteristics

478
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
are too obvious.

479
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,090
Let me tell you.

480
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,700
Qin Yiran rides a motorcycle.

481
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,260
What do you think?

482
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,100
Let's give it a go.

483
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,360
We could possibly win.

484
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:56,860
Come on.

485
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,340
Come on.

486
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,210
Go for it.

487
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,980
Come on.

488
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,020
I can't row anymore.

489
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,500
Go ahead.

490
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,780
Your boat is spinning.

491
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,640
I'm exhausted.

492
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,290
Have we come too early?

493
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,810
Girls often

494
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,890
take beauty sleep.

495
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,380
What kind of logic is yours?

496
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,230
There are no girls here.

497
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,780
Guys, don't be so sad,

498
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,430
okay?

499
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,860
Always keep

500
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,220
a cheerful

501
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,300
sportsman image.

502
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,710
Maybe girls

503
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,000
will appear in a while.

504
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,430
Mom, I want to go home.

505
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,900
Let's take a photo here.

506
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,340
Here.

507
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,710
This bridge looks good.

508
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,810
Huiben.

509
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,500
Huiben.

510
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,070
Look.

511
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,580
Girls.

512
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,840
Look.

513
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,050
Girls.

514
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:46,940
Hey girls.

515
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,460
Are you hanging out together?

516
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,840
Do you need labor?

517
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,320
Come on! Come on!

518
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,300
Go!

519
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,620
Hurry up.

520
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,820
We're waiting for you here.

521
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,190
Bye.

522
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,020
See you later.

523
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Be careful.

524
00:16:59,210 --> 00:16:59,780
Be careful.

525
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,580
Let me help you.

526
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,340
No, thank you.

527
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,020
Are you tired?

528
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,940
I'm fine.

529
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,660
It's quite fun.

530
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,490
Do you want some water?

531
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,099
Go away.

532
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,380
Let me open it for you.

533
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,540
Thank you.

534
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,790
Guys,

535
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,220
although my sunglasses are black,

536
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,050
they are transparent.

537
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,839
I can see it clearly, okay?

538
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,440
So what?

539
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,790
Your joke is so cold.

540
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,670
Here, have some warm water.

541
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,920
Do you think I'm cold now?

542
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,300
I think it's quite cold.

543
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,630
Listen, Chen Ye.

544
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,369
I'll take it today

545
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,300
since we're sharing the same boat.

546
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,140
Stay away from me.

547
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,770
Don't cross this line.

548
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,570
Do you hear me?

549
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,820
The 38th Parallel.

550
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,680
How old are you?

551
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,530
Did you reveal your age?

552
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,580
What era are you from?

553
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,640
Shut up and no talk.

554
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,500
No talk?

555
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,420
How many sun icons do you have

556
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,650
for your QQ Yellow Diamond Membership?

557
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,510
What do you mean?

558
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,660
What do you mean?

559
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,330
I need some water to warm myself up.

560
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,500
Here comes the food.

561
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,230
Take some more.

562
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,770
Beer. Beer.

563
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,790
Beer.

564
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,260
I'm jealous of young people.

565
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,820
No matter what you do,

566
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,020
you are so energetic.

567
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,780
Don't make others proud

568
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,180
and sell yourself short.

569
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,120
What's there to envy about being young?

570
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,570
They have pimples

571
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,570
and oily skin.

572
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,700
You can't even find my pores

573
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,820
after I finish

574
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,900
my non-invasive facial laser procedure.

575
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,810
But there's always something

576
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,010
that can't be hidden.

577
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,540
What?

578
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,150
Take a guess.

579
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,220
The wrinkles?

580
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,620
You'll lose

581
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,120
that innocence

582
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,470
after you've gained some experience.

583
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,690
That cute boy is coming.

584
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,020
That cute boy is coming.

585
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,780
Hey.

586
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,440
Is there anything

587
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,070
we can help you with?

588
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,750
Right.

589
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,820
That's right.

590
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,380
Just tell us.

591
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,840
Do you need help?

592
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,700
That's enough. Stop being emotional here.

593
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,280
Go and save

594
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,690
your loyal puppy.

595
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,810
I'm not going.

596
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,780
What is this for?

597
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,900
Are you tired?

598
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,140
Can you help us carry this?

599
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,230
OK.

600
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,220
Huiben, come and help.

601
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,990
Let me do it.

602
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,460
Take a break. We'll do it.

603
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,710
Let's go have some fun together.

604
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,580
It's good for you to hang out with young people.

605
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,190
Go ahead.

606
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,600
You're still young.

607
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,940
Go.

608
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,010
Let's go.

609
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,590
I won't

610
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,900
go along for the ride.

611
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,690
Here, have some of this.

612
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,130
Let me help you with the barbecue.

613
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,820
We're going over there for the barbecue.

614
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,060
Thank you.

615
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,580
You're welcome.

616
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,830
You're back.

617
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,670
Do you want coke?

618
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,140
Yes.

619
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,770
Thank you.

620
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,100
Hey man,

621
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,890
is this lady

622
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
your girlfriend?

623
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,930
How is that possible?

624
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,170
They're siblings.

625
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,460
No wonder.

626
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,370
Only good-looking people

627
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,370
are a family.

628
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,220
Miss.

629
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,180
How old are you?

630
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,660
It's rude to ask about a girl's age

631
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,900
when you meet her for the first time.

632
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,460
It's okay.

633
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,700
It's better for them to ask directly

634
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,100
rather than to be "YYGQ".

635
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:53,980
Miss.

636
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,300
What did you just say?

637
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,740
What's "YY"?

638
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,650
What does it mean?

639
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,520
Don't you know?

640
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,870
We never heard of it.

641
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,820
I might have learned

642
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,460
too much

643
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,590
about young people.

644
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,950
It just means being sarcastic.

645
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,020
How did you know?

646
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,480
I searched online.

647
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,940
You'll find it in a second.

648
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,780
Miss,

649
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,220
you haven't told us

650
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,180
your age.

651
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,510
I'll turn to 35 in three years.

652
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,740
Almost 35?

653
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,170
You don't look your age at all.

654
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,170
How do you take care of yourself?

655
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:24,900
Yeah.

656
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,340
Your skin is so good.

657
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,660
What skincare products are you using?

658
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,570
I have pimples.

659
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,310
Your skin is so good.

660
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,420
It's bright and tender.

661
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,460
Here, the barbecue is ready.

662
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,620
Here, try it.

663
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,920
The barbecue is ready.

664
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,020
I told you that you are young.

665
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,340
You are young.

666
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,940
You're welcome.

667
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,230
You're welcome.

668
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,690
Here.

669
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,860
Grilled chicken wings.

670
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,710
Try it.

671
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,070
Is it salty? Is it spicy?

672
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,700
Eating more chili can make you younger.

673
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,160
Why?

674
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,340
It's rare to come to the wild.

675
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:00,980
Why are you

676
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,010
sitting and sleeping here alone?

677
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,220
None of your business.

678
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,210
I just want to be alone

679
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,300
for a while, can't I？

680
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,160
I just think

681
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,060
you're too quiet.

682
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,890
You know?

683
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,380
Look how lively there is.

684
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,860
I'm gonna get you some work.

685
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,520
Here, put them on the skewers.

686
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,880
Me?

687
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,490
Didn't you say you don't rely on men?

688
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:16,820
If these skewers

689
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,300
are all done

690
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,180
by men,

691
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,820
will you eat or not?

692
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,360
Fine, I'll do it.

693
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,290
I'll do it.

694
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,650
I don't want to listen to your nagging.

695
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,860
You know what?

696
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,330
Sister and brother are a good match.

697
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,870
Do you know about their relationship?

698
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,100
Do you think I'm blind?

699
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,680
Listen,

700
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,140
Yike has her own difficulties.

701
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,220
Don't gossip

702
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,910
or let the whole company know.

703
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,420
I'm can keep secrets.

704
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,390
Don't worry.

705
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,940
From now on,

706
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,430
this is our common secret.

707
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:04,820
Here.

708
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,760
Give me five.

709
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,160
Can you reach it here?

710
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,790
Thank you.

711
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,490
What do you want to eat?

712
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,350
-Let me get it for you.
- It's okay.

713
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,420
Miss.

714
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,000
I heard that both of you are working for a big company.

715
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,400
You are also the manager.

716
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,060
I really envy you.

717
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,260
I still can't find a job.

718
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,420
I don't even know

719
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
whether I can pass the postgraduate entrance exam.

720
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,400
Don't be afraid even if you can't.

721
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,570
Even students who graduated from universities of Project 985 or Project 211

722
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,360
can't find a job.

723
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,490
People who graduated from Tsinghua University or Peking University work overtime as well.

724
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,340
We all get suppressed

725
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,360
at work.

726
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,510
But take my advice.

727
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,540
Study may not

728
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,860
lead you to a good job,

729
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,940
but you can never find a good job

730
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,260
if you don't study.

731
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,690
So you still have to study hard.

732
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,960
That's good enough.

733
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,140
After graduation,

734
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,060
I worked part-time while looking for a job.

735
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,740
Now, I'm no longer

736
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,000
a graduating student.

737
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,300
Look at me.

738
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,850
I've changed four jobs.

739
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,690
I can't wait to resign now.

740
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,980
I'm asked to make tea everyday

741
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,310
in the current company.

742
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,410
Ladies,

743
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,790
I finally made it

744
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,710
to get into this company.

745
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,540
I'm not here to make tea for them.

746
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,780
Besides, I'm not their secretary.

747
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,860
They won't let me attend

748
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,180
important meetings either.

749
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,810
I've experienced

750
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,540
all the things you said before.

751
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,370
Really?

752
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,730
I just thought

753
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,460
no matter what

754
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,130
you ask me to do,

755
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,170
I have to do it better.

756
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,420
Even if it's making tea,

757
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,580
I'll make it different from others'.

758
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,460
They'll acknowledge

759
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,790
my capability someday.

760
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,590
Got it.

761
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,300
My mom said

762
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,730
if I fail the postgraduate entrance exam,

763
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,210
she'll arrange a blind date for me

764
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,610
and ask me to get married.

765
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,130
Do you still want to get married now?

766
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,390
Of course not.

767
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,640
You have to work hard

768
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,060
if you don't want to.

769
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,590
Miss,

770
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,410
however, we may not get to where you are

771
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,940
when we are at your age.

772
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,460
We'll be old by then.

773
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,300
It'll also be hard to get married.

774
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,940
You think

775
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,180
our work is going well.

776
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,020
Actually to me,

777
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,980
I always think

778
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,780
I'm a failure.

779
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,980
How come you feel like a failure?

780
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,270
It's just pressure

781
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,660
from work and life,

782
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,480
but I never thought about

783
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,380
getting married

784
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,780
can reduce the pressure.

785
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,800
I think

786
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,430
the biggest failure in life

787
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,780
is not about

788
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,220
whether you've become a manager or not,

789
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,100
but you're living a life

790
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,090
you don't want.

791
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,060
Well said.

792
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,500
You must

793
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,860
understand this anti motivational quote.

794
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,340
Dad Chen, you have a good taste.

795
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,510
Getting married and having children...

796
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,100
You too.

797
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,260
Is not necessarily bad.

798
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,590
But it's definitely not

799
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,080
a safe shelter.

800
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,740
Right?

801
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,140
It's the same as entering a workplace.

802
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,450
You might fail.

803
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,720
Anyway,

804
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,220
no matter which path you choose,

805
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,130
don't be afraid.

806
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,880
Youth is the capital.

807
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Youth is the capital.

808
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,080
Yeah.

809
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,900
After hearing what you said,

810
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,740
I feel like I've gained the courage.

811
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,520
I'm not afraid anymore.

812
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,040
Right?

813
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,140
This anti motivational quote

814
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,370
is really encouraging.

815
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,120
Mindset.

816
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,310
Mindset is very important, girls.

817
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,710
Come on.

818
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,660
Have some kebabs.

819
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,220
Try it, Baba.

820
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,980
These are the kebabs

821
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,510
cooked with secret recipe.

822
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,470
Great!

823
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,460
Awesome!

824
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,630
Kebabs and alcohol are the best match.

825
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,300
Help yourself.

826
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,120
Fill it up.

827
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,670
Let's

828
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,220
raise our glasses.

829
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,520
Come on.

830
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,880
To youth. To time.

831
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,070
Cheers.

832
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,700
Don't drink too much,

833
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,780
or I'll tell everyone

834
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,380
about your crazy behaviors after drinking.

835
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,110
How dare you!

836
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,860
Drink, young people.

837
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,980
-Come on.
-Cheers.

838
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,300
Anyone wants to give a performance?

839
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,900
Come on.

840
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,340
Come on.

841
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,940
I'll do it.

842
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,750
Come on.

843
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,210
Chen Musen.

844
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,270
Chen Musen.

845
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,180
Chen Musen.

846
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,780
Awesome!

847
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,710
Dad Chen! Dad Chen!

848
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,490
Dad Chen! Dad Chen!

849
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,470
There you go.

You danced well.

865
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,960
Aren't you afraid that others will see this?

866
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,660
The more nervous you are,

867
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,520
the easier you'll be discovered.

868
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,010
Be natural.

869
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,260
I find that

870
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,990
you really enjoy excitements.

871
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,140
You're wrong.

872
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,080
I only enjoy

873
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,460
excitements with you.

874
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,510
There you go.

875
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,930
Have some water.

876
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,750
Tell me.

877
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,970
Are you stupid?

878
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,980
I've done this to you.

879
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,310
You're still not angry?

880
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,860
Have you forgotten

881
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,700
what my job is？

882
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,930
I'm a supplier.

883
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,660
I can't be a supplier

884
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,010
if I don't have a good temper.

885
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,010
Our biggest competitive advantage

886
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,410
is we can tolerate any obstacles by others.

887
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,230
And I was wrong

888
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,000
for what happened between us,

889
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,310
so it's understandable for you to mess with me.

890
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,020
See? You've already done it.

891
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,460
Right?

892
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,170
After drinking this bottle of water,

893
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,660
let's move on

894
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,620
and make up.

895
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,020
You want to make up with me with just a bottle of water?

896
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,780
It's not that easy.

897
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,850
What else do you want?

898
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,700
It depends on

899
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,340
whether you can

900
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,210
make me happy or not.

901
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,470
Of course I can.

902
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,450
It's easy to make you happy.

903
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,510
Ladies and gentlemen,

904
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,780
the next part

905
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,620
is the "Taking Song Requests" session.

906
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,380
It's a song requested

907
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,380
by me, Chen Ye,

908
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,980
to Ms. Qin Yiran.

909
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,940
I wish her a whole happy night.

910
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,760
-Music.
- What's he doing?

911
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,820
He's probably gonna make his ultimate move.

912
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,880
His ultimate move?

913
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,610
He must be drunk.

914
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,120
He can't even stand straight.

915
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,460
They look like

916
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,660
a perfect couple.

917
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,910
Let them have fun.

918
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,300
Come with me to a place.

919
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,220
Let's go.

920
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,840
Here we are.

921
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,020
Is this the motorhome you rented secretly?

922
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,350
Do you like it,

923
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,660
or is it a bit old-fashioned?

924
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:49,960
I like it.

925
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,380
Let's get inside and take a look.

926
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,180
You've brought my suitcase here?

927
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,670
Have a seat.

928
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,220
Are you thirsty?

929
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,580
Have some water.

930
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,700
Thank you.

931
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,350
I'm a little hot.

932
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:47,900
So...

933
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,280
Yes, it's a little hot.

934
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,350
What should we do now?

935
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,300
Shall we watch TV first?

936
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:27,960
Okay.

937
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,430
We're going to spend the night

938
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,090
sitting here and watching TV?

939
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,920
You could take a shower first.

940
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,620
I mean

941
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,060
you've sweated a lot today.

942
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,520
It must be uncomfortable.

943
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,130
Here's the bathroom.

944
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,080
Let me help you.

945
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,950
I'm done.

946
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,940
The bed is ready.

947
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,080
It's your turn.

948
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:15,350
I'm gonna get in and take a shower.

949
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,870
Guangxi.

950
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,370
Guangxi.

951
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,810
You look like a zombie.

952
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,520
What are you doing?

953
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,020
I'm doing some abs workout.

954
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,700
I'm doing some workouts.

955
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,720
Guangxi.

956
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,060
Guangxi.

957
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,320
Xu Guangxi.

958
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,460
Who is it? It's late at night.

959
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,460
You're annoying!

960
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,330
Get back in!

961
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,610
Come here!

962
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,820
Get back in!

963
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,480
You...

964
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,230
Honey.

965
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,900
No, no, no.

966
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,650
No, no.

967
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,280
Psycho.

968
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,970
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

969
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:23,780
She bullied me.

970
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,980
She didn't bully you.

971
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,730
What kind of woman is she?

972
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,550
How come she even has a husband?

973
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,280
Don't say that.

974
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,090
Why?

975
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,700
Why did she leave with another man

976
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,490
after drinking my alcohol?

977
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,200
Who?

978
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,110
Who did this?

979
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,790
Just one of those girls,

980
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,830
Yuanyuan.

981
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,370
Stop it.

982
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,430
She could still be here.

983
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,720
Let's talk in the room.

984
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,190
I won't die.

985
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,850
Come on.

986
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,580
Drink with me.

987
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,250
You didn't have enough?

988
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,940
Well...

989
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:00,860
Come on.

990
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,580
Cheers, bro.

991
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,070
Cheers!

992
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,270
Friends go together forever.

993
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,150
We'll be single together.

994
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,660
Don't curse me.

995
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,550
Who wants to be

996
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,680
single with you?

997
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,470
Thank you for your kind words.

998
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,170
After I wake up tomorrow,

999
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,510
I'll find a girlfriend.

1000
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,040
Take a sip.

1001
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,370
She always left her phone number,

1002
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,210
but never let me take her home.

1003
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,780
You...

1004
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,300
Why do you always

1005
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,310
sing such an old song?

1006
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,570
Can you sing something

1007
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,360
more trendy?

1008
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,540
You don't understand.

1009
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,090
This is nostalgia for the classics.

1010
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,620
Okay.

1011
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,270
It's nostalgia for the classics.

1012
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,390
The classics, right?

1013
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,180
A toast to you.

1014
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,600
To the classics.

1015
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,500
Cheers!

1016
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,490
Qin Yiran.

1017
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,370
You're home.

1018
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,100
I...

1019
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,990
I'm gonna go.

1020
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,700
Chen Ye.

1021
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,480
Do you like me?

1022
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,940
Why are you talking so loudly?

1023
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,700
Do you?

1024
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:33,890
Yes.

1025
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,520
Listen.

1026
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,780
I'm a

1027
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,590
shaky boat.

1028
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,410
It may run aground anytime.

1029
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,650
Are you sure you want to get on board?

1030
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:55,730
It's okay.

1031
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,650
I'm a man

1032
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,020
who's determined to be the King of Sailing.

1033
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,940
I'll give you a chance.

1034
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,500
I won't guarantee the time.

1035
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,660
Stop.

1036
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,540
Stop. Stop.

1037
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,980
[Yu]

1038
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,710
Damn it.

1039
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:38,530
What happened?

1040
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,300
Damn it.

1041
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,470
Damn it.

1042
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,160
Damn it.

1043
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,910
I have to go now.

1044
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,070
I'm gonna go.

1045
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,610
I have something urgent.

1046
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,140
Well,

1047
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:45,970
I'll make it up to you next time.

1048
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,630
I'm really sorry.

1049
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,140
I'm sorry.

1050
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,660

Sorry.

1052
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,310
I'm getting off now.

1060
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,580
Ms. Qin.

1061
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,420
Can I sit here?

1062
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,120
Suit yourself.

1063
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,090
Just don't disturb my sleep.

1064
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,260
Did you drink?

1065
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,350
You're reeking of alcohol.

1066
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,430
No.

1067
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,420
I don't even mind

1068
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,790
your smell of an old man.

1069
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,340
Don't talk to me.

1070
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,280
Are you crazy?

1071
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,350
Give it to me.

1072
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,220
Why does your company have

1073
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,230
such a product?

1074
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,260
Chen Ye, are you crazy?

1075
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,770
