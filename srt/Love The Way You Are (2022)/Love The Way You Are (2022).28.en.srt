It's all an illusion.

Now I realize

119
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,940
he's only obedient and sensible

120
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,150
when he's asleep,

121
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,780
other time he's as energetic

122
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780

123
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,890
I can't take it anymore

124

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,470

After all, this is life.

No way.

132
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,060
After I've experienced this,

133
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,020

134

Isn't it a good match?

Mom, I'm hungry.

147

It's time to get off work.

148
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,120
I have to go home and cook for my child.

149
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,330
They are a perfect match.

150

One doesn't want to get married or have kids,

Right away.

156
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,740
Wait a moment.

157
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,770
Mom, I'm hungry. Hurry up.

158
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,420
Hurry up.

159
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,340
It's coming.

160
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,770
Hurry up.

161
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,590
There you go.

162
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,020
Mom, you only eat vegetables.

163
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,420
You must be a fairy.

164

Meat...

167
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,740
Hold on.

168
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,080
I'll be right back.

169
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,340
Mom, hurry up.

170
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,820
I'm hungry.

171
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,820
Cut some meat.

172
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,500
Cut some meat.

173
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,460
Mom, are you okay?

174
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,110
I'm fine, Yu.

175

It's no big deal.

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:47,810
Don't panic.

177
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,820
Chen, please come over and save the child.

178
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,240
Also please save mom.

179
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,540
Chen comes here to help!

180
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,360
Come on in.

181
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,460
Come in.

182
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,870
Chen comes here to help!

183
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,070
Well...

184
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,350
I'll cook for Yu in your kitchen.

185
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,410
Mom, I'll treat you today.

186
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,390
Thank you.

187
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,820
Go have fun.

188
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,140
Well,

189
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,150
I only have one knife.

190
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,060
It's okay.

191
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,380
I brought a few.

192
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,460
I also bought some ingredients

193
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,900
and condiments. I...

194
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,590
I bought them all.

195
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,820
Then my apron...

196
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:55,820
What?

197
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,720
Nothing.

198
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,130
Go ahead.

199
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,640
Just wait a moment.

200
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,670
It'll be quick.

201
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:13,890
Okay.

202
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,640
Okay, it's time to eat.

203
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,590
There you go.

204
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,510
Dig in.

205
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,180
What else do you want to eat?

206
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,720
Just tell me. I'll cook for you.

207
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,470
It's okay.

208
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,760
You cooked so much.

209
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,940
Can Yu finish all of them?

210
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,260
You also need to eat.

211
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,590
I used your kitchen

212
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,890
and your room.

213
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,640
I have to do something for you.

214
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,310
Don't worry.

215
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,460
Less oil and salt.

216
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,299
You can eat.

217
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,460
You won't gain weight.

218
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,520
Let me get you some.

219
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,260
You've cooked this much.

220
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,840
Did you graduate from Le Cordon Bleu?

221
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,580
I have to take care of him.

222
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,620
Because he has to take care of me.

223
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,060
Yes.

224
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,920
That's why

225
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,630
I can do everything.

226
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,560
I'll get some soup for you.

227
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,900
You're right.

228
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,560
Since you're so versatile,

229
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,700
you probably don't need

230
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,500
to find a wife.

231
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
What are you talking about?

232
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,530
I want to have a wife for love,

233
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,940
not for work.

234
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,310
Is it salty?

235
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,460
Is it salty?

236
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:10,820
No.

237
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,100
What have you been up to?

238
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,960
You seem tired.

239
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,770
No, I'm good.

240
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,050
I'm in a good place.

241
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,930
When will you

242
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,780
take Yu away?

243
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,340
Yu.

244
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,210
Come here.

245
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,540
Don't trouble her.

246
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,250
Did you hear that?

247
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:26,980
I'm gonna go.

248
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,620
Good luck.

249
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,290
Please.

250
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:29,770
See you.

251
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,410
Well...

252
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,790
You're leaving?

253
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,020
What has he been up to?

254
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,150
He's so mysterious.

255
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,790
Dig in.

256
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,830
Leave him alone.

257
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,740
This is yummy. And that as well.

258
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,420
This is a little spicy.

259
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,720
My dad cooks delicious food.

260
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,640
Delicious.

261
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,830
The soup is good too.

262
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,370
Not bad.

263
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,010
Stir-fried tomatoes and eggs taste better.

264
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,330
It's good.

265
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,230
It's the usage scenario.

266
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,910
Baba.

267
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,560
I can't believe it.

268
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,540
It's so late.

269
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,820
Why are you coming to the office?

270
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,080
None of your business.

271
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,100
This is my office.

272
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,030
I can come

273
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,990
whenever I want.

274
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,750
What are you doing here at this hour?

275
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,310
We want to prove that it's original,

276
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,580
but we need some solid evidence.

277
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,860
So we're analyzing and comparing

278
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,560
every frame.

279
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,140
You're bringing toothbrush, cup,

280
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,740
mouthwash, and toothpaste.

281
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,950
It's a set.

282
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,950
Are you going to spend the night here?

283
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,280
I bought it for you guys.

284
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I saw the lights on

285
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,590
from afar.

286
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,420
I guess it must be

287
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,330
you guys

288
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,130
working overtime voluntarily.

289
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,390
I was right about you guys.

290
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,590
I'm happy about that.

291
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,140
Wash up.

292
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,220
After you're done,

293
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,350
go back to work.

294
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,980
What about you?

295
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,060
I'll definitely stay here

296
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,620
to keep you company, right?

297
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,500
As the boss of this company,

298
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,860
I can't leave you alone

299
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,430
and enjoy myself

300
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,660
at this crucial moment.

301
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,280
Right?

302
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
I must stay here

303
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
to keep you company.

304
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,370
Don't worry.

305
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,550
You don't understand it.

306
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,580
Though I can't understand it,

307
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,340
I can help you do some errands.

308
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,580
Buy some food

309
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,420
and drinks.

310
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,460
We've got food here.

311
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,860
Just some drinks will do.

312
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,750
What about Yu?

313
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,820
Don't worry about Yu.

314
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,460
Yu has...

315
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,510
He's alone at home.

316
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,500
I have to go back and accompany him.

317
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,630
Shall I leave?

318
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,940
Are you leaving,

319
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,930
or not?

320
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,550
I'd better go.

321
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,190
Take care, Baba.

322
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,540
Don't stay up too late.

323
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,500
Don't stay up too late.

324
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:11,860
Bye.

325
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,580
Turn off the lights

326
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,300
when you leave.

327
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,030
Don't worry.

328
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,920
Call me when you leave.

329
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,650
I just want to make sure you're safe.

330
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,480
Take care.

331
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,280
Bye.

332
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,510
Drag the progress bar.

333
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,550
Here's your kid's meal.

334
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,940
Come on.

335
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,180
Have some more.

336
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,510
Eat more to grow taller.

337
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,140
What do you want to eat?

338
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,540
I'll get you some shrimp.

339
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,620
Wipe the sweat off.

340
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,090
Okay.

341
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,330
Thank you.

342
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:58,930
Yu,

343
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,700
tell me the truth.

344
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,810
What has your dad been up to?

345
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,950
When will he take you away?

346
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,150
Mom, can you

347
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,660
sleep with me tonight?

348
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,360
I'm scared.

349
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,370
Fine.

350
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,510
You're naked. You kid.

351
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,330
I found it.

352
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,370
Look.

353
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,090
Look.

354
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,450
This core material

355
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,300
was not in the part

356
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,190
we gave him.

357
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,420
But he actually used this to make a promotional video.

358
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,520
Is there really a mole?

359
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,660
The core plot was...

360
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,420
Scriptie?

361
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,340
Scriptie has dreams.

362
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,780
He's a bit ambitious,

363
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,850
but he doesn't need to...

364
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,900
Could it be Damai?

365
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,020
He's short of money recently.

366
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,070
He's poor but he has dignity.

367
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,960
It can't be him.

368
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,170
Could it be Huiben?

369
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,060
We stay up late for work and eat instant noodles together.

370
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,310
We're like brothers.

371
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,190
How come someone...

372
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,570
Don't think about it.

373
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,660
I... I'll give Dad Chen...

374
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,150
Don't.

375
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,060
It's such a big thing.

376
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,620
Are we going to keep it from Dad Chen?

377
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,790
Dad Chen is busy

378
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,700
pitching for other projects.

379
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,740
Don't put him to any trouble

380
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,400
before we figure it out, okay?

381
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,220
You're right.

382
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,380
It's said Dad Chen

383
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,580
has been working on a presentation

384
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,580
for a big project.

385
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,900
But I haven't seen the big project

386
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,370
or the slides.

387
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,340
No.

388
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,060
No, Guangxi.

389
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,770
When we were working overtime last time,

390
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,420
we saw Dad Chen coming back in the middle of the night.

391
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,820
He was holding a bunch of toiletries.

392
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,380
Right?

393
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,540
I bumped into him for a few times

394
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,470
when I worked overtime in the middle of the night.

395
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,300
I asked him why he came back.

396
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,829
He couldn't give an answer.

397
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,500
Do you think he's living in the office?

398
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,460
If he lives in the office,

399
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,589
what about Yu?

400
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,760
Have you seen Yu?

401
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,359
Well...

402
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,630
Is it possible

403
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,920
that he sold his house?

404
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,869
Do you have his address?

405
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,500
He told us

406
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,740
at our gathering last time.

407
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,599
Let me check.

408
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,550
Is it the one you sent to me?

409
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,210
Yeah, it is.

410
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,190
Boya Home.

411
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,510
Chen Musen.

412
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,260
Is this it?

413
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,540
Isn't this Dad Chen's house?

414
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,520
He sold it?

415
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,640
Who sold the house?

416
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,940
Dad Chen.

417
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,790
That's what happened.

418
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
No wonder Yiran told me

419
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,230
Chen Yu is staying at her place these days.

420
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm telling you.

421
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
If I know who the mole is,

422
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,170
I'll kill him first.

423
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,740
This plagiarism incident

424
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,550
caused by a mole in your company?

425
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,020
There are only a few people

426
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,390
in your company.

427
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,130
We don't know yet.

428
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,940
We're still investigating.

429
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,600
I'll tell you once I figure it out.

430
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,060
Even if we investigate it,

431
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,710
we have to do it at the office.

432
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,610
How can we investigate it

433
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,140
since Dad Chen lives in the office everyday?

434
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,570
We have to find a way to stall him.

435
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,020
Well.

436
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,340
He is so smart.

437
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,900
How can we stall him?

438
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,410
I'm counting on you.

439
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,610
I...

440
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,820
Get the snake out of the cave.

441
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,210
Step one, lure the snake.

442
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,270
Throw out the bait.

443
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,220
I have a plan B for the ending.

444
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,900
I have

445
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,890
a better version here.

446
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,470
Once it's published,

447
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,130
we'll know who's plagiarizing.

448
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,210
You should have told us earlier.

449
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,670
So that means, we're safe.

450
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,630
It's just a false alarm.

451
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,310
Thank you for your hard work.

452
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,270
I'm sorry

453
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,060
for not seeing through Mr. Xie's trick.

454
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,210
Don't say that, Guangxi.

455
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,580
Hurry up and sort out the core materials.

456
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Let's help together.

457
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,010
Yes.

458
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,300
I have some work

459
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,480
to finish up here.

460
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,810
It may take some time.

461
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,940
Go back to your work.

462
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:10,780
OK.

463
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,420
Let's get back to work.

464
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,380
Step two,

465
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,240
let the snake think he's safe,

466
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,100
so he can get out of the cave without being hurt.

467
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,000
Done.

468
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,970
Is it done, Guangxi?

469
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,750
Show us, Guangxi.

470
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,140
I'll save it in the hard drive first.

471
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,780
Dad Chen will have a look at it next Monday.

472
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,810
You've been working hard lately.

473
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,740
Tomorrow is Saturday.

474
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,870
Have a good weekend.

475
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,540
Finally, I don't have to get up early.

476
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,360
We're gonna go. Bye.

477
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,320
Bye.

478
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,950
Thank you, Guangxi.

479
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,410
Step three.

480
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,460
Rule out all possibilities of accidents.

481
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,860
Dad Chen can't come back.

482
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,340
I'm coming.

483
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,220
What's the rush?

484
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,840
I'm busy.

485
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,530
Dad Chen.

486
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,540
It's actually about

487
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,770
this new project.

488
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,770
I have something

489
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,900
to discuss with you.

490
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,740
Are you crazy?

491
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,260
When did I get involved

492
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,260
in any technical issues of a project?

493
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,100
If it's a technical issue.

494
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,780
Ask Guangxi.

495
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,910
Don't waste my time.

496
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,550
What?

497
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,140
Baba.

498
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:39,970
Well...

499
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,660
This new project is special.

500
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,420
As you know,

501
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,990
the comics I usually read,

502
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,890
the mountains and the sea...

503
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,860
Anyway, it's not a technical issue.

504
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,530
It's just

505
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,410
the Three-Character Canon is very important.

506
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,540
I can't teach anything bad to kids.

507
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,140
Am I right?

508
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,020
Yes, your knowledge structure

509
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,220
is a bit complicated.

510
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,340
Let's go.

511
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,690
No, no, no.

512
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,570
Something wrong with you.

513
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,270
That's not like you.

514
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,040
When did you

515
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,540
care so much about work?

516
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,800
It doesn't make sense.

517
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,280
I...

518
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:08,980
All these years,

519
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,300
am I like this

520
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,260
in your heart?

521
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,030
Yes.

522
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,220
Now there's such a big problem

523
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,340
in the company.

524
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,980
I care about the company.

525
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,740
I can give up

526
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,100
on those women.

527
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,940
How could you say that to me?

528
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,110
Fine.

529
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,060
Calm down.

530
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,390
It makes sense.

531
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,160
Well...

532
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,070
Hurry up.

533
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,560
I'm in a hurry. Spit it out.

534
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,180
The final step

535
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,580
is to hunt and get the net.

536
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,660
Close the door and catch the snake.

537
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,740
That's all.

538
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,060
These are

539
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,230
all I've learned

540
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,870
from Yu.

541
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,670
Most importantly,

542
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,460
you have to satisfy his needs

543
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,100
for someone at his age.

544
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,720
One is hero mentality.

545
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,750
The other is

546
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,060
exploring mentality.

547
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,760
And this game...

548
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,110
Repeat it.

549
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,660
What are the three mentalities?

550
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,260
Mental...

551
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,500
Mentality?

552
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,060
Mentality.

553
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,700
You asked me out

554
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,970
and wasted my time.

555
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,060
But you weren't even listening to me.

556
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,260
You were on your phone all night.

557
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,280
What do you want?

558
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:11,940
Well.

559
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,600
I...

560
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,470
I have a girlfriend recently.

561
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,930
If I don't text her back immediately,

562
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,900
she'll get mad at me.

563
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,740
So now I'm used to

564
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,470
checking my phone all the time.

565
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,500
Don't you care about the big picture?

566
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,300
Didn't you say

567
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,940
the company is in danger now?

568
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,380
Don't you prioritize

569
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,980
the company over your relationship?

570
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,380
What do you really think?

571
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,610
Did I say that?

572
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,070
Who are you texting?

573
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,080
I just...

574
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:34,900
Let me see.

575
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,700
Baba, it's personal privacy.

576
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,140
Let me see.

577
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,610
This...

578
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
What are you doing?

579
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,610
Baba, I...

580
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,340
Just wait.

581
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,100
There will be an answer soon, okay?

582
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,830
What answer?

583
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,500
What are you doing?

584
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,420
What did you do behind my back?

585
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:44,880
Tell me.

586
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,830
What answer?

587
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,350
Now.

588
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,410
Ok, fine. I'm telling you.

589
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,460
We compared the plagiarized video

590
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,940
of Mars Animation.

591
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,820
We found there's an original manuscript

592
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,340
that we didn't give out.

593
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,440
So we suspect

594
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,700
there's a mole.

595
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,380
It's easy to think that.

596
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,950
Do you think I don't know?

597
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,490
Do I need your help?

598
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,150
You're making trouble.

599
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,600
Baba!

600
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,480
Baba!

601
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,540
It's you.

602
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,420
Dad Chen...

603
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,500
I left something in the company.

604
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,940
I've got it. I'm gonna go.

605
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,950
Why did you do that?

606
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,160
Why?

607
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,020
Answer me.

608
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,820
Why did you do this?

609
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,060
Sorry, Dad Chen.

610
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,820
I don't

611
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,970
get paid regularly

612
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,820
at our company.

613
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,350
I couldn't afford the rent,

614
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,070
so I went to a moneylender.

615
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,060
But the compounding interest was too expensive.

616
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,260
I couldn't afford it.

617
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,030
They even threatened me

618
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
to come to my place

619
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,260
if I don't pay back the money.

620
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,620
Then you should have told me.

621
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,660
If you don't have money, just tell me.

622
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,990
Why didn't you tell me?

623
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,690
I can give you money if you tell me.

624
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,420
Why did you do such thing?

625
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,000
Dad Chen.

626
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:03,900
I didn't know

627
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,300
it would end up like this.

628
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,180
At the beginning,

629
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,690
I thought they just wanted to have a look.

630
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,390
But later,

631
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,030
they threatened me with this

632
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,430
and forced me to work for them.

633
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,230
I was desperate.

634
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,860
Dad Chen.

635
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,080
Dad Chen.

636
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,170
Damai.

637
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,820
How come it is you?

638
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,400
I...

639
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,950
Don't fight no matter what.

640
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,110
Dad Chen, please forgive me.

641
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,660
I had no choice.

642
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,900
Please forgive me.

643
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,500
Please forgive me, Dad Chen.

644
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,630
I beg you.

645
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,530
I don't have the right to forgive you.

646
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,080
I don't have the right

647
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,140
to forgive you on behalf of everyone.

648
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:44,940
But...

649
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,780
I apologize to you.

650
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,530
I know you don't want to do that.

651
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,380
It's my fault

652
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,580
to leave you no choice.

653
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,460
It's my fault.

654
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,410
I didn't do well.

655
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,620
I apologize to you.

656
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,130
I apologize to you too.

657
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,770
I'm sorry.

658
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,920
Baba.

659
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,080
Go.

660
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,530
-Go. -Don't go!

661
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,100
Go!

662
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,700
Do you take us as your friends?

663
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,180
Calm down.

664
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,680
You just let him go?

665
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,030
Come back!

666
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,500
Guangxi.

667
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,850
Baba.

668
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,350
Stop walking.

669
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,980
You're giving me a headache.

670
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,100
I know

671
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,270
you don't feel good.

672
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,020
I don't feel good either.

673
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,520
But what else can we do?

674
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,550
We all know

675
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,100
Mars Animation.

676
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,900
Even if we sue them,

677
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,500
their only way is to delay.

678
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,140
They can delay for years

679
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,140
until we're broke.

680
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,380
There's no point

681
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,420
to blame on Damai completely

682
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,870
and let him

683
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,820
have a criminal record.

684
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,280
Are we just letting him go?

685
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,460
What else can we do?

686
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,260
Lock him up and sentence him?

687
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,100
Will you be satisfied?

688
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,380
Can we feel at ease?

689
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,900
Our project

690
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,220
is so long.

691
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,340
The process is very complicated.

692
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,420
It takes long before we get paid.

693
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,630
He's just a young man

694
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,170
working alone in a big city.

695
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,180
He's short of money.

696
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,660
It's not hard to understand.

697
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,500
-I… -Musen.

698
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,660
You all call me dad, right?

699
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,220
But I can't

700
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,740
let you guys call me that for nothing.

701
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,140
Do you really think you're our dad?

702
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,670
Maybe I'm too into the role.

703
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,260
Okay?

704
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,070
I know.

705
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,270
Dad Chen.

706
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,790
We'll listen to you.

707
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,880
Right, Chen Musen?

708
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,030
Where are you going?

709
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,860
Fix the computer and have a perm.

710
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,620
I'll talk to Chen Musen.

711
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,420
We'll figure out a way

712
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,520
about the company.

713
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:10,910
There you go.

714
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,530
Here are the samples you want.

715
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,660
I'll put them here.

716
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,740
What are you looking at?

717
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
Why the long face?

718
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,690
Something happened

719
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,700
to Guangxi's company.

720
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,360
I'm trying to solve it for him.

721
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,900
I just want to ask you.

722
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,640
What happened

723
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,900
to their company?

724
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,100
When I asked Chen Ye,

725
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,940
he didn't tell me.

726
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,430
He said it's no big deal.

727
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,350
Their project

728
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,200
was plagiarized by another company.

729
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,470
They also found a mole

730
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,970
in their company.

731
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,330
Then...

732
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
If they've found out,

733
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,620
they should call the police.

734
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,620
Objectively speaking,

735
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,260
the knowledge copyright case

736
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,460
is the most difficult.

737
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,340
Even if they have evidence

738
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,730
and win the lawsuit,

739
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,260
their company may be broke.

740
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,860
From the perspective of Dad Chen,

741
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,260
he wanted to let him go.

742
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,170
He said that guy was from a poor family.

743
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,260
Once he has a criminal record,

744
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,590
his life will be ruined.

745
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,340
Their company had planned

746
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,220
to get some cash inflows

747
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,280
with this project.

748
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,420
Now Dad Chen is broke

749
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,950
and even sold his own house.

750
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,980
He sold his house?

751
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:05,910
Well.

752
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,180
He is really interesting.

753
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,220
Why is he doing good

754
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,780
to such an ungrateful person?

755
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,040
He's way too generous.

756
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,400
What's wrong with him?

757
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,320
What?

758
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,560
You care about him?

759
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:16,830
No.

760
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,210
Who cares about him?

761
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,850
I'm just asking.

762
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,420
I don't care about him.

763
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,140
Go on with your work.

764
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,080
Find a way.

765
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,620
I'll get back to work.

766
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,950
I'm done.

767
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,960
How are you?

768
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,420
I'm almost done here.

769
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,880
See you at the restaurant.

770
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,630
Come over after work

771
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,540
and pick Yu up.

772
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,930
I'll finish everything

773
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,420
before two o'clock in the afternoon.

774
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,880
Keep an eye on the details.

775
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,300
Chen Musen.

776
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,030
Change the color of the clothes

777
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,460
and get back to me before half past five.

778
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,590
Guangxi.

779
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,430
You're here.

780
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,600
Are you still busy?

781
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,560
Dad Chen went to see the investors.

782
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,790
We'll stay behind.

783
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,420
We'll do as many projects as we can,

784
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
so that the company can last longer.

785
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,210
Are you tired?

786
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,820
100,000 volts.

787
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,160
Let me charge you.

788
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,700
If there are really 100,000 volts,

789
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,100
I would be electrocuted.

790
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,930
But now is good.

791
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,780
I won't be powered off.

792
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,410
Dig in.

793
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,030
Here.

794
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,670
Have more.

795
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,460
The client of the Three-Character Canon is chasing.

796
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,620
I need to go back.

797
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,360
Why don't you grab something to eat before leaving?

798
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,730
There's no time.

799
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,410
I'll have some on the way.

800
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,390
Take the sandwich with you.

801
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,470
I'm gonna go.

802
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,570
Ms. Xu.

803
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,580
Do you have time

804
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,640
for a cup of coffee?

805
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,110
So you came to me

806
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,600
for Fengqi Shendu's case.

807
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,500
I've heard about Mr. Chen's problem.

808
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,140
But,

809
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,260
would that be any of my business?

810
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,340
So far as I know,

811
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,310
Flower World

812
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,140
has always been interested

813
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,700
in entering into the entertainment business

814
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,780
and getting in touch

815
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,980
with Mars Animation.

816
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,150
I am interested,

817
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,820
but it doesn't mean

818
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,280
I will stand up for others.

819
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,870
Even if your potential partner

820
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,490
is a company

821
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,420
that copies other people's works?

822
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,740
When sheep are eaten by wolves,

823
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,830
no one will condemn

824
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,620
whether wolves' behavior is moral or not.

825
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,280
Miss Yin.

826
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,260
Time's up for a cup of coffee.

827
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,190
I have a meeting.

828
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,220
See you.

829
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,260
Ms. Xu.

830
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,300
I believe

831
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,770
you don't need

832
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,300
a wolf like Mars,

833
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,870
but a trustworthy partner.

834
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,430
After all,

835
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,420
Flower World doesn't want to live on a single product,

836
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,140
but to build up

837
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,670
its own animation kingdom.

838
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,450
Right?

839
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,630
Your coffee is really special.

840
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,580
If you don't mind,

841
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,540
can I finish my cup of coffee before I leave?

842
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,800
Are your certain

843
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,900
that Xu Guangxi

844
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,740
is my choice?

845
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,260
I trust your taste.

846
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,360
You only choose

847
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,530
the best.

848
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,800
Yin Yike.

849
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,140
Since you really

850
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,460
want to help Guangxi.

851
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,540
I'm curious.

852
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,210
What would you

853
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,300
like to do

854
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,580
for him?

855
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:19,980
Ms. Xu.

856
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
What do you want?

857
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,230
Just tell me.

858
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,900
I want all staff,

859
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,100
especially Xu Guangxi,

860
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,780
of That's A Big Animation Movie Company

861
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,980
to come with me

862
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,180
to Guangzhou.

863
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,150
Mom, what are you thinking?

864
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,770
Nothing.

865
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,230
Eat up.

866
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,810
Your dad will pick you up later.

867
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,340
Mom.

868
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,640
Are you abandoning me?

869
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,000
No, I'm not.

870
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,170
I was supposed to

871
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,770
accompany you temporarily.

872
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:12,940
In the end,

873
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,590
you have to live with your dad.

874
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,429
If you two are together,

875
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,170
I can see both of you everyday.

876
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,480
It's not your business, kid.

877
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,020
Eat up.

878
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,429
I'm sorry.

879
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,340
I'm late.

880
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,050
Sorry.

881
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,840
You're eating.

882
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,350
Chen.

883
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,260
Enjoy your food.

884
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,460
I need to talk to her.

885
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,940
What's wrong?

886
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,540
Come over.

887
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,380
Please.

888
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,300
Can I let Yu

889
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,460
stay at your place for a few more days?

890
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,980
At first, you said one or two days.

891
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,900
Now it's been five, six, seven, eight...

892
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,380
So many days.

893
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,620
How can you be a father like that?

894
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,100
I know.

895
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,909
But it's true that at home...

896
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,389
I mean,

897
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,380
I haven't finished my work

898
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:57,610
at the company.

899
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,700
If you think

900
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,860
cooking is too troublesome,

901
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,100
I can continue to come to your place

902
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,160
to cook for you two.

903
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,790
Did you

904
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,970
sell your house?

905
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,680
Well...

906
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,340
It has nothing to do with the kid.

907
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,140
The cleaner of the building said

908
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,510
there's a weird guy

909
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,740
brushing teeth and washing his face

910
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,060
in the public toilet everyday.

911
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,870
He wears glasses and slippers.

912
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,960
If it was not you, who else could it be?

913
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,070
Well, I admit that.

914
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,180
There are some problems

915
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,210
in the company,

916
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,500
but they're temporary.

917
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,260
It's mainly because...

918
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,060
As you can see,

919
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,340
there are a lot of young men in the company.

920
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,180
They can't...

921
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,020
Take this.

922
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,710
What is this?

923
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,080
Well,

924
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,980
My friend went abroad.

925
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,350
The house is available.

926
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,550
You and Yu can live there

927
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,490
for a while.

928
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,500
Don't worry about the rent.

929
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,340
I discussed with him.

930
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,700
You could talk about it later.

931
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,540
Just

932
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,800
move in.

933
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,450
I won't stop you

934
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,460
if you want to support others' dreams

935
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,020
as a man.

936
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,880
But you can't always let Yu

937
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,970
suffer with you.

938
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,060
I know it hasn't been easy for you.

939
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,940
You need to take care

940
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,850
of those young people downstairs,

941
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,260
but...

942
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:07,970
Thank you.

943
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,650
I'm so shy.

944
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,010
I'll send Yu's stuff

945
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,620
to you later.

946
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,560
I'm off work. I'm gonna go.

947
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,900
Their breakfast smells so good.

948
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,500
It's even better to add a sausage.

949
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,550
Hello, guys.

950
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,380
Good morning.

951
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,060
Why are you here so early?

952
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,790
What's wrong with you two?

953
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,720
You look so down.

954
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,180
The rat-racer is late.

955
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,380
I must tell Dad Chen

956
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,290
to deduct his salary.

957
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,610
He must drink too much last night.

958
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,330
Definitely not.

959
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,560
Why is his desk empty?

960
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,380
There's also a resignation letter.

961
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,570
Did he run away with the money?

962
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,030
Maybe the mole is Damai.

963
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,860
You're right.

964
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,220
What did you say?

965
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,380
The reason why

966
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,300
Fengqi Shendu was copied

967
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,220
is there's a mole

968
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,240
in our company.

969
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,400
Bro.

970
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,630
Are you sure about that?

971
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,300
Are you joking?

972
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,090
I wish this was a joke.

973
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,040
But the truth is that he's the mole.

974
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,400
Guangxi.

975
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,400
Is that true?

976
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,600
This ungrateful guy.

977
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,660
He sold all of us out.

978
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,660
It's our dream.

979
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,740
I'll go find him.

980
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,220
It's day time.

981
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,050
Where are you going?

982
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,220
I'm going to find Damai.

983
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,680
He left an IOU and ran away.

984
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,430
Give it to me.

985
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,070
Come on.

986
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,030
We are all out there working

987
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,570
to make a living.

988
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,320
What happened

989
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,830
is all my fault.

990
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,520
I didn't do my job well as a dad.

991
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,910
Baba is just being modest.

992
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,590
How can he be defeated?

993
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,090
Right?

994
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:19,760
Of course.

995
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,980
It's not a big deal.

996
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,560
Right?

997
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,980
Even if we can't do Fengqi Shendu.

998
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,500
We can still do Fengqi Xiandu.

999
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:25,940
Right?

1000
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,340
If we can't shoot the Tang Dynasty.

1001
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,260
What about the 5,000 years of civilization?

1002
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:29,980
There are so many dynasties.

1003
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,340
Any one will do.

1004
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:34,940
Okay.

1005
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,450
I know

1006
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,070
I'm only a few years older than you.

1007
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,590
You respect me

1008
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,580
so you call me dad.

1009
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,630
I also know

1010
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,380
how much this means to me

1011
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,500
in my heart.

1012
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,950
Although I always

1013
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,180
paint a big picture,

1014
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,120
but I promise you

1015
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,530
that I have never doubted our dream

1016
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,060
for one second.

1017
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,180
Not even for a second.

1018
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,030
I know

1019
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,620
it's time

1020
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,540
to help you set up the easel

1021
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,820
and paint the big picture together.

1022
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,350
Don't worry.

1023
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,200
Everything will pass.

1024
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,710
Your dad is here.

1025
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,170
Baba!

1026
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,860
I'll always stand by you.

1027
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,790
I have your back.

1028
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,560
Baba.

1029
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
I won't leave you.

1030
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,680
Why are you crying?

1031
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,370
Didn't you cry just now?

1032
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:35,940
No.

1033
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,910
I was just clearing a sleep crust.

1034
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,370
What's wrong?

1035
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,100
It's normal to have a sleep crust

1036
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,460
after getting up in the morning.

1037
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,090
Hello.

1038
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,210
Who is Mr. Chen?

1039
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,240
I am.

1040
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,700
I'm Ms. Xu's secretary

1041
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,760
from Flower World.

1042
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,790
Our boss wants

1043
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,420
to invite you to our company.

1044
