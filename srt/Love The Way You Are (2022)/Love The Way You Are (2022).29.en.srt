But

67
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,220
a little question.

68
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,200
Well,

69
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,660
we all know

70
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,579
your company is a game company.

71
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,220
And we are

72
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,680
a pure animation company.

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,090
You chose to invest in us

74
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,570
because...

75
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,420
Because I want to

76
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,880
advance to the film and television section.

77
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,210
I've applied to the board

78
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,420
to establish the Animation and Film Business Department.

79
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,360

So I'll accept

84
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,450
all your previous projects.

85
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,380
And I'll reinforce the investment and development.

89
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,579
We've been the one who proposed worries.

90
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,650
Apart from

91
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,650
the quality of our works,

92
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,970
you must have other conditions as well.

93
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,850
Everyone,

94
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,460
go to Guangzhou headquarters with me.

95
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,510
Why?

96
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,200
Guangzhou.

97
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,279
Xu Guangxi.

98
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,060
If you can't,

99
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,940
our cooperation

100
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,980
is over.

101
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,590
Think about it.

102
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,780
Ms. Xu.

103
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,500
I have a question.

104
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,220
Why do we have to go to Guangzhou?

105
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,680
Why?

106
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,990
Any worries?

107
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,710
I hope you can think it through

108
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,660
instead of being influenced

109
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,580
by anyone,

110
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,310
and thus miss such a good opportunity.

111
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,540
After all, you just experienced

112
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,710
the feeling of losing your dream.

113
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,630
Right?

114
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,460
But I think

115
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,740
there's no conflict.

116
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,740
Xu Guangxi.

117
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,070
You really don't appreciate my kindness.

118
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,700
You're worried that Yin Yike won't agree,

119
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,150
right?

120
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,380
But in my opinion,

121
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,990
it's not a big problem.

122
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,130
Yin Yike is no longer

123
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,300
18 years old.

124
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,190
She knows what to do

125
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,520
is the best for you.

126
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,900
And you.

127
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,260
If you give up your career

128
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,659
because of love,

129
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,070
it would be

130
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,570
very immature.

131
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,990
Tell me.

132
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,210
What do you think?

133
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:49,800
Baba,

134
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:50,900
I think

135
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,440
Ms. Xu

136
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,240
has everything we need.

137
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,100
What's more, she's giving us

138
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,350
everything we want.

139
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,010
Yes.

140
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,380
Let alone Guangzhou,

141
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,350
even the moon,

142
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,780
we're willing to go, right?

143
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,670
Yes, of course.

144
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,380
Since ancient times, beauties come from Guangzhou.

145
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,070
I'm willing to move.

146
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,970
In that case,

147
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,180
our Group of Pie

148
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,840
is really going to get the pie.

149
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,660
Our dream is coming true.

150
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,010
Guangxi.

151
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,270
Guangxi.

152
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,650
What do you think?

153
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,440
Well...

154
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,120
It's hard.

155
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,610
You're right.

156
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,930
Love

157
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,040
and career.

158
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,850
It's really difficult.

159
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,860
Indeed.

160
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,960
I'll figure something out.

161
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,620
Guangxi.

162
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,020
I don't know

163
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,300
if there are many talented people

164
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,180
in our industry.

165
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,580
But I know that

166
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,460
those with the chance and luck

167
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,700
can be counted with one hand.

168
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,620
It's such a big gift

169
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,710
bestowed on us.

170
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,010
This may be

171
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,710
the chance of our lifetime.

172
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,780
Right, Guangxi.

173
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,290
Besides, Shanghai is not far from Guangzhou.

174
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,890
The flight is only two hours.

175
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,270
What do you know? Don't talk nonsense.

176
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,230
If Guangxi won't go,

177
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,400
we can't get it done

178
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,390
by ourselves.

179
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,170
It's cruel,

180
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,460
but it's reality.

181
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,140
Don't be so pessimistic.

182
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,100
I understand

183
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,310
your thoughts.

184
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,870
I know

185
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,820
this opportunity is very rare.

186
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
Give me some time.

187
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,060
Let's go.

188
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,500
Go back and think about it.

189
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,430
There's no rush.

190
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,040
Give him some time.

191
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,909
You're back.

192
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,580
Come and eat.

193
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,790
You sent

194
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,890
Xu Yuan there, right?

195
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,390
It's because you're capable.

196
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,620
I'm just a matchmaker.

197
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,460
Do you know

198
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,630
what she offered us?

199
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,020
She wants our entire team to go to Guangzhou.

200
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,620
I know.

201
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,100
Do you want me to go?

202
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,190
It's not easy

203
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,990
to find

204
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,539
a reliable investor nowadays.

205
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,299
Xu Yuan

206
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,770
is quite capable

207
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,560
and straightforward.

208
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,790
I think

209
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,040
her offer

210
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,710
is also within a reasonable range.

211
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,150
Her offer

212
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,730
really attracts Dad Chen.

213
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,910
Dad Chen can't live without me.

214
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,530
But I want to know

215
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,460
without consideration for others,

216
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,460
and only focusing on your feelings,

217
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,590
do you really want me to go?

218
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,660
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

219
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,990
Here, have some shrimp.

220
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,630
Add some vinegar.

221
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,560
Leave the rest to me.

222
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,670
Bai,

223
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,610
we've been friends for so many years.

224
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,980
We finally arrived

225
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,440
at the crossroads of life.

226
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Give me some advice.

227
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,540
There's something

228
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,480
I can't decide.

229
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,360
Should I go to Guangzhou or not?

230
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,430
Let me tell you what I think.

231
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,230
I...

232
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,560
I really want to go.

233
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,370
It's my career after all.

234
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,190
And those kids

235
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,330
need me.

236
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,590
But to be honest,

237
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,460
I don't want to part

238
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,540
with Qin Yiran.

239
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,340
Because you know that if I go to Guangzhou,

240
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,350
I have to break up with her.

241
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,390
So I think

242
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,390
I'm going to ask her out

243
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,530
to the amusement park

244
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,990
and confess my love to her.

245
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,740
If she agrees,

246
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,970
from now on,

247
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,300
we won't mention going to Guangzhou ever again.

248
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,500
If she doesn't agree,

249
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,180
you have to

250
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,510
go to Guangzhou with me.

251
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,260
You need to change your license plate.

252
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
Chen Ye.

253
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,000
What a coincidence.

254
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,660
Why are you here?

255
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,100
What are you doing here?

256
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,190
My car broke down.

257
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:31,950
Well...

258
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,540
So I

259
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,500
am waiting for a car

260
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,710
to come and help me

261
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,730
charge it or something.

262
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,460
What a coincidence to meet you.

263
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,750
It's fate.

264
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,740
What a coincidence that

265
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,260
your car broke down on my way home.

266
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,860
This is...

267
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,560
Is this your way back home?

268
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,290
Tell me, what's the matter?

269
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,020
I'll get straight to the point.

270
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,540
Are you free tomorrow?

271
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,010
Tomorrow?

272
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,500
What's wrong?

273
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,800
Yu has been...

274
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,590
He's been...

275
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,460
He's been very fussy.

276
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,700
Always saying he wants to go to the amusement park.

277
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,890
If I go to the amusement park, given my condition,

278
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,210
there are lots of facilities we can't ride on,

279
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,660
right?

280
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,500
Well...

281
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,860
The point is he always

282
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,540
asks for you to take him to play.

283
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,000
I said, how could we do that?

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,850
We've already caused her

285
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,900
so much trouble.

286
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,470
You even lived in her house.

287
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,780
It's inappropriate

288
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,650
to ask her to take you anywhere.

289
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,940
But he doesn't care.

290
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,180
Kids don't know this, right?

291
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,280
He acts like a child, pretending to hang himself.

292
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,720
Really.

293
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,540
He found a rope to hang himself.

294
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,520
So I came to you.

295
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,160
It's okay. I understand.

296
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,940
I understand.

297
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
It's hard for you.

298
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,780
Very hard for you.

299
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,540
As I said,

300
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,360
I shouldn't bother you anymore.

301
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,340
I've caused you

302
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,420
so much trouble, right?

303
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,420
He's just a kid.

304
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,460
He can get through it.

305
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,210
It'll be fine.

306
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:40,720
It's okay.

307
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,500
Don't take it to heart.

308
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,380
It's okay. I'll see...

309
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,010
I'll go back and see him hang himself.

310
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,850
Wait.

311
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,790
Where should I go tomorrow?

312
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,060
Send me the time and location.

313
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,620
Okay.

314
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,400
Chen,

315
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,670
are you nervous?

316
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,150
I've seen

317
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,770
all kinds of spectacles.

318
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,740
It's just a small thing.

319
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,040
Why should I be nervous?

320
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,490
Chen, come on.

321
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,690
Thank you, Yu.

322
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,840
I'll do my best.

323
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,700
Why is this woman

324
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,460
so slow?

325
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,130
Yes.

326
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,340
Wait a minute.

327
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,460
Auntie,

328
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,900
we already have tickets.

329
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,060
Who are you calling auntie?

330
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,240
Mom.

331
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,280
Yu.

332
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,400
You...

333
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,900
Why are you dressed like this?

334
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,300
What do you know, old man?

335
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,780
Let me tell you.

336
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,520
This is the most fashionable sunscreen outfit

337
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,410
for OLs.

338
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,920
OL?

339
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,380
Are you sure

340
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,380
OLs dress like this?

341
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,420
Of course.

342
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,430
That auntie dresses just

343
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,420
like you.

344
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,890
I think

345
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,420
you have the same hats.

346
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,040
I...

347
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,420
Well,

348
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,540
I'm ready.

349
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,720
Let's go in and play.

350
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,860
Yu.

351
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,770
What do you want to play?

352
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,580
How about roller coaster?

353
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,860
This...

354
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,580
Kids can't play roller coaster.

355
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,640
Chen wants to play.

356
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,950
I want to play roller coaster.

357
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,280
Then...

358
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,480
Let's go.

359
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Line up.

360
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,550
Let's go.

361
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,220
Slow down.

362
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,620
Yu, slow down.

363
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,200
Are you nervous?

364
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,840
No.

365
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,890
Do we have to sit in the first row?

366
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,020
The first row has the best experience.

367
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,940
OK.

368
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,840
Since we're here, come on.

369
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,990
Let's go.

370
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,220
Come on.

371
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,330
Well,

372
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,800
I have something to tell you.

373
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,910
♫Coffee shaken in the palm of my hand♫

374
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,900

♫Pretending not to care♫

392

Not bad.

393
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,900
At least you didn't pretend.

394
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,860
♫Melting in my hands♫

395
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,340

Are you done?

429
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,340
Yes.

430
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,140
Take a look.

431
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,140
It looks good.

432
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,030
Remember to send it to me.

433
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,500
I'll send it to you.

434

Here.

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:15,870
Come on.

436
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,150
Three, two, one.

437
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,830
Yu, you're sweating.

438
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,590
Did you have fun?

439
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,280
Yes.

440
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,070
Here, have some water.

441
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,730
Here.

442
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,340
Drink slowly.

443
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,140
Let's go see penguins.

444
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,100
Let's go see penguins.

445
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,870
Be careful.

446
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,770
Be careful.

447
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,500
He is naughty.

448
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,280
He's quite close to you.

449
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,220
I don't know if he's your son

450
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,460
or my son.

451
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,090
Here, have some water.

452
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,360
Thank you.

453
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,580
You're welcome.

454
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,110
Actually, I had a good time.

455
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,530
If...

456
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,260
If you're willing,

457
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,260
we can take the child out

458
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,780
every weekend

459
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,970
together.

460
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,860
I won't beat around the bush.

461
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,700
You know

462
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,340
-I asked you out... -Chen Ye.

463
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,120
Actually,

464
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,480
you don't have to be like this.

465
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:51,890
What?

466
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,260
I think

467
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,070
the best relationship

468
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,960
between us

469
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,770
is

470
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,150
to be friends.

471
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,860
You know me.

472
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,180
I think my principle is

473
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,440
not getting married or raising children for my safety.

474
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,840
Right?

475
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,870
And I love to go to clubs.

476
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,930
I love drinking.

477
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,590
How could I

478
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,870
be Yu's...

479
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:17,950
Of course.

480
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,040
I think Yu is great.

481
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,900
You are great too.

482
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,080
It's my problem.

483
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,780
I really don't have the ability

484
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,250
to take the responsibility.

485
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,780
You know?

486
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,940
I really...

487
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,800
Anyway, I'm sorry.

488
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,380
It's okay.

489
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,020
I knew it.

490
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,570
Mom.

491
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,060
Take me to see polar bears.

492
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:51,870
Okay.

493
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,710
Let's go, Yu.

494
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,170
Hello?

495
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,660
Are you free? Come out for a drink.

496
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,690
Send me the address.

497
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,430
What's going on?

498
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,440
I thought you quit drinking.

499
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,180
I'm just drinking away sadness.

500
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,460
Sometimes I can

501
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,300
still do that.

502
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,060
OK.

503
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,180
Waiter.

504
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,140
A glass, please.

505
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,520
Thank you.

506
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,420
Miss Yin's career

507
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,050
has been so successful.

508
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,830
The only person

509
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,360
can make you worry is Xu Guangxi, right?

510
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,810
Xu Yuan is going to acquire their company.

511
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,140
She has human resources,

512
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,170
and she has money.

513
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,240
The dead game

514
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,140
has been turned around.

515
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,580
Good news.

516
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,670
The bitterness has come to an end.

517
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,650
But there is one thing.

518
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,530
She asked everyone

519
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,880
to go to the Guangzhou headquarters.

520
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,670
Everyone...

521
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,530
This is the so-called

522
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,270
"dig a hole and bury yourself", right?

523
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,350
Are you worried that Xu Guangxi

524
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,650
will become Li Zelin 2.0?

525
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,720
Not really.

526
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,810
Li Zelin and I

527
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,090
parted because we are not suitable for each other.

528
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,250
It's not exactly because of long-distance thing.

529
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,450
That's good.

530
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,450
It's just Guangzhou. It's not going abroad.

531
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,260
It doesn't count as a long-distance relationship.

532
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,380
Reasonally,

533
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,950
of course it's a good thing.

534
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,980
But in love,

535
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,510
I'm not

536
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,430
emotionless.

537
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,360
I'm reluctant to let him go.

538
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,470
So I asked you out

539
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,930
to drink the sadness away with me.

540
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,420
Got it.

541
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,240
What about you?

542
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,780
Didn't Dad Chen tell you?

543
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,890
No.

544
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,130
What's going on

545
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,420
with you now?

546
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,470
Actually, he asked me

547
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,360
to go to the amusement park today.

548
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,020
Then,

549
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,660
he confessed his love to me.

550
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,920
Confessed?

551
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,140
And then?

552
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,670
You know

553
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,740
I'm so used to rejecting others all these years.

554
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,310
So I...

555
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,540
I subconsciously...

556
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,790
I ran away.

557
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,070
Yiran.

558
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,730
I don't understand.

559
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,510
What are you

560
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,860
still hesitating for?

561
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,470
To be honest,

562
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,990
I don't know

563
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,220
what I'm dwelling on.

564
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,660
Maybe I'm just timid.

565
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,890
I just think

566
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,850
you finally meet someone

567
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,630
that you have a crush on.

568
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,650
Don't miss someone

569
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,600
because of timidness.

570
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,180
Now that you know

571
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,540
he's moving to Guangzhou,

572
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,170
do you have a little bit impulsion

573
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,220
to keep him?

574
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,110
Yu is great.

575
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,010
You are great too.

576
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:18,940
It's my problem.

577
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,900
I don't have the ability

578
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,180
to take the responsibility.

579
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,660
Do you understand?

580
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,340
I...

581
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,250
I just...

582
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,510
Anyway, I'm sorry.

583
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,310
It's okay.

584
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,080
I knew it.

585
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,720
Forget it.

586
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,950
I hurt him so badly.

587
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,260
How can I

588
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,900
go back to him?

589
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,860
Let's drink.

590
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,330
Sometimes,

591
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,620
we need to

592
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,850
face ourselves.

593
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,770
All these years,

594
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,810
I know

595
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,220
you've been afraid of getting hurt,

596
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,530
so you never dared to accept others.

597
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,650
But you know,

598
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,060
even if you hang out every day,

599
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,300
I know there's a hole

600
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,630
in your heart.

601
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,740
Now you finally

602
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,060
meet someone

603
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,660
who can walk into your heart.

604
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,660
Ask your heart,

605
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,050
what do you want?

606
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,250
If there is a chance,

607
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,660
I hope

608
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,710
I can tell him about

609
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,700
the real me.

610
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,650
But...

611
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,740
we've missed each other.

612
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,540
There's nothing to regret.

613
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,670
Let's drink.

614
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,930
Sometimes,

615
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,370
I feel sorry for you.

616
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,920
Hello, Dad Chen.

617
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,390
Chen Ye.

618
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,330
You're here.

619
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,920
Why didn't you tell me

620
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,490
you are going to Guangzhou?

621
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,970
You didn't tell me you are going to Guangzhou.

622
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,060
We were in the amusement park

623
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,410
all day.

624
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,780
Why didn't you

625
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,780
find a chance to tell me?

626
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,810
You even asked my best friend to tell me.

627
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,380
Right?

628
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,420
What is this?

629
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,620
What kind of man are you?

630
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,420
Why didn't you tell me yourself?

631
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,420
You...

632
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,070
I...

633
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,300
What's wrong with you?

634
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,960
Listen.

635
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,950
You're always so stubborn.

636
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,150
So shameless.

637
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,700
You stick to me

638
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,030
like a plaster.

639
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,350
I can't remove it.

640
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,460
Why are you giving up

641
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,380
and leaving this time?

642
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,260
Why?

643
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,500
I...

644
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,870
I'm telling you.

645
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,310
In the amusement park today,

646
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,520
if you...

647
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,290
took the initiative, I...

648
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,200
I wouldn't have run away.

649
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,580
You know

650
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,490
under that situation,

651
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,690
I panicked

652
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,030
all of a sudden.

653
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,030
I didn't know what to do.

654
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,220
Do you understand?

655
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,100
Actually,

656
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,410
I really wanted to say yes.

657
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,170
I really want to...

658
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,060
to live

659
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,690
with you.

660
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,340
But

661
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,650
you know what?

662
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,400
I've grown up

663
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,430
in a very unhappy family

664
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,520
since I was little.

665
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,270
So, I never believed

666
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,830
anything like

667
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,980
love will bring

668
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,380
security and happiness.

669
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,450
All this time,

670
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,150
I've always been alone.

671
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,260
Until one day,

672
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,950
you appeared in my life.

673
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,750
And I fell in love with you.

674
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,390
I became even more scared

675
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,760
since I fell in love with you.

676
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,060
Because I'm afraid of losing you.

677
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,420
I'm afraid that one day

678
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,220
you won't love me anymore.

679
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,830
Yu doesn't like me

680
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,460
as his step-mom anymore.

681
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,710
Then you two

682
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,500
will abandon me.

683
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,580
By then,

684
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,060
I'll be alone.

685
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,640
I don't know what to do

686
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,390
at that time.

687
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,530
Do you know that? I'm scared.

688
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,530
No, we won't.

689
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,550
Why not?

690
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,740
You are going to Guangzhou.

691
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,990
You won't care about me.

692
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,410
No, no, this...

693
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,870
I know

694
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,300
you don't want to care about me anymore.

695
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,700
Why?

696
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,800
Why?

697
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,140
Are you proposing?

698
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,180
I was ready

699
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,460
to propose today.

700
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,070
You wanted to propose?

701
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,780
You were not leaving? Why didn't you tell me earlier?

702
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,540
-I'm not leaving. -You proposed.

703
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,500
I think

704
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,150
I look so ugly when I cry.

705
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,760
And you are proposing.

706
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,980
No, no, no.

707
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,700
You are pretty.

708
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,780
-I don't have any flowers. -Yes, you do.

709
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,860
I prepared them.

710
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,320
And then suddenly...

711
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,220
Okay.

712
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,340
I'll explain. I'm not leaving.

713
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,010
I won't leave.

714
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,090
I won't leave.

715
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,180
No.

716
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,630
I want...

717
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,010
I want a white and beautiful wedding dress.

718
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,210
White and beautiful.

719
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,000
Well,

720
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,390
you have to

721
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,610
take good care of Yu.

722
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,180
What do you mean?

723
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,140
I have to take care of you wholeheartedly.

724
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,450
♫Say "I will"♫

725
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,840
♫My love♫

726

♫By your side♫

737
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,560
Have you talked it through

738
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,889
with Xu Guangxi about going to Guangzhou?

739
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,340
Ms. Xu.

740
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,150
I want to talk to you in person.

741
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:51,820
Ms. Xu.

742
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,270
I want to talk to you in person.

743
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,080
These two

744
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,430
are really interesting.

745
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,880
Ms. Xu.

746
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,610
The preparation of Animation and Film Department

747
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,410
is almost done

748
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,390
in Guangzhou.

749
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,460
If Xu Guangxi's team

750
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,980
won't sign the contract,

751
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,890
it might affect

752
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,420
the company's annual plan.

753
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,970
And there are many animation companies

754
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,140
in the industry

755
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,740
that want to compete for this opportunity.

756
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,740
What do you think?

757
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,380
Make an appointment with Xu Guangxi and Yin Yike.

758
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,540
Separately.

759
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,020
I want to see them separately.

760
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,840
Okay, Ms. Xu.

761
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,180
Dad Chen has made the pie for so long,

762
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,590
and he finally got a big one.

763
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,720
You are not thinking about giving up, Guangxi, are you?

764
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,060
But since ancient times,

765
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,900
there have been many people

766
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,540
who gave up career for beauty.

767
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,870
For example, King Zhou,

768
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,060
Zhang Wuji.

769
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,700
You were talking about ancient times.

770
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,030
What era is it now?

771
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,290
It's just going to Guangzhou.

772
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,220
Is that such a big deal?

773
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,100
In front of true love,

774
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,390
is three meters that far?

775
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,270
No, Musen.

776
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,370
My sister's last relationship

777
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,300
ended

778
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,580
because of the long-distance thing.

779
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:56,940
Right?

780
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,870
And...

781
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,620
Guangxi.

782
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,260
How did you promise

783
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,170
in front of my dad?

784
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:00,940
Ms. Xu

785
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,230
came for Guangxi.

786
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,020
Now,

787
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,930
the fate of the whole team

788
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,220
is in the hands of Guangxi.

789
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,720
Think it through, Guangxi.

790
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,020
I don't care. I won't allow

791
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,620
the long-distance relationship.

792
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,230
Did I ask them to break up?

793
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,060
Why can't they

794
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,540
enjoy both career and love?

795
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,620
As long as you work,

796
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,550
you won't be able to manage your time.

797
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,330
Kid, you know...

798
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:16,910
Enough!

799
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,340
Stop arguing.

800
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,240
I know what to do.

801
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:24,580
Guangxi.

802
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,260
See, you drove him away.

803
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,060
You pissed him off.

804
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,210
You pissed him off.

805
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,340
We both pissed him off, okay?

806
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,920
Let's drink.

807
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,180
Go back and persuade your sister.

808
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,840
Go back and persuade Guangxi.

809
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,990
Ms. Xu.

810
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,140
Sorry, I'm late.

811
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,830
Thank you.

812
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,890
I ordered it for you.

813
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:54,620
Wait for me.

814
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,320
Sorry.

815
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,260
We're testing

816
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,390
the new game developed by the company.

817
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,790
Congratulations on completing the game.

818
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,720
There's nothing to congratulate.

819
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,090
I just played for one night and I completed it.

820
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:12,960
I'll reject it

821
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,750
and ask them to revise it again.

822
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,740
You are asking them to revise it just because you complete too fast?

823
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,340
Ms. Xu.

824
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,540
Your company really

825
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,740
doesn't care about the cost on creating games.

826
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,870
Don't you think that

827
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,950
the companies

828
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,580
are doing projects too fast?

829
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,650
All they think about is making money.

830
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,140
Yes.

831
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,220
Too eager for quick success.

832
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,200
Maybe they forget their original intention.

833
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,960
That's what

834
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,060
makes Xu Guangxi precious.

835
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,670
I'm very straightforward.

836
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,710
But I always

837
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,030
go straight for what I want,

838
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,310
and I never failed.

839
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
You can be angry

840
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,180
or scold me.

841
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,660
I understand.

842
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,940
But there's something

843
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
I need to tell you.

844
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,780
I must take Xu Guangxi away.

845
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,710
I hope you won't stop me.

846
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,020
Ms. Xu.

847
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,660
I also admire

848
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,300
your straightforwardness.

849
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,560
I will take care of everything for Guangxi

850
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,020
for his move to Guangzhou.

851
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,420
I'll also tell him

852
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,480
to focus on his work

853
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,120
and don't have any worries.

854
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,730
Aren't you worried?

855
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,320
To be honest,

856
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,370
of course I have worries.

857
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,960
But I know I love Guangxi.

858
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,020
I hope he can become

859
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,380
a better version of himself

860
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,640
and fulfill his dream.

861
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,070
If a relationship

862
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,860
can only be protected

863
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,200
by binding,

864
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,670
it's too fragile.

865
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,920
Besides,

866
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,570
Ms. Xu,

867
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,560
I also believe in your character.

868
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,820
What if

869
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,910
I can't help it?

870
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,420
♫Travels to the end♫

871
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,370

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,050
So many penguins.

875
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,290
Right?

876
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,540
For penguins,

877
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,260
dads are responsible for hatching eggs,

878
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,940
while moms go hunting.

879
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,060
After the baby

880
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,350
is born,

881
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,870
the three of them

882
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,340
live together.

883
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,840
They are happy, right?

884
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,020
Yes.

885
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,230
Don't be fooled by penguins.

886
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,280
Let me tell you.

887
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,730
Many penguins

888
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,730
sneak around.

889
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,100
Especially the emperor penguins.

890
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,070
They have that

891
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,850
annual-monogamy thing.

892
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,150
They get divorced

893
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,770
before they can settle down.

894
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,460
It's safer

895
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,320
not to get married or have a child.

896
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,010
Yu, let's go.

897
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,100
Let's go to

898
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,010
the Polar Bear Hall.

899
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:49,540
Let's go.

900
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,160
Okay.

901
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,900
Ten Zebra Danios.

902
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,470
There are many kinds of fish here.

903
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,500
What kind of fish do you like?

904
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,860
Flatfish.

905
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,260
Flatfish is good.

906
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,890
It's very auspicious.

907
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,300
And it implies flying wing to wing.

908
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,640
There is a poem written like this.

909
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,410
"If we become flatfish, why be afraid of death?"

910
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,120
"I won't envy gods because I'm happy in love."

911
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,140
What nonsense

912
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,440
are you talking about?

913
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,570
I'm talking about the

914
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,270
steamed flatfish.

915
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,440
Braised flatfish.

916
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,620
This fish is good.

917
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,790
It has lots of flesh and few fishbones.

918
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,920
♫Look at me♫

919
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,790
