But I'm afraid that

105
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
I may destroy her family.

106
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,120
Destroying her family?

107
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,200
It's not your fault.

108
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,180
It's his fault.

109
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,760
People like him deserve to

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,440
what I bought

157
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,530
with the money?

158
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,940
This's it.

159
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,490
The high heels that made me sprain my ankle.

160
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,400
This one?

161
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,850
Stop laughing.

162

164
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,060
Not really.

165
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,040
I just don't understand

166
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,940
why did you spend so much money

167
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,790
to buy a pair of shoes

168
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,150
that you can't stand.

169
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,850
Is it for work?

170
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,080
I don't want that either.

171
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,050
But that's the truth.

172
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,060
Why could men

173
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,930
still be young after half of your life?

174
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,470
But if a woman is over 30,

175
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,910
and doesn't dress up well,

she will be settled before her time comes

177
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,240
and just get old.

178
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,640
That's not ture.

179
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,250
I told you Yin Yike

180
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,520
is the prettiest woman I've ever met.

181
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,300
What you said

182
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,320
is neither sincere

183
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,200
nor comforting for me.

184
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,200

187
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,980
It's more disgusting if you say in broadcasting tone.

188

How are you now?

189
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,400
Are you feeling better?

190
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,320
Do you want me to carry you?

191
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,970
It's okay.

192

193
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,690
Let me change to sneakers.

194

198

Luckily, I brought a pair of sneakers.

201
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,870

208
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,670

209
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,440
I think so too.

210
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,610
Bye.

211
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,210
Go back and take a rest.

212
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,240
Good night.

213
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,620
Thank you for your dinner.

Yike, get up.

Hurry up. Time to get up.

218
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,080
Aunt Lan, today is weekend.

219
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,250
I want to stay in bed longer.

220
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,900
I know. I'd like to let you

221
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,890
sleep longer.

222
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,000
But Zelin came early in the morning.

223
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,000
If he keeps sitting,

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,930
your father may discuss

225
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,190
when can he have a grandson with him.

226
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,420
I'll be right out, Aunt Lan.

227
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,690
Zelin, it's fine.

228
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,760
Why did you bring so many gifts?

229
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,400
We're family.

230
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,200
Don't bring gifts next time.

231

232
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,100
Thank you, brother-in-law.

233
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:37,770
I'm glad you like it.

234
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,380
Try it. See if it fits.

235
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,300
Since you became the boss,

236
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,540
you must be more tired.

237
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,490
You look much slimer.

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,320
It's my duty as a man.

239

We're right in the middle of business recently.

240

When will you set up an office

241

242
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,290

243

That's great.

245
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,280

Why didn't you tell me?

251
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,600

00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,100
What?

350
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,910
Here's the milk.

351
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,360
Mom, just give it to me.

352
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,150
Milk. Yibo.

353
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,200
Don't play too late.

354
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:42,960
Okay.

355
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,950
What's wrong? What are you looking at?

356
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,370
Nothing.

357
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,900
Sleep early.

358
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,570
Good night.

359
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,600
Xu Guangxi, we are working on the boss.

360
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,430
What are you doing?

361
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,720
What's wrong with you today?

362
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,050
You're absent-minded.

363
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,400
I've played this round.

364
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,160
It's not fun.

365
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,820
And you still asked me to play with you in that case?

366
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,430
If you are not interested,

367
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,620
I'm not playing either. I'm going to sleep.

368
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,890
It's early.

369
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,750
You're going to sleep

370
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,420
before your sister comes back.

371
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,660
Are you young?

372
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,890
My sister may not come back

373
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,680
tonight.

374
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,490
Why?

375
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,610
Li Zelin

376
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,330
picked her up early in the morning.

377
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,950
There's no reason for her come back.

378
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,610
But honestly,

379
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,400
after my sister gets married,

380
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,600
she'll give me her room.

381
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,640
As my brother,

382
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,450
I'll give

383
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,290
my little attic to you.

384
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:39,850
What do you think?

385
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,650
Am I nice?

386
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,010
Why are you silent?

387
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,650
I'll give you my room.

388
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,350
Why aren't you saying anything?

389
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,160
What's on your mind?

390
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,040
Don't vent your anger on the game.

391
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,060
Tell me. What's wrong?

392
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,010
Work?

393
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,680
Relationship?

394
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,370
It's relationship.

395
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:03,930
Tell me.

396
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,740
Are you in a relationship?

397
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,170
You are trapped in love. How's it?

398
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,240
Are you dating?

399
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,940
What are you talking about?

400
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,240
Well, you're in a relationship.

401
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,710
What does she do?

402
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,580
How old is she?

403
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,990
32.

404
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,000
Thir...

405
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,330
Xu Guangxi.

406
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,380
You're quite trendy.

407
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,450
Is dating with elder girls

408
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,560
popular now?

409
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,430
32.

410
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,930
She's almost as old as

411
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,750
my sister.

412
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,550
What if you're dating my sister?

413
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,200
Are you crazy?

414
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,450
Are you taking care of her?

415
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,360
Or is she taking care of you?

416
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,740
Why don't you find someone...

417
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,610
I'm leaving.

418
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,360
Don't worry.

419
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,730
I won't tell Aunt Lan.

420
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,290
You must

421
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,160
tell me next time.

422
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,270
Maybe I know her.

423
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,230
Let me check for you.

424
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,210
Okay, I'll be back soon.

425
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,550
Where's Yike?

426
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,400
You are waiting for her too.

427
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,030
Right?

428
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,360
Looks like

429
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,320
she won't be back today.

430
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,240
♫The sky is sapphire♫

431
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,170

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,640
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

453
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,210
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

454
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,050
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

455
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,190
Zelin.

456
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,020
You've done so much.

457
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,130
Have you ever thought that I would reject you?

458
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,380
Yike, what's wrong?

459
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,170
My colleagues

460
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,520
and leaders are here.

461
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,040
I specially prepared this for you.

462
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,470
I'm sorry.

463
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,010
I can't marry you.

464
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,680
Miss,

465
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,070
where are you going?

466
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,000
Hongye Community. Thank you.

467
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,400
Why are you here on the weekend?

468
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,530
I remember I left the dream bed

469
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,090
with you.

470
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,800
Is it still there?

471
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,640
Dream bed?

472
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,900
Change your shoes.

473
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,470
I'm speechless.

474
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,340
How old is this antique?

475
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,410
Why did you have to take it out?

476
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,540
I didn't expect

477
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,660
it is still here.

478
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,890
It's your dream bed.

479
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,240
You once said

480
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,150
you wanted to build a love nest with Li Zelin.

481
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,930
And asked me to buy this with you.

482
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,480
But he just

483
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,040
went to Beijing

484
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,840
for his luxurious bed.

485
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,770
He proposed to me.

486
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,490
This's your reaction?

487
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,330
You came to me.

488
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,670
Isn't the answer obvious?

489
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,540
He booked a big cinema

490
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,770
and invited his friends

491
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,920
and his colleagues.

492
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,770
It is

493
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,170
quite Li Zelin's style.

494
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,690
I can imagine

495
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,570
what he said to his colleagues.

496
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,480
Look, I, Li Zelin,

497
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,530
could marry such a beautiful

498
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,750
girl from Shanghai.

499
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,310
How great I am!

500
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,810
How amazing I am! How excellent I am!

501
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,440
But what does it have to do with you?

502
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,000
He is proposing to you. What about your family?

503
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,430
Where are your friends?

504
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,800
He deserves to be rejected.

505
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,340
He even bought a ticket to Beijing

506
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,910
He wants to take me there.

507
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,260
That's why people say

508
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,450
lawyers are good at scheming.

509
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,240
You flied to Beijing for three years,

510
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,860
and he wants to pay off by one ticket.

511
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,470
Amazing.

512
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,640
So,

513
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,730
I don't know why.

514
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,510
In my mind,

515
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,380
I just had one thought.

516
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,840
I just wanted to run away.

517
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,280
Good job.

518
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,340
He probably didn't expect

519
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,450
you would reject him.

520
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,020
Don't you think I've gone too far?

521
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,080
After all, we've been together for four years.

522
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,970
What are you talking about?

523
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,150
It's not too much.

524
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,770
Listen,

525
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,880
don't deny yourself.

526
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,130
For those efforts in the past,

527
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,650
take them as gifts from time.

528
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,030
Just accept it.

529
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,930
Besides,

530
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,830
if you really die alone,

531
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,900
I'll be with you.

532
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,890
Who will die alone?

533
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,560
Maybe you will

534
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,640
leave with some young boys

535
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,420
and leave me behind.

536
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,330
Do I

537
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,960
value men more than friendship?

538
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,210
Maybe sometimes.

539
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,510
Besides,

540
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,360
can't get up after falling.

541
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,120
That's not

542
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,420
Yin Yike's style.

543
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,850
Come on.

544
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,200
Congratulations to Yin Yike

545
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,940
for your glorious graduation from Love School.

546
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,010
Let's sail someday.

547
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,770
Don't drink too much.

548
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,760
We have to work tomorrow.

549
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,330
It's okay.

550
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,920
♫Oh, let me knock♫

551
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,830

Hello, Miss Yin.

565
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,840
I'm Li Zelin.

566
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,130
Hello.

567
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,530
My boss is

568
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,200
the legal adviser of your company.

569
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,290
If anything goes wrong in the future,

570
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,530
I can help right the first time.

571
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,560
Thank you.

572
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,500
Thank you

573
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,310
for encouraging me.

574
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,200
I think Shanghai

575
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,780
is extraordinary.

576
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,160
As long as you work hard,

577
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,540
you can get opportunities and achievements.

578
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,330
Congratulations.

579
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,730
I think girls in Shanghai

580
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,920
are also very good.

581
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,600
Yike.

582
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,890
My boss decided to go to Beijing

583
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,680
and set up a branch.

584
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,100
He specifically asked me to go with him.

585
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:02,930
Really?

586
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:03,900
I think this is

587
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,650
a great opportunity.

588
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,750
If I succeed,

589
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,800
I'll be the hero.

590
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,970
It must be because of

591
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,560
your excellent works

592
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,620
in previous cases.

593
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,600
The boss values you.

594
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,400
But I have to leave you

595
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,170
here alone.

596
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,690
Don't worry.

597
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,250
It is only temporary.

598
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,240
I promise to finish the task as soon as possible

599
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,380
and come back in glory.

600
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,540
Hello?

601
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,990
Hello, Yike.

602
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,910
I'm about to be a partner.

603
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,290
You know what,

604
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,600
Beijing's working environment

605
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,430
is much better than Shanghai.

606
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,250
Hello, I'm almost there.

607
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,180
Have you arrived?

608
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,880
Sorry, Yike.

609
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,090
It's your birthday today,

610
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,880
but I can't go back.

611
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:46,800
My boss asked me

612
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,850
to accompany an important client.

613
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,370
But I bought you a gift.

614
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,240
It's on the way.

615
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,850
Don't be angry. Next year.

616
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,090
I will go back to accompany you next year.

617
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,800
I'm sorry.

618
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,100
I can't marry you.

619
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,400
Mr. Li, why are you here so early?

620
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,010
You didn't sleep last night, did you?

621
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,590
How about I make you another cup of coffee?

622
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,740
Postpone my schedule to Beijing.

623
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,520
But there are several cases...

624
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,120
Okay, I got it.

625
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,900
You okay?

626
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,540
I told you to stop me

627
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,470
from drinking too much last night.

628
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,340
Why did you just let me drink so much?

629
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,400
Well, get another round later?

630
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,790
No, no, no.

631
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,790
I can't.

632
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,880
Guangxi's sister?

633
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,090
It's really you. What a coincidence.

634
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,870
Are you sick again?

635
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,310
I'm fine.

636
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,830
Miss, we met before.

637
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,970
Have you forgotten?

638
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,120
It was right here last time.

639
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,330
Your motor and

640
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,140
my car almost crashed into each other.

641
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,980
If it weren't for my good skills,

642
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,640
and and I have stopped just in time,

643
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,600
you would have to pay the bill.

644
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,430
Was that you?

645
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,950
Why did I remember he was an old man?

646
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,690
How dare you call me that?

647
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,130
I am just a young brother.

648
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,450
You?

649
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,290
How could you say you're young in this outfit?

650
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,760
Do me a favor. He's Guangxi's boss.

651
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,490
We're leaving.

652
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,330
See you next time.

653
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,040
Okay. Okay.

654
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,380
-Go ahead.
-Bye. Bye.

655
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,140
Have a good day.

656
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,900
I'm doing your favor today.

657
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,670
Wait, wait, wait.

658
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,720
What a coincidence.

659
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,390
Squeeze a little.

660
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,760
What a coincidence.

661
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,870
My company is two floors

662
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,650
above your company.

663
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,360
We can have

664
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,360
a blind date sometimes, right?

665
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,100
We have many

666
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,330
excellent and single men in our company.

667
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,400
Don't you

668
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,600
come to work at ten?

669
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,120
Why are you here so early?

670
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,530
We just started our business.

671
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,850
The boss has to

672
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,940
work harder than the employees.

673
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,440
Right?

674
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,640
To set a good example.

675
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:37,440
Besides,

676
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,120
if I didn't get up early,

677
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,080
I wouldn't be so lucky

678
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,020
to meet you two.

679
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,220
Are you sure you didn't get up early

680
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,330
because you're old?

681
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,450
No, that's not true.

682
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,790
I always follow a regular schedule.

683
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,750
No later than 11 p.m.,

684
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,780
I must be on the bed.

685
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,370
For your heart, spleen, and kidney

686
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,190
to detox,

687
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,230
it plays a very important role.

688
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:52,840
Yike.

689
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,770
Did you smell

690
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,970
any strange smell?

691
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,950
Strange smell?

692
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,380
Mine?

693
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
No, it's just...

694
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,630
Let's go.

695
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,429
Work hard.

696
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,320
Come on.

697
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,920
What did you smell?

698
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,630
Father's smell.

699
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,570
He's so talkative.

700
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,219
I just want him to shut up.

701
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,250
According to the core market positioning

702
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,730
of SC Fragrance

703
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,120
and Chen Zicheng's

704
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,040
core target customers,

705
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,560
I made the following analysis.

706
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,840
The final purpose of

707
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,560
cooperating with Chen Zicheng

708
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,050
is to realize the diffusible

709
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,489
circle pattern of content.

710
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:43,830
[Li Zelin]

711
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,060
By means of online and offline

712
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,480
advertising strategies,

713
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,420
we will deepen the concept of new products

714
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,170
into every consumer's

715
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,550
social environment.

716
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,280
Are you okay?

717
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,690
I'm fine.

718
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,110
Our target customers have comparatively higher education

719
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,300
and income level.

720
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,910
They all have bachelor degrees

721
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,460
or above.

722
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,610
I have an important

723
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,570
product meeting tonight.

724
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,330
I'll let our Miss Yin

725
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,650
to follow.

726
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,350
What do you think?

727
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,390
Ok, let's work well together.

728
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,440
I made an appointment

729
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,270
with Chen Zicheng's agent.

730
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,940
6 p.m. In the hotel lobby.

731
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,600
You need to work out

732
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,260
the project in the daytime

733
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,360
and bring it over tonight

734
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,020
to communicate with them

735
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,960
all the details of the shooting.

736
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,310
Okay, got it.

737
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,880
I'll deal with it now.

738
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,100
Yike.

739
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,800
Do you

740
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,880
have something on your mind lately?

741
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,410
I saw that you were not in a good mood

742
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,170
in the meeting today.

743
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,640
It's about your relationship?

744
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,470
Li Zelin and I

745
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,960
are like this.

746
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,440
Since you had

747
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,420
made your choice,

748
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,750
what are you sad about?

749
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,090
I just don't understand

750
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,780
how could he and I

751
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,640
end up like this?

752
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,000
I think I'm a failure.

753
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,780
Do you think you've changed

754
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,740
or he has changed?

755
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,120
I don't know.

756
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,970
Maybe we were

757
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,320
what we are now.

758
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,790
But time

759
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,290
gradually

760
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,560
expose our true self.

761
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,210
Let me ask you one more question.

762
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,330
This is also

763
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,390
an actual question for me.

764
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,480
For example,

765
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,230
you don't want a child at all.

766
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,530
But everyone around you

767
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,470
are pushing you.

768
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,740
Are you confident you can handle it?

769
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,710
Maybe.

770
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,920
Are you confident

771
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,950
he'll handle it for you?

772
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,660
Thank you, Zheng Ying.

773
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,960
Good luck.

774
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,050
It's no big deal.

775
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,410
Ms. Zheng, this file

776
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,400
needs your sign.

777
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,420
Why did you come in without knocking?

778
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,560
Can't you see we're talking?

779
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,830
Get out.

780
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,200
Mr. Kong's men all act like this.

781
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,950
What's the big deal?

782
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,790
Taking advantage of her seniority.

783
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,200
One Americano without ice.

784
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,730
Okay, wait a moment.

785
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,810
Let me tell you.

786
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,810
My ex-girlfriend

787
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,760
posted on Moments yesterday.

788
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,160
I'm telling you.

789
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,040
Can you be careful?

790
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,490
Guangxi.

791
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,100
Guangxi.

792
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,680
What?

793
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,110
I'm in love again.

794
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,690
I have a feeling.

795
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,320
This is definitely my true love.

796
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,590
We can't take any risks.

797
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,800
True love?

798
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,360
Then you have to do something.

799
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,690
Got it.

800
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,260
I'll buy you coffee these days.

801
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,710
Miss, are you alone?

802
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,880
I want to buy...buy...

803
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,450
He...He wants to buy you coffee.

804
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,170
Are you from

805
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,160
the movie company upstairs?

806
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,260
We met in the elevator.

807
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,390
Yes.

808
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,290
That's

809
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,600
a big animation movie company.

810
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:25,850
Here's the thing.

811
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,890
A Japanese restaurant

812
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,040
just opened nearby.

813
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,000
There's a discount for a four-person set.

814
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,540
But we don't have enough people, so...

815
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,080
I like Japanese food very much.

816
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,860
How about we add each other on WeChat?

817
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,920
You can ask me out then.

818
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,950
Me too. Me too.

819
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,110
Come on.

820
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,730
Actually, we are destined to meet.

821
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,290
-My friend's sister, Yin Yike,
-Xu Guangxi.

822
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,650
works in the same company as you.

823
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,680
Yin Yike? I see.

824
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,350
What happened to my sister?

825
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,290
Nothing.

826
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,870
That's your sister.

827
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,420
What a coincidence!

828
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,940
The world is so small.

829
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,580
Miss,

830
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,450
let's make an appointment

831
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,760
and have fun.

832
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,130
Sure.

833
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,030
Take a seat. We could discuss it.

834
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,830
Don't you have something to do?

835
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
I've got something to do. Yes.

836
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,660
Yes.

837
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,010
I forgot. I have to go.

838
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,810
He's busy. He's busy.

839
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,470
Miss, have a seat.

840
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,310
Your eyes look empty,

841
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,050
but they are actually foggy.

842
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,550
You must be a person of depth.

843
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,040
You are in such a good shape.

844
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,680
You must have exercised a lot.

845
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,850
Yin Yike is Xu Guangxi's sister.

846
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,050
Why is one surnamed Yin

847
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,290
and the other Xu?

848
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,320
It's too complicated.

849
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,780
Elder sister's stepmother

850
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,890
is younger brother's biological mother.

851
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:45,870
Younger brother's biological mother

852
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,020
is elder sister's stepmother.

853
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,430
Isn't that dramatic?

854
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,840
So they are biologically unrelated.

855
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,040
Chen Zicheng

856
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,270
should have been in the crew for drama shooting.

857
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:53,780
How about this?

858
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,910
Make plans for all possible cases.

859
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,120
Okay, just in case.

860
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,530
Keep in touch when you get there.

861
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,660
Okay, bye.

862
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,320
Yike.

863
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,520
I've been calling you all day.

864
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,000
Sorry, I've been busy today.

865
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,040
Let's have a meal and talk.

866
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,750
My company is shooting an advertisement in two days.

867
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,370
I have an appointment

868
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,920
with the star's agent to discuss the details.

869
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,560
Can we make an appointment later?

870
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,350
When we had fights before, you said I didn't take things seriously

871
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,540
and didn't communicate with you.

872
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,890
Let's sit down and talk.

873
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:21,930
I want to know

874
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,220
what you're thinking.

875
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,500
Let's meet another day.

876
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,480
I'm really busy today.

877
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,840
Are you running away?

878
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,750
Let's meet another day. I promise.

879
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,510
Yin Yike, you'd better think it through.

880
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,300
I don't care why.

881
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,170
I'll count to three.

882
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,770
If you don't let go,

883
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,710
I'll call the police and tell them

884
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,210
someone is harassing women in public.

885
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,710
♫Travels to the end♫

886
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:52,660

897
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,990
♫Hate to calculate the distance between you♫

898
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,470
♫I fear I cannot see you in the next second♫

899
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,600
♫My heart is protesting♫

900
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,400
♫I just feel it too♫

901
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,150
♫It's like the coffee with full caramel milk foam♫

902
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:12,340
♫The air has the fragrance of missing you♫
