there is also a quiet place.

This is a quiet place.

It's sunrise. Make a wish.

You believe that making a wish can work?

I don't even make birthday wishes.

25

Just make a wish first.

and asked the company to give you an explanation.

65
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,860
Ms. Zheng,

66
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,310
this is not what I meant.

67
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,110
You've been with me for so many years.

68
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,090
From what I know about you,

69
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,750
I know

70
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,840
you didn't mean it.

71
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,140
Frank is very angry now.

Kong Xianzhe

73
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,940
kept making things worse

74
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,300
and stirred up trouble.

75
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,900
This happened because of me.

76
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,160
I will take full responsibility.

77
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,700
I'll go and

78
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,230
explain to Frank right now.

79
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,570
No hurry.

80
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,600
I've explained

81
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,740
to Frank for you.

82
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,610
I applied to the company

83
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,420
for a new department.

84
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,140
Next,

85
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,220
the company is planning

86
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,320
to transfer the sales channels

87
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,380
to the live stream.

88
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,909
You should lead the charge.

89
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,020
It'll be an important battlefield

90
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,440
for our development in the future.

91
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,060
It'll also be the most

92
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,240

capable of managing

96
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,690
a new department.

97
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,680
If you do well,

98
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,740
it'll be very helpful

99
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,870
for your promotion.

100
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,690

come to me anytime.

102

Thank you, Ms. Zheng.

103
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,700
Yike.

104
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,750
Come in.

105
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,770
I was about to call you.

106
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:32,980
How is it?

107
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,080
With my influence,

108
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,549
they don't dare to bully you anymore, right?

109
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,020
Retract the lawyer's letter.

110
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,679
Retract it?

111
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,010
Are you kidding me?

112
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,559
They have

113
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,500
oppressed you like this.

114
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,700
Look at your company.

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,650
What did they do?

116
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,660
What if it were you?

117
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,900
Should I also send a lawyer's letter

118
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,500
to warn them without

119
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,380
asking about your situation first?

120
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,150
Why do you always

121
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,410
make decisions for me?

122
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,260
Yike.

123
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,490
The reason why

124
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,930
I did this is that

125
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,300
I care about you and want to protect you.

126
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,520
If there's

127
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,720
anything inappropriate,

128
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
I think that's the difference

129
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,530
in thinking between men and women.

130
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,480
I don't want you

131
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,560
to get hurt.

132
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,260
I couldn't care that much.

133
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,640
Zelin, it's not like that.

134
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,670
This is not...

135
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,640
Alright, Yike.

136
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,310
I've asked you go to Beijing. I know

137
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,840
you have to sacrifice a lot.

138
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,170
But it doesn't matter.

139
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,360
You can find another job

140
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,560
and make new friends.

141
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,970
You can also take

142
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,300
your family to Beijing.

143
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,170
I know

144
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,220
sometimes girls

145
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,280
feel insecure.

146
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,660
How about this?

147
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,270
After we get to Beijing,

148
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,130
I'll add your name

149
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,740
to the property ownership certificate.

150
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,870
Will you stay for me?

151
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,760
Yin Yike.

152
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,950
We are adults.

153
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,130
I admit

154
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,820
it was my fault.

155
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,420
I shouldn't have left you

156
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,150
alone there.

157
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,780
But have you ever considered me?

158
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,300
I'm a lawyer.

159
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:02,860
I...

160
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,700
I've just got promoted to partner.

161
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,100
At this critical moment,

162
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,020
am I wrong to be careful?

163
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,370
I'm doing this so that we can

164
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,740
live a better life in the future.

165
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,800
Do you understand?

166
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,770
Yes, I do.

167
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,350
I've never been

168
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,620
your first concern.

169
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,700
I don't think

170
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,430
we are suitable for each other.

171
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,020
All these years,

172
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,270
you've always given me what you think is good,

173
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,210
but you never know

174
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,260
what I want.

175
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,640
Zelin.

176
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,310
Many problems are accumulated day by day.

177
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,980
If too much disappointment is accumulated for me,

178
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,180
I really can't see hope.

179
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,670
I think

180
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,910
it's time for us

181
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,260
to say goodbye decently

182
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,860
and move forward respectively.

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,040
If you walk out of this room,

185
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,640
it'll be over between us.

186
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,380
I only

187
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,330
say it once.

Does it smell good?

198
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,300
I took it to take a shower.

199
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,660
How did you eat your food?

200
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,670
The corner of your mouth is dirty.

202
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,840
It's sweet.

203
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,940
It's like I'm back to my childhood.

204
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,020
It's really comforting

205
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,880
to eat ice cream

206
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,470
when one is in a bad mood.

207
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,290
What's wrong?

208
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,330
Does the lawyer's letter have a big influence

209
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,060
on your work?

210
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,780
You know everything?

211
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,030
It has spread among the neighborhood.

212
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,640
I went to see you, too.

213
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,690
But I didn't know

214
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,750
where you had gone.

215
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,070
Nor did I know

216
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,920
if you were in a good mood.

217
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,630
So I came here to see

218
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,000
if I could meet you.

219
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:02,810
I'm fine.

220
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,940
I just want to go back to my former position.

221
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,340
It may take some time.

222
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,730
But I've figured it out.

223
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,040
Take it as a restart button

224
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,500
and start over completely.

225
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,390
I broke up with Li Zelin.

226
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,680
I thought

227
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,630
breaking up would make me

228
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,540
feel very painful.

229
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,470
Now I may

230
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,510
still need some time

231
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,920
to get over it,

232
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,420
but the moment I told him,

233
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,040
I felt much relieved instead.

234
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,770
There are many sceneries on the road.

235
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,930
For example,

236
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,260
the sun that is about to set,

237
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,440
or

238
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,000
the night breeze that blows through the leaves.

239
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,640
Aren't you a comic artist?

240
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,050
I didn't expect your literary

241
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,650
attainments to be this good.

242
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,020

Even Xu Guangxi is so busy.

Aunt Lan asks him to...

255
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,660
Xu Guangxi is amazing.

256
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,900
He has just come back from abroad.

257
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,690
Guangxi.

258
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,310
Guang...

259
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,510
You... You...

260
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:11,510
Who are you?

261
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,390
You...

262
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,040
Sir.

263
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,260
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,260
I didn't know you're

265
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,550
Guangxi's elder brother.

266
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,950
I didn't mean it.

267
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
Don't call me brother.

268
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,010
You sound like an old hen laying eggs.

269
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,260
I know you didn't mean it.

270
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,720
If you did, I would have...

271
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,650
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,080
How about this?

273
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,100
I'll treat you to dinner.

274
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,700
Take it as my apology.

275
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,310
OK?

276
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,740
You can order whatever you want.

277
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,390
I'm not short of money.

278
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,070
Who are you?

279
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,500
On what ground can you treat me to dinner?

280
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,380
You kept calling

281
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,310
Guangxi's name.

282
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,210
Are you

283
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,160
his girlfriend?

284
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,690
Well,

285
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,720
if you think so,

286
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,170
that's not wrong.

287
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,990
Guangxi is amazing.

288
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,460
He has just come back from abroad,

289
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,980
and he is raising a girlfriend now.

290
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,510
What do you mean by raising?

291
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,220
I'm a career woman.

292
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,960
OK?

293
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,480
Do you know Little Xiaomian,

294
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,010
who is very popular online?

295
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,360
I don't know.

296
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,500
Then you must have heard

297
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,360
about Chen Zicheng's scandal

298
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,160
which was exposed a few days ago.

299
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,410
Yes. I heard about it.

300
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,500
I heard about it.

301
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,140
Are you saying

302
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,780
you're Chen Zicheng's

303
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,310
girlfriend in the scandal?

304
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,540
Haven't you just said

305
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,400
you're Xu Guangxi's girlfriend?

306
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,620
You... You...

307
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,450
What are you thinking about?

308
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,840
I mean

309
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,590
I exposed the information

310
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,120
about his girlfriend.

311
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,490
So you did it?

312
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,740
Xu Guangxi.

313
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,730
Xu Guangxi.

314
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,240
Wait.

315
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,220
Yin Yibo, what’s wrong with you?

316
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,890
What’s wrong?

317
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,570
Ask him what's wrong with his girlfriend.

318
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,290
Sister, let me tell you.

319
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,330
He told me a few days ago that

320
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,650
the woman he likes is in her thirties.

321
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,220
Is your girlfriend over 18 yet?

322
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,930
The scandal which is spreading all over the Internet now

323
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,490
was posted

324
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,550
by his girlfriend.

325
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,910
Wait.

326
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,450
Make it clear first.

327
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,980
Who posted my information online?

328
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,630
It's he

329
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,250
and a woman who he lives with.

330
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,670
Live with me?

331
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,020
Yes.

332
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,510
A woman?

333
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,510
Yes.

334
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,500
The girl who keeps calling

335
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,570
you Guangxi affectionately.

336
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,950
You mean Xia Xiaomian?

337
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,130
I don't care what her name is.

338
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,460
As she has bullied my sister,

339
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,340
I must hold her

340
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,170
responsible for this.

341
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,220
Don't be angry.

342
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,550
I didn't mean to do that.

343
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,910
It's OK. I understand.

344
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,870
Yin Yibo, stand over there.

345
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,040
Why?

346
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,420
Who hit him just now?

347
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,790
Stand over there.

348
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,500
But sister,

349
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,240
I'm on your side.

350
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,950
Explain it.

351
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,040
What happened?

352
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,930
Well...

353
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,010
Ma'am,

354
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,360
I'll delete

355
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,500
your personal information. Okay?

356
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,130
Sorry.

357
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,050
You

358
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,580
didn't know Yike.

359
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,650
Why did you have

360
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,180
her personal information?

361
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,540
My friend gave it to me.

362
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,350
Which friend?

363
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,830
The boss

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,540
you once mentioned?

365
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,350
Of course not.

366
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,040
That boss was talking about fans.

367
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,340
Fans are people who we rely on for living.

368
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,580
So...

369
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,300
Enough.

370
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,340
The logic of your words doesn't make sense.

371
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,340
Tell me the truth.

372
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,400
I won't say it.

373
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,660
Whatever I say

374
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,380
will be evidence in court.

375
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,490
You can't force me.

376
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,650
I won't say anymore.

377
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,780
Evidence in court.

378
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,300
Xia Xiaomian.

379
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,100
I really need to

380
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,900
explain it to you,

381
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,980
you legal illiterate.

382
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,610
First,

383
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,940
exposing others' privacy

384
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,430
relates to others' right of reputation,

385
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,350
and right of privacy.

386
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,220
According to the seriousness of the case,

387
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,230
it might break the law.

388
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,160
If it's serious,

389
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,320
you'll go to jail.

390
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,150
Understand?

391
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,170
Someone found me.

392
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,810
Louder.

393
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,580
He asked me

394
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,870
to expose that Chen Zicheng's

395
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,820
girlfriend is the marketing manager

396
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,000
of the Fragrance Department of SC.

397
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,130
He also talked about

398
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,120
giving my sister's company information.

399
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,300
He said I could get money and increase the number of fans

400
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,100
if it was exposed.

401
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,160
Who is this person?

402
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,860
Is it a man or a woman? How old is this person?

403
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,910
I don't know.

404
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,730
You don't know?

405
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,060
How did you contact him?

406
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,540
Say it!

407
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,940
I really don't know.

408
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,030
Ma'am.

409
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,140
Trust me.

410
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,740
I swear.

411
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,900
I swear with my beauty

412
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,930
I don't know anything.

413
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,930
If I know, I'll definitely tell you.

414
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,830
Guangxi.

415
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,720
Please help me.

416
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,420
I...

417
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,300
Look.

418
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,060
Although we didn't

419
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,580
become a couple,

420
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,900
we are master and disciple after all.

421
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,730
You can't send me to jail

422
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,870
as soon as you see me.

423
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,340
Right?

424
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,180
Please save me.

425
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,040
How about this?

426
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,270
Contact him

427
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,160
and ask him out.

428
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,360
Okay.

429
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,500
He has blacklisted me.

430
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,720
Xia Xiaomian,

431
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,500
if you can't get in touch with him today,

432
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,660
I'll call the police now.

433
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,300
I'll call him.

434
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,050
I'll call him.

435
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,580
Call him.

436
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,860
Sorry, the phone you're calling

437
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,720
is powered off.

438
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,350
The phone you're calling is powered off.

439
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,460
Sorry, the phone you're calling

440
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,360
is powered off.

441
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
The phone you're calling is powered off.

442
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,290
Hello?

443
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,710
Yes.

444
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,200
It's me, Little Xiaomian.

445
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,200
Well, where should we meet

446
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:55,940
tomorrow?

447
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,280
What?

448
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,110
I... I suddenly can't hear

449
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,870
you clearly.

450
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,510
I'll find a place with good signals

451
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,440
to listen to you.

452
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,100
Yes, yes, yes.

453
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,150
I can't hear you clearly.

454
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,610
Hello?

455
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,150
I'll find a place with good signals.

456
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,250
Hello?

457
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,230
What did you say?

458
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,210
Yike, I didn't do it.

459
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,260
I can't take the blame alone.

460
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,100
Xia Xiaomian!

461
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,900
Forget it.

462
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,850
I think I know who it is.

463
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,270
Sister.

464
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,420
They were just a few

465
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,450
blurry photos,

466
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,660
but I hired an Internet celebrity

467
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,530
to spread the news about Yin Yike,

468
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,500
and also exaggerated the truth.

469
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,050
In order to reduce the influence,

470
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,540
the company has no choice but to punish her.

471
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,270
Did you leave any trace behind?

472
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,480
Don't worry.

473
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,290
The document is fake.

474
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,660
So is the account.

475
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,700
Even the IP address is fake, too.

476
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,460
After I blacklisted her,

477
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,590
nothing can be investigated.

478
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,600
You did it with little effort.

479
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,130
Good job.

480
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,120
Mr. Kong.

481
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,010
Then I...

482
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,610
About my promotion...

483
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,100
No hurry.

484
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,460
Let's defer it for now.

485
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,820
When the time is right,

486
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,820
I'll suggest

487
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,020
promoting you.

488
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,980
Mr. Kong, we are in the company.

489
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,240
There are so many people outside.

490
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,980
I'll get you some more water.

491
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,570
Time was short, and the task was both heavy and difficult.

492
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,820
But under the leadership

493
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,500
of Frank, Ms. Zheng and Mr. Kong,

494
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
and with our co-workers'

495
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,900
efforts made through day and night,

496
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,880
we got

497
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,930
the top search positions of various popular platforms,

498
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,690
covering offline channels, subway, commercial buildings,

499
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,540
and core areas.

500
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
We also clarified

501
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,970
the advertisement and the video,

502
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,530
helping Chen Zicheng

503
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,170
increase the number of his fans again.

504
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,500
The sales volume is higher than expected.

505
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,580
From now on, Jiang Man

506
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,220
will be in charge of the Marketing Department.

507
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,470
Ms. Jiang will be in charge.

508
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,590
Thank you.

509
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,860
So she has to leave like this?

510
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,580
She has worked in the company for so many years,

511
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,310
but she is abandoned like this.

512
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,620
In the workplace,

513
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,470
you'll lose if you're sincere.

514
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,610
Yike.

515
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,480
Yike.

516
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,310
Yike.

517
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:36,990
Let me do it.

518
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,600
Yike.

519
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,700
Are you really going to

520
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,360
that totally new department?

521
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,300
We've posted the clarification video,

522
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,700
and they've withdrawn the lawsuit.

523
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,670
Besides, the sales volume of

524
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,190
our new products is so good.

525
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,100
How can they burn the bridge after crossing it?

526
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,660
Right.

527
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,100
Look how complacent they are.

528
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,940
What's your plan?

529
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,020
Should we strike back with violence

530
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,970
or counterattack with a strategy?

531
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,810
It's up to you.

532
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,790
These two documents

533
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,160
are handed over to you.

534
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,150
Work hard.

535
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,500
Don't embarrass me.

536
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,570
Yike.

537
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,380
Yike.

538
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,900
It looks like you have a lot of stuff.

539
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,370
Do you need help?

540
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,520
No, thanks.

541
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,250
Your most capable teammate has left.

542
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,060
I'm afraid it's hard to slack off again.

543
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,900
It seems the space of the Marketing Department isn't enough.

544
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,910
Would you consider making

545
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,120
some space for us?

546
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,220
The capital has been tight recently.

547
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,480
It's your treat today.

548
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,540
What would you like to drink?

549
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,670
Americano or latte?

550
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,840
Americano.

551
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,540
Hello.

552
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,860
Make me another 20 cups of latte.

553
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,990
Put it on my account.

554
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,850
Xiaoman,

555
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,310
you're so generous.

556
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,300
You're all tired. I should do this.

557
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:45,890
Guangxi.

558
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,070
Isn't that my eternal idol?

559
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,310
She has a beautiful smile,

560
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,270
like the flowers in spring.

561
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,380
She's looking at us.

562
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,800
She's looking at us.

563
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,800
She's coming.

564
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,600
Guangxi, I'll buy you coffee.

565
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,180
Sorry, miss.

566
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,420
Guangxi, coffee.

567
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,860
What's the occasion today?

568
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,090
Why do you buy us coffee?

569
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,020
Today is Xiaoman's promotion day.

570
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,240
Then it's a good day.

571
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,250
Xiaoman gets promoted with the fastest speed

572
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,910
in our marketing department.

573
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,380
This time, she defeated

574
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,420
the former

575
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,780
Manager Yin directly.

576
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,980
Actually, I don't want

577
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,140
to let Yike go.

578
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,550
But this is the company's decision.

579
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,340
None of us can do anything about it.

580
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,780
Today is a good day.

581
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,520
-We need to celebrate it. -Guangxi.

582
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,320
Miss,

583
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,150
look.

584
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,060
These are some of the best

585
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,260
restaurants in Shanghai

586
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,140
I've marked recently.

587
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,820
You choose one.

588
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,930
My treat. I'll pay.

589
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,730
This one.

590
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,060
You have a good taste.

591
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,740
I've marked several ones,

592
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,770
but I haven't decided which one to choose.

593
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,020
You could get it done immediately.

594
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,880
Let's eat here.

595
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,660
When will we eat?

596
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,260
Just next, next, next, next

597
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,360
next, next, next, next, next

598
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,960
next week.

599
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,650
Okay, I'll write it down.

600
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,730
Next, next, next, next, next, next, next week.

601
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,810
It's a good day.

602
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,460
Then...

603
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,850
Where is she?

604
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,190
♫Is it rain or sunshine♫

605
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,880
♫In your sky♫

606
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,480
♫Could you let me hear♫

607
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,320
♫What it is on your mind♫

608
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,820
♫Sometimes it stayed awake♫

609
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,560
♫All night♫

610
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,780
♫So you were meant for me♫

611
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,170
♫Forever♫

612
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:31,430
♫Silently I seek for answers♫

613
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,700
♫In your eyes♫

614
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,090
♫Oh, let me knock♫

615
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,990
♫Oh, let me knock♫

616
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,440
♫Let go your heart♫

617
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,480
♫Open up your door♫

618
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,580
♫Leave no more♫

619
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,290
♫Stay by your side♫

620
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
♫Dance with you in twilight♫

621
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,940
♫It is time♫

622
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,210
♫Just once in life♫

623
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,140
♫We all have to♫

624
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,190
♫Take a chance for love♫

625
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,140
♫Give it all♫

626
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,940
♫Stay by my side♫

627
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,230
♫Let me knock on your heart♫

628
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,530
Do you need help?

629
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,140
I was at the entrance

630
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,020
and said I wanted to see Yin Yike,

631
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,220
so they just let me in.

632
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,110
Give me a hand.

633
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,910
Put it there.

634
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,850
What's wrong?

635
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,790
I just moved something for you.

636
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,080
Why are you so touched?

637
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,240
Do you have tissues?

638
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,880
Do you feel insecure because you've been

639
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,270
transferred to a new position?

640
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,660
But maybe this is a good

641
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,990
opportunity to grow up.

642
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,420
Just cry.

643
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,010
I'm the only person here.

644
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,260
I'm allergic to dust.

645
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,980
What?

646
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,020
Allergic to dust?

647
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,270
So these guys

648
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,900
bully you?

649
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,630
Right?

650
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,100
♫I will ask for you♫

651
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,580
Stop flicking the dust.

652
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,260
Get to work.

653
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,390
♫With lemon and soda♫

654
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,250
♫I'll drink it beneath the blue♫

Why did you draw two dolphins?

688
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,860
The symbol of wisdom and happiness.

689
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,500
I wish you success

690

Put the finishing touches to the fish your drew?

694
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,020
Dolphins.

695
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,060
But I don't know how to draw.

696
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,610
I'm afraid...

697
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,610
I'm afraid their eyes will be crooked with my drawing.

698
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,340
The picture you drew today is good.

699
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,300
Why is it raining so heavily?

700
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,420
How about we take a taxi?

701
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,429
Wait for me here.

702
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,650
I'll buy an umbrella.

703
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,719
Thank you.

704
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,540
What took you so long?

705
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,550
Why did you only buy an umbrella?

706
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,460
This is the only one left in the store.

707
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,460
Let's squeeze in.

708

Have you measured

728

many girls' shoulders before?

729
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,230

you have to shoulder so many responsibilities.

I've arrived.

763

I'll give the umbrella to you.

764
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,330
It is said that good things will happen

765
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,790
if you hold a red umbrella.

766

Thank you.

767
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,650
