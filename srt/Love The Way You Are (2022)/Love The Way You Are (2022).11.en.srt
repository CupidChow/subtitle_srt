18
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,990
It's been so many years

19
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,250
and you still eat pancakes like the northerners.

20
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,660
Can't you have some pan-fried buns?

21
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,750
Aunt Lan, why didn't you

22
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,079
wake me up this morning?

23
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,380
You came back so late last night.

24
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,860
I thought

25
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,220
you could use some more sleep today.

26
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,480
Couldn't you have set an alarm yourself?

27

-Leaving. -She's still so careless at her age.

How can she get married like this?

31
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,000
She was on the phone all night last night.

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,460
So noisy

33
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,140
that I couldn't sleep.

34
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,020
She was on the phone in the middle of the night?

35
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,940
With whom?

36
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,579
It must be Zelin.

37
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,430
She was laughing and chatting all along.

38
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,900
There couldn't be so many funny things

39
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,180
if it was business.

40
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,980
Look at them, in different cities.

41
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,290
It's not a good thing

42
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,490
that they can't see each other often.

43
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,370
Think of a way

44

45
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,780
You...

46
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,020
are really stubborn.

47
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,730
She has her own idea.

48
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,950
Besides,

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,420
the phone call wasn't necessarily

50
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,140
with Zelin.

51
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,020
Then who else could she call?

52
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,410
Who?

53
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,100
I'm asking you.

54
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,250
All right.

55
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,190
Have more pancakes, talk less and worry less.

Good morning, auntie.

Hello?

59
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,380
What are you doing?

60
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,980
I'm about to leave.

61
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,260
Where are you?

62
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,170
Are you leaving home?

63
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,830
Let me send you there.

64
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,340
Okay.

65
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,760
See you

66
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,100
downstairs later.

67
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,930
Bye.

68
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,900
Why didn't you call

69
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,900
before you came?

70
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,070
What if I missed you?

71
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,580
I've been calling your phone this morning.

72
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,380
But it was off.

73
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,340
So I thought I'd come straight here.

74
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,659
We were on the phone the whole night

75
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,860
and my phone was dead.

76
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,720
Who is to blame?

77
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,659
It's my fault.

78
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,860
It's my fault indeed.

79
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,540
But did you

80
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,230
come down from home directly?

81
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,470
Are you sure?

82
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,770
What's wrong?

83
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,310
You didn't see everything, did you?

84
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,270
No.

85
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,450
I saw Yin Yike running into the car.

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,060
She almost drove out of the stall,

87
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,860
but she turned back

88
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,370
and ran inside.

89
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,820
Are you so eager to see me?

90
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,340
Are you angry?

91
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,660
You drive.

92
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,600
I'll get even with you if you're late.

93
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,580
If I come to pick you up every day,

94
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,380
can I see this scene over and over again?

95
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,290
Which scene?

96
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,590
The cute scene.

97
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,659
Enough.

98
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,420
What?

99
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,980
Can't versatile Yike

100
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,480
be praised for being cute?

101
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,780
You've gone too far, master.

102
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,780
I think

103
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,740
you're doomed.

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,740
Another woman

105
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,940
has fallen for me.

106
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,580
Put your hands here.

107
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,540
Drive properly.

108
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,020
I like to put my hands here

109
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,540
when I drive.

110
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,290
Eyes on the road.

111
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,500
I don't care.

112
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,380
If I'm late today,

113
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,640
I'll get even with you.

114
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,700
How?

115
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,790
I'm sure you'll love it.

116
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,490
I want to try it.

117
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,500
Isn't it ugly?

118
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,580
This is definitely not okay.

119
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,460
This is too old-fashioned.

120
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,420
-This is so energetic. -Morning. -Do you have a taste?

121
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,880
What are you chatting about?

122
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,800
-Yike. -Yike.

123
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,860
Good morning, Yike.

124
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,340
I'm dwelling on the product selection.

125
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,460
Should we promote

126
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,780
the girls lists

127
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,690
or the middle-aged women lists?

128
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,550
Let me smell it.

129
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,260
I think both of them are good.

130
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,060
Promote both.

131
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:53,940
Yes.

132
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,440
Yike,

133
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,980
choose from the posters.

134
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,540
Look.

135
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,620
This and this.

136
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,620
I think this can be used at night.

137
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,100
The first one is for noon.

138
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,020
They both passed.

139
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,460
Yes, for different ages.

140
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,710
Both passed.

141
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,980
Yike, why are you

142
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,410
in such a good mood today?

143
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,530
I'm in a good mood

144
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,300
because you did a good job.

145
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,100
Thank you, Yike.

146
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,260
Right. And you dress

147
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
very differently today.

148
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,100
Differently?

149
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,830
Is it different?

150
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,770
Your aura is very different.

151
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,500
Really?

152
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,440
So special?

153
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,930
Alright, stop talking nonsense.

154
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,270
Get back to work.

155
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:32,900
Okay.

156

[After work tonight, I'll wait for you downstairs.]

157
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,380
After work tonight,

158
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,040
I'll wait for you downstairs.

159
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,160
Yike,

160
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,460
Ms. Zheng wants you

161
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,540
to meet her in her office later

162
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,740
to talk about the recruitment of live streamers.

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

164
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,240
Okay.

165
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,260
What would you like to drink?

166
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,980
My treat.

167
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,100
Okay. Thank you, Yike.

168
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,030
Okay, thank you.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's weird.

170
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,370
What do you think

171
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,540
is wrong with her lately?

172
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,270
She's been smiling so happily.

173
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,010
Isn't it good to be happy?

174
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,610
You like her with a long face?

175
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,240
That's not what I meant.

176
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,410
Don't you think there's something different

177
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,500
in her smile?

178
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,420
Something.

179
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,780
Shen Xin.

180
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,450
Use your sixth sense of women.

181
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,370
What do you think?

182
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,620
I don't know about my sixth sense,

183
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,180
but my fifth sense tells me

184
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,100
to work hard.

185
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,460
Work hard.

186
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,860
Come in.

187
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,630
Ms. Zheng.

188
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,340
Yike.

189
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,260
The live streamers we hired

190
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,060
are quite differentiated

191
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,210
in style.

192
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,260
As for product selection,

193
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,300
we've also finished it.

194
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,630
It can be aired anytime.

195
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,100
Good job.

196
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,460
Thank you for your hard work.

197
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,380
I can see that you've worked hard lately.

198
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,110
It's my duty.

199
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,340
As for live stream resources,

200
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,030
Frank has

201
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,100
a client of a big live stream platform.

202
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,820
Their live stream is very popular

203
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,180
and has a lot of business support.

204
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,070
I heard that

205
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,860
he'll be on a business trip to Fengxian District tomorrow.

206
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,630
You can go

207
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,030
meet him

208
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,900
and talk to him

209
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,220
to get the cooperation done

210
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,730
so that we can build a solid foundation.

211
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,580
Is it appropriate considering my level?

212
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,860
That's not a big deal.

213
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,860
You are my girl.

214
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,160
You'll be the representative

215
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,090
of the Marketing Department of SC.

216
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,660
Thank you, Ms. Zheng.

217
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,990
I'll complete the task.

218
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,740
Okay.

219
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,080
That's all.

220
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,360
I'm leaving.

221
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,490
Yike.

222
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,760
Has anything good

223
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
happened lately?

224
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,660
You look so good.

225
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,740
New department, new mood.

226
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,940
I want to cheer everyone up.

227
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,500
Good.

228
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,420
Keep it up.

229
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,860
Keep working hard.

230
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,260
Yike.

231
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,060
Hello.

232
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,420
She's been transferred to the Live Stream Department,

233
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,500
but she still comes to our Marketing Department every day.

234
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,970
What's wrong with Yin Yike?

235
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,300
She's so happy even though she got demoted.

236
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,760
Maybe she was born to take the maltreatment.

237
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,270
Alright.

238
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,760
I'll choose this one.

239
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,220
Perfect.

240
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,980
I think it's good enough.

241
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,600
[Yike]

242
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,170
Take this out,

243
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,020
and it will be an ace.

244
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,460
Have you shown it to Dad Chen?

245
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,940
No.

246
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,980
Dad Chen has no time

247
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,860
for this.

248
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,460
He's rejuvenating.

249
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,260
Daydreaming about youth.

250
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,710
He opened

251
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,780
that bottle of perfume again.

252
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,570
No way.

253
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,350
No way.

254
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,580
He still hasn't thrown that thing away.

255
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,180
Exactly.

256
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:52,970
It stinks.

257
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,410
Help!

258
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,500
I can't stay in this company anymore.

259
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,020
Miss Qin, if there's any misunderstanding,

260
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,540
let's solve it in person.

261
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,380
What is it?

262
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,920
Is it that serious?

263
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,420
Miss Qin.

264
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,190
I have something to tell you.

265
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,750
The thing you gave me

266
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,850
has seriously affected

267
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,540
my employees and me.

268
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,340
Do you know

269
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,550
the maintenance fee of our floor

270
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,610
is very expensive.

271
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,030
You're quite cheap.

272
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,700
I thought your company

273
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,470
has a deal of 100 million yuan

274
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,230
or some

275
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,500
illegal underground deal

276
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,780
that needs to be closed in the middle of the night.

277
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,260
It was my fault

278
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,500
that I stood you up last time.

279
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,020
But

280
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,820
I already apologized

281
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,750
to you.

282
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,980
Did you?

283
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,590
Where? I didn't see it.

284
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,550
You blocked me.

285
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,240
Of course you couldn't see it.

286
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,780
Haven't your mom told you that

287
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,890
apology should be done in person,

288
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,180
or it's just rude?

289
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,390
No, you're wrong.

290
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,090
I apologize

291
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,580
because I did something wrong.

292
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,870
If you don't like it,

293
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,940
I can continue to apologize

294
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,510
until you're satisfied.

295
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,420
But you can't take revenge.

296
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,150
It's like

297
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,280
if you were beaten,

298
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,650
you should call the police

299
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,400
-to solve this problem. -Chen Ye.

300
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,360
Do you have to

301
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,580
be so serious about this?

302
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,220
Yes.

303
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
I just don't think

304
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,370
it should be take so seriously.

305
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,130
Don't be too harsh

306
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,420
so that it won't be awkward when we meet again.

307
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,390
No need.

308
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,020
Meaningless socializing is a waste of time.

309
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,110
Besides,

310
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,700
I never date people who hide things.

311
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,260
It's tiring.

312
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,390
You're wrong again.

313
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,930
My apology

314
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,210
is very sincere.

315
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,540
I didn't make up

316
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,980
any excuse to get away from this,

317
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,500
right?

318
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,020
On the contrary,

319
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,150
you should reflect on yourself.

320
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,730
Do you want

321
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,780
my sincere apology,

322
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,580
or do you think

323
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,120
you lost in our relationship,

324
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,130
and you want to win back.

325
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,230
You want revenge.

326
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,980
You want...

327
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,260
Mr. Chen.

328
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,620
Please teach me.

329
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,730
Facing a no-show like you,

330
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,540
how should I...

331
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,540
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

332
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,950
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,780
I'm sorry. I forgot completely.

334
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,900
I forgot. I'm sorry.

335
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,500
I'll be right there.

336
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,740
I'll be right there.

337
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,540
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

338
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,460
See you next time.

339
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,940
No, I...

340
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,300
What the hell!

341
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,940
I've never been scolded like this

342
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,100
in my whole life.

343
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,710
He tried to put sense into me?

344
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,350
Wait and see.

345
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,100
I'll kill you next time.

346
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,100
You are Maruko.

347
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,020
Got it?

348
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,180
Got it.

349
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,350
Yu.

350
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,490
Yu.

351
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,790
What's wrong with you?

352
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,000
He said I don't have a mother.

353
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,050
And he hit me.

354
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,940
It was him.

355
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,620
I'm sorry.

356
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,180
-Sorry we bothered you. -It's okay, Mr. Chen.

357
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,890
He's just a kid.

358
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,350
It happens all the time.

359
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,010
I've educated

360
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,120
both of them.

361
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,620
You don't have to be too harsh

362
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,420
to your child.

363
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,420
Pay more attention to

364
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,660
his mental health.

365
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,260
You're right.

366
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,220
I'll take him home now.

367
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:51,780
Okay.

368
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,380
Go.

369
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,620
Take your bag.

370
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,260
Here.

371
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:58,980
Say goodbye to your teacher.

372
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,750
Goodbye.

373
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,180
Bye.

374
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,310
See you, Ms. Zhang.

375
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,340
What about you?

376
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,020
Don't cry.

377
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,760
Chen, are you angry?

378
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,260
Tell me honestly.

379
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,290
Did you hit him first

380
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,550
or did he hit you first?

381
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,110
It was him.

382
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,850
And it was the third time.

383
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,840
Did you win?

384
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,540
Yes.

385
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,530
Didn't you see

386
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,490
he was crying over there?

387
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,180
Great.

388
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,340
I'm proud of you.

389
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,060
Let's go.

390
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,320
Chen,

391
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,100
are you not mad at me anymore?

392
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,770
It's not right

393
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,920
for kids to fight.

394
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,500
But for a kid who's arrogant

395
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,110
and bullies others,

396
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,460
teaching him a lesson once in a while

397
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,340
is fine by me.

398
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,760
But remember,

399
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,240
no matter what happens,

400
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,260
you can't be the one who hits others first.

401
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,060
Do you hear me?

402
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,950
Of course.

403
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,580
Men never bully the weak.

404
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,670
Why are you so great?

405
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,070
Who did you get that from?

406
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,580
Come on, let's go have some hamburgers.

407
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,740
Hurray!

408
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,820
I want fries too.

409
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,780
I have no money.

410
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,330
Coke.

411
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,520
No money.

412
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,380
Come in.

413
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,319
Your house has good lighting.

414
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,720
Right?

415
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,359
How much did my sister pay you

416
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,869
that you can rent

417
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,829
such a big house?

418
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,150
Yibo.

419
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,060
You must be tired.

420
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,990
Have some water.

421
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,260
Yibo,

422
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,630
I lost my job recently,

423
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,320
and the introduction failed.

424
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,580
You asked me to pull some strings.

425
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,700
I didn't want to help you.

426
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,060
Don't blame me for everything.

427
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,740
But I didn't manage to

428
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,580
pull the strings.

429
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,630
Doesn't that mean

430
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,460
you and your sister are not close enough?

431
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,610
In her heart,

432
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,030
your relationship is not that important.

433
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,740
I'll give my sister

434
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,300
a call.

435
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,630
The interview is over anyway.

436
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,880
The new live streamers

437
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,560
must have gone to work.

438
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,080
I think I'll have to live on air.

439
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,760
There's no clue

440
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,670
about the rent next time.

441
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,140
Right, I wanted to ask you about this.

442
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,860
You don't even

443
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,700
have a job now,

444
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,740
so why did you rent

445
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,100
such a big house?

446
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,490
But it's dangerous for a girl

447
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,300
to stay in a hotel alone.

448
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,060
Besides,

449
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,970
the quality of life must be guaranteed.

450
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,480
Plus, with your help,

451
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,260
I thought it would be a sure thing this time.

452
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,700
Don't blame everything

453
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,860
on me, okay?

454
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,140
Yibo,

455
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,540
I have a good idea.

456
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,100
It can help both of us.

457
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:28,950
Go ahead.

458
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,100
If you move here,

459
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,140
we can split the rent.

460
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,400
What do you want to say?

461
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,820
Think about it.

462
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,330
It's not safe for you

463
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,770
to sneak around and do your business alone at home.

464
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,450
You have to prevent your family from finding out.

465
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,420
But my place is different.

466
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,330
This place

467
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,030
is fully equipped.

468
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,370
Look here.

469
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,850
You can have whatever you want.

470
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,550
So you mean

471
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,330
I should move in

472
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,180
and pay the rent?

473
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,140
Smart.

474
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,020
Xia Xiaomian,

475
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,200
are you trying to trick me again?

476
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,000
I won't buy it.

477
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,860
Bye. Bye.

478
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,820
Are you scared?

479
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,700
Of what?

480
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,890
Are you shy

481
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,970
to share a room with a beauty?

482
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,680
Beauty?

483
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,540
Are you hiding someone else here?

484
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,000
Beauty, come out! Beauty!

485
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,660
Are you blind at such a young age?

486
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,490
I'm such a beauty.

487
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,750
Can't you see me standing in front of you?

488
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,350
Here's the thing.

489
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,240
In my knowledge, what makes a beauty

490
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,700
is first, intelligence,

491
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,260
and second, culture.

492
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,940
Xia Xiaomian,

493
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,890
I don't see you on either side.

494
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,660
What do you mean by intelligence

495
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,790
and culture?

496
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,660
Tell me.

497
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,470
If I'm not a beauty,

498
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,380
who else is a beauty?

499
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,280
No, no, no.

500
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,140
My sister.

501
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,820
Yike.

502
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,630
Xiaomian,

503
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,180
congratulations on being admitted.

504
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,270
But remember,

505
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,260
you are hired on a special application.

506
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,020
What the company loves

507
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,090
is your humorous style

508
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,900
and your experience as a live streamer.

509
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,660
I hope you can

510
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,610
create a unique style

511
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,020
in your own live stream room.

512
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,740
Come on.

513
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,270
Okay.

514
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,010
No problem.

515
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,020
Thank you, Yike.

516
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,500
I will show you

517
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,780
my strength.

518
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,860
See? I told you.

519
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,980
My relationship may be late,

520
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,510
but it will never be absent.

521
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,000
Thank you, Yibo.

522
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,350
I will become

523
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,860
the intelligent and cultured

524
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,340
beauty of yours.

525
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,180
And I'll let you see

526
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
the shining me.

527
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,770
I'm going to

528
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,100
get ready for my new job.

529
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,160
Tonight, Xintiandi.

530
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,930
I'll pass.

531
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,220
20% off.

532
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,980
The proposal is tomorrow, my friend.

533
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,030
Before proposal, you should get refreshed.

534
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,500
Do you think everyone is like you?

535
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,830
Going to a bar the day before the proposal.

536
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,060
Something's wrong with you.

537
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,940
You've been busy lately.

538
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,130
And you came home late.

539
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,540
Are you in

540
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,910
a secret relationship?

541
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,830
You're so imaginative.

542
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,290
You think too much.

543
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,210
Turn around.

544
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,840
Your car is here. Get in.

545
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,830
Alright.

546
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,350
Bye.

547
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,020
Bye.

548
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,570
I'm off work.

549
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,400
I'll wait for you downstairs.

550
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,940
Yiran.

551
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,380
I forgot my lipstick when I went out today.

552
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,540
Do you have a lipstick?

553
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:23,980
Yes.

554
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,380
What? Do you have a date tonight?

555
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,660
No.

556
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,060
I have an important occasion

557
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,660
to attend.

558
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,740
Important occasion.

559
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,020
Let me see.

560
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,170
Let me see.

561
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,500
This one.

562
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,860
Queen red.

563
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,270
I guarantee that after you put it on,

564
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,000
you'll be the queen in the room.

565
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,230
That's too imposing.

566
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,530
Is there any for a low profile?

567
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,330
Low profile?

568
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,390
Let me see.

569
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,120
Low profile.

570
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,590
Low profile.

571
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,140
This one.

572
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,390
Bean paste pink.

573
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,250
Low-key, luxurious and classy.

574
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,100
It's not that grand actually.

575
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,100
Not that grand?

576
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,740
Let me see.

577
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,370
Not that grand.

578
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,940
Not that grand.

579
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,070
Do you have some innocent color?

580
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,420
Yes.

581
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,300
Honey.

582
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,500
If something like this happens again,

583
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,710
don't tell me

584
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,260
it's for a formal occasion.

585
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,140
Just ask me

586
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,900
which lipstick

587
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,130
looks more delicious for men.

588
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,260
What are you thinking?

589
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,160
No.

590
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,330
The one I told you last time

591
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,270
is my friend.

592
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,750
Okay, friend.

593
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,730
I just want to ask for her.

594
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,300
Okay.

595
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,490
Keep the lipstick.

596
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,690
Don't return it to me.

597
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,580
Where are you?

598
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,060
At the intersection?

599
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,380
Why are you there?

600
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,320
I didn't see you at the intersection.

601
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,170
Where are you?

602
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,420
Why did you scare me?

603
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,790
I've waited long.

604
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,150
You've finally finished work.

605
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,680
I have to meet a client tomorrow,

606
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,210
so I worked a little longer.

607
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,250
I'm willing to

608
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,160
lose to Yin Yike's career.

609
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,950
It's late.

610
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,230
Where can we go?

611
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,440
We can go out for a drink.

612
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,540
Can do.

613
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,260
Wait for me.

614
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,370
Hello?

615
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,550
Pie in the sky, again.

616
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,540
Okay, I got it.

617
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,010
So?

618
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,800
It was boss calling,

619
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,400
asking me to modify the plan.

620
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,130
How about we go somewhere else

621
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,010
to drink?

622
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,220
Where?

623
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,340
My company.

624
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,700
Is it appropriate?

625
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,100
There are so many people in your company.

626
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,290
We have a proposal tomorrow.

627
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,290
They all went home to get a good rest.

628
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,310
Looks like it's time

629
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,380
for me to visit your workplace and give you guidance.

630
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,380
Most welcome.

631
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,940
Let's go.

632
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,660
I'll go back to the company to get some snacks.

633
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,720
We'll eat while working extra hours.

634
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,620
Okay.

635
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,180
Don't give me

636
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,310
some sharp advice.

637
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,940
What would you like to drink?

638
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,890
Coke or beer?

639
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,810
♫ In the square or in the elevator♫

640
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,140

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,540
Why are you here?

662
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,700
Guangxi.

663
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,310
I knew you were still here.

664
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,660
My good friend.

665
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,090
Didn't you go on a blind date?

666
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,980
What blind date?

667
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,700
I was stood up.

668
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,460
Here.

669
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,140
Drink with me.

670
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,540
Drink.

671
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,660
Take it.

672
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,100
Open it.

673
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,980
You...

674
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,850
How can I work overtime with you here?

675
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,700
Go wait for me back home.

676
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,290
Why can't you work overtime

677
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,420
with me here?

678
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,740
Why not?

679
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,150
Alright.

680
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,900
I'll stay here with you.

681
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,660
Drink.

682
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,760
I mean

683
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,060
it's uncomfortable for you to be here.

684
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,860
There's a bed at home.

685
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,940
Wait for me at home.

686
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,030
I'm not going home.

687
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,650
I want to stay here with you.

688
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,070
You can't be here.

689
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,970
Why can't I be here?

690
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,030
Why is the door open?

691
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,410
Who is it?

692
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,520
I didn't order takeout.

693
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,140
No.

694
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,020
There won't be anyone

695
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,650
delivering you food at this hour.

696
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,300
There's really someone there.

697
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,500
I heard it.

698
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,140
Listen.

699
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,160
Brother.

700
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,540
Only you can drink with me

701
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,860
at this hour.

702
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,040
My good friend.

703
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,990
Fortunately, I have you, Guangxi.

704
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,500
I suddenly don't want to work overtime today.

705
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,840
Let's go home and drink.

706
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,790
I want water.

707
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,660
Why do you want water again?

708
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,330
Come on, sit down.

709
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,130
Let me get some for you.

710
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,540
I drank too much. My mouth is dry.

711
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,740
Let me pour it for you.

712
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,500
Guangxi.

713
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,410
I've been wanting to ask you.

714
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,460
That day at the restaurant,

715
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,580
the girl that you said you are in love with.

716
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,810
Who is it?

717
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,580
I want to know

718
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,850
what kind of girl

719
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,110
can make my Guangxi

720
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,460
think about her all day.

721
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,820
Drink it.

722
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,420
Is she better than Jiang Jun?

723
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,300
Stop it.

724
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,950
What nonsense are you talking about?

725
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,470
I'm not.

726
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,060
When Jiang Jun got married,

727
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,420
you cried for three days and three nights.

728
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,110
Was I wrong?

729
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,500
Jiang Jun is good.

730
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,940
Now that I think about it,

731
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,260
she's quite pretty.

732
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,700
Yes.

733
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,820
-Pretty. -Yes.

734
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,850
Whatever you say is right.

735
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,910
Dad Chen told us to turn off the lights

736
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,460
to save electricity.

737
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,960
I want to go home.

738
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,340
Wait.

739
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,690
The door is not locked.

740
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,810
Let's go home, Guangxi.

741
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,400
The car is here.

742
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,420
Happy.

743
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,940
You go home first.

744
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,200
Aren't you leaving?

745
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,060
I still have documents to upload.

746
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,390
Did you say that?

747
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,330
What did you say?

748
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,590
You don't want to pay the carfare, do you?

749
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,600
It's enough for you to even go to Hangzhou. Here.

750
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,540
-Bye. -Bye.

751
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,630
Yike.

752
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,900
Yike.

753
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,170
Yike.

754
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,320
Yike.

755
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,560
What's wrong?

756
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,600
Why? Are you angry?

757
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,280
I was just kidding.

758
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,090
Are you really angry?

759
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:01,990
If you are,

760
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,220
I won't buy you Coke.

761
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,480
Then I have to have lunch alone

762
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,940
with Chen Musen tomorrow.

763
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,410
Why did you ask him out for lunch?

764
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,340
And you want to go alone without me?

765
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,620
I want to talk to him

766
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,980
about Jiang Jun.

767
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,060
He exaggerated it just now.

768
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,470
There's nothing between Jiang Jun and me.

769
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,130
The kids back from abroad

770
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,390
are indeed different.

771
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,950
If there's nothing between you,

772
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,740
why would you cry for three days and nights

773
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,020
when she got married?

774
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,860
You're really sentimental.

775
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,530
Well.

776
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,320
When you were in a relationship,

777
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,620
would you only say hello to that person?

778
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,380
Only scumbags

779
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,610
ignore the person they are in love with.

780
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,770
You should be passionate like fire

781
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,500
when you are in a relationship.

782
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,570
Or it's not fair for the other person,

783
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,620
and yourself.

784
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,930
Really?

785
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,810
You must be a love expert.

786
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,950
Young people like you are passionate

787
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,220
in a relationship.

788
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,230
I'm too old to handle it.

789
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,690
Didn't you come to

790
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,550
give me advice?

791
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,970
You want to leave before you finish?

792
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,680
Is this what you want me to see?

793
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,900
No.

794
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,480
I want to show you this.

795
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,180
This is pretty.

796
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,960
Do you think so too?

797
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,460
You think so too,

798
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,660
don't you?

799
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,500
Yes.

800
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,410
But this may be the difference

801
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,010
between reality and dreams.

802
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,410
What you want to do

803
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,360
will be turned down by the clients.

804
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,870
Therefore,

805
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,820
I can only brazenly

806
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,140
make something that suits the market demands.

807
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,910
As long as you can save

808
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,910
a little dignity.

809
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,510
There's no real dignity

810
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,170
for employees.

811
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,470
But my dignity

812
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,780
is my dream.

813
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,940
I support you.

814
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,340
Anything else you want to show me?

815
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,470
You want to see more?

816
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,060
♫Oh love should be♫

817
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,900

830
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,730
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.

831
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,490
I can only come back this weekend.

832
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,490
We won't see each other for two days.

833
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,090
Going on a business trip?

834
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,250
I'll take a leave and go with you.

835
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,220
You have a proposal to do tomorrow morning.

836
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,220
Actually it's already ready.

837
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,340
I'll let Chen Musen be the main presenter.

838
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,350
No way.

839
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,980
This is your chance to shine.

840
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,710
What if

841
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,180
they don't like it?

842
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,290
Should I stand

843
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,400
or kneel?

844
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,300
See.

845
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,270
We can't escape from choices.

846
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
I didn't expect Xu Guangxi

847
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,870
would worry about this.

848
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,390
Who doesn't appreciate your talent?

849
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,540
Make a good proposal tomorrow.

850
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,590
We'll see each other again

851
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,590
after I come back.

852
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,960
Is your client

853
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,310
a man or a woman?

854
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,970
A man.

855
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,739
What's wrong?

856
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,380
Are you upset?

857
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,530
Are you jealous?

858
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,929
Xu Guangxi.

859
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,030
Don't push your luck.

860
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,389
I'm going there to work.

861
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,440
Even if I believe you can do anything,

862
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,790
you can't stop me from worrying about you.

863
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,540
I promise you.

864
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,620
I will be more careful

865
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,510
and pay attention to every detail

866
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,020
to protect myself.

867
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,980
Okay, I'll send you in.

868
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,500
Let me send you home.

869
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,350
If we walk on like this,

870
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,489
both of us will have the most step counts

871
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,560
on WeChat today.

872
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,340
I like it.

873
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,150
Me too.

874
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,940
Can you do anything about it?

875
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,600
No.

876
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,260
Will we tie for first place?

877
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,270
I'm afraid you'll be robbed and harassed sexually.

878
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm the one who's afraid, okay?

879
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,740
When you arrive tomorrow,

880
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,940
please face time me.

881
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,380
Okay?

882
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,650
No.

883
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,900
You have to report on WeChat in time, too.

884
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,660
No, I won't.

885
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,200
Mr. Kong,

886
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,690
why are you here?

887
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,940
Of course I'm here.

888
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,340
I've been waiting for you.

889
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,400
Let's go together.

890
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,610
What?

891
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,060
Didn't Ms. Zheng tell you?

892
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,700
You see,

893
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,460
he's such an important client.

894
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,920
How can I let you

895
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,980
go on the battlefield alone?

896
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,550
So,

897
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,320
I have to go help you.

898
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,550
You're welcome.

899
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,290
By the way,

900
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,630
I bought you coffee.

901
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,880
The most important thing

902
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,550
for a person is to know

903
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,220
when it's time to appear

904
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,780
and disappear.

905
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,220
Let's go.

906
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,420
Let's go. Hurry.

907
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,740
The client is waiting.

908
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,600
This is our project,

909
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,720
Fengqi Shendu.

910
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,700
We can see the background of the story

911
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,220
is set in the Tang Dynasty.

912
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,660
Now,

913
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,860
this is our heroine.

914
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,460
She

915
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,060
is actually a fox spirit killer.

916
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,320
But we will put

917
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,990
the character features

918
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,860
of a modern heroine on her.

919
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Actually,

920
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,950
I think the most important thing

921
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,150
is the cultural core.

922
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,360
So the scene-setting

923
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,330
is very important.

924
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,100
Next, there are some scene pictures.

925
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,210
Take a look.

926
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:40,920
Mr. Xu.

927
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,600
It's not a big deal.

928
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,300
You're here.

929
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
How can I not come?

930
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,800
I have to be there myself,

931
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,780
right?

932
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,990
Don't worry.

933
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,940
I've arranged everything.

934
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,820
Let's

935
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,020
have a good drink later,

936
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,700
okay?

937
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,730
Okay.

938
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,140
See you later.

939
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,370
Ms. Yin.

940
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,410
Why do you frown

941
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,300
when we talk about having a drink?

942
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,160
Entertaining clients

943
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,860
is also one of our jobs.

944
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,970
Besides, Mr. Xu is

945
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,330
a very important client

946
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,420
for our company,

947
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,080
right?

948
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,610
This is the least we can do to

949
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,700
treat guests,

950
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,700
am I right?

951
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,220
As for the live stream performance goal

952
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,430
Frank set for you,

953
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,340
if you make Mr. Xu happy,

954
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,950
one word from him

955
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,900
can lead to

956
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,050
a million views.

957
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,550
Then why would you worry you can't finish it?

958
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,200
Don't take social activities so seriously.

959
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,000
Relax.

960
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,870
Just treat it as a friends' gathering

961
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,250
and have a chat.

962
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,480
Isn't that all right?

963
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,540
Yes.

964
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,690
Is this your first time meeting Mr. Xu?

965
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,690
It's okay.

966
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,860
Don't worry.

967
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,200
By then,

968
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,510
I will put in a good word for you.

969
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,670
It's good for you.

970
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,330
This is the story and drafts

971
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,940
of this project.

972
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,770
Mr. Xie, what do you think?

973
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,130
Chen Ye,

974
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,140
you got yourself a treasure.

975
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,010
Exactly.

976
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,570
Look.

977
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,240
The director who came back

978
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,050
from overseas

979
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,350
is full of talent.

980
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,390
The whole work

981
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,380
gathers the essence of our team.

982
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,070
If you didn't come here,

983
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,690
I wouldn't have taken it out.

984
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,300
Mr. Xie thinks

985
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,370
this project is good.

986
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,250
Name your price.

987
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:27,980
Straight up.

988
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,940
I calculated

989
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,270
the cost that

990
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,620
we have invested in it.

991
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,430
If we finish it,

992
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,170
we need...

993
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,020
I will

994
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,130
buy it out.

995
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,700
Buy it out?

996
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,710
Do you mean that

997
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,030
we'll be kicked out?

998
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,700
Young man,

999
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,810
don't

1000
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,860
put it that way.

1001
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:50,790
I admit that

1002
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,540
your idea

1003
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,420
is indeed good.

1004
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,740
But with your

1005
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,350
team's qualification,

1006
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,160
if you want to do

1007
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,520
all the work well,

1008
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,350
it's not realistic.

1009
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,390
So,

1010
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,530
to ensure the quality,

1011
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,660
I've decided to

1012
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,360
send our director and team

1013
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,690
to finish the work.

1014
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,620
Mr. Xie.

1015
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,370
If that's the case,

1016
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,880
I won't sell it.

1017
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,060
What do you mean?

1018
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:20,960
This is a project completely created

1019
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,120
by us.

1020
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,640
I hope we can lead the way to finish it.

1021
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,040
This is my bottom line.

1022
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,380
Xu Guangxi, right?

1023
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,410
Don't think just because

1024
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,540
you won two awards abroad,

1025
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,360
you can brag in front of me.

1026
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,580
Do you know that

1027
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,830
it's an era

1028
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,180
of information explosion?

1029
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,030
Domestically,

1030
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,940
you have no work,

1031
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,700
and no box-office assurance.

1032
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,430
What profit can you guarantee?

1033
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,540
Mr. Xie.

1034
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,780
Excuse me.

1035
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,700
Guangxi.

1036
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,940
Guangxi.

1037
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,930
Guangxi.

1038
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,330
Guangxi.

1039
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,100
Guangxi.

1040
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,840
We haven't finished talking about the project yet.

1041
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,970
Where are you going?

1042
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,410
I have to go.

1043
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,350
Say sorry to Dad Chen for me.

1044
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,130
Sorry, Mr. Xie.

1045
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,120
I'm sorry.

1046
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,980
He just came back from abroad

1047
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,780
and has a weird temper.

1048
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,930
I spoiled him.

1049
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,120
Look at this mess.

1050
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,780
I'm sorry.

1051
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,020
Old man.

1052
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,870
You are the boss.

1053
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,820
You have the final say.

1054
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,880
It's settled then.

1055
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,420
Don't worry. As for the price,

1056
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,580
I'll try to get more for you.

1057
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,470
I know.

1058
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,130
You guys

1059
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,480
are having a tough time recently.

1060
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,170
But Mr. Xie,

1061
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,100
he's my kid.

1062
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,530
I have to take care of him.

1063
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,620
After all, he calls me dad,

1064
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,330
right?

1065
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:46,730
Look.

1066
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,110
If I give the kid away

1067
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,860
with my own hands,

1068
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,360
what will he think of me?

1069
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,820
I have my pride.

1070
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,770
Chen Ye,

1071
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,120
I'm trying to save you.

1072
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,790
I heard that you've been

1073
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,300
making quick money everywhere.

1074
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,360
With your ability,

1075
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,340
I'm afraid

1076
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,620
there's no big company in the market

1077
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,150
that dares to work with you.

1078
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,800
Think about it carefully.

1079
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,260
Can you

1080
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,310
sell this film?

1081
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,740
It depends on my ability.

1082
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,540
Right?

1083
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,530
Yes.

1084
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,230
I didn't expect

1085
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,750
you are so conscientious.

1086
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,150
Since

1087
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,700
you want to die together,

1088
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,310
I won't stop you.

1089
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,740
Mr. Chen.

1090
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,700
I'll wait for the news of

1091
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,310
your company's bankruptcy.

1092
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,540
Thanks to your kind words,

1093
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,420
I have to live a long life for it.
