[Episode 30]

16
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,170
But I know

17
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,250
I love Guangxi.

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,380
I hope he could become

19
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,900
a better version of himself

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,160
and fulfill his dream.

21
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,580
If a relationship

22
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,420
can only be protected

23
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,539
by binding,

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,740
it's too fragile.

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,340
Besides,

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,130
Ms. Xu,

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,880
I also believe in your character.

28
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,100
What if

29
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,260
I can't help myself?

30
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,430
As you know,

31
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,020
Guangxi is such an excellent guy that

32
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,380
anyone would fall in love with him if being with him for long.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,330
You too, right?

34
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:12,980
Actually,

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
I knew it long ago.

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,340
Even though it weren't you today,

37
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,140
other girls would

38
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,870
have such feelings for him too.

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,410
Lastly, I want to say

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,950
I have confidence in myself.

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,110
You are really

42
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,160
an interesting opponent.

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,380
But I admire your confidence.

44
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:37,990
Actually,

45
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,460
when I was in a relationship before,

46
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,460
I always felt that

47
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,210
as long as I do

48
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,530
what others want me to,

49
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,660
respect others' decisions,

50
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,620
and take care of others,

51
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,620
I could take good care of

52
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,290
my love.

53
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,140
But later I found

54
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,300
what I did was useless.

55
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,660
When

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,500
I am in a relationship with Guangxi,

57
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,700
he makes me feel

58
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,150
that I'm good too.

59
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,170
I deserve to be cherished.

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,780
He made me more confident.

61
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,720
So now,

62
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,510
I won't be afraid of

63
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,400
a short separation from Guangxi.

64
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,060
And I won't be insecure

65
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,160
about the uncertainty in the future.

66
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,510
I trust him.

67
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,230
And I trust our relationship more.

68
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,130
Okay.

69
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,300
I'll pay the bill.

70
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,950
Enjoy your coffee.

71
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,670
By the way,

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,060
the beans

73
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,000
are sweet after taste.

74
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,160
You'll know soon.

75
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,810
Ms. Xu.

76
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,250
He is just a new director.

77
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,530
Why did you spend so much effort

78
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,260
on hiring him?

79
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,850
And you even ask for

80
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,380
his girlfriend's consent.

81
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,730
What an interesting couple.

82
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,560
So interesting that

83
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,160
I don't want to destroy them.

84
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,310
But I'd like to extend the game time

85
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,830
and give them a test.

86
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,470
You are here.

87
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,909
Why do you want to bring me here?

88
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,620
To play on the swing with you?

89
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,700
You look happy.

90
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,150
Having fun in bitterness.

91
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,080
But

92
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,030
I feel a little

93
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,790
in a bad mood.

94
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,770
I know.

95
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,220
One is me,

96
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,100
and the other is your dream.

97
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,620
And the Drawing Pie in the Sky Team

98
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,430
and Dad Chen.

99
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,790
You have too many concerns.

100
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,710
The reason why I'm in a bad mood

101
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,780
is that

102
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,660
someone

103
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,030
said we should cherish each other,

104
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,190
and cherish the present.

105
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,950
But she used

106
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,710
supporting my dream as execuse

107
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,690
to let me go to Guangzhou.

108
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,270
How did you know?

109
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,300
When you were talking

110
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,460
with Xu Yuan today,

111
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,990
I actually heard it.

112
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,890
What?

113
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,030
When I was in a relationship before,

114
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,140
I always followed others' steps.

115
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:40,930
Actually,

116
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,460
when I was in a relationship before,

117
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
I always felt that

118
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,140
as long as I do

119
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,530
what others want me to,

120
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,659
respect others' decisions,

121
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,700
and take care of others,

122
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
I could take good care of

123
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,520
my love.

124
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,409
But later I found

125
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,150
what I did was useless.

126
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,350
When I am

127
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,140
in a relationship with Guangxi,

128
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,420
he makes me feel

129
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,740
that I'm good too.

130
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,850
I deserve to be cherished.

131
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,360
He made me more confident.

132
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,500
So now, I won't be afraid of

133
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,340
a short separation from Guangxi

134
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,660
And I won't feel insecure

135
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,020
because of the uncertainty in the future.

136
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,100
I trust him.

137
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,740
And I trust our relationship more.

138
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,050
Are you wearing

139
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,110
Harry Potter's Invisibility Cloak?

140
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,150
No wonder Xu Yuan said

141
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,800
that the beans are sweet after taste.

142
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,060
I know the meaning now.

143
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,750
I went to meet Xu Yuan today

144
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,550
to see if

145
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,780
we could discuss about

146
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,250
going to Guangzhou.

147
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,490
I failed.

148
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,430
But I watched

149
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,620
how my girlfriend

150
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,030
sent me away.

151
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,020
Are you satisfied with

152
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,280
the excuse I used to send you away?

153
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,700
Yes, I am.

154
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,280
But it's also a pity.

155
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,540
What's the pity?

156
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,460
Someone hired me to Guangzhou.

157
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,350
Aren't you going to detain me?

158
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,150
So you like this?

159
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,340
Guangxi.

160
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,740
I don't want you to leave.

161
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,080
If you leave,

162
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,710
I don't know

163
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,140
how I can live.

164
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,940
Guangxi.

165
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,430
You'd better not leave.

166
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,590
I was going to

167
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,880
not to go to Guangzhou.

168
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,780
I want to let you

169
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,900
feel secure.

170
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,159
But today,

171
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,020
after hearing what you said,

172
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,490
I felt you've changed.

173
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,750
So I decided

174
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,659
to become a better version of myself

175
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,150
so that I can be able to

176
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,660
protect you

349
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,210
I heard you wanted to see me.

350
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,260
So you felt

351
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,190
my summon

352
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,930
and came back

353
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,190
to have dinner with me.

354
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,580
I just submitted the film today.

355
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,180
The company gave us a day off.

356
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,190
I haven't seen you for a long time.

357
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,630
So I made a little surprise.

358
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,340
It must be tiring

359
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,480
to come back.

360
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,640
I already did it for you.

361
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,740
Aren't you going to reward me?

362
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,460
Miss Yike.

363
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,640
Didn't someone say

364
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,980
behind every successful woman,

365
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,290
there's always a man

366
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,700
supporting her secretly?

367
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,500
Who said that?

368
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,640
Thank you, Guangxi.

369
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,770
Let's eat.

370
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,710
Recently,

371
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,380
the two movie with high similarity on content,

372
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,220
Double-faced Fox Spirit and Fengqi Shendu,

373
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,550
will see their result of the seesaw battle of their box office.

374
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,910
The overall quality

375
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,770
and reputation of Fengqi Shendu are better

376
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,790
compared to

377
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,119
the Double-faced Fox Spirit.

378
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,849
Its box office has been rising.

379
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,400
We're famous!

380
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,369
We're popular.

381
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:13,859
Am I dreaming?

382
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,819
Chen Musen, hit me!

383
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,500
We won!

384
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,260
We won!

385
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,400
We're rich! We're famous!

386
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,740
We're rich! We're rich!

387
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,770
We're rich! We're rich!

388
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,060
We are the champion!

389
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,220
All right.

390
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,100
Calm down.

391
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,620
Is it right to

392
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,500
follow Baba?

393
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Our dreams came true.

394
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,780
And you ate the pie.

395
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,270
Right?

396
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,310
Yes.

397
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,790
Do we have bonus?

398
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,270
Yes. Come on.

399
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,140
One for each person.

400
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,850
One for each person.

401
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,700
Here, one for each.

402
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,370
Take it.

403
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,820
Baba.

404
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,580
What is this?

405
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,060
New pie...

406
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,130
No, a new project.

407
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,140
New project.

408
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,860
Only new projects can give us new motivation

409
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,530
and new dreams

410
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,180
to realize.

411
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,970
Right? Come on.

412
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,890
Fighting.

413
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,900
You're drawing pies in sky again.

414
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,100
You tricked us again.

415
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,300
What do you mean? I...

416
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,080
Guangxi came...

417
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,220
Don't talk.

418
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,300
Don't talk.

419
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,440
Baby Guangxi.

420
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,450
This project

421
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,750
has no big boobs

422
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,350
or anything dirty

423
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,790
in your imagination.

424
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,950
It's completely...

425
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,840
Dad Chen,

426
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,550
I only have one request.

427
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,710
We'll modify it.

428
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,250
We'll modify it until you are satisfied.

429
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,620
We are the champion.

430
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,170
We are the champion.

431
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,020
We are the champion.

432
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,160
Ms. Xu.

433
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,310
Xu Guangxi's team moved back.

434
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,030
Where's their office cubicle?

435
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,430
Just ask Guangxi's team.

436
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,700
Okay, I'll do it.

437
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,100
Don't let them show off for too long.

438
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Quickly move on to

439
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,180
the next project.

440
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,060
Okay, Ms. Xu.

441
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,430
Yike, look.

442
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,660
This is the sales data

443
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,660
this month.

444
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,770
The performance of Yu Rou

445
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,230
and Xiaomian

446
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,630
has greatly improved.

447
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,500
Then...

448
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,780
This and this

449
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,060
are selling well.

450
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,130
Not bad.

451
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,880
Good.

452
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,260
Well...

453
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,500
Yin...

454
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,820
Mr. Kong.

455
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,540
Are you here to ask Director Yin for instructions?

456
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,800
Ask for instructions?

457
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,620
Yes.

458
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,840
I came to ask Director Yin for instructions

459
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,110
to help me with my work.

460
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,860
I have some documents

461
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,180
to sign.

462
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,470
Are they urgent?

463
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,040
Yes.

464
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,540
Very urgent.

465
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,980
They can't wait.

466
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,460
Go back and paste yellow sticky notes

467
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,030
on them.

468
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,610
And then put them on my desk.

469
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,290
I'll work on this plan first.

470
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,180
Okay.

471
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,440
Yike, let's continue.

472
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,620
Yellow labels?

473
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,240
The market effect will be better.

474
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,980
Indeed.

475
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,130
I'll leave you to it.

476
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,280
It'll be better.

477
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,940
Yike.

478
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,110
Happy birthday.

479
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,190
Happy birthday.

480
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,630
Happy birthday.

481
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,970
I wish you become more beautiful.

482
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,060
Never gain weight no matter how much you eat.

483
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,620
You'll always be beautiful.

484
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,740
I wish you sleep until you wake up naturally.

485
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,820
Too much money to count.

486
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,700
Love you.

487
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,460
Never get fat if you eat too much. More and more beautiful.

488
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,280
Love you forever, Chacha.

489
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,620
Sorry.

490
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,570
I have to work overtime in Guangzhou.

491
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,030
I can't make it back today.

492
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,340
Remember to eat well.

493
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,410
I'll make up for the gift.

494
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,550
Happy birthday.

495
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,800
Xiaoyi. Xiaoyi.

496
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:06,780
I'm here.

497
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,650
How to celebrate birthday alone?

498
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,700
Think about

499
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,970
why you are alone.

500
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,750
Don't sit down.

501
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,910
Don't sit down.

502
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,980
I'm so worried.

503
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,030
Here.

504
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,810
-Is it necessary? -OK. OK.

505
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,300
Slow down.

506
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,840
Come on.

507
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,270
Why are you still wearing high heels

508
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,020
while doing antenatal examination?

509
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,500
Let me tell you.

510
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,660
It's bad for the fetus.

511
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,450
The doctor will scold you again.

512
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,510
Here, change them.

513
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,010
Chen Ye, since I met you,

514
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,780
I've broken all my principles.

515
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,610
Now you want to change

516
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,340
what I wear now?

517
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,300
No.

518
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,100
I just gave

519
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,220
an immature suggestion.

520
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,620
Right?

521
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,230
Listen. Even if I'm pregnant,

522
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:46,900
I want to be

523
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,970
the coolest pregnant woman.

524
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,260
Of course, you are.

525
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:49,820
Right?

526
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,860
Of course you are.

527
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,860
I'll check the procedures

528
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,770
for you.

529
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:57,860
Hello.

530
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,210
Hello.

531
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,750
Honey.

532
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,710
Happy birthday.

533
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,540
Yiran, thank you.

534
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,640
What are you doing?

535
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,670
Me?

536
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,350
I...

537
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,780
I'm...

538
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,970
I'm in the hospital.

539
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,860
Let me tell you.

540
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,580
I've been greatly affected

541
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,580
by pregnancy reactions these days.

542
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,460
I can't eat or sleep.

543
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,260
I even doubt myself that

544
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,900
if I have the...the

545
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,500
prenatal anxiety disorder, you know?

546
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,850
I...

547
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,420
I'm fine. You...

548
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,380
Take your time for the antenatal examination.

549
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,040
Okay, okay.

550
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,140
Bye. Bye.

551
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,430
My best friend is busy.

552
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,990
Where is my little brother?

553
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,760
Sister!

554
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,350
Hello?

555
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,020
Sister, I'm Xiaomian.

556
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,520
Happy birth...

557
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,400
Sister,

558
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,940
I'm working on the couple live stream

559
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,030
with Xiaomian.

560
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,060
What's the matter?

561
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,180
The couple live stream?

562
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,070
So early?

563
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,580
It's okay.

564
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,740
Work hard.

565
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,660
Good luck.

566
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,460
OK. Bye.

567
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,660
Xia Xiaomian.

568
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
What are you talking?

569
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,250
I almost lost my life.

570
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,490
I want to say that we work so hard that

571
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,700
we can live and die together.

572
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,960
Live and die together?

573
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,440
Cultural level has improved.

574
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,370
I'm very smart now.

575
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,860
If that's the case,

576
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,500
let's

577
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,460
study in the library later.

578
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,860
I can't leave you behind.

579
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,450
Review again?

580
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,900
Please, stay with me.

581
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,420
The exam is coming.

582
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,380
Please, please.

583
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,900
Okay.

584
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,100
You're the best.

585
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,240
Yes.

586
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,300
Wait, I have to tell Guangxi.

587
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,950
What about parents?

588
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,210
What are they doing?

589
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,980
I've never worn this before.

590
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,500
Never.

591
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,140
Here.

592
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,980
Ke is calling.

593
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,630
Hurry up.

594
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,060
I'll put on my hat. You...

595
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,470
That's right. Hold on.

596
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,210
Is this okay?

597
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,370
Okay.

598
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,930
Girl, happy birthday.

599
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,190
Dad.

600
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,790
Hello, happy birthday.

601
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,900
Aunt Lan, you...

602
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,290
Where are you going?

603
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,020
Aunt Lan signed up for a travel group.

604
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,690
I didn't expect that we're leaving today.

605
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,170
Well...

606
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,890
That's good.

607
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,580
You're finally willing to hang out.

608
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,390
Yes.

609
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,620
Pulling out your father

610
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,910
from home

611
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,260
is not easy.

612
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,990
I wanted to

613
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,060
come back to see you.

614
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,090
Well...

615
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,280
Unfortunately...

616
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,620
What delicious food

617
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,100
are you going to eat tonight with Guangxi?

618
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,580
How could he leave me behind?

619
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,300
Don't worry.

620
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,740
Yes, our daughter is independent.

621
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,010
You should be independent too.

622
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,180
Yes, yes, yes.

623
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,100
All right.

624
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,980
Go and play.

625
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,080
I won't bother you.

626
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,140
Well,

627
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,910
I haven't finished yet.

628
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,180
It's obvious that she wants to

629
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,180
go home for dinner.

630
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,970
Every birthday,

631
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,080
we celebrated together in the past.

632
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,700
Well,

633
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,590
who promised Guangxi

634
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,130
that

635
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,180
we're going to be sensible old people,

636
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,470
we're letting go,

637
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,560
and let you have a good relationship?

638
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:09,950
Yes.

639
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,310
Let go.

640
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,230
Look.

641
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,220
We're dressed up.

642
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,770
Shall we start

643
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,540
a trip?

644
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,060
What happened today?

645
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,770
Xiaoyi. Xiaoyi.

646
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,700
I'm here.

647
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,290
If I'm eating alone,

648
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,930
how can I be happier?

649
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,530
Don't eat out.

650
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,700
Don't eat out?

651
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,800
Having fun in bitterness.

652
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,500
I must do something for fun anyway.

653
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,870
Little thing.

654
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,200
Why are you here again?

655
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,720
Do you think

656
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,990
if my birthday

657
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,310
has been cursed?

658
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,540
Guangxi isn't with me.

659
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,390
My family or friends

660
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,450
aren't with me.

661
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,420
I'm alone again.

662
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,030
What?

663
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,470
You want sausage again?

664
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,610
Here.

665
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,860
This is for you.

666
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,930
In the previous show,

667
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,830
I once said long-term separation

668
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,690
is against the intention of love.

669
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,940
But some listeners have different opinions on it.

670
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,540
They think even joy and sorrow can't be shared,

671
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,900
and they can't embrace when laughing and crying.

672
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,560
They still have expectations

673
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,220
and still love each other.

674
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,740
This is true love.

675
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,300
It's been so long.

676
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,110
I wonder

677
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,420
have you changed

678
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,420
your definition of love?

679
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,290
Hello, Guangxi.

680
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,720
Are you having anything good for your birthday?

681
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,760
Of course.

682
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,040
Let me guess.

683
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,430
Are you in that

684
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,520
Michelin Japanese restaurant,

685
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,580
eating king crabs and caviare again?

686
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,620
This time,

687
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,350
I am really in the Michelin Japanese restaurant.

688
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:50,970
Hello?

689
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:52,940
Hello?

690
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Got you.

691
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,190
And you are going to drink beer secretly.

692
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,790
And I find that

693
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,080
you have the most rare characteristics.

694
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,780
You always forget to charge your phone.

695
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,450
How come you are back?

696
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,320
Did you sneak back?

697
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,080
I finished my work beforehand and hurried back.

698
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,350
In such a hurry?

699
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,850
It's exhausting.

700
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,630
But today is

701
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,860
Yin Yike's birthday.

702
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,790
You are the most important.

703
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,860
Wait a moment.

704
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,820
♫Happy birthday to you♫

705
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,970
♫Happy birthday to you♫

706
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,460
♫Happy birthday to you♫

♫Happy birthday to you♫

708
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,370
Make a wish.

709
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,030
♫Dark♫

710
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,230
♫The whole world was dark♫

711
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,080
♫Until someone brought light and scattered it♫

712
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,420
What wish did you make?

713
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,020
♫To Morning day and night♫

714
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,270
I'm not telling you.

715
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,090
You blew out my candles.

716
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,050
Why didn't you tell me?

717
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,470
♫The sun, the moon, the star♫

718
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,420
It won't work if I tell you.

719
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,240
It won't work if you tell me?

720
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,830
♫How beautiful they are♫

721
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,660
It just occurred to me that

722
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,470
♫Make people fall in love♫

723
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,390

you also sat here.

725
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,990
And I sat here.

♫Your color and your smile♫

728

But at that time

729
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,750
I didn't know you.

730
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,060
Last year, someone thought

731
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,380
I wanted to hit on her.

732
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,940
♫Little did I know♫

733
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,860
Am I wrong?

734
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,190
♫That I am the shadow♫

735
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,670
Well, that's truth.

736
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,700
♫You brought to the world♫

737
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,030
♫The world is half of you♫

738
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,260

742

♫Travels to the end♫

746
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,440

747

♫Of the whole universe♫

749
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,400

♫But never will it travel♫

What are you doing?

763
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,460
I saw a mosquito bite you.

764
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,210
I want to announce the sovereignty

765
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,900
and tell it you're taken.

766
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,030
Are you jealous of mosquitoes?

767
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,140
Give me the pen.

768
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,570
No.

769
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,750
Give it to me.

770
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,510
I'll give you if you sing for me.

771
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:34,650
Why did you

772
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,580
come back today?

773
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,780
Today is an important day.

774
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,040
How can I not come back?

775
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,470
What if I have an appointment?

776
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,070
Didn't those people

777
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,420
refuse you?

778
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,860
How did you know?

779
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,210
Xu Guangxi, so...

780
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,580
Did I say something?

781
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,550
Was it you?

782
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,540
What is the proposal scene

783
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,780
in your imagination?

784
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,600
It'd better not to be too grand

785
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,420
or be watched

786
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,510
by too many people.

787
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,970
What do you want?

788
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,080
I've never thought about it.

789
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,580
Maybe

790
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
just

791
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,160
make it simple.

792
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,260
Even just a ring will work.

793
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,040
How about this?

794
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,140
This is only temporary.

795
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,000
I'll make it real.

796
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:05,780
Let's go.

797
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,120
When will it become real?

798
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:12,989
When?

799
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,710
[What do you think love should be like?]

800
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,000
I think it should be...

801
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,610
[About love,]

802
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,610
[everyone has their own topic.]

803
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,780
Ms. Zheng asked us to withdraw

804
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
all advertisements

805
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,610
of the spokesperson.

806
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,139
No way.

807
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:41,980
I've modified it for 89 times.

808
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,370
It's still useless even so.

809
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,750
Yin Yike is

810
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,380
very persistent

811
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,699
at work.

812
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,790
I think

813
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,850
the packaging color

814
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,540
should be brighter.

815
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,860
She thinks everyone should

816
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,260
have their own achievements

817
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
and self-growth.

818
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,980
She chose the other half

819
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,180
because she hopes

820
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,150
they can respect each other

821
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,300
in everything

822
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,870
and understand each other.

823
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,940
You've been busy all day.

824
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:05,980
Go to sleep.

825
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,950
I think Guangxi

826
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,940
is very considerate.

827
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,700
Some adults

828
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,810
are really careless.

829
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,850
He gets jealous

830
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,060
or teases Yike sometimes.

831
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,760
Where is he?

832
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,220
I think these are

833
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,060
some seasonings

834
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,280
between two people.

835
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,580
When Yike was misunderstood

836
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,340
and had an affair

837
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,780
with that little actor.

838
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,690
Why there's such a piece of news?

839
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,270
Li Zelin

840
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,740
kept asking Yike

841
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:32,650
and didn't trust her.

842
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,380
Could

843
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,670
the photo be real?

844
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,160
Is that how you think of me?

845
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,900
Guangxi

846
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,100
trusted Yike so much.

847
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,240
Cry if you want.

848
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,820
Don't hide it.

849
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,520
Took her to the beach for a ride

850
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,260
and accompanied her.

851
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,500
He wouldn't ask her

852
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,500
about this.

853
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,860
Because he knows her well.

854
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,950
You looked pretty

855
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,020
when you were sleeping.

856
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,100
I thought I am on

857
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,970
a lifeboat.

858
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,390
I didn't expect it to be a pirate ship.

859
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,070
I'm a pirate ship.

860
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
I think the most attractive thing of Yike

861
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,340
is that

862
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,870
she is brave enough.

863
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,800
As long as you leave this room,

864
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,700
it's impossible for us.

865
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,640
Just like when she decided

866
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,040
to break up with Li Zelin,

867
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,060
she took this step

868
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,460
very bravely.

869
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,780
Who wants to be your sister?

870
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,660
When she decided

871
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,100
to be with Guangxi,

872
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,400
she got rid of all difficulties

873
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
to be with him.

874
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,580
I don't want to be your brother either.

875
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,660
He's my boyfriend.

876
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,240
She's your sister!

877
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,220
You bastard!

878
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,650
But ever since I met Guangxi,

879
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,500
I realized that

880
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,990
I am worth to be cherished.

881
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
In the past,

882
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,100
I used to live

883
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,300
according to others' thoughts.

884
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,320
But this time,

885
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,000
I want to be myself.

886
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,520
I think Yike's biggest charm

887
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,580
comes from

888
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,940
her multiple characters,

889
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,180
her multiple roles.

890
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,140
When she's in this relationship,

891
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,340
she can be jealous

892
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,660
like a little girl

893
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,220
and lose temper.

894
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,780
I am as light as a swallow.

895
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,300
But when Guangxi

896
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,540
needs her,

897
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,980
she will give Guangxi

898
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,830
some

899
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,330
constructive ideas,

900
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,030
think for him,

901
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,140
and help him.

902
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,750
I picked it up for you this time.

903
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,210
Don't throw it away again.

904
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,270
Since young,

905
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,550
he had feelings

906
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,340
for Yike.

907
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,540
Sister, look.

908
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,630
He would share his secret base

909
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,060
with Yike.

910
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,980
After coming back,

911
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,860
at the convenience store

912
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,470
and airport,

913
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,680
he knew what to do

914
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,140
with his love.

915
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,660
It's pure.

916
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,210
The last bottle of iced coke.

917
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,670
Take it.

918
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,980
In fact, he knew

919
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,440
Yike had a boyfriend.

920
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,810
But at that moment, he might choose

921
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,890
to protect her secretly.

922
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,700
We broke up.

923
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,910
I quit drinking to drown my sorrows.

924
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,630
Then later he found out

925
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,780
Yike broke up with

926
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,420
Li Zelin.

927
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,300
Why are you laughing?

928
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,940
He pursued bravely again.

929
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,260
Yin Yike.

930
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,590
The most memorable scene

931
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,590
is

932
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,570
when Yike was surrounded,

933
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,640
at that moment,

934
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,100
I grabbed her wrist.

935
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,840
Then we started

936
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,920
running.

937
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,980
Happy wedding.

938
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,360
So I think

939
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,260
this kind of love

940
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,860
really makes me yearn for it.

941
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:37,900
In my heart,

942
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,340
as long as she's living her life

943
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,380
and being the happiest

944
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,260
Yin Yike,

945
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,390
everything is fine.

946
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,460
First, I think

947
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,380
Qin Yiran's family situation.

948
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,950
I

949
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,160
grew up

950
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:06,660
in a very unhappy family,

951
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,760
made her unconfident

952
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,910
in herself

953
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,120
to maintain

954
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,800
a very stable relationship.

955
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,830
New boys again.

956
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,930
He looks young.

957
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,920
I'm not getting married anyway.

958
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,130
As long as I'm happy.

959
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:19,970
There was a misunderstanding of Cheng Ye

960
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:20,910
at the beginning.

961
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,520
She thought Cheng Ye

962
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,380
is unreliable.

963
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,220
No, I'm not married.

964
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,750
I'm divorced.

965
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,420
Keep lying.

966
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,530
After she found out

967
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,380
all the truth,

968
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,140
she realized that

969
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,980
Chen Ye is

970
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,990
a very

971
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,420
responsible man.

972
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,890
It's not easy

973
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,750
to be a single father.

974
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,220
He

975
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,620
gradually merged

976
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,260
into your life.

977
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,370
When you realize it,

978
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,100
you will find

979
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,630
you can't live without him.

980
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,300
Qin Yiran, I like you.

981
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,780
I liked you

982
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,910
when I first saw you.

983
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,860
First, Chen Ye should be

984
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,740
a father.

985
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,420
Because he is a single father

986
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,140
who has a child.

987
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,340
Hurray!

988
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,380
In the company,

989
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,670
there are so many kids around him.

990
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,580
He has to be responsible for

991
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,540
everyone's food and life.

992
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,450
So he has all the quality of

993
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,740
a father.

994
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,300
Thank you, Baba.

995
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,700
In fact,

996
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,020
he's looking for

997
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,220
a suitable companion

998
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,390
and partner in life.

999
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,420
Why are you driving so fast?

1000
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,300
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

1001
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,740
After meeting Qin Yiran,

1002
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,660
his thoughts

1003
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,330
began to change.

1004
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,330
Thank you, uncle.

1005
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,830
His philosophy of love

1006
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,260
is totally different

1007
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,420
with Qin Yiran.

1008
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,540
Eye cramps?

1009
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,020
It's a totally different

1010
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,000
situation of life and attitude of life.

1011
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,060
What are you doing?

1012
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,660
Chrysanthemum plus goji berries.

1013
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,940
It's good for the liver and eyes.

1014
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,660
It means Qin Yi really

1015
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,270
caused his resonance

1016
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,500
in his heart

1017
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,800
on some pity.

1018
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,750
He would pursue

1019
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,460
something he didn't achieve

1020
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,270
when he was young.

1021
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,580
So he likes

1022
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,820
Qin Yiran's carefree characteristic,

1023
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,950
brave words,

1024
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,920
and righteous things.

1025
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,600
He will be attracted by this quality.

1026
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,310
Are you

1027
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,210
proposing?

1028
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,380
Hello, everyone.

1029
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,260
This is Dan from Xiafei Road.

1030
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Because Yin Yibo

1031
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,660
grew up

1032
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,620
in a simple environment.

1033
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,450
Although his mother passed away

1034
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,450
when he was young.

1035
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:43,990
Eat it.

1036
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,290
The growth environment

1037
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,490
including his sister's love for him

1038
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,850
made up his mother on one hand.

1039
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,020
Let me help you.

1040
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,820
I'll help you.

1041
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,580
So,

1042
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,110
Yin Yibo

1043
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,660
is quite single-minded.

1044
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,580
My sister is the best.

1045
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,390
He's a

1046
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,450
straight man.

1047
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,620
Give it straight.

1048
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,280
I was wrong.

1049
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,110
He knew afterwards that

1050
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,850
Xia Xiaomian

1051
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,100
is a little silly.

1052
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,370
I wrote this letter of apology myself.

1053
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,020
I heard

1054
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,620
old people like reading letters.

1055
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,420
Xia Xiaomian is a little wicked.

1056
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,650
She lets Yin Yibo feel

1057
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,940
why this girl is

1058
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,500
a little different

1059
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,620
from other girls?

00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,580

1061
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,740
Then his dad got sick.

1062
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,570
Xia Xiaomian gave him

1063
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,030
all her savings.

1064
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,180
Consider it a love loan.

1065
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,520
to Yin Yibo directly.

1066
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,620
I think,

1067
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,910
from that point,

1068
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,220
Yin Yibo should know it's good

1069
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,750
to have someone by his side.

1070
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,250
Thank you.

1071
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,220
What?

1072
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,890
Thank you.

1073
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,860
It's not

1074
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,770
love at first sight

1075
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,820
but love growing over time.

1076
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,340
Baby,

1077
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,400
this is my gift for you.

1078
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,940
Chen Musen

1079
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,870
has a rough way of love.

1080
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,770
Why did you give me a scarf in hot summer?

1081
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,220
But he is always

1082
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,530
passionate and hopeful for love.

1083
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,700
We only met for several months

1084
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,930
and you want to get married?

1085
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,780
That's enough.

1086
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,620
I think the best quality of Chen Musen

1087
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,590
is that

1088
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,270
he would not stick

1089
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,430

1090

the beautiful side of love.

1095
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,670
Is there anything else

1096
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,100
except your girlfriend?

1097
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:27,670
Brother,

1098
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,610
I have the whole world.

1099
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,580
I'm madly in love with you in this life.

1100
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,780
This love is unparalleled in the world.

1101
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,780
Come on, Chen Musen.

1102
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,420
Your true love is coming.

1103
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,210
Grow up quickly.

1104
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,840

I wish you, Yu

1107
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,580
and Qin Yiran

1108
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,980

after getting married.

1112

I hope she can

1116
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,240
be herself bravely

1117
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,430
