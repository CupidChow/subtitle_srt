16
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,590
Since you work so hard,

17
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,800
I'll forgive you.

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,860
Let's eat something delicious.

19
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,170
Hello, dad.

20
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,560
Where are you?

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,690
I told Aunt Lan this afternoon that

22
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,490
I have to work overtime.

23
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,750
I'm not going back for dinner.

24
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,680
Why is there no one in your company?

25
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,860
Where are you?

26
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,580
I'm in front of your company.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,430
The door is broken. I can't get in.

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,870
I just went to the convenience store downstairs

29
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,800
to buy some food.

30
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,160
Wait for me in front of the company.

31
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,240
Go. Deal with dad first.

32
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,620
You're going back by yourself?

33
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:21,980
By the way,

34
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,340
I bought this

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,590
specially for you.

36
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,670
You can wear it

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,230
for the proposal tomorrow.

38
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,380
Then we can only have the meal

39
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,310
after it's done.

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,190
Bye.

41
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,340

Bye.

Okay.

Don't worry.

45
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,860

revise the proposal for you today.

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,020
I have something to do here.

48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,910
I'll talk to you later.

49
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,880
Why can't I open the door

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,740
of you company?

51
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,260
Dad.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,580
Why did you come

53
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,710
without telling me?

54
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,410
It can only be open with a card.

55
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:13,940
Let's go.

56
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,170
Where else can I find you

57
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,210
if I don't come to your company?

58
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,010
Why do you always work overtime?

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,960
Have some food first.

60
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,540
It's time for dinner. Here.

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,020
You said you were coming.

62
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,530
I bought you

63
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,870
some food for you.

64
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,220
What do you want to eat?

65
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,040
This is junk food.

66
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,170
I never eat it.

67
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,060
This...

68
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,920
This chicken leg is so expensive.

69
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,880
I usually eat this when I work overtime.

70
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
It's not nutritious.

71
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,140
By the way,

72
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,579
you said you were working overtime.

73
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,820
Where is your colleague?

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,820
Why are you alone?

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,750
Some of our colleagues

76
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,240
went out to accompany clients today.

77
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,600
Some of them are

78
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,700
working at home.

79
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,890
Then why can't you

80
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,890
work at home?

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,380
I'm the leader.

82
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,000
And today,

83
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,620
I need to work one a ppt today.

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
P, P what?

85
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,750
PPT is something

86
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,150
for my client,

87
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,740
with which

88
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,550
I can report,

89
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,510
report something to them.

90
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,250
Fine, I don't understand anyway.

91
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,580
Here's the thing, girl.

92
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,860
You...

93
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,180
Don't think I'm nagging.

94
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,100
I don't understand.

95
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,760
Why do you make yourself tired

96
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,300
all day long?

97
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,200
Dad, it's my work...

98
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,680
Listen.

99
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,339
It's hard to start everything.

100
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,079
-Our Live Stream Department is upstairs. - Well...

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,540
Don't change the subject.

102
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,580
You have to hurry up and get married.

103
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,100

104
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,290
has developed so well.

105
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,620
After getting married,

106
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,710
he'll take care of the business

107
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,630
and you take care of the family.

108
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,050
It's good to divide the work like this.

109
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,460
One more thing.

110
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm worried.

111
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,110
This time Zelin,

112
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,880
well,

113
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,650
went back to Beijing

114
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,909
without informing me.

115
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,110
Did you two

116
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,260
quarrel again?

117
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,630
If you feel shy

118
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,659
to call him,

119
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,310
I'll call him

120
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,909
later.

121
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,540
Let me tell you.

122
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,740
I have to talk to him.

123
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,700
I... I'll urge him.

124
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,130
Dad, you can care about this,

125
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,460
but don't interfere it.

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,420
What's interfering?

127
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,510
We're family.

128
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,860
There's no need to regard me as an outsider.

129
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,070
-I'm caring about you. -I can really

130
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,890
handle this on my own.

131
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,710
Just trust me.

132
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,700
Yes, you know what? Girl.

133
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,820
You're 32 years old.

134
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,290
If you still don't get married,

135
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,550
-Let me tell you. -Dad.

136
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,220
I...

137
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,660
I really cannot

138
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,900
write the slides.

139
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,060
Why don't we go back and see

140
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,110
what Aunt Lan cooked?

141
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,060
Listen.

142
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,840
-You cannot eat this. -You must be hungry.

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,310
It's not nutritious, you know?

144
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,340
No, don't throw it away.

145
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,740
I'll take it back and eat it.

146
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,140
Come on.

147
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,950
Ask Aunt Lan

148
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,300
to make you some delicious food.

149
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,780
Take it.

150
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,380
I'll hold it for you.

151
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,820
Let's go.

152
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,820
-Let' go. -Go. Go.

153
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,970
You...

154
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,780
Your company...

155
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,620
Why is this street so bright

156
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,620
like in the day?

157
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,560
Young people like you

158
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,780
don't sleep at all at this time?

159
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,100
This is nothing.

160
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,110
In our employees' eyes,

161
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,460
it's still early.

162
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,390
Work. Work.

163
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,340
I raised my daughter up

164
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,180
and send you here.

165
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,470
The pigeon cage,

166
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,540
and the desk.

167
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,940
You just move from here to there.

168
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,970
That's called work?

169
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,860
Why do you suffer so much?

170
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,360
It breaks my heart.

171
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,830
I earn a living with my own hands.

172
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,460
I feel at ease.

173
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,530
Isn't it good?

174
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,220
It can also create

175
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,150
social value.

176
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,220
What's good?

177
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,900
Girls don't need to be so strong.

178
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,820
It's better to marry a good man than work well.

179
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,250
Dad.

180
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,400
Why did you come back

181
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,630
to this matter again?

182
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,850
What's wrong with girls?

183
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,660
Girls should have

184
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,700
their own career.

185
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,020
I won't say it.

186
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,830
You...

187
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,720
Don't step on the brake so hard.

188
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,180
Slightly. Slightly.

189
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,700
How many times have I taught you?

190
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,640
It's fuel-consuming.

191
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,750
I know, dad.

192
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,310
With you stepping on it,

193
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,740
it's all money.

194
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,040
Speaking of money,

195
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,530
you should talk to your brother.

196
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,130
Well,

197
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,780
if he fails the exam for three years,

198
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,740
when can he be admitted?

199
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,140
It's useless to feed him.

200
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,640
Also,

201
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,810
don't always

202
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,220
give him money.

203
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,310
Your money doesn't come in a storm.

204
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,760
Yes, Mr. Yin.

205
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,700
I just finished.

206
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,640
Step...

207
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,740
Dad, don't scare me.

208
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,720
Slightly.

209
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,660
Slightly.

210
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,460
Slight brake. Yes.

211
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,100
I'm panicked sitting in your car.

212
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,380
Okay, dad, I'll drive faster.

213
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,510
Let's go back early.

214
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,790
How is it, boss?

215
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,930
Are you satisfied?

216
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,900
Not bad.

217
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,180
The size is just right.

218
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,800
Of course.

219
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,659
You are the one who bought it.

220
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,920
You...

221
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,830
You were tortured again today?

222
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,300
I'm used to it.

223
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,800
As long as I don't get married one day,

224
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,670
my dad would rather

225
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,770
put me on his belt.

226
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,140
In another way,

227
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,380
it's actually

228
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,280
a sweet burden.

229
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,330
Look at me.

230
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,690
I can only see my dad

231
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,750
a few times a year.

232
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,860
Sometimes I envy that

233
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,290
your family is so lively.

234
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,290
Thinking from another perspective.

235
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,890
I need to learn that from you.

236
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,060
Still studying at this hour?

237
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,450
Yes.

238
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,820
I still have

239
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,300
some product selection plans to read today.

240
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,020
I didn't expect

241
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,260
I still need to learn so many things at this time.

242
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,460
Think in another way.

243
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,230
You won't have dementia

244
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,160
when you are old.

245
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,500
What are you talking about?

246
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,960
Who will  be stupid easily?

247
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,000
Sister.

248
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,460
Yin Yibo, what are you doing?

249
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:30,930
I...

250
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,860
Aunt Lan asked me to bring you milk.

251
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,220
Why didn't you knock?

252
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,010
I knocked for a long time.

253
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,100
You didn't hear it.

254
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,370
I heard you giggling inside.

255
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,710
Who giggled?

256
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,780
You. You giggled.

257
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,510
Enough.

258
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,640
You may leave.

259
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,660
Yin Yibo, he...

260
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,380
Sister.

261
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,840
What now?

262
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,340
Sister.

263
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,910
Tell me the truth.

264
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,730
You and my brother-in-law...

265
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,540
The thing between you two.

266
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,980
Dad came to me today.

267
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,670
Why didn't you stop him for me?

268
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,820
I can stop him for one time.

269
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,650
I cannot stop him every time.

270
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,860
I advise you to

271
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,990
think of a solution.

272
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,340
You'll always help your sister,

273
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,780
right?

274
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,460
Of course.

275
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,370
But,

276
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,230
you need to pay more.

277
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,020
You're so greedy, aren't you?

278
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,550
I...

279
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,400
Have some milk.

280
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,130
I'm leaving.

281
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,710
Okay.

282
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,460
Good night.

283
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,590
Good luck tomorrow.

284
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,690
The latest Summer Parasol.

285
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,690
Next,

286
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,670
let's experience it on our own.

287
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,720
This smell.

288
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,100
I've already felt it.

289
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,830
But to experience

290
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,220
the real feeling...

291
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,270
This is a bit far from

292
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,940
the performance assessment

293
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,140
set by Yike and Frank.

294
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:39,860
I wonder

295
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,950
what will happen

296
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,080
when Yike go to report this time?

297
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,530
It's the first day.

298
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,820
It's a no-weight

299
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,320
new account's broadcast.

300
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,150
Yurou's sales

301
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,620
has already been pretty good.

302
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,380
As for Xiaomian,

303
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,880
at least it's not zero, right?

304
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,430
Yes, it's not zero.

305
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,100
But if we keep the performance like this,

306
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,940
to be honest,

307
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,980
it's hard for us

308
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,140
to finish our performance requirements.

309
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,740
Xiaomian,

310
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,380
why don’t you try

311
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,150
to change your style next time?

312
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,740
Next time,

313
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,000
don't try funny style.

314
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,500
In fact, there are

315
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,790
many audiences in Xiaomian's live room.

316
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,940
I think

317
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,940
as long as there are audiences,

318
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,920
it's possible to convert it

319
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,300
to purchase rate.

320
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,220
Yes.

321
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,390
I'm a

322
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,620
a popular live streamer anyway, right?

323
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,090
It seems that popularity

324
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,060
is not absolute.

325
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,160
As long as no one buys stuff,

326
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,690
everything will be in vain.

327
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,340
Xiaomian,

328
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,840
I watched your replay.

329
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,090
You chatted with your fans

330
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,770
in the live room for three hours,

331
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,060
but you didn't even mention

332
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,940
the price

333
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,300
and promotion methods.

334
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,100
You really should think of a way

335
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,430
to recommend products.

336
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,400
I know.

337
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,380
But I'm

338
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,840
a popular live streamer.

339
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,720
My fans are coming for me.

340
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
I have to chat

341
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,070
with everyone, right?

342
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,630
What if I

343
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,860
scare everyone away?

344
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,380
If I scare them away,

345
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,970
how can I sell things?

346
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,950
Right?

347
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,920
Yike.

348
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,250
Yike.

349
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,480
Yike, are you okay?

350
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,740
Was Frank mad at you?

351
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,830
No.

352
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,320
It's just a normal report.

353
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,350
He understood

354
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,460
it's our first live stream.

355
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,190
There must be a lot of problems.

356
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,050
But I just checked

357
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,930
the backstage data.

358
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,100
The time of our live stream yesterday

359
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,730
was from 2 to 5 p.m.

360
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,390
During this period,

361
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,770
people are at work and school.

362
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,460
So there won't be many people

363
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,920
watching live streaming.

364
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,020
I've also studied

365
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,670
some top live streamers online.

366
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,740
Their time of live stream

367
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,460
usually

368
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,520
is between 7 to 10 p.m.

369
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,220
This period is actually

370
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,170
the most popular.

371
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,230
But this period

372
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,340
has been occupied by

373
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,450
many top live streamers.

374
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,380
So I'm thinking

375
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,340
if our live stream

376
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,300
can be switched to noon,

377
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,790
between 12 to 2 p.m.?

378
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,660
During this period,

379
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,580
people are having a lunch break.

380
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,620
They can eat

381
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,780
and play with their phone

382
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,970
and watch live streaming.

383
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,340
But in this way,

384
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,100
it may affect

385
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,430
our lunch break.

386
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,290
No problem.

387
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,190
I can do it.

388
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,020
We can do it too.

389
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,470
Me, no problem.

390
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,290
OK.

391
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,970
From today onwards.

392
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,180
Hurry up

393
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,310
and get ready.

394
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:58,980
After the live streaming,

395
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,490
I will treat you lunch, okay?

396
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,060
Okay.

397
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:01,710
Come on.

398
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,640
Thank you, Yike.

399
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,160
Come on.

400
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,780
Come on!

401
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,420
Everybody, come on! Come on!

402
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,340
Mr. Xie.

403
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,950
It will not be cheap

404
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,820
for such quality products

405
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,690
in the market.

406
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,300
I think their cost performance ratio

407
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,160
is really high.

408
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,150
Guangxi,

409
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,540
this thing

410
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,920
is really good.

411
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,050
Thank you for your appreciation.

412
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:39,900
But,

413
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,160
you see,

414
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,060
this is not a small project.

415
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,660
How about this?

416
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,540
I'll take this proposal

417
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,130
back to the company

418
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,240
and discuss it

419
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,300
with our project department.

420
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,830
Mr. Xie.

421
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,580
You’ve seen our strength.

422
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,510
Dad Chen,

423
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,040
are there some other companies

424
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,500
waiting for our proposal?

425
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,390
Many.

426
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,460
Mr. Xie, I’m sorry.

427
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,280
Don’t.

428
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,210
Don't take it away.

429
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,180
Look, this is the internal information

430
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,040
for reference.

431
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,230
I'm sorry.

432
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,220
Look at you.

433
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,660
Chen Ye.

434
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,650
Guangxi.

435
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,860
You're rushing.

436
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,390
We need time

437
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,220
to sign the contract.

438
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,090
No need.

439
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,620
I just brought it

440
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,780
with me when I went out.

441
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,910
What a coincidence.

442
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,500
[Contract]

443
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,780
It's not a big deal.

444
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,440
Come on. Sit down.

445
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,060
Sit down.

446
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,020
Send the deposit

447
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,970
to them now.

448
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:44,920
Okay.

449
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,900
Mr. Chen.

450
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,180
This time,

451
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,250
I've made an exception.

452
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,900
I hope everyone here

453
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,710
won’t let me down.

454
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,420
Mr. Xie.

455
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,020
I promise you.

456
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,450
This values more

457
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,150
than it does.

458
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,650
It's worth it.

459
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,780
The countdown of live streaming.

460
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,950
Three, two, one.

461
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,630
Start.

462
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,700
Hello, everyone.

463
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,790
Welcome to

464
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,020
SC's So Good Live Room.

465
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,170
I'm your live streamer, Yurou.

466
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,150
Today,

467
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,620
I've brought you many

468
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,270
great products.

469
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,300
The No.1 link

470
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,140
is the fragrance

471
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,780
I want to recommend to you highly.

472
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,420
Xiaomian, what are you doing?

473
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,130
Come back for live streaming.

474
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,110
And this fragrance

475
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,760
is very strong.

476
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,140
Xiaomian.

477
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,780
If you don’t make efforts from today,

478
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,260
you will really

479
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,150
lose.

480
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,020
Don't worry.

481
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,750
I can definitely make it today.

482
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,540
The countdown of live streaming.

483
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,040
Three.

484
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,000
Two.

485
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,850
One.

486
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,420
Start.

487
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,410
Hello, everyone.

488
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,270
Welcome to

489
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,940
my live stream room.

490
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,700
I’m your sweet live streamer,

491
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,780
Little Xiaomian.

492
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,250
I believe you’ve noticed

493
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,190
my unique style.

494
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,660
What do you think?

495
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
Isn't it cute?

496
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,900
All of you in my live stream room

497
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,150
are my "So Good" babies.

498
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,990
No.1 link

499
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,700
is the fragrance

500
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,630
I highly recommend to you.

501
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,780
This fragrance is

502
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,660
very popular this year.

503
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,480
Hope you like it. Turn it off.

504
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Xiaomain. Xiaomain.

505
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,700
Introduce products.

506
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,180
No one bought it.

507
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,750
Of course.

508
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,990
All the products today

509
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,590
are very cheap.

510
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,350
You must be generous

511
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,540
and reward me.

512
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:28,940
Alright.

513
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,220
The next link.

514
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,710
The next link

515
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,990
is our No.4 link.

516
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,940
I just introduced

517
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,820
this product to you.

518
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,810
The live streamer has such a beautiful hairstyle.

519
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,120
Can you sing us a song?

520
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,340
I'm good at singing.

521
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,350
Next.

522
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,080
Link No.19.

523
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,890
Five, four, three, two, one.

524
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,660
Okay, start.

525
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,460
There are 100 more left.

526
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,510
Hurry up.

527
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,620
Xiaomian.

528
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,260
The products.

529
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,340
The products.

530
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,980
The products.

531
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,950
Our perfume

532
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,250
is also very good.

533
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,060
It's the No.21 link.

534
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,410
This perfume.

535
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,290
This perfume

536
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,000
is our main product today.

537
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,510
Don't leave.

538
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,970
Well...

539
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
There are three urgent matters for people.

540
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,630
Well,

541
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,790
please excuse me.

542
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,619
Let our assistant streamer

543
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,089
show the products to you.

544
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,050
I'll draw cash

545
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,250
for you when I'm back, okay?

546
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:18,980
Don’t leave.

547
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,619
Xiaomian.

548
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,140
No.

549
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,550
I won't lose.

550
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,160
Our live streaming data

551
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,070
is out again.

552
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,530
Xiaomian’s data is great.

553
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,580
She’s improved a lot.

554
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,340
Praise.

555
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,880
Impressive.

556
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,460
Our comedian

557
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,770
is very aggressive today.

558
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,500
Have you used cheating tricks?

559
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,820
Of course I'm good.

560
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,560
I'm the sales representative

561
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,260
of our live stream department.

562
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,060
How can you do it without me?

563
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,560
Awesome. Awesome.

564
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,100
Xiaomian’s data

565
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,240
is really good today.

566
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,840
Looks like I need to review it

567
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,090
and learn more from Xiaomian.

568
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,250
OK. Let’s eat first and then review.

569
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,120
Let's eat.

570
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,030
Let's go.

571
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,630
Why isn't she angry?

572
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,300
Why are you

573
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,430
so competitive?

574
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,020
We are colleagues.

575
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,460
It's a fair competition.

576
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,590
Let's go and eat.

577
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,490
Thank you. Thank you.

578
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,860
Xia Xiaomian.

579
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,220
Why are you here again?

580
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,690
Also,

581
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,480
what's wrong with your face?

582
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Are you allergic?

583
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,210
Brother.

584
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,210
It's an emergency. It's a matter of life and death.

585
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,800
No.

586
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,780
I've read the contract of sharing a house

587
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,980
you sent me last time.

588
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,900
I can't do it.

589
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,030
Brother.

590
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,090
I know it won't work to be a mistress.

591
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,590
Can you lend me some money

592
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,680
for the emergency?

593
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,580
Borrow money?

594
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,630
Don't you have a proper job?

595
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,300
Why are you asking me who don't have a job

596
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,540
for money?

597
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,090
In the live streamer competition,

598
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,850
I put my own money in to buy the products

599
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,930
to compete with others.

600
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,140
I can't help it.

601
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,540
Faces are more

602
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,860
important than life.

603
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,540
No way.

604
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,460
Brother, stop looking at the shoes.

605
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,020
Don't move.

606
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,260
Don't touch my precious.

607
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,990
Listen to me.

608
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,540
Listen to me.

609
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,370
Okay, go ahead.

610
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,670
Brother, take a seat.

611
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,260
Sit down.

612
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:05,990
I

613
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,020
was a beauty live streamer.

614
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,300
What I'm best at

615
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,060
is makeup and becoming beautiful.

616
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,370
Selling perfume

617
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,210
is about fragrance.

618
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,460
I'm really not good at it.

619
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,500
Of course.

620
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,250
It requires skills, okay?

621
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,300
What skill? Teach me.

622
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,780
No, don't fool me.

623
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,540
Brother.

624
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,290
No.

625
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,370
If my sister knows

626
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,180
I do live streaming.

627
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,510
I'll be killed.

628
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,040
Also, I'm warning you.

629
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,150
If others find out

630
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,030
about this,

631
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,780
we will break up.

632
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,640
We can’t be brothers anymore.

633
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,700
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

634
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,620
Have a happy life and a happy family.

635
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,190
Wish you prosperity.

636
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,240
Here it is.

637
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,460
We have money!

638
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,220
Baba, can we

639
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:05,910
have bonus?

640
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,070
Yes, we must.

641
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,660
We must.

642
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,180
Baba,

643
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,300
can we take a vacation now?

644
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,960
Of course.

645
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,940
Where are you going?

646
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,540
It's vacation.

647
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,420
Get lost.

648
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,860
Those who are gone can't attend

649
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,950
the next activity.

650
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,630
Baba,

651
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,780
I know

652
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,640
a good RV camping base.

653
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,980
Shall we

654
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,260
go camping together this weekend?

655
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,950
Camping?

656
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,430
Will that cost a lot?

657
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,410
Absolutely not

658
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,850
more than the deposit just now.

659
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,780
Spending money occasionally

660
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,370
is also helpful for the team building.

661
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,370
That makes sense.

662
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,760
OK. Camping. Camping.

663
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,330
Camping this weekend.

664
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,180
There's bird chirping,

665
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,610
and fragrance of flowers.

666
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,980
I'll meet my fairy Jiang Man.

667
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,020
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

668
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,680
Baba, can I bring a girl?

669
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,750
Do you have a companion?

670
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,730
Hello, mom.

671
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,480
I'm sorry.

672
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,550
My mom called me.

673
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,390
Take them. Take them.

674
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,890
Give you an exception.

675
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,750
Be happy.

676
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,230
Thank you, Baba.

677
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,190
You're welcome.

678
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,980
Let's go home.

679
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,110
It's happy to have a dream.

680
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,620
We signed a contract

681
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,820
with Mars Animation.

682
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,280
Let's celebrate tonight.

683
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,780
One piece.

684
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,340
Two pieces.

685
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,850
Three pieces.

686
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,900
Four pieces and five pieces.

687
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,790
How much is it?

688
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,760
It's 88 yuan in total.

689
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,400
Eighty eight, and a big gift.

690
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,710
Please click No.5 link.

691
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,460
Five, four, three, two, one.

692
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,550
Here's the link.

693
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,760
A hot celebration meal.

694
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,350
I'm sorry.

695
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,220
We agreed that I would celebrate for you.

696
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,340
And you prepared it for me.

697
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,070
No.

698
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,980
Don't look at it.

699
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,100
Although it's instant noodles,

700
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,150
there are

701
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,300
lotus root, meatballs

702
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,160
and oden in it.

703
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,980
It's so rich.

704
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,820
The richest celebration instant noodles.

705
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,180
Be careful. It's hot.

706
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,560
What are you watching?

707
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,080
I'm watching live streaming.

708
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:23,970
What?

709
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,220
Is it still not good?

710
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,980
It's better than before

711
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,550
after we change the time.

712
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,580
But there's still some distance

713
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,380
to the performance assessment.

714
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,250
I'm studying

715
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,580
the top live streamers.

716
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,060
I don't understand

717
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,820
what he said.

718
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,060
What it means to eat lotus root and shrimp?

719
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
Do you know what it means?

720
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,320
Is what he said

721
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,670
your shrimp is lacking some pig heart?

722
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,100
What does it mean?

723
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,030
It seems to be,

724
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,620
look.

725
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,540
It means killing people by stabbing his heart.

726
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,310
You're the best.

727
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,460
You can do everything well.

728
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,060
Not really.

729
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,260
You can just check online.

730
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,990
You'll find it in a few seconds.

731
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,240
I mean,

732
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,230
don't stress yourself out.

733
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,860
For example, work and life

734
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,880
needs to be adjusted properly

735
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,540
so that to have double result with half efforts.

736
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,730
This weekend, our company

737
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,700
is going camping at the RV base this weekend.

738
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,620
Two days and one night.

739
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,680
Do you want to come?

740
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,950
You go with your colleagues.

741
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,460
Why should I go with you?

742
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,540
There are mountains and rivers.

743
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,460
Maybe it's beneficial

744
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,260
to have better ideas

745
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,320
if you have a different environment.

746
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,530
Fine.

747
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,780
I'll consider it.

748
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,340
I...

749
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,120
rented another recreational vehicle on my own.

750
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,270
Only you and I.

751
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,180
Going camping,

752
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,910
and he booked an extra vehicle?

753
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,900
Isn't it too fast?

754
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,260
No.

755
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,620
I have to

756
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,850
get rid of my eye bags.

757
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,540
Wait.

758
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,620
Did I eat too much tonight?

759
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,630
Have you made up your mind?

760
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,640
Don't rush me.

761
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,710
No rush.

762
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,880
Let's go camping.

763
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,070
Time to eat.

764
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,430
Sister, hurry up.

765
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,980
Half an hour has passed and you are still not out?

766
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,010
What's the rush?

767
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,820
Got it.

768
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,190
I can't hold it anymore.

769
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,070
Coming.

770
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,600
What happened

771
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,660
to your hair?

772
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,540
Smells good.

773
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,760
Go away.

774
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,320
Ke.

775
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,610
Time for breakfast.

776
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,460
Aunt Lan, I'm running out of time.

777
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,990
What do you want for dinner?

778
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,020
Tonight？

779
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,180
Pig trotter soup.

780
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,180
Pig trotter soup?

781
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,290
Okay.

782
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,570
I'm leaving.

783
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,160
Bye.

784
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:54,820
Morning.

785
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,060
Morning, Ke.

786
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,790
Morning, Ke.

787
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,360
I'm sorry.

788
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,830
It's the peak of work.

789
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,580
I don't know when the

790
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,780
next shift will come.

791
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,650
-Luckily, I made it. -Bravo.

792
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,370
We agreed to gain weight together.

793
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,310
Why did you go to the gym secretly?

794
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,490
How did you know?

795
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,540
You dumbbells, protein powder.

796
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,200
Only numb people cannot tell.

797
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,560
I have to stay up for many nights.

798
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,220
So I exercise to improve my strength in advance.

799
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,160
Okay.

800
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,340
We are going camping this weekend.

801
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,930
And you are making preparations for it.

802
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,900
The problem is

803
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,000
who are you taking?

804
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,140
If you don't tell me, I'll regard that you are taking someone.

805
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,900
Height, weight,

806
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,820
age, measurements,

807
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,700
all to me.

808
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:19,990
Say it.

809
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,190
Done.

810
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,260
It's not your style.

811
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,890
Last time when you were in a relationship,

812
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,850
you showed your girlfriend

813
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,590
to me

814
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,660
at no time

815
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,850
and showed off to me.

816
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,380
What happened this time?

817
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,780
I know.

818
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,740
It must be that the woman...

819
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,620
is old, ugly and wrinkled.

820
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,480
-Excuse me. -So you are embarrassed to bring her to me.

821
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,810
Guangxi.

822
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,470
Go home for dinner tonight.

823
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,620
Your sister?

824
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,480
Why did she step on me?

825
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,900
You deserve it for the words.

826
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,590
Take it.

827
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,690
I didn't say anything about her.

828
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,870
Brother, are you there?

829
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,660
Answer me.

830
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,180
Why don't you teach me?

831
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,060
The thing you asked me

832
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,260
to bring to you last time.

833
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:09,990
Here. Got it.

834
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,280
Thank you.

835
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,510
Morning.

836
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,010
Yike.

837
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:15,870
Morning.

838
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,580
Sister.

839
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,330
Yike.

840
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,400
You are different today.

841
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,120
You look so young.

842
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,700
If I say you are 18 years old in high school,

843
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,100
people would believe me.

844
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,420
A light smell of women.

845
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,660
N0.5, right?

846
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,660
What is the good news?

847
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,190
Share it.

848
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,660
Yes.

849
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,000
Nothing good.

850
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,450
Our live streaming data

851
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,450
has not been good.

852
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,510
You came up with

853
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,740
a new plan?

854
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,820
Why don't we let Yike

855
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,880
be a live streamer?

856
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,860
She knows products and the market.

857
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,260
Maybe she will

858
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,250
open a new stage for us.

859
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,950
Yes, that's right.

860
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,630
Good idea.

861
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,310
You are a good candidate of live streamers.

862
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:55,510
No.

863
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,500
If Yike becomes a live streamer,

864
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,830
won't you lose your job?

865
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,740
It's okay.

866
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,730
I become a live streamer?

867
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,560
No.

868
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
That's not right.

869
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,580
Something must be wrong.

870
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,530
Delicious.

871
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,540
They only add meat, not noodles in this store.

872
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:10,900
So cruel.

873
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,540
Give us a good review.

874
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,980
We must eat as much as the money.

875
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,780
Let's go tomorrow.

876
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,210
Of course. Go.

877
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,980
But why do I want a cup of coffee?

878
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,190
Americano, iced.

879
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,750
Iced Americano. Absolutely iced Americano.

880
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,060
Miss Jiang Man,

881
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,900
Have you had lunch?

882
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,760
What kind of fate is it?

883
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,920
I was thinking of you and I just met you.

884
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,630
Guangxi, we're doing

885
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,770
research for male perfume.

886
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,020
Try the perfume for me.

887
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,500
I don't know much about this.

888
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,930
I won't ask you if you know it.

889
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,520
You try it.

890
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,630
I know. Let me try.

891
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,250
You don't need it.

892
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,490
That's not what I meant.

893
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,560
I mean this perfume

894
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,710
is not suitable.

895
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,170
Try this.

896
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:46,500
Okay.

897
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,950
Guangxi, smell it.

898
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,980
I'm in a rush for the draft.

899
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
Take your time chatting.

900
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,710
I'm leaving.

901
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,050
Guangxi.

902
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,710
The one you chose

903
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,340
is indeed the most suitable one for me.

904
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,020
Sister.

905
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,300
Tomorrow is weekend.

906
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,020
Do you want to

907
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,080
go camping with us?

908
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,940
I sincerely invite you

909
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,140
as my companion.

910
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,460
I have plans tomorrow.

911
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,700
And even if I go,

912
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,700
I won't go with you.

913
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,030
Give me back my perfume.

914
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,590
I will give this back to you

915
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,230
Poor people don't deserve it.

916
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,430
I'd better spray the toilet water.

917
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,120
Well,

918
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,420
this smells just like the toilet water my mom gave me.

919
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,090
Smell it.

920
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,450
It's not what she really means.

921
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,820
Can't you see that?

922
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,560
If Jiang Man is the character of the story,

923
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,310
what's the main reason that

924
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,800
caused her sudden change?

925
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,340
What?

926
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,420
Look.

927
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,420
We had a good chat just now.

928
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,260
When Xu Guangxi was here,

929
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,880
Jiang Man was happy.

930
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,310
After Xu Guangxi left.

931
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,320
Jiang Man suddenly got upset.

932
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,280
And then?

933
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,510
Then...

934
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,710
She just left.

935
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,930
What about me?

936
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,460
Go to work.

937
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,280
Go to work.

938
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,610
The toilet water

939
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,010
really smells like this.

940
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,970
Man,

941
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,130
you had a crush on

942
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,100
the handsome guy

943
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,130
on the 22nd floor.

944
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,070
Now you give up

945
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,770
so easily?

946
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,650
I don't devote much time

947
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,960
to things

948
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,660
that are not effective for a long time.

949
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,930
The cost is too high.

950
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,860
You're right.

951
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,500
But what if he was just

952
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,690
shy to invite you?

953
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,940
Then he deserves to miss

954
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,090
such an excellent girl like me.

955
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,750
He will definitely regret it.

956
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,780
You think too much.

957
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,740
Although Mars is quite satisfied

958
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,800
with our proposal,

959
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,810
I still have some suggestions

960
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,870
on the characters.

961
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,170
I hope the heroine

962
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,370
can be more friendly.

963
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,970
Chen Musen, enough.

964
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,030
Here. Everybody, look at the screen.

965
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,460
So, I made some adjustments

966
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,480
to the heroine.

967
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,980
Here. The one on the left.

968
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Take a look.

969
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,660
This is the first adjustment I made.

970
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,910
I also adjusted

971
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,860
the hair color

972
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,380
and pushed the lines of her face.

973
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,840
It'll look more friendly.

974
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,460
I stretched her body proportion a bit.

975
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,780
It makes her look

976
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,340
more like a fairy.

977
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,380
Hello, mom.

978
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,750
I'll be right there.

979
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,370
Ten minutes.

980
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,500
Our company is good.

981
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,310
Enough, Xu Guangxi.

982
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,220
What?

983
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,700
How can you let my little fairy

984
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,900
dressed so exposedly?

985
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,750
What?

986
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,590
I fell in love with her first.

987
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,240
I know

988
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,460
she has her freedom.

989
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,730
She has the right to choose.

990
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,220
-You... -You have your freedom.

991
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,610
I won't let you give up your love

992
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,770
for your brother.

993
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,660
So I wish you happiness.

994
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,980
Wish you a happy life.

995
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,300
I...

996
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,730
But I only have one thing.

997
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,900
Be good to her.

998
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,040
Otherwise, I won't let you go.

999
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,380
Which fairy is it?

1000
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,900
My fairy Jiang Man.

1001
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,570
She refused my invitation

1002
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,890
and said she wanted to go with you.

1003
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,410
You two...

1004
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,540
Nothing happened

1005
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,300
between us.

1006
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,470
I have no feelings

1007
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,900
to your little fairy.

1008
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,430
You promise?

1009
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,620
I promise.

1010
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,060
Who are you inviting then?

1011
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,310
I've decided. I'll go.

1012
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,140
-In order not to be divulged... -Why do you care?

1013
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,740
I might need reinforcement.

1014
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,659
Meticulousness

1015
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,199
leads to great things.

1016
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,409
Are you free after work?

1017
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,620
Give me an hour. I need your help.

1018
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,010
Xiaomian, what are you doing?

1019
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,010
Nothing.

1020
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,460
Work. Work.

1021
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,370
What are you doing?

1022
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,739
Why are you walking around in front of me?

1023
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,570
Have you finished memorizing the script?

1024
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,550
Not yet.

1025
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,620
Go and recite it.

1026
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,820
I will check it later.

1027
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,670
Brother.

1028
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,780
Please help me one more time.

1029
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,940
Can you bear to see me

1030
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,860
get fired as soon as I entered the company?

1031
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,620
It's better to teach someone to fish

1032
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,860
than to give them fish.

1033
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,190
You're quite cultured.

1034
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,940
Brother,

1035
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,580
for the sake of

1036
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,880
our friendship.

1037
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,340
No way.

1038
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,440
We're not friends.

1039
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,820
I have a piece of information

1040
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,930
about your sister.

1041
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,250
About my sister?

1042
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,580
What information?

1043
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,530
How can you have prejudice?

1044
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,820
When it comes to your sister,

1045
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,460
your eyes

1046
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,860
are widely open.

1047
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,120
When it comes to me,

1048
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,540
you just ignore me.

1049
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,210
Whatever. You can choose to tell me or not.

1050
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,650
I'll tell you.

1051
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,490
I think something is wrong with your sister.

1052
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,720
Why?

1053
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,290
I think she's in a relationship.

1054
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,630
You're awesome.

1055
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,890
My sister is indeed in a relationship,

1056
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,800
for four years.

1057
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,520
My brother-in-law is in Beijing.

1058
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,530
No.

1059
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,970
I mean she is in a relationship

1060
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,340
right now.

1061
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,960
And her boyfriend is around her.

1062
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,620
Don't talk nonsense.

1063
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,270
Stop joking.

1064
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,260
How could my sister

1065
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
cheat?

1066
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,200
Brother.

1067
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,980
I don't know

1068
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,240
whether she's cheating or not.

1069
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,710
But you should get updated for

1070
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,420
your sister's new relationship.

1071
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,640
You have to trust

1072
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,880
a girl's sixth sense.

1073
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:22,830
When a girl

1074
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,660
starts to dress herself up,

1075
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,540
wear beautiful clothes,

1076
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,330
and put on beautiful makeups,

1077
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,150
like pouting lips,

1078
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,060
she basically announced

1079
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,690
to the world that

1080
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,980
she's going on a date.

1081
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,000
What are pouting lips?

1082
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,100
Pouting lips.

1083
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,670
It's like mine.

1084
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,300
I don't want to talk to you.

1085
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,030
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

1086
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,480
If she really has

1087
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,440
a new boyfriend,

1088
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,710
teach me the secret of live streaming.

1089
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,870
See?

1090
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,460
You don't dare to bet with me.

1091
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,860
Are you afraid of losing?

1092
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,590
I'll bet with you.

1093
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
If I lose,

1094
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,640
I'll be your assistant for free.

1095
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,800
Deal.

1096
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,800
Deal.

1097
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,670
It seems that

1098
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,580
it's not easy to do live streaming.

1099
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,310
Even you have to

1100
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,600
be the face and start the business again.

1101
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,910
Why do you also think

1102
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,400
I want to be live streamer?

1103
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,620
Isn't fashion a reincarnation?

1104
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,550
What's wrong with my girl‘s style?

1105
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
You said you need a favor. What is it?

1106
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,880
I really...

1107
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,750
I...

1108
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,890
I told you to enjoy your love

1109
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,790
not to ask you make efforts for the wrong one.

1110
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,180
Just be yourself.

1111
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,510
Yike.

1112
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,410
Can I wear this?

1113
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,750
It suits you.

1114
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,600
You spend your time of dating

1115
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,040
on shopping.

1116
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,970
Is Xu Guangxi okay with that?

1117
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,530
No.

1118
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,580
When did you know?

1119
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,140
I've known you for so long.

1120
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,370
I've never seen you wear

1121
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,700
such a style of jewelry?

1122
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,500
What a coincidence.

1123
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,560
I saw the same design

1124
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,970
on Xu Guangxi's hand.

1125
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,100
Matching bracelets?

1126
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,220
No.

1127
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,520
Besides,

1128
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,480
your friend stories

1129
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,230
are so detailed.

1130
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,660
If I still can’t guess it,

1131
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,340
how can I continue being your counsellor?

1132
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,380
You know me well.

1133
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,050
Of course.

1134
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,650
Waiter, wrap it up for me.

1135
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,230
Okay.

1136
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,850
So,

1137
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,110
it's not that simple

1138
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,340
to ask me to go shopping with you, right?

1139
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,230
I do have another request.

1140
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,430
Tell me.

1141
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,030
This weekend,

1142
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,240
Guangxi's company

1143
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,060
is going camping for team building.

1144
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,460
He asked me to go with him.

1145
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,380
Can you come with me?

1146
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,870
Such a healthy

1147
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,100
and green activity.

1148
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,410
No.

1149
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,580
I can only beg you now.

1150
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,860
Go, Yiran.

1151
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,960
No.

1152
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,410
Our friendship is so hypocritical.

1153
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,320
You or me?

1154
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,200
You just used me

1155
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,370
as an excuse.

1156
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,940
I'm not going.

1157
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,090
Besides,

1158
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,850
I would feel sick

1159
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,100
to see some middle-aged man.

1160
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,900
If you don't like him,

1161
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,380
just ignore him.

1162
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,860
I haven't seen you avoid

1163
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,970
any man.

1164
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,060
Are you really...

1165
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,830
Impossible.

1166
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,370
I'm not going anyway.

1167
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,230
Hello, it's packed.

1168
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,790
Coming.

1169
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,740
Am I not a good friend?

1170
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,110
Am I really not a good friend

1171
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,590
if I don't go?

1172
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,660
You're right.

1173
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,060
He's just an uncle.

1174
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,420
I'm not afraid of him.

1175
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,630
Did you get a helper?

1176
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,490
What's wrong?

1177
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,590
What happened

1178
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,330
between Chen Ye and Yiran?

1179
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,900
When it comes to Chen Ye,

1180
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,280
Yiran is very angry.

1181
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,210
It's predictable.

1182
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,190
It's like Mars hitting the Earth.

1183
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:38,950
How about

1184
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,330
we don't go?

1185
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,220
After all, it's your company's team building.

1186
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,770
I don't want Yiran

1187
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,130
to cover for me.

1188
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,880
Actually, it doesn't matter

1189
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,920
if Yiran doesn't go.

1190
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,980
Sister and brother

1191
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,750
are good covers for each other.

1192
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,830
Besides,

1193
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,350
I don't have many friends.

1194
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,780
What should I do

1195
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,820
if others know?

1196
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,080
You just

1197
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,370
think for others

1198
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,730
about different stuff,

1199
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,820
except for your own feelings.

1200
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,050
Actually, I just think

1201
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,690
you've been too tired lately.

1202
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,830
You need to go out and relax.

1203
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,320
What should I do?

1204
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,000
Don't think too much.

1205
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,710
Ms. Qin has decided to help you.

1206
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,770
See you tomorrow.

1207
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,310
Ms. Qin has changed her mind.

1208
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,140
My sincerity must

1209
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,140
have touched her.

1210
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,620
Isn't that my sincerity?

1211
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,220
Isn't your sincerity

1212
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,450
my sincerity?

1213
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,580
My sincerity is my sincerity.

1214
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,530
Your sincerity is also mine.

1215
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,680
OK.

1216
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,110
Yeah.

1217
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,820
Yours is yours.

1218
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,620
Mine is yours.

1219
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,900
What? Say it again?

1220
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,380
♫Travels to the end♫

1221
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,330
♫Of the whole universe♫

1222
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,070
