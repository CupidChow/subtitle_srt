16
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,900
You heard everything?

17
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,539
I know

18
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,720
no matter in life

19
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,039
or on work,

20
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:54,870
there are too many

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,360
things recently.

00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,740
But being with you

23
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,890
makes me feel at ease.

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,490
Maybe it's because

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,670
sometimes I don't even

26
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,240
know myself well.

27
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,630

Do you think

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,820
I'll only watch you dance?

43
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,579
Then did you watch others dance?

No.

Why are you here?

54
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,090
You disappeared for so many days.

55
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,890
I couldn't find you anywhere.

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,960
And you didn't go online in the live stream room.

57

I'm worried about you.

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,470
Xu Guangxi told you

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,100
I'm here.

60
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,340
I didn't mean to ask about you.

61
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,890
It's just that you suddenly disappeared.

62
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,180
It's normal to worry about you.

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,860
Right?

64
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,140
Well,

65
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,030
did Guangxi tell you

66
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,640
how's my dad?

67
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,420
If you're worried about him,

68
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,970
you can just go to the hospital.

69
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,430
I can't go to the hospital.

70
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,250
I'll cause him trouble.

71
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,329
Of course not.

72
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,420
One more person,

73
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,730
one more helper.

74
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,579
You have no idea

75
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,340
how stubborn my dad is.

76
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,660
If I help him,

77
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,380
we would argue about many other things.

78
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,930
Yibo,

79
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,660
you have no idea

80
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,820
how much I envy you.

81
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,940
You have a home.

82
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,460
You can eat hot dishes.

83
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,580
And your dad nags you.

84
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,900
Unlike me,

85
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,160
since young,

86
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,030
I've been seeing my dad on a business trip

87
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,650
or on his way to a business trip.

88
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,860
It's lucky that

89
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,390
he could call me once a week.

90
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,790
I envy you. OK?

91
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,620
You don't know how lucky you are.

92
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,630
My sister and I

93
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,620
are old.

94
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,590
But my dad still treats us

95
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,990
as three-year-old kids.

96
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,390
And he has to know

97
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,660
every detail about us.

98
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,250
If it were you, would you have gone crazy?

99
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,990
But if you were me,

100
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,000
you would know my feelings.

101
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,170
When I had

102
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,630
the appendicitis surgery abroad,

103
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,130
I was alone.

104
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,020
Don't you blame them?

105
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,340
No.

106
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,380
Because I love my dad so much.

107
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,500
Because I know

108
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,740
it's his first time

109
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,350
to be a dad.

110
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,720
No matter what he does,

111
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,050
he loves me.

112
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,280
He can't be with me

113
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,310
but

114
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,140
he is making money for his family.

115
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,280
Just like your father.

116
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,790
Although he will discipline you

117
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,700
and nag you,

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,470
that's because he cares about you.

119
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,130
So I think

120
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,180
if family members

121
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,300
love each other,

122
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,010
they should show it directly,

123
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,620
and they shouldn't hide it in hearts.

124
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,860
Besides,

125
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,450
I'm not just saying.

126
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,130
This

127
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,650
is my salary this month.

128
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,300
Consider it as a love loan.

129
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,500
Interest-free.

130
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,290
What do you mean?

131
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,660
Well, friendship will do.

137
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,980
I'll raise money in my own.

138
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,740
Bye.

139
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,700
Yibo,

140
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,350
if you encounter any trouble again,

141
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,820
you must tell me.

142
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,460
Be gentle.

143
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,650
These are limited editions.

144
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,070
They took me a lot of effort

145
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,130
to get.

146
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,050
You...

147
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,659
This is the centenary edition

148
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,830
with artificial diamonds.

149
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,460
How can you shake it? They are  artificial diamonds.

150
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
It's easy to fall off.

151
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,220
Good Man.

152
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,130
For this pair of shoes,

153
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,380
I almost fought with others.

154
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,820
So

155
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,900
sell it or not?

156
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,460
Yes.

157
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,850
But let me tell you,

158
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,020
well,

159
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,340
I'm

160
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,040
in bad financial condition.

161
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,130
When I earn the money back,

162
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,660
I will redeem them.

163
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,330
Got it.

164
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,100
I've transferred

165
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,700
to you through Alipay.

166
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,650
I didn't treat you badly.

167
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,620
Be gentle.

168
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,100
One more thing.

169
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,180
Can you

170
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,720
find a good place for them?

171
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,220
Please.

172
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,860
Be gentle.

173
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,420
Jin Lan.

174
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,980
Stop working around.

175
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,620
Come and talk with me.

176
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,900
What's wrong?

177
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,990
We used to say

178
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,940
we will accompany each other when we're old.

179
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,030
How come I got

180
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,940
such a disease?

181
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,340
What are you talking about?

182
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,980
Listen.

183
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,700
What if

184
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,580
some day...

185
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,090
Okay, there's no "what if".

186
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,920
-You'll be fine. -Let me finish.

187
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,450
I mean just in case.

188
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,740
There's a card

189
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,620
in my blue jacket.

190
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,860
I secretly saved some money

191
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,659
all these years.

192
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,930
I thought

193
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,910
when the kids grow up,

194
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
and leave home,

195
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,460
I'll take you to travel.

196
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,300
I saved the money to give you a surprise.

197
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,420
It's fine.

198
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,600
I'll give it to you for your retirement.

199
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,810
Also, don't take it too seriously.

200
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
If you find someone suitable,

201
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,990
get married.

202
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,380
He'd better be someone with a good temper.

203
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,520
Being together with me,

204
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,100
you've suffered for most of your life.

205
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,930
Yin, what are you talking about?

206
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,600
Have you forgotten

207
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,140
the words you said

208
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,370
when I married you?

209
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,480
You said that Jin Lan,

210
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,820
since you're in my family,

211
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,450
don't care about what others think

212
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,940
because you'll always be by my side.

213
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,340
Now,

214
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,460
I want to tell you

215
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,980
no matter what happens,

216
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,570
I will

217
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,560
be with you.

218
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,980
Yike and Guangxi

219
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,100
went to check the medical examination report.

220
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,420
As long as the report shows you're fine,

221
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,020
we can go home happily.

222
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,560
Being in hospital

223
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,820
costs kids a lot of money.

224
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,060
I'm getting old.

225
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,780
How come I became

226
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,460
a burden to our kids?

227
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,130
You do know that children are good.

228
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,210
The bill

229
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,790
was paid by Yike and Guangxi.

230
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,040
These days, Guangxi

231
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,240
has been working hard

232
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,890
to take care of you.

233
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,100
He's quite tired.

234
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,890
Guangxi is a good boy.

235
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,330
But he's

236
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,000
much younger than Ke.

237
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,680
It's really inappropriate.

238
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,760
Besides, Guangxi's still a child.

239
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,390
Tell me.

240
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,680
Yin,

241
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,730
kids have their own lives.

242
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,220
We don't need to worry, okay?

243
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,700
How can I not be worried?

244
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,940
You have to trust Guangxi.

245
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,340
Dad.

246
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,500
Aunt Lan.

247
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,280
The result is out.

248
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,540
Sister.

249
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,530
This is my private saving.

250
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,730
Dad.

251
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,320
Dad, I was wrong.

252
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,350
I didn't mean to

253
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,020
piss you off.

254
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,250
I...

255
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,440
I didn't mean to

256
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,320
get you in the hospital.

257
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,910
I just want you

258
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,140
to stop critizing me at home.

259
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,820
Also,

260
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,940
I've sold

261
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,740
all the things you don't like.

262
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,750
Sneakers, clothes, and all other things.

263
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,310
I've sold all of them.

264
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,260
You just need to cooperate with the doctor

265
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,780
for the treatment.

266
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,250
Let's get discharged as soon as possible, okay?

267
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,060
As long as you...

268
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,920
As long as you recover,

269
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,100
I promise I'll pass the postgraduate entrance exam.

270
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,650
I promise.

271
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,530
I promise to get married

272
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,300
and have a child.

273
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,940
OK, dad?

274
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,500
You must be healthy, okay?

275
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,980
When will I see my grandson?

276
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,850
You...

277
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,460
When you recover.

278
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,710
I won't treat it.

279
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,550
Why not?

280
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,700
We have money now.

281
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,210
I sold my sneakers and clothes.

282
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,930
Why are you cursing me?

283
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,900
I didn't curse you.

284
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,420
The doctor was shaking his head.

285
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,950
He said it's not optimistic.

286
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,620
You don't want me to get better,

287
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,180
right?

288
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,020
No, dad.

289
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,640
I love you.

290
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,580
Yin Yibo,

291
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,740
you must have saved a lot of money.

292
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,020
Spit out the money

293
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,270
I invested in you.

294
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,140
What do you mean?

295
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,790
Nothing.

296
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,940
Uncle is fine.

297
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,820
My mom has gone home to cook.

298
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,780
Let's go.

299
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,740
You silly boy.

300
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,450
You promised me.

301
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,430
Give birth to my grandson.

302
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,580
Pack up and go home.

303
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,980
Give me the car key. I'll drive.

304
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,240
It's okay, dad. You've just got discharged.

305
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:38,850
Let me drive.

306
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,700
That's fine.

307
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,900
I'm worried about you driving.

308
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,550
Uncle.

309
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,500
Let me do it.

310
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,610
Go.

311
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,090
Go home.

312
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,770
Why are there so many cars today?

313
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
When can we get home?

314
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,750
You...

315
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,680
Watch out!

316
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,590
Xu Guangxi, you are good.

317
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,540
This is my dad's unique skill.

318
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,330
When did you learn

319
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,020
it secretly?

320
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,990
No one has ever driven

321
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,790
without giving my dad chances

322
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,610
to give instructions.

323
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,430
Yes.

324
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,310
I can prove that.

325
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,550
When my sister just got her license,

326
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,310
as long as she drove,

327
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,080
my dad nagged her every day.

328
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,340
Shut up.

329
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,070
If you don't say anything,

330
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,740
no one will treat you as a mute.

331
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,860
It's better to stay at home.

332
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,610
I can't eat in the hospital.

333
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,130
Didn't you

334
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,740
want to go to the hospital?

335
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,290
Are you hungry now?

336
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,580
Here comes the food.

337
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,420
This time,

338
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,900
the two of them worked the hardest.

339
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,830
They have to work and take care of you.

340
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,920
Come, have a seat.

341
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,500
Time for dinner.

342
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,200
Uncle,

343
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,530
do you mind having one more pair of chopsticks?

344
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,630
In the hospital,

345
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,860
you didn't say a word when Guangxi took care of you.

346
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,500
And now you don't allow him to sit?

347
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,580
It's not like he hasn't eaten at home.

348
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,930
You want me to get him a chair.

349
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,880
Right.

350
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,980
Uncle just got discharged.

351
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,950
You guys are so pretentious.

352
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,780
Help yourselves.

353
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,660
Sit down.

354
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,180
Let's eat.

355
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,400
You must miss the food at home.

356
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,430
Eat more.

357
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,420
Here.

358
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,940
Why are there only three eggs?

359
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,010
How can we divide them?

360
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,700
Well, I haven't

361
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,830
gone to the market for days.

362
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,180
There are only three eggs in the fridge

363
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,290
so it's not enough.

364
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,100
It's okay.

365
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,580
Yike, you've worked hard. Take it.

366
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,380
Aunt Lan, you should eat.

367
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,780
Sister.

368
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,070
You're too thin. Eat more.

369
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,860
What if the typhoon

370
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,040
takes you down?

371
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,370
Guangxi, take it.

372
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,050
Uncle, please take it.

373
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,210
Alright.

374
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,510
I don't like it.

375
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,440
Eat it yourself.

376
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,090
Just eat.

377
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,560
Your uncle has high cholesterol.

378
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,540
He can't eat it.

379
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,590
It seems

380
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,020
my dad's attitude towards Guangxi

381
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,320
changed greatly.

382
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,020
He even didn't give the egg to his own son.

383
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,410
Shut up.

384
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,120
If you don't say anything,

385
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,700
no one will treat you as a mute.

386
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,420
Here.

387
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,640
Yibo, eat it.

388
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,400
Sister, I know you love me the most.

389
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,800
But I'm just joking.

390
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,030
Eggs, duck eggs, zeros like eggs.

391
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,740
They are not good symbols

392
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,360
for exam-takers like me.

393
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,020
So...

394
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,910
I mean it.

395
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,360
Eat more and gain weight.

396
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,300
Let's raise our glasses first

397
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,810
to celebrate dad's discharge.

398
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,900
Come on.

399
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,900
Dad, you can't drink.

400
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:58,780
Orange juice.

401
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,140
Here, orange juice.

402
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,980
It's too sweet to drink.

403
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,540
I'll have some tea.

404
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,890
Here.

405
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,020
Safe and sound.

406
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,200
Safe and sound, cheers!

407
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,780
Never get sick again.

408
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,540
Look at you.

409
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,100
Help yourselves.

410
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,220
In the hospital,

411
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,300
there's nothing to eat. Here.

412
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,820
Sister,

413
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,820
can I stop washing dishes today?

414
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,060
Considering you sold the shoes to save dad,

415
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,110
you can slack off once.

416
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,080
Take a rest.

417
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,860
Thank you.

418
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,700
I won't disturb

419
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,320
you two.

420
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,220
You two must be exhausted.

421
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,390
Let me do it.

422
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,300
Mom.

423
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,860
We're almost done.

424
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,280
Just take a rest.

425
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,160
Okay, I'm leaving.

426
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,460
What's wrong?

427
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,180
They are leaving.

428
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,170
And you are feeling unwell again?

429
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,020
They?

430
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
Get it straight.

431
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,640
One is my daughter,

432
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,180
and one is your son.

433
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,500
"They" are not here.

434
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,180
They can go wherever they want.

435
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,640
Don't make me angry.

436
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,530
You...

437
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,890
You're double-faced.

438
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,180
Actually,

439
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,020
you hope kids can

440
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,880
spend more time at home,

441
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,280
and you want to attract their attention.

442
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,590
Do you know

443
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,210
how much you rely on your daughter?

444
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,660
I rely on her?

445
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,690
She's not with me anymore.

446
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,940
How can I rely on her?

447
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,900
Such an ungrateful thing.

448
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,170
You...

449
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,300
What do you want?

450
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,850
Just say it.

451
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,220
Why do you keep it to yourself?

452
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,790
I am begging you.

453
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,580
Leave me alone.

454
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,420
OK?

455
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,120
Sure.

456
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,890
Leave you alone.

457
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,190
Think about it.

458
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,700
We'll leave.

459
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,860
Guangxi.

460
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,470
We don't have much food at home.

461
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,600
I want to go to the supermarket.

462
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,940
Come and help me.

463
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,130
OK, mom.

464
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,310
Yibo.

465
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,340
Aunt Lan is going to the supermarket. Come down.

466
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,930
Help me carry the things.

467
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,350
OK. Coming.

468
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,400
Hurry up.

469
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,690
Come on.

470
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,530
Let's go.

471
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,780
Let's go.

472
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,680
Let's go.

473
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,910
We're leaving.

474
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,660
Dad.

475
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,850
Let's talk.

476
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,330
I remember when I was little,

477
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,390
after dinner,

478
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,700
you and Aunt Lan would always sit here,

479
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,050
drinking tea, chatting

480
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,540
and watching TV.

481
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,740
I know actually

482
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,180
you were under a lot of pressure.

483
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,140
But look at now,

484
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,850
after so many years,

485
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,130
our family

486
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,600
is still fine.

487
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,480
Talk about yourself.

488
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,960
Just talk about yourself.

489
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,610
Why are you talking about me and Aunt Lan?

490
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,460
Guangxi

491
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,380
is a good boy.

492
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,750
But I always treat him

493
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,060
as my son.

494
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,980
You two

495
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,940
made such a mess.

496
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,740
How can Aunt Lan and I

497
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,460
change our minds suddenly.

498
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,820
Also,

499
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,670
what will our neighbours

500
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,530
think of you?

501
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm so embarrassed.

502
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,210
Dad.

503
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,700
Ke.

504
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,290
He's much younger than you.

505
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,540
It's inappropriate.

506
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,910
You should find

507
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,090
a mature man

508
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,720
who has a successful career

509
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,970
and treats you well.

510
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,350
The key is that he would give in to you.

511
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,860
Get married and have your children.

512
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,140
That's perfect.

513
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,330
If you are in a relationship

514
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,560
with Guangxi,

515
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,230
you'll have many difficulties.

516
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,260
It's not easy

517
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,520
to build up a family.

518
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,240
Most importantly,

519
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,780
ten years,

520
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,620
ten years later,

521
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,220
how old are you?

522
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,780
You'll be over 40.

523
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,580
He...

524
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,510
He'll be just over 30.

525
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,500
He'll be in his prime.

526
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,980
At that time,

527
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,060
there will be so many temptations.

528
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,220
What if something happens then?

529
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,250
Girl,

530
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,690
what will you do?

531
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,180
Tell me.

532
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,820
How can I let you be with him?

533
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,580
I'm really worried.

534
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,390
In the future,

535
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,990
I can't even sleep well.

536
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,620
Well...

537
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,790
Girl,

538
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,660
you've been the most obedient

539
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,610
since childhood.

540
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,590
How come...

541
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,500
How come you make me so worried

542
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,260
about your marriage?

543
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,690
This...

544
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,220
Dad.

545
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,300
I remember when I was young,

546
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,020
I wanted to learn dancing

547
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,810
but you didn't allow me to learn.

548
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,180
I gave up.

549
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,660
I wanted to learn piano,

550
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,780
but you didn't let me.

551
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,260
I gave up, too.

552
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,260
And there was a time

553
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,680
a classmate bullied me.

554
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,660
I really wanted to fight back.

555
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
But you secretly

556
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,480
transferred me to another school.

557
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,580
There are many things like those.

558
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,160
My major

559
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,620
and my job

560
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,260
were chosen according to your thoughts.

561
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,770
But, dad,

562
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,330
I want to make my own choice this time.

563
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,730
I want to be responsible.

564
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,540
I want to be responsible for my life.

565
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,190
Actually, I've thought about what you said.

566
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,450
I thought

567
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,730
Zelin is good.

568
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,500
He has a stable job.

569
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,650
He's a decent man.

570
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,320
Zelin proposed to me.

571
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,600
He asked me to go to Beijing with him,

572
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,270
giving up

573
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,580
my job

574
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,460
and my family.

575
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,700
And when I was with him,

576
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,620
many details in life

577
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,020
were actually very depressing

578
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,140
and inappropriate.

579
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,940
I know.

580
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
I have to

581
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,570
talk about your childhood first.

582
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,880
When you said you wanted to dance,

583
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,260
I disagreed at first.

584
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,520
I didn't want dancing to affect your study.

585
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,850
But later,

586
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,200
I paid your tuition fee.

587
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,620
That's my salaries

588
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,750
for months.

589
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,820
After paying your tuition,

590
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,810
we didn't have money any more.

591
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,280
But after paying your tuition fee for dancing,

592
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,910
you fell in love with playing piano.

593
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,790
I didn't have money to pay your tuition fees

594
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,780
so I had to stop you from learning it.

595
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,940
Then...

596
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,230
that bully

597
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,180
bullied you

598
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,960
and you wanted to fight back.

599
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,480
But as a girl,

600
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,260
how can you fight with others?

601
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,820
Let me tell you.

602
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,660
After I drove you home that day,

603
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,900
I went to his house

604
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,580
to find him.

605
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,070
I gave him a lesson.

606
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,340
Otherwise,

607
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,160
when he saw you,

608
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,470
how could he run away?

609
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,360
However,

610
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,330
I didn't expect that Zelin

611
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,870
made you suffer so much.

612
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,080
Girl.

613
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,340
But I don't understand.

614
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,260
Guangxi

615
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,860
is much younger than you.

616
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,960
What's good about him?

617
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,560
He gave me a lot of courage.

618
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,760
He made me

619
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,750
stop compromising to life.

620
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,490
He let me become

621
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,600
what I like now.

622
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,290
Every morning when I wake up,

623
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,100
I feel

624
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,580
it's a day full of hope.

625
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,820
There was a time

626
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,300
I was quite confused.

627
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,600
Every day,

628
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,210
I didn't know what I'm doing.

629
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,690
I didn't know what

630
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,920
could make myself happy.

631
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,270
Guangxi makes me feel

632
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,260
he's like a light.

633
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,620
He's like

634
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,540
the light guiding me forward.

635
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,220
Being with him

636
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,650
makes me like myself more.

637
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,720
So even though the future

638
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,540
is hard,

639
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,180
I am willing to face it.

640
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,270
If the future is happy,

641
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,190
I'll applaud for myself.

642
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,770
Because it's the life

643
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,530
that I choose for myself.

644
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,100
I believe Guangxi and I

645
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,940
can make it.

646
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,150
It's hard to keep grown girls at home.

647
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,650
As a father,

648
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,790
I treat you so well

649
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,540
but now you are willing to,

650
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,020
well,

651
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,800
contribute

652
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,590
your whole life for that brat.

653
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,320
Think about it now.

654
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,860
I might be

655
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,790
not willing to be embarrassed

656
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,590
by you and Guangxi.

657
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,570
I don't know how to

658
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,460
face those uncles and aunts.

659
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,260
Since you were young,

660
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,020
I've been unwilling to let you be wronged.

661
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,980
I've been willing to see

662
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,860
my girl to be happy.

663
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,290
Of course.

664
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,730
After you have your own family,

665
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,490
you should also be happy.

666
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,220
Right?

667
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,340
Fine.

668
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,360
If you think he's good,

669
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,860
then,

670
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,380
you...

671
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,580
You could just

672
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,410
try to be in a relationship with him.

673
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,490
Take a try.

674
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,460
Dad.

675
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,960
You agreed?

676
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,130
No.

677
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,750
I just said

678
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,540
take a try.

679
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,860
But if it doesn't work,

680
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,450
you still have me.

681
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,710
You really want to get married?

682
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,840
We're just taking a try, Dad.

683
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,690
Yes, taking a try.

684
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,450
Thank you, dad.

685
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,430
How old are you? Why are you crying?

686
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,220
You...

687
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,450
Dad.

688
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,570
How did you help me

689
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,920
teach that bully a lesson?

690
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,920
That day,

691
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,500
I went to their house.

692
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,610
I said that from now on,

693
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,460
stay 5 meters away

694
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,420
from my daughter.

695
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,620
Or I'll beat you next time.

696
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,230
Guangxi.

697
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,140
Come and have a look.

698
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,820
Do you want to eat this?

699
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,340
Dumplings.

700
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,620
The dumplings here are very good.

701
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,200
Corn.

702
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,900
And these with cucumber and pork

703
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,500
are also delicious.

704
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,640
I'll prepare some for you, too.

705
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,500
Thank you, mom.

706
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,040
See if there's anything

707
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,940
you like.

708
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,200
Fried dumplings.

709
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,100
When you come back from work,

710
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,350
you could make some. It's convenient.

711
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,670
Here, have more.

712
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,460
Aunt Lan, it's not the Spring Festival yet.

713
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,820
Are you doing special purchases for the Spring Festival?

714
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,490
We used to be a family.

715
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,820
Now we become two families.

716
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,740
Of course we need more.

717
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,150
This one, too.

718
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,140
Wonton is also convenient.

719
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,090
Son,

720
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,420
Uncle Yin won't eat humans.

721
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,500
Besides, Yike is his daughter.

722
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,460
Mom.

723
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,020
I trust Yike.

724
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,740
I'm worried about uncle.

725
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,370
Don't worry.

726
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,790
They love each other very much.

727
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,490
Besides,

728
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,780
Aunt Lan brought us out

729
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,540
just for giving them

730
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,590
some private space.

731
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,100
Don't worry.

732
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,810
My sister will persuade my dad.

733
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,910
All right, here.

734
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,420
Let's see what you want to eat.

735
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,860
Okay.

736
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,110
Have some noodles first.

737
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,670
Did he scold you?

738
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,320
It's okay.

739
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,220
Didn't we agree that

740
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,770
this is a long battle?

741
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,410
There's no rush.

742
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,900
Did uncle overreact just now?

743
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,460
Did you

744
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,990
run out

745
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,900
in the middle of arguing?

746
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,900
I'm going

747
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,490
to explain.

748
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,020
I was touched.

749
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,090
My dad and I

750
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,060
had a happy conversation.

751
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,650
Xiaomian.

752
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,820
Look how haggard my skin is.

753
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,140
I've been making

754
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,560
the self-criticism video lately

755
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,030
so I couldn't even sleep.

756
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,270
And look at me.

757
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,860
I have a pimple here.

758
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,420
Have you read the comments of

759
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,820
that self-criticism video?

760
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,340
There are many positive comments now.

761
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,070
I've kept an eye on them.

762
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,830
Look, here.

763
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,890
The self-criticism video makes you popular.

764
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,290
I've been a fan of this brand.

765
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,860
It's just a stupid video.

766
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,240
The image and temperament of the company

767
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,020
became low because of you.

768
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,100
The company

769
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,870
is on the trending news list for free,

770
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,970
and has gained a large group of fans.

771
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,900
It's easy to tell

772
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
even for me. What do you know?

773
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,580
But the Flower World

774
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,870
still ignores you.

775
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,070
The company still has to pay

776
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,400
for your infringement.

777
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,220
It's just a stupid video.

778
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,380
What's there to be happy about?

779
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,800
But the fact is

780
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,110
our live stream data

781
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,460
is increasing.

782
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,310
Besides, Yike

783
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,950
has gone to the Flower World

784
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,780
for cooperation.

785
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,730
There are no flowers in the car.

786
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,340
Who is missing you?

787
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,850
It must be Yin Chenggong.

788
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,340
You just moved out.

789
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,810
He could not be accustomed so soon.

790
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,610
How about this?

791
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,780
We can go home for meals

792
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,850
as frequently as possible.

793
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,340
Speaking of eating,

794
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,770
we could not have a meal well lately.

795
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,870
After I finish

796
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,660
the case of the Flower World,

797
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,950
I'll make it up.

798
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,740
Here.

799
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,420
It's delicious.

800
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,300
Really?

801
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,880
It seems that the self-criticism video

802
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,970
is quite a success.

803
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,270
Of course.

804
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,310
There's Guangxi behind it.

805
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,910
Seems that Yike

806
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,680
owns the victory in her hands.

807
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,680
It's time to perform

808
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,960
a combination attack.

809
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,480
Miss Yin.

810
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,180
You came in such a hurry today.

811
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,360
Ms. Xu is

812
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,000
still occupied.

813
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,610
Why don't you come next time?

814
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,630
When will Ms. Xu

815
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,580
be available?

816
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,740
I'll let you know.

817
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,060
You can leave now.

818
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,500
Well,

819
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,030
can you tell her

820
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,700
this is the latest settlement plan

821
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,730
I've brought.

822
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,070
How about this?

823
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,190
I'll wait here.

824
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,060
As long as Ms. Xu is available,

825
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,100
feel free to call me.

826
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,100
Please.

827
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,110
Miss Yin,

828
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,739
Ms. Xu is really busy today.

829
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,550
It's okay. I'm not in a hurry.

830
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,310
I can wait.

831
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:13,940
Suit yourself.

832
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,409
Yes.

833
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,139
Leave me alone.

834
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:16,010
Thank you.

835
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,850
Miss Yin,

836
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,510
how about going back first?

837
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,429
I'll let you know.

838
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,080
I must meet Ms. Xu today.

839
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,909
But we're getting off work soon.

840
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,620
Somatic sets

841
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,820
can be sent to users for testing.

842
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,540
And the power development kits

843
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,250
of Havoc Game

844
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,340
must finish testing next week.

845
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,190
Ms. Xu.

846
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,429
Sorry for interrupting.

847
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,850
I'm Yin Yike from SC.

848
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,850
Ms. Xu.

849
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,020
Miss Yin has been

850
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,850
waiting for a whole day.

851
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,660
What's wrong?

852
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,490
Have you read the new settlement plan?

853
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,590
What do you want to say?

854
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,670
Actually, on our collaboration,

855
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,480
we can totally

856
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,200
achieve a win-win cooperation.

857
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,030
I thought about it before.

858
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,020
Your company is rich

859
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,140
and want to compensate us?

860
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,750
Then do it.

861
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,740
In addition to

862
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,710
sustaining losses in business,

863
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,300
we can totally

864
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,290
work in another way

865
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,980
to win

866
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,210
interests for both companies.

867
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,160
The lawyer came to talk about compensation before.

868
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,630
You came to talk about win-win cooperation today.

869
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,980
What about the day after tomorrow?

870
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,930
Another person for another plan?

871
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,790
I won't cooperate with

872
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,660
such a company.

873
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,310
Amy, the ticket.

874
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:28,940
Okay.

875
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,000
Ms. Xu, here.

876
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,110
Hello, Guangxi.

877
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,420
Hello?

878
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,530
Are you still working?

879
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,390
What about you?

880
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,910
How was your battle today?

881
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,160
Just the first step of my long expedition.

882
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,510
I still have a long way to go.

883
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,410
I think you can do it.

884
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,350
As long as Yin Yike wants to do,

885
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,220
she can do it.

886
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,410
Are you going to keep waiting for her tomorrow?

887
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,690
Yes.

888
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,340
After all,

889
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,420
I met Ms. Xu today.

890
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,090
Don't work too hard.

891
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:13,980
Chacha.

892
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,350
Help me search for

893
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,660
the Original Animation Exhibition.

894
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,330
Why are you still here?

895
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,470
What is this?

896
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,090
Private job?

897
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,390
Dad Chen, listen to me.

898
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,050
This is...

899
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,830
I'm helping my friend.

900
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,780
All right.

901
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,220
It's just a private job.

902
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,940
It's no big deal.

903
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,570
Why are you so nervous?

904
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,320
What's wrong?

905
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,020
Do you need money or does a big boss

906
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,760
want to hire you?

907
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,240
There's no big boss.

908
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,800
It's just for personal reasons.

909
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,950
Personal reasons?

910
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,490
Can you tell me?

911
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,730
It's not convenient now.

912
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,170
Okay.

913
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:54,820
Forget it.

914
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,230
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

915
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,660
After all, Dad Chen

916
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,450
is not a gossiper.

917
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,740
But if you want to say something,

918
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,500
-I... -Dad Chen...

919
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:02,900
I'm leaving.

920
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,570
Good night.

921
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,360
Rest early.

922
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,090
Good night.

923
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,430
Don't forget to turn off the lights.

924
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,490
♫Travels to the end♫

925
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,440
♫Of the whole universe♫

926
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,180
♫Together, we will♫

927
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:51,620
♫Guard the whole one world♫

928
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,650
Yin,

929
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,020
let's eat

930
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:02,900
Plain Noodles today.

931
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,400
Make it simple, okay?

932
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,050
Remember to take away one

933
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,630
without scallion.

934
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,470
Without scallion?

935
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,350
Yike doesn't like scallion.

936
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,350
Then you ordered it

937
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,380
for...

938
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,410
You did it on purpose.

939
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,860
Say whatever I don't like to hear.

940
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,960
Sir.

941
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,170
Three bowls of Yangchun Noodles.

942
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,570
One without scallion for takeaway.

943
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,260
Okay.

944
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,500
Look at you.

945
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,050
Yesterday, it is you

946
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,660
who sent Yike out.

947
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,560
What?

948
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,060
You don't want her to leave now?

949
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,830
Even so,

950
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,810
I'll let her out.

951
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,710
Your son is lucky.

952
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,210
It seems

953
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:42,930
you are still worried about

954
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,110
Guangxi.

955
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,060
He had been abroad

956
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,040
for so many years.

957
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,630
Who knows

958
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,220
how his temper is?

959
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,850
I need to observe him.

960
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,320
How long are you going to observe him?

961
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,140
Actually,

962
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,300
I've figured it out long ago.

963
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,610
She's grown up.

964
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,940
She will leave sooner or later.

965
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,930
But after I agreed yesterday,

966
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,850
I feel empty.

967
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,850
I understand.

968
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,390
In this house,

969
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,220
there are only you and me.

970
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,300
It's indeed empty.

971
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,860
But

972
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,820
they grew up.

973
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,340
They have their own life.

974
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,780
We should also

975
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,830
live well ourselves.

976
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,460
Right?

977
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,060
Besides,

978
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,470
we still have a lot to do.

979
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,800
For example, there's one promise

980
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,040
that you didn't fulfill.

981
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,830
When Yibo was in school,

982
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,150
I planned to get the driver's license.

983
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,590
You said that

984
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,130
we would travel in the future.

985
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:39,940
By then,

986
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,100
I can drive,

987
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:41,970
giving you a hand.

988
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,890
But in the end,

989
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,750
we were too busy with focusing on

990
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,590
Yibo and Yike's study.

991
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,660
Yes. All these years,

992
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,140
we've been busy with these two kids.

993
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,400
I neglected you.

994
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,820
After having the noodles,

995
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,840
I'll take you to the driving school.

996
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,700
We can buy a RV

997
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,700
and raise two dogs.

998
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,650
Right.

999
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,940
We could raise a alpaca.

1000
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:02,620
The, the...

1001
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,180
The white one. Yes.

1002
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,420
The sheep with such a big neck.

1003
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,220
With it,

1004
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,310
let's drive the RV

1005
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,130
around the country.

1006
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,170
Okay, let's...

1007
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,300
Don't eat the noodles. Let's buy a RV.

1008
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,140
No hurry.

1009
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,740
Boss.

1010
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,270
Are the noodles ready? Hurry up.

1011
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,210
Coming.

1012
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,580
The alpacas spit at people.

1013
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,180
You know, right?

1014
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,100
So cute.

1015
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:20,740
Yes.

1016
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,180
Coming.

1017
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,350
Here, thank you.

1018
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,090
Thank you.

1019
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,860
We have a great life.

1020
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,380
Don't always think about children.

1021
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,610
We have our own life.

1022
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,360
Come on, eat.

1023
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,570

00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,980
♫You are my luck♫

1049
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,010
♫I'm like an ice-cream beneath the sun♫

1050
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:41,730
♫Melt my heart into love♫

00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:00,750
