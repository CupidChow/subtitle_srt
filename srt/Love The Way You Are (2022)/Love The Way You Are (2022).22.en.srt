What's wrong with shotgun marriage?

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,560
Yibo, wait for me.

18
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,910
You should lose weight.

19
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,020
Besides,

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,820
It's for Yike's sake.

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,380
Why do you

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,979
always pour cold water on me?

23
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,300
I'm not.

24
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:51,820
I just think

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,900
your suggestion is unreliable.

26
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,020
Even if it's not reliable,

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,220
it's also an opinion.

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,150
Why don't you think of one?

29
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,570
Xia Xiaomian, why do you

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,180
suddenly become so righteous?

31
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,980
What do you mean by suddenly?

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,840
I'm always so righteous, okay?

33
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,860
Besides,

34
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,180
girls must help girls.

35
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:09,979
Yes, you're right.

36
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,860
Girls must help girls.

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,560
Besides the previous idea,

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,460
do you have

39
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,060
any constructive opinions?

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,430
Constructional opinions?

41
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,720
Yes.

50
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,420
so she can focus on

51
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,579
her domestic affairs.

52
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,170
Do you think this is a

53
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,540
constructive opinion?

54
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,260
That makes sense.

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,550
Xia Xiaomian.

56
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,100
In that case,

It smells so good.

How can you cook so many dishes

61
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,140
while I was taking a shower?

62
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,860
Try it for me.

63
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,340
How does it taste?

64
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,310
It's delicious.

65
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,590
The heat is just right.

66
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,300
How about this dish?

67
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,220
Is it salty?

68
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,660
How does it taste?

69
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,590
It's just right.

70
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,340
Why does your cooking

71
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,600
taste like Aunt Lan's?

72
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,850
Really?

73
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,990
Help me try

74
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,950
this dish for me.

75
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,590
Take a bite of this too.

76
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,990
Wait.

77

It's just the two of us.

Do you need to cook so many dishes?

79
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,990
I was thinking

80
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,000
how to cater to uncle.

81
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,170
So you want me to try the dishes.

82
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,430
It happens that

83
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,120
my mom doesn't cook for uncle.

84
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,510
Offering fuel in snowy weather

85
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,890
is another version of it.

86
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,500
Good idea.

87
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,060
I called my mom for help

88
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,140
on purpose.

89
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,660
So the dishes

90
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,880
taste similar.

91
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,070
I don't know

92
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,660
whether your dishes

93
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,260
can get through my dad's stomach.

94
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,590
But they can get through

95
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,730
my stomach.

96
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,300
I'll eat.

97
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,180
Wait a minute.

98
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,190
Although it's for Uncle Yin,

99
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,390
I still prepared

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,460
your favorite one.

101
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,640
Did Aunt Lan

102
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,720
tell you secretly?

103
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,780
Of course not.

104
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,530
I certainly know

105
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,410
what you like.

106
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,680
Eat more.

107
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm more confident

108
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,140
seeing you eating so happily.

109
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,600
You should cook every day.

110
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,460
Every day.

111
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,940
I'll cook every day.

112
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,240
Yes. Taste of Aunt Lan's cooking.

113
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,630
It's just making dumplings.

114
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,920
Who can starve to death?

115

Hello, guys.

116
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,330
Next, what I would introduce

117
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:20,910
is

118

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,810
is their latest product

123
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,250
called Good Night.

124
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,060
Yibo.

125
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,340
Have some dumplings.

126
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,150
Yibo.

Have some Boiled Noodle Slices.

Have some Boiled Noodle Slices.

130
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,740
Why do we say

131
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,750
it's a spicy one?

132
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,300
Yibo.

133
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,590
Because it's a

134
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,700
First, it's a perfume for men.

135
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,660
It has a end tone that is

136
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,180
a little spicy.

137
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,630
It's a perfume for men...

138
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,360
It's spicy.

139
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,430
Perfume for men...

140
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,800
What are you doing?

141
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,830
This...

142
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,460
What are you doing?

143
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,650
Why did you come in without knocking the door?

144
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,140
How can I know

145
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,410
what you are doing without coming in?

146
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,860
You don't study hard.

147
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,820
Live stream, right?

148
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,550
Do I expect you to earn me money?

149
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,400
Take it off.

150
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,020
I'm helping my sister attract traffic.

151
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,500
You're helping her piss me off

152
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,890
rather than helping her attract traffic.

153
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,620
How dare you barge into my room?

154
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,200
What are you doing?

155
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,830
No.

156
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,970
This is a limited edition.

157
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,130
You're are disrupted by

158
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,250
these trash.

159
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,159
You're crazy.

160
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,600
What are you throwing a tantrum for?

161
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,340
What's the point of studying?

162
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,380
Why do I have to seek further study?

163
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,690
Why do you force me to study?

164
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,890
Isn't it nice to have one more approach?

165
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,950
One more approach.

166
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,870
Right. There are a lot of approaches out there.

167
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,940
Go for them.

168
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,909
As a lazy person,

169
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,110
can you do that?

170
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,500
I...

171
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,700
Fine.

172
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,320
You've grown up.

173
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,450
You want to move out like your sister?

174
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,410
Fine, move out.

175
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,460
There are so many approaches.

176
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,580
Go! Go! Go!

177
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,320
Get out!

178
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,580
Why should I move out?

179
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,230
You...

180
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,730
How dare you move out?

181
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,460
Get lost!

182
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:07,740
I...

183
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,700
Get out! Get out!

184
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,940
What are you doing, Yin?

185
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,470
What do you think I'm doing?

186
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,430
Yibo, ignore him.

187
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,380
He doesn't like anyone.

188
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:13,940
Let's go.

189
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,140
Are you leaving too?

190
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,280
You're pissing me off like them.

191
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,700
Right?

192
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,340
Look at you now.

193
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,130
You scold anyone you see.

194
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,220
Leave this house. Get lost!

195
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,700
Let's go.

196
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,820
Let's go. Ignore him.

197
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,350
Look at him.

198
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,440
What are you doing?

199
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,140
Come on.

200
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:28,910
Get lost.

201
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,470
Let's go.

202
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,510
Aunt Lan,

203
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,150
is it okay for us to leave like this?

204
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,500
Yes.

205
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,659
You can't follow him around.

206
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,940
Let him think about it alone.

207
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,470
Let's go.

208
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,650
Here, change your shoes.

209
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,090
Shrimp, garlic, spinach,

210
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,710
beef.

211
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,650
It should be enough.

212
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,600
Of course it's enough.

213
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,090
What do you take the wine?

214
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,420
Just in case. What if uncle feels happy

215
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,540
and wants to drink?

216
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,840
Can you drink with my dad?

217
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,630
I'd better go back and get some dried scallops.

218
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,860
Make some dried scallop porridge for uncle.

219
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,590
He must not eat well these days.

220
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,390
All right, don't take it.

221
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,300
It's enough.

222
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,290
Why are you more nervous than I am?

223
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,740
I'm afraid of unexpected situations.

224
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,460
There's no such thing.

225
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,840
Aunt Lan. We are about to be back.

226
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,220
Yike, something happened.

227
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,550
Your dad is in hospital.

228
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,130
What?

229
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,310
[Emergency Department]

230
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,730
Sister.

231
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,330
Yibo.

232
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,760
What's wrong with dad?

233
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,700
Dad found out about my live streaming

234
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,850
and had a big fight with me.

235
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,390
He was so angry with me that he was sent to hospital.

236
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,670
It's my fault.

237
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,620
I know your dad has high blood pressure.

238
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,060
Why should I be angry with him?

239
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,590
Aunt Lan,

240
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,030
don't blame yourself.

241
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,390
What did the doctor say?

242
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,180
The patient is awake.

243
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,140
Please come in.

244
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,230
Yin.

245
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,540
How is Yin, doctor?

246
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,340
Doctor, what happened to my dad?

247
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,380
He has long-term

248
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,690
high blood pressure disease.

249
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,260
He fainted

250
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
from the excitement.

251
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,430
At present,

252
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,660
he's fine now.

253
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,480
That's good.

254
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,590
Would I be lying here if I'm fine?

255
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,210
Calm down.

256
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,380
Calm down.

257
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,790
Why do I feel

258
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,660
I can't breathe again?

259
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,010
Don't rush. Take your time.

260
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,870
How about this?

261
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,370
You can get him admitted.

262
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,560
Tomorrow,

263
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,380
let's give him

264
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,710
a thorough examination

265
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,500
and see if

266
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,020
if he needs further treatment.

267
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,480
Doctor,

268
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
didn't you say he's fine?

269
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,830
Why is he hospitalized?

270
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,070
He doesn't have to.

271
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,170
He can come tomorrow for a check-up.

272
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,060
Well,

273
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
I don't have to be hospitalized.

274
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,890
Slow down.

275
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,420
Uncle.

276
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,710
What's wrong?

277
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,570
What's wrong?

278
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,800
I can't take it anymore, Yin.

279
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,130
I have chest tightness.

280
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,380
I feel

281
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,410
I can't breathe.

282
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:15,910
Doctor,

283
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,580
let's get my dad hospitalized.

284
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,740
Do a good check-up tomorrow.

285
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

286
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,690
Then we can feel relieved.

287
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,020
Okay.

288
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,810
Then stay in the hospital.

289
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,410
We'll do CT tomorrow.

290
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,500
Who wants to go with me for the procedure?

291
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,160
Let me do it.

292
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,430
Okay, follow me.

293
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,320
Yin, what's wrong?

294
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,180
Don't scare me.

295
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,380
Are you feeling unwell?

296
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,010
I... I want to sleep.

297
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,470
Aunt Lan.

298
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,590
Leave this to me.

299
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,500
Have a good rest.

300
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,320
Come replace me tomorrow.

301
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,910
I...

302
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,130
I'll stay with him for a while.

303
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,660
It's okay. Go back and rest.

304
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,330
Okay.

305
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,980
-Thank you. Sister. -If you need anything, immediately give me a call.

306
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,470
Go.

307
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,290
Dad, are you cold?

308
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,150
I'll turn up the air conditioner.

309
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,690
Look.

310
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,030
I brought you

311
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
your tea cup.

312
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,020
The tea is ready.

313
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,950
Do you want some?

314
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:19,890
I just bought

315
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,890
a cushion for you.

316
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,660
Do you want to put it on your waist?

317
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,990
It's more comfortable.

318
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,480
Dad.

319
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,190
I'm going to sleep.

320
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,350
I've done the procedures.

321
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,790
Uncle,

322
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,740
if you need anything

323
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,530
at night,

324
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,580
just call me.

325
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,470
I'm at the door.

326
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,160
No need.

327
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I can do it myself.

328
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,640
I'm going to sleep.

329
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,380
Dad.

330
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,450
I put the cushion on the bed.

331
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,580
Uncle,

332
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,670
if you didn't fall asleep,

333
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:57,900
I want to share some thoughts

334
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,980
with you.

335
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,060
If you are asleep,

336
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,320
I'm talking to myself.

337
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,620
Yike

338
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,550
is definitely not

339
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,870
going against you.

340
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,380
Although she moved out,

341
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,340
she's never stopped missing you

342
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,590
for a moment.

343
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Sometimes,

344
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,620
she even secretly called

345
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,510
my mom

346
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,620
to ask about your situation at home.

347
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,100
She also told Yibo

348
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,110
to prepare all the medicine at home.

349
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,680
For you,

350
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,770
you cherish

351
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,930
Yike so much.

352
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,220
But for Yike,

353
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,290
you are a father

354
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,690
greater than God.

355
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,600
You're here.

356
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,710
All right.

357
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,580
You've been busy all day.

358
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,790
Go to sleep.

359
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,620
Guangxi.

360
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,000
It's late.

361
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,080
Yes.

362
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,760
My mom and Yibo are here.

363
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,580
Do you want to take a look?

364
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,320
Hurry up. You don't know.

365
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:05,820
You don't know?

366
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,700
Aunt Lan has a waist problem?

367
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,020
Tell me.

368
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,620
It's fine.

369
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,140
Let me do it. You take a rest.

370
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,870
It's okay.

371
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,750
Sit down.

372
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,760
Sit down.

373
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,900
Leave me alone. Look.

374
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,770
The soup will get cold. Drink it.

375
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,340
Let me feed you.

376
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,140
I don't want to drink this.

377
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,730
You know? Hurry up.

378
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,860
You are a patient, you need more nutrition.

379
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,350
Here.

380
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,190
Open your mouth.

381
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,250
Come on, eat like a child.

382
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,540
Mom.

383
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,260
The doctor said Uncle's test report

384
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,100
will be out soon.

385
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,160
He'll be here soon.

386
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,340
Okay.

387
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,170
Here.

388
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,220
Open your mouth and increase your resistance.

389
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,180
The report is coming out.

390
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,300
Actually, yesterday,

391
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,710
I felt a little stuffy and a little scared.

392
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,940
so I called 120.

393
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,400
But as soon as I arrived at the hospital...

394
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,100
I'm fine.

395
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,940
Are you pretending to be sick?

396
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,180
You can't say that.

397
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,740
You know what?

398
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,640
I've always been timid, you know?

399
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,910
This...

400
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,780
Yin,

401
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,460
how old are you?

402
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,380
Stop pretending to be sick.

403
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,020
You can do anything else.

404
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,680
Why do you have to pretend to be sick

405
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,080
to curse yourself?

406
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,290
I'm not pretending.

407
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,820
I was just so timid that I called 120.

408
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,290
Well,

409
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,460
You like calling 120 so much.

410
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,160
Fine.

411
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,340
Ask 120 to deliver

412
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,130
a washboard for you.

413
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,260
Kneel down at home.

414
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,060
Then I'll continue to get sick.

415
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,300
Dad.

416
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,930
Aunt Lan said it out of anger.

417
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,830
I promise

418
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,020
if you go home,

419
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,690
you'll still be the most honorable discharge patient.

420
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,340
Look.

421
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,820
My daughter loves me so much.

422
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,300
You know?

423
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,060
But how can you pretend to be sick?

424
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,460
Come on.

425
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,260
Cut the crap.

426
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,980
Get the paperwork done.

427
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,540
Who wants to stay in the hospital?

428
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,340
When he's not sick,

429
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,060
he is shouting

430
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,010
and got his high voice back, right?

431
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,010
Your voice is high again.

432
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,940
Yes.

433
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,150
Seriously.

434
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,140
Hello, Doctor.

435
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,340
Based on the preliminary examination results,

436
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,250
the patient's blood pressure

437
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,250
is under control.

438
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,950
There is no relevant

439
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,020
serious complications.

440
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,410
I knew it. I'm fine.

441
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
I'll take it as a physical examination.

442
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:47,970
Come on.

443
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,100
Get out of the hospital.

444
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,310
But I have a question

445
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,470
to discuss with you.

446
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,610
From the CT scan,

447
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,280
the patient has shadows in the lungs.

448
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,920
What do you mean?

449
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,050
I'm not sure yet.

450
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,020
We need to wait for further confirmation.

451
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,700
Please stay calm

452
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,060
and wait for the news.

453
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,680
Dad.

454
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,710
Why did I pretend to be sick?

455
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,410
I deserve it.

456
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,100
Dad, come on.

457
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,050
I'm doomed.

458
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,110
It's over.

459
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,620
Dad.

460
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,300
Anyone who comes to the hospital

461
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,900
will find some minor problems.

462
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,380
Don't scare yourself.

463
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,150
Mom.

464
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,240
You too.

465
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,180
The doctor said

466
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,220
it's not sure what's going on.

467
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,350
Don't worry.

468
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,300
Yile.

469
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,330
I've asked the company for a leave

470
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,360
today.

471
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,380
Don't you have a lot

472
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,110
to deal with?

473
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,380
As you can see,

474
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,120
I have the tablet with me.

475
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,820
And I think there will be

476
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,480
a round of examination today.

477
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,720
It's okay, sister. Guangxi.

478
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,510
Go back to work.

479
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,210
Aunt Lan and I will take care of him.

480
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,230
I don't need you.

481
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,060
Go back now.

482
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,840
Go back to study.

483
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,070
Listen, son.

484
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,670
You must

485
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,560
enter graduate school this year.

486
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,980
What if I can't take care of you?

487
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,860
What if you

488
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,830
can't earn yourself a living?

489
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,140
Yibo, your dad is right.

490
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,320
You should study.

491
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,900
Guangxi,

492
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,710
Ke, go to work.

493
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,510
Besides, the doctor said

494
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,580
it might be inflammation.

495
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,980
Let's not think too much.

496
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,660
I'm here. I'll keep watch.

497
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,750
Don't worry.

498
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,630
Are you okay?

499
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,580
Let me pat you on the back.

500
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,140
Don't worry.

501
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,520
Uncle will be fine.

502
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,600
We should think less

503
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,660
and do more.

504
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,170
I'll keep in touch with mom.

505
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,900
I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.

506
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,300
Who gets off work first

507
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,260
will come.

508
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,780
Don't think too much.

509
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,660
You have

510
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,860
a tough battle today.

511
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,470
And I'll get off work earlier than you.

512
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,140
What are you throwing a tantrum for?

513
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,140
Why do I have to seek further study?

514
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,620
Why do you

515
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,460
force me to study?

516
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,820
Isn't it nice to have one more approach?

517
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,950
One more approach.

518
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,430
Yes.

519
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,300
Right. There're a lot of approaches out there. Go for them.

520
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,310
As a lazy person,

521
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,780
Can you do that?

522
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,260
Learn from your sister, right?

523
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,900
Okay.

524
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,000
Move out now.

525
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:36,930
I...

Dad found out about my live streaming

528
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,420
and had a big fight with me.

529
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,220
He was so angry with me that he was sent to hospital.

The new lawyer of the legal department

533
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,540
still failed to deal with Flower World.

534
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,200
Do you think

535
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,270
will our live stream continue?

536
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,550
Of course.

537
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,140
We've been very popular these days.

538
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,600
And I've done my homework.

539
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,270
Yes, it's very hot.

540
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,220
But the transformation rate is very low.

541
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,940
Those who enter our live stream

542
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,260
are anti-fans who play games

543
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,140

was rejected by Li Zelin.

547
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,360
Now that I think

548
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,380
it might be a chance for us to handle

549
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,910
the public opinion crisis.

the self-defamation video

552
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,020
which got us fooled.

553
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,190
It can represent

554
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,740
our attitude to admit our mistake

555
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,070

is to race against time

I saw everyone holding it outside.

It's okay to rub it.

This is the first draft of the self-defamation video.

701
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,340
Please take a look when you have time.

702
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:19,690
OK.

703
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,950
Miss Yin, everything goes well.

704
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,140
Uncle is stubborn,

705
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,370
but he allows me to take care of him.

706
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,230
What about you?

707
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,420
Everything is fine here.

708
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,830
I'm counting on you tonight.

709
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,230
I'll deliver breakfast tomorrow morning.

710
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,860
We said I'll see you online.

711
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,120
Why did you disappear?

712
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,940
We agreed to have double-screen interaction,

713
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,210
work hard, clench our teeth

714
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,540
for the sales champion.

715
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,190
Xiaomian.

716
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,500
Get ready for the live stream.

717
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:27,930
Okay.

718
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,740
Forget it.

719
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,370
He likes people who keep their promises.

720
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,300
I'll go to him after the broadcast.

721
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,400
The report for bed 15 will come out tomorrow.

722
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,840
He's asleep.

723
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,560
Okay.

724
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,740
Uncle,

725
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,710
do you want to sleep a little longer?

726
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,840
Or do you want some water?

727
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,600
If I leave like this.

728
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,570
what to do with my family?

729
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,660
Ke is not young.

730
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,040
She's not married.

731
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,410
I want to take care of

732
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,140
her child.

733
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,300
Uncle,

734
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm not going to say empty words

735
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,740
to comfort you.

736
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,900
I've consulted experts

737
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,730
in Shanghai.

738
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,410
Your report and data

739
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,300
shows that there is no big problem.

740
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,510
Yibo

741
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,690
has been taking the postgraduate entrance exam for two years.

742
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,620
If he still fails this year,

743
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,320
he'll really sell his shoes.

744
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,740
Ke

745
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,010
has been

746
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,880
a very obedient child.

747
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,570
When her mother was pregnant with her brother,

748
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,060
she followed me to work.

749
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,430
Wherever she went,

750
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,910
she attracted attention.

751
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,530
When her brother was born,

752
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,060
she was still a little girl,

753
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,320
she then knew to take care of her brother.

754
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,140
Uncle.

755
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,170
Since we're talking about Yike's childhood,

756
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,610
do you still remember

757
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,450
she wanted to learn dancing?

758
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,570
Of course.

759
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,070
I wanted her to learn piano

760
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,710
and I paid for the lessons.

761
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,780
She wanted to learn dancing instead.

762
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,380
We didn't have that much money.

763
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,780
Let me tell you secretly.

764
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,300
For a period of time,

765
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,460
Yike

766
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,290
practice dancing in a small park.

767
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,420
How did you know?

768
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,850
One time, I happened to pass by.

769
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,230
I was lucky to be

770
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,320
the only audience.

771
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,120
Did she dance well?

772
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,270
She was

773
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,390
dancing around.

774
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,070
She smiled brightly.

775
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,550
My daughter is pretty.

776
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,970
She's pretty in everything.

777
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,820
Yes, uncle.

778
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,740
Yike is so beautiful

779
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,660
when she's doing

780
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,050
what she likes.

781
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:39,940
Yes.

782
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,590
Actually, there are some things

783
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,180
about Yike

784
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,340
you might not know.

785
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,550
She's just a little muddle-headed.

786
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,570
She often forgot to charge her phone.

787
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,420
While working overtime in the company,

788
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,850
She even caught a cold.

789
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,600
She really needs

790
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,650
care.

791
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,540
She's so muddle-headed.

792
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,560
She grew up and became more sensible.

793
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,690
I forgot about this.

794
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,610
I remember once

795
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,420
she went out with her brother

796
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,190
and lost her brother.

797
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:08,610
I...

798
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,260
I hit her.

799
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,980
It's first time in my life

800
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,220
that I've ever

801
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,950
hit her.

802
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,300
She cried

803
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,030
but still

804
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,660
found her brother in the end.

805
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,910
Ke is too sensible.

806
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,530
Uncle,

807
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,420
I really want to protect her.

808
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,220
I want her to be muddle-headed

809
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,350
as long as she likes.

810
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,350
I want her

811
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,410
live freely.

812
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,780
Kid,

813
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,080
You're a good boy.

814
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,930
But you are too young.

815
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,140
How do you know women?

816
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,050
Let alone protecting her.

817
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,220
Uncle,

818
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,950
if you say so,

819
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,140
all my promises

820
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,130
are pale.

821
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,100
But

822
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,900
I will use action

823
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,980
to prove that

824
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,250
I love her more than anyone else.

825
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,500
In front of me,

826
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,660
she can be herself,

827
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,890
the one who is always

828
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,860
happy and smiling.

829
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,860
That's all I want.

830
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,480
