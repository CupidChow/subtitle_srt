by the cool girl?

103
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,340
That makes sense.

104
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,710
It's normal to fail

105
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,910
if you try the hardest one at the beginning.

106
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,269

I've got her WeChat.

109
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,829
I'm going to succeed soon.

110
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,330
You have no evidence.

111
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,060
You're the only one who has a mouth, aren't you?

112
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,260
You don't talk usually.

113
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,220
But you talks so much at critical times.

114
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,850
Baba,

115
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,100

invite Qin Yiran to go with us.

117

118
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,800

Xu Guangxi, you...

123
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,430
He needs motivation.

124
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,860
Am I that shallow?

125
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,750
Fine.

126
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,930
It's a deal. No one can deny it.

127

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,310
Yes.

133
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,290
All those young boys upstairs

134
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,530
are asking me out.

Chen Musen

136
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,100
asked me to

137
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,770
-have the dinner.
-Dinner together tonight?

138
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,310
I can't say no.

139

Guangxi will go, too.

140
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,370
He'll come if I go.

141
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,130
So nice.

142
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,600
Do I look good

143
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:25,970
with this lipstick?

144
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,600
Yike.

145
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,380
I think Jiang Man has been

146
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,930
too concerned about your brother recently.

147
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,860
Aren't you going to say something?

148
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,420
Let's go.

Take a look at the commercial shooting plan.

152
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,100
Okay.

153
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,500
Chacha.

154
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,360
This is the men's perfume series.

155
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,090
I think the best choice I've made

156
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,620
is to invite Guangxi

157
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,940
to our company, right?

158
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,700
Of course.

159
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,420
Right?

160
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,390
Yes.

161
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,060
Drink.

162
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,980
Cheers.

163
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,890
Cheers! Cheers!

164
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,910
Cheers! Cheers!

165
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,200
Are you hungry?

166
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,660
Let's go and have dinner.

167
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,260
Come on.

168
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,630
Let's go.

169
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Let's work later.

170
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,640
Cheers.

171
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,380
Cheers.

172
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:35,900
Cheers.

173
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,260
Actually drinking is a special way

174
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,810
to relieve stress.

175
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,570
Guangxi, do you usually drink?

176
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,860
It's really good.

177
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,680
Really?

178
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,730
You don't drink?

179
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,159
Let's have another drink.

180
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,230
Come on, cheers.

181
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,010
Is it convenient

182
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,780
for joining several persons here?

183
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,610
Yike, here.

184
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,300
Come here.

185
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,080
Move.

186
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,140
Come on, sister.

187
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,390
Squeeze a little.

188
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,450
What? Do you want more?

189
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,170
Take a seat.

190
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,520
Take a seat.

191
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,680
Who will pay today?

192
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,170
Our company will pay.

193
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,080
Okay.

194
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,380
Then we will help ourselves.

195
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,110
Okay.

196
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,340
I'll get you some wine.

197
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,220
Get a bottle of coke for me.

198
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,780
Okay.

199
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,050
Guangxi.

200
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,350
No matter what occasion,

201
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,680
your sister will always keep an eye on you.

202
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,180
He doesn't need that.

203
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,780
He's a good boy, right?

204
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,500
What are you talking about?

205
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,960
We're talking about work.

206
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,980
Since Yike

207
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,030
has been transferred to the Live Stream Department,

208
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,930
our Marketing Department is really busy.

209
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,460
We have a lot of things to do.

210
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,370
Guangxi.

211
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,180
Look at my face.

212
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,070
It can't tell I'm from

213
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,670
a cosmetics company, right?

214
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,830
I don't even have time to put on makeup.

215
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,100
Miss,

216
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,580
you are usually so busy with work.

217
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,810
You must rest well.

218
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,280
I'm usually free.

219
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,460
Where do you live?

220
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,100
I can pick you up

221
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,090
every day.

222
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,930
I live in the Wujiaochang.

223
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,190
After graduation,

224
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,230
I found it inconvenient

225
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,890
so I bought a small apartment.

226
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,780
Since I returned home after postgraduate study,

227
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,500
I've been living alone.

228
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,260
What about you, Guangxi?

229
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,820
I...

230
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,450
I live near Yike's house.

231
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,760
Let's drink.

232
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,380
Here, sister.

233
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,170
Cheers. Cheers.

234
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,780
Cheers!

235
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
Cheers! Cheers!

236
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,420
Thanks for the dinner.

237
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,150
Here, this is for you.

238
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,480
-Don't you like it?
-Guangxi.

239
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,340
How about your love life?

240
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,400
Our Guangxi

241
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,420
keeps receiving love letters.

242
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,220
As long as Guangxi likes the girl,

243
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,990
he will make her his girlfriend.

244
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,390
Do you need my help?

245
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
It can't be 100%.

246
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,090
Even though it can't be 100%,

247
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,320
it must be 99%.

248
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,420
Awesome.

249
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,620
Who's the 1%?

250
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,380
No.

251
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,059
He is talking nonsense.

252
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,350
So there is

253
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,870
still one girl

254
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,600
who is not taken down by Xu Guangxi.

255
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,420
There's a girl who rejected Guangxi?

256
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,980
Yes.

257
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,740
Who is she?

258
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,410
Who is she?

259
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,900
Tell us.

260
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,620
Don't whet our appetite.

261
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,260
Tell us!

262
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,820
Say it!

263
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,540
Who is she?

264
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,260
Now,

265
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,310
there is someone I can't make her my girlfriend.

266
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,540
Really?

267
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,290
Yes.

268
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,750
That's the 1%.

269
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,930
How come I don't know it even I live with you?

270
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,330
You...

271
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,190
Enough.

272
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,260
Don't make it hard for Guangxi.

273
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,760
Let's drink.

274
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,630
Yes, let's drink.

275
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,650
Come on, let's drink.

276
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,380
Let's drink.

277
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,970
Cheers.

278
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,530
No more questions.

279
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,990
Come on.

280
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,580
Cheers.

281
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,060
Cheers.

282
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,990
Looks like I have to hurry up

283
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,120
and speed up my plan.

284
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,080
After all, if you take action,

285
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,070
it's different.

286
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,690
For relationships between men and women,

287
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,400
timing is the key.

288
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,660
Then what is the right timing?

289
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,020
Either die of aging or die of anxiety.

290
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,500
If you insist in fighting to the end,

291
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,630
things will end even at the beginning.

292
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,740
Guangxi.

293
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,300
You're out of cola.

294
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,540
I just ordered some water.

295
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,870
It's very sweet. Try it.

296
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,070
No, no.

297
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Try it.

298
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,020
I drank a lot of coke.

299
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,460
Try it.

300
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,250
Have a sip.

301
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,060
No need.

302
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,920
Sit over there.

303
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,650
I have a few words with Guangxi.

304
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,860
Guangxi.

305
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,730
I have something to tell you.

306
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,050
Does the water taste good?

307
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,820
Miss Jiang Man.

308
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,380
Are you a lemon?

309
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,060
It's sour.

310
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,140
It's actually very close to you.

311
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,060
What do you want to eat?

312
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,580
You two live together?

313
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,940
Do you know who he likes?

314
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,490
He likes...

315
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,750
Guangxi.

316
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,270
You know my love life well.

317
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,130
But you don't tell me this time.

318
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,760
You're not loyal to our friendship.

319
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,630
Who is it?

320
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,450
What?

321
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Stop pretending.

322
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,250
No.

323
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,560
Why are you back on me?

324
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,680
Do we know this person?

325
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,710
Haven't you figured out

326
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,380
whether you really like her?

327
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,120
I'm sure.

328
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,100
But...

329
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,420
But she's not sure,

330
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:20,970
right?

331
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,440
I never ask.

332
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,560
I never ask her.

333
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,150
What are you worried about?

334
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,110
Are you afraid of being rejected?

335
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,130
I'm just not sure

336
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,310
how she thinks of me.

337
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,900
Listen to me.

338
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,340
If she can make Guangxi so nervous,

339
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,220
she must be a special person.

340
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,910
Yes.

341
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,580
He must like her very much.

342
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,570
-Yeah.
-Yeah, stop guessing.

343
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,890
That means you are not

344
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,150
in a relationship yet?

345
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,680
Not yet.

346
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,820
Then others still have a chance.

347
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,390
Guangxi, what's wrong?

348
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,850
Did you drink too much coke?

349
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,020
-Yes.
-No.

350
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,470
I'm asking your sister, not you.

351
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,380
Just drink.

352
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,820
Why are you so talkative?

353
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,110
Come on, drink.

354
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,420
Don't just play games.

355
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,020
Come on, let's drink.

356
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,480
Cheers.

357
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,260
No more words. Wish you success.

358
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,420
Come on, cheers.

359
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,040
Come on.

360
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,000
Cheers.

361
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,850
You cheated again.

362
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,550
Impossible.

363
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,580
You cheat every time.

364
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,290
Impossible.

365
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,340
Are you really from the same company?

366
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,220
We never cheat.

367
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,810
Okay, don't cheat.

368
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,870
[Restaurant & Bar]

369
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,680
Baba.

370
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,500
What's wrong?

371
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,350
Do you have information

372
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,980
of all the girls in SC?

373
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:44,730
Yes.

374
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,980
In this situation and

375
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,220
at this moment,

376
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,910
where will Qin Yiran be?

377
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,550
Don't you have her WeChat?

378
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,570
Ask her yourself.

379
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,790
What do you know?

380
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,980
This is called surprise.

381
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,060
You have to suddenly show up

382
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,970
in front of her.

383
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,080
Only in that way can you

384
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,890
give girls a surprise.

385
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,460
Got it?

386
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,440
What?

387
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,390
Where is she?

388
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,780
Qin Yiran?

389
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,730
The famous Queen of Club from SC.

390
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,740
If you want to ask her out,

391
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,670
check which club

392
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,370
is holding special events

393
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,170
or is popular.

394
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,780
She will definitely go to clubs like that.

395
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,400
Special events?

396
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,660
Don't touch me.

397
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,290
Go away.

398
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,380
This wine

399
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,580
left your sight.

400
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,490
It's not safe.

401
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,870
Did anyone tell you

402
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,020
if you want to conduct safety teaching,

403
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,770
go find the kids.

404
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,230
Don't aim at me, Qin Yiran.

405
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,580
We're friends.

406
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,580
This is a friendly reminder

407
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,580
for your own good.

408
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,180
Sir,

409
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,010
you were the one

410
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,090
who wanted my WeChat last time.

411
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:20,940
The person doing nothing

412
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,670
was also you.

413
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,490
You're quite casual.

414
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,930
About that, I need to

415
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,990
clarify.

416
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,670
It wasn't my fault last time.

417
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,430
It's because there was no signal in the elevator.

418
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,590
I realized that

419
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,690
I didn't add you on WeChat later.

420
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,560
Then I wanted to find you in your company.

421
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,020
But I was afraid the social influence

422
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,750
would be bad.

423
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,940
So I didn't go.

424
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,250
How about we...

425
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,140
How about this?

426
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,260
I'll give you some time before I drink my wine off.

427
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,470
Tell me

428
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,260
why should I forgive you?

429
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,690
How about this?

430
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,700
To express my apology,

431
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,160
I'll buy you a drink, okay?

432
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,780
You can't drink this anyway.

433
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,220
Waiter.

434
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,780
Two cups of the...

435
00:15:59,250 --> 00:15:59,930
Whiskey.

436
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,840
Whiskey, two glasses of whiskey.

437
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:05,810
Thank you.

438
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,380
Sorry.

439
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,470
What are you doing?

440
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,350
Chrysanthemum and goji berries.

441
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,780
It is good for the liver and the eyes.

442
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,460
Have some?

443
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,130
I'm sorry.

444
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,099
Well,

445
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,420
this is the fifth time

446
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,810
we encounter.

447
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,980
It's fate.

448
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,630
Can we add each other

449
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,380
on WeChat?

450
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,700
Are you sure it was a coincidence?

451
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,930
It was, to a certain degree.

452
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,290
Today, our company

453
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
wants to have a blind date

454
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,740
with your best friend's company.

455
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,540
And

456
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,010
we always feel that if you are not there,

457
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,020
something is missing.

458
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,140
So I volunteered

459
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,020
to invite you.

460
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,220
I see.

461
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,450
But

462
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,540
you missed the opportunity to do it in office.

463
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,340
You came here to add me on WeChat.

464
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,840
You have to follow the rules here.

465
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,650
You have to pass the test.

466
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,640
There's a test?

467
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,210
Sorry, buddy.

468
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm sorry.

469
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,230
What do you want to take?

470
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,170
Physical strength test.

471
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,840
Uncle,

472
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,170
can you do it?

473
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,220
Don't casually say

474
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,860
a man can't do things. Got it?

475
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,530
Then get high.

476
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,230
What are you dancing?

477
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,940
Don't you know

478
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,760
my nickname?

479
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,210
The Prince of the Ballroom.

480
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,780
You dance really well.

481
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,940
Sorry.

482
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,570
Handsome.

483
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,110
Sorry.

484
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,720
Can I add you on WeChat?

485
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,180
Can I add you on WeChat?

486
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,690
What did you say?

487
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,910
Take out your phone.

488
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,020
Add me on WeChat.

489
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,440
Let's go.

490
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,050
Don't keep them waiting anymore.

491
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,070
I'll call a taxi.

492
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,660
Come out later.

493
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,190
Okay.

494
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,700
Hello, what's wrong?

495
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,140
Dad, I have a stomachache.

496
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,020
No way.

497
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,770
Come back quickly.

498
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,580
I feel so bad.

499
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,040
Okay, I'll be right there.

500
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,150
Where is he?

501
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,400
Where's the taxi?

502
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
Where is he?

503
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,660
I have something to do today.

504
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,350
I'm sorry.

505
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,570
The location of the blind date.

506
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,370
You're still welcome to join us.

507
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,010
What's going on?

508
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,860
He's just kidding me?

509
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,190
Happy.

510
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,030
Slow down.

511
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,480
I'm happy.

512
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,200
Careful.

513
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,530
Miss Fairy,

514
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,620
do you have

515
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,680
any songs that you are good at singing?

516
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,810
When we go to the KTV,

517
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,930
I'll be the first to rush in

518
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,190
and order them for you.

519
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,310
Guangxi.

520
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,140
Let's

521
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,070
go to the KTV.

522
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,200
Do you want to go with us?

523
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,390
No.

524
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,620
You youngsters go and have fun.

525
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,380
I'm leaving.

526
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,540
Bye. Bye.

527
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,510
Yike, you're not going?

528
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,380
Send her back.

529
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,220
Okay, bye.

530
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,600
Goodbye, sister.

531
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,810
If she's not going, let's go.

532
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,270
-Let's continue singing in the second round.
-Let's go.

533
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,120
Come on.

534
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,140
KTV.

535
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,100
Over there.

536
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,060
Slow down.

537
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,060
Guangxi.

538
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,000
Chen Musen.

539
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,200
I left something in the company.

540
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,090
I'll go get it.

541
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,140
Guangxi.

542
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,690
Miss Fairy.

543
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,570
Let's go.

544
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm tired.

545
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,530
I want to go back to sleep.

546
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,770
Let me give you a ride.

547
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,980
Why are you running?

548
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,650
Of course I have to run.

549
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,780
It's already 10:30.

550
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,660
My dad will keep calling me

551
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
if I don't go back.

552
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,110
Are you going to deny it?

553
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,340
What?

554
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,690
My hand.

555
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,980
Your hand is there

556
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,580
for somebody to hold anyway.

557
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,790
Besides,

558
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,380
I've held your hand before.

559
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,420
I also held your hand and

560
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,200
went to school when we were young.

561
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
It's not the same as now.

562
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,840
We're adults.

563
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,580
What does holding hands mean?

564
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,240
You also

565
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,350
held my hand.

566
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,610
We...

567
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,540
We're even now.

568
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,990
That's it.

569
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,510
I am going home.

570
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,090
Take care.

571
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,420
♫Oh, love should be♫

572
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,360
♫Like children playing crayons♫

573
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,130
♫in the summer field♫

574
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,720
♫When I give in to you♫

575
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,710
♫I feel the troubles fade away♫

576
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,150
♫And if I want you, you want me♫

577
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,690
♫Who cares what others may think?♫

578
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,870
♫I hear church bells ring♫

579
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,770
♫I have you, you have me♫

580
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:01,390
♫Roses will bloom in our dreams♫

581
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,580
How come I

582
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,180
did things like that?

583
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,060
♫And I'll kiss you now♫

584
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,590
You're back.

585
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,340
Is it hot outside today?

586
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,670
You drank so much water.

587
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,230
None of your business.

588
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,600
Do you want some soda?

589
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,830
Shut up.

590
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,770
Guang Xi, I'm moving out.

591
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,590
With Yibo's encouragement,

592
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,820
I decided to find a job

593
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,090
and start a new life.

594
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,960
When I find it,

595
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,510
I'll treat you to a big meal.

596
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,000
I wish you a happy new life.

597
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,880
Hello, everyone.

598
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,500
This is Dan from Xiafei Road.

599
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,980
We meet again on time.

600
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,260
This is the one.

601
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,370
Why on a certain platform

602
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,540
its live stream data

603
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,870
and sales data...

604
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,560
Where are you? Did you eat?

605
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,860
I'm sorry about yesterday.

606
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,320
Something urgent came up.

607
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,210
I'll buy you lunch to apologize.

608
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,740
I didn't expect

609
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,020
drinking coke can make me feel dizzy.

610
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,150
I don't understand.

611
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,240
I want to change my taste.

612
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,800
But I was changed at the end.

613
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,900
Excuse me.

614
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:23,940
Beer.

615
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,300
Two bottles.

616
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:26,860
Coming.

617
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,040
Why don't you reply my message?

618
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,880
Are you shy?

619
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,620
Are you really shy?

620
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,300
There's no reason not to reply. What's wrong?

621
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,620
She's shy.

622
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,260
Really?

623
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,020
Have some tea.

624
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:56,970
Have some tea.

625
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,210
I think you should take the initiative.

626
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,140
Who?

627
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,540
Who else?

628
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,040
Yin Yike.

629
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,730
I'm not that obvious, am I?

630
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,650
You...

631
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,810
Chen Musen is a bunch of wood.

632
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,460
I'm not.

633
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,330
You go to SC every day.

634
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,300
Your heart

635
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,590
is super obvious.

636
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,610
Listen.

637
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,110
According to

638
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,400
my experience,

639
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,180
for a woman,

640
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,080
no matter how old she is,

641
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,060
and what her horoscope or blood type is,

642
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,830
in her heart,

643
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,060
there is a teenage girl.

644
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,720
They all have a girlish heart.

645
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,150
They all want their hearts to be

646
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,690
to be poked.

647
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,220
Are you talking about Yin Yike

648
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,190
or Qin Yiran?

649
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:46,950
The same thing.

650
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,730
They are in the same situation.

651
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,700
They're the same. They're in the same pants.

652
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,870
They are from the same company.

653
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,640
Right?

654
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,380
In this world,

655
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,500
nobody dares

656
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,580
to stand me up.

657
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,250
I'll make it even

658
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,250
sooner or later.

659
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,840
What about you?

660
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,160
Didn't we agree to drink coke?

661
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,510
Why did you regret?

662
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,420
Drinking coke will make things worse.

663
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,490
The third chapter of that young boy came out?

664
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,900
The woman was impulsive for a moment

665
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,630
and did something aggressive.

666
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,700
How?

667
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,510
It's not what you think.

668
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,890
Tell me.

669
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,460
Well,

670
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,380
they finally

671
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,200
held hands.

672
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,250
That's it?

673
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,050
They just held hands?

674
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,390
That's all.

675
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,850
All right.

676
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,220
It's kind of a progress.

677
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,270
The young guy

678
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,060
is just there.

679
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,460
Right?

680
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,940
And they have entered into the next level.

681
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,610
Then hurry up.

682
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,260
Go straight and sail.

683
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,110
Age is not appropriate.

684
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,980
Status is not appropriate.

685
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,460
A lot of things are not appropriate.

686
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,590
What if...

687
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,880
There's no such thing.

688
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,820
A man and a woman

689
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,680
standing together is a good word.

690
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,990
Qin Yiran.

691
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:10,980
Look at you.

692
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,720
It's easy for you to say that.

693
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,740
You won't get married and have bady for your own good.

694
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,090
Your flag is well established.

695
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,490
I'm not getting married or having children

696
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,340
for safety.

697
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,890
I wonder if we have to

698
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,290
work overtime tomorrow.

699
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,900
I hope not.

700
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,790
That's true.

701
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,020
Sorry.

702
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,120
It's okay.

703
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,060
Why are you running so fast?

704
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,350
Are you afraid I'll block you?

705
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,750
You're just blocking me.

706
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:16,980
Yes.

707
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,650
You touched my hand yesterday.

708
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,060
I'm going to take a ride today.

709
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,610
Didn't we agree to be even?

710
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,520
So you won't

711
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,750
be my sister anymore?

712
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,580
Your brother wants you to drive him home today.

713
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,110
Let's go.

714
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,180
Guangxi. Here.

715
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,860
Eat more.

716
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,470
You can't get it, right?

717
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,180
Thank you, Aunt Lan.

718
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,970
Thank you, sister.

719
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,280
For you.

720
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,700
Thank you, sister.

721
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,700
You're an adult.

722
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,430
You don't know how to take food?

723
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,290
You gave it to me.

724
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,190
And you criticized me?

725
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,700
You trapped me.

726
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,890
How could you talk to your sister like that?

727
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,950
-No, she...
-Do you want to eat or not?

728
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,860
Alright.

729
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,090
Eat well.

730
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,490
Come on.

731
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,300
Come on. Eat.

732
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,240
Let's play basketball after dinner.

733
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:25,900
Cool.

734
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,530
Good.

735
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,460
Don't always work overtime.

736
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,040
Don't just focus on study.

737
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,110
And then get ill.

738
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,420
Go out and exercise.

739
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,300
Yes, mom.

740
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,610
The new recruitment is about to begin.

741
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,700
Can you

742
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,620
pass the postgraduate examination this year?

743
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,500
Your sister is right.

744
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,300
You must pass the exam this year.

745
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,680
How old are you?

746
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,940
Yet you still live off your parents.

747
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,660
Look at you.

748
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,970
What's wrong with me today?

749
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,850
Who did I offend?

750
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,980
You all attack me.

751
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,540
Go to the library and study tomorrow.

752
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,950
I'll check it when I'm back.

753
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,610
No, sister.

754
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,740
What's wrong with you?

755
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,760
Otherwise, we won't give you living expenses.

756
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,160
Right.

757
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,250
Don't give him living expenses.

758
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,100
I know,

759
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,110
in this family,

760
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,190
my sister treats my the best.

761
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,080
Have more meat.

762
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,540
You gave me such a fat piece.

763
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,940
I feel you work too hard.

764
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,550
Nice equipment.

765
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,659
But your skills are still the same.

766
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,170
What's wrong?

767
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,449
Look at my dark circles.

768
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,100
It's lucky

769
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,420
to play basketball with you.

770
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,250
My dad and my sister

771
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,110
are watching me at home every day.

772
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,290
And my sister has been scolding me lately.

773
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,260
I'm going crazy.

774
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,290
Damn it.

775
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,150
Now, it's your turn.

776
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,620
He's in a good mood.
