It's none of my business.

Yes.

151
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,580
some setbacks.

152
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,700
But speaking of this setback,

153
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,730
although it is a small setback,

154
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,220
I

155
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,220
need time to solve it.

156
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,090
You are quite familiar with Yu.

157
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,750
Would you like to take him with you for some days?

158
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,409
Such a big favor.

159
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,780
I cannot do it.

160
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,180
Don't say that.

161
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,030
Really.

162
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,620
It's really

163
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,740
not convenient for me these days.

164
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,260
I always take him to meet clients.

165
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,260
It's not serious.

166
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,730
Do you understand?

167
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,540
I will be worried

168
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,100
if he is alone.

169
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,020
Those people in the company have no time either.

170
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,480
Well...

171
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,220
The day before yesterday,

172
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,950
he ate alone

173
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,770
and had a stomachache

174
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,190
right?

175
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,800
So bad.

One day,

178
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,740
he turned on the air conditioner to a low temperature,

179
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,580
and faced the strong wind.

180
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,780
He had a fever, right?

181
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,350
Yes.

182
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,300
One time, the clothes stand fell down

183
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,600
on his head.

184
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,130
It hurt.

185
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,080
OK.

186
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,490
You two are cooperating with each other, right?

187
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,640
Impossible. No.

188
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,570
I can't even take good care of myself.

189
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:31,890
How could I

190
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,820
take care of a child?

191
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,740
Yes, look.

192
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,740
You cannot take good care of yourself.

193
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,780
He cannot take good care of himself either.

194
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,400
You two should be together

195
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,140
and take care of each other.

196
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,299
Chen Ye, did I not make things

197
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,340
clear last time?

198
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,900
Clear.

199
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,659
Very clear.

200
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,980
We're brothers and friends, right?

201
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,940
Good brothers help each other.

202
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,870
This is about brothers.

203
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,070
Don't you wanna help?

204
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,620
Fine. Are you tricking me?

205
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:47,990
No.

206
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,020
I'm asking for your help sincerely.

207
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,540
No.

208
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,310
You...

209
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,540
How could you do this?

210
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,710
Mom.

211
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
Do you not want me to go to your house?

212
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,560
Please.

213
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,110
Hurry up.

214
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,780
I need to go to the toilet.

215
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,780
I need to go to the toilet.

216
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,460
That's my room.

217
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,370
Here.

218
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:22,940
Toilet.

219
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,930
Here.

220
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,250
I knew it.

221
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,910
How could I

222
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,370
take care of a child?

223
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,270
Motorbike.

224
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,120
Yu.

225
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,170
Let me ask you.

226
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,010
What happened to your dad?

227
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,130
He's busy.

228
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,430
Come on.

229
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,660
He's busy all the time.

230
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,240
And he can't handle it now?

231
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,440
Mom, do you have a snack box?

232
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,090
I don't have snacks in my house.

233
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,260
My carpet.

234
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,150
Gaming machine.

235
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,100
This is not a gaming machine.

236
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,740
This is not fun.

237
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,570
You can't play this.

238
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,770
Snack box.

239
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,830
This is not a snack box.

240
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,390
I want some drinks.

241
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:27,850
Yu.

242
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,140
Yu.

243
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,630
How about you

244
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,250
take a nap?

245
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,000
But Mom, I'm hungry.

246
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,850
Hungry?

247
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,640
Well,

248
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,740
I'll go check

249
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
in the fridge.

250
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,420
Stay here.

251
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,480
Don't move!

252
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,150
Mom.

253
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,860
Why is your fridge empty?

254
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,770
Yu,

255
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,100
let's drink...

256
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,730
It's inappropriate.

257
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,650
Let me order food for you.

258
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,530
Hurray!

259
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,990
Hello, who is it?

260
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,980
Mr. Li.

261
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,690
Chen Ye?

262
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,230
That one.

263
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,220
The one from That's A Big

264
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,680
Animation Movie Company.

265
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,040
Ma,

266
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,150
do you have any projects recently?

267
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,980
I...

268
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,420
Has your wife delivered the baby?

269
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,480
Doing it right now?

270
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,960
Well, I won't bother you.

271
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Won't bother you.

272
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,730
Hello?

273
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,070
Brother.

274
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,410
Chen Ye, are you free?

275
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,420
Yes.

276
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:18,920
Go ahead.

277
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,490
I have an urgent project.

278
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,780
Do you have time for it?

279
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,480
Yes.

280
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,140
Our company just finished a new project.

281
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,900
We have time.

282
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,820
Help me edit the green screen.

283
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,120
Edit the green screen?

284
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,160
Yes, it's urgent.

285
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,580
No problem.

286
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,900
What do we animation companys

287
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,700
do well in?

288
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,060
We do best in editing green screen.

289
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,720
No problem.

290
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,820
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

291
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,750
No problem.

292
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,940
Is that all?

293
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,620
Yes.

294
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,580
Editing green screen is fine.

295
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,840
Sesame is also food.

296
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,020
Is it really meaningful

297
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,980
to compare it

298
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,070
frame by frame?

299
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,540
Although both sides

300
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,370
have reasons

301
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,250
in plagiarism,

302
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,900
the measurable analysis

303
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
should be strong.

304
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,780
If Dad Chen wants to file a lawsuit,

305
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
we need evidence.

306
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,260
If we need to safeguard legitimate rights on the Internet,

307
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,300
we need evidence.

308
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,180
What you said

309
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,280
makes sense.

310
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,470
-Children, here comes the work. -Three-Character Canon.

311
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,020
Children's lesson

312
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,130
cartoon.

313
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,850
Dad Chen.

314
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,940
Let me tell you.

315
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,880
I have pains

316
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,580
in my hands, legs, eyes

317
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,190
and butt.

318
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,600
I can't do it anymore.

319
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,090
You must be tired from staying up late.

320
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,100
Have some noodles first.

321
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,430
Here.

322
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,900
Thank you, Yike.

323
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,100
Be wary of being a mother in a relationship.

324
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Watch your mouth.

325
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,660
Thank you.

326
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,740
You're welcome.

327
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,260
How much is left?

328
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,600
Some. I still have to work hard.

329
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,600
Fighting.

330
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,220
I'll wait for you at the back.

331
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,099
Where's the original file before the color adjustment?

332
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,020
You have it too, right?

333
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,280
Send it to me via email.

334
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,690
I want the one

335
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,620
with 14 minutes.

336
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,890
Let me search it.

337
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,690
Guangxi.

338
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,380
Go to sleep.

339
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,490
You have to go to work tomorrow morning.

340
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,170
I will hug you for a while.

341
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,140
If you distract me,

342
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,190
it's not good.

343
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,630
Leave now.

344
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,600
Good night.

345
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,320
Good night.

346
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,390
To be honest, Frank,

347
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,340
I really don't understand

348
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,340
why you

349
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,670
are doing this?

350
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,480
The Marketing Department is

351
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,320
an important department of the company.

352
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,960
In this time,

353
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
you cut the resources of Marketing Department...

354
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,130
I'm okay with that.

355
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,430
But the employees

356
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,630
will feel unstable.

357
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,480
Do you want to check my emails?

358
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,380
It's filled with applications for internal transfer.

359
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,240
They all want to be transferred to the live stream team.

360
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,040
As long as people don't leave,

361
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,460
there is no problem.

362
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,740
But Frank,

363
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,260
stores and counters are also important.

364
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,120
We can't give up

365
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,380
the traditional territory.

366
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,780
Wherever the talents go,

367
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,950
that place becomes important.

368
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,980
I don't need to

369
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,610
explain this for you, right?

370
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,690
But

371
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,500
Ms. Yin is

372
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,260
at the edge of the storm.

373
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:00,870
Yes.

374
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,870
It takes time

375
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,570
to adjust stores and counters.

376
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:04,980
I

377
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,060
have done it myself.

378
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,440
At this critical point,

379
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,580
I just hope the distribution of resources

380
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
can be fairer.

381
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,750
Live Stream Department achieves good results.

382
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,690
Of course I'm willing to

383
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,090
give them the resources.

384
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,190
Mr. Kong,

385
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,730
how about you go

386
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,610
and discuss it with Ms. Yin?

387
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,170
Frank.

388
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:24,760
Okay.

389
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,780
That’s enough. Thank you very much.

390
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,680
Mr. Kong.

391
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,550
Well.

392
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,700
Yin Yike

393
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,690
is really lucky.

394
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,550
Keep an eye on the Live Stream Department.

395
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,800
I don't believe

396
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,910
they won't make any mistakes.

397
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,430
OK.

398
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,440
Mr. Kong, I’m leaving.

399
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,940
She's been devoted so much for days.

400
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,020
Yes.

401
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,320
If it weren't for Yike

402
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,990
went out for business,

403
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,620
she'll definitely ask for leave.

404
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,550
But now,

405
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,090
she never moved her butt

406
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,280
since she sat there and started work.

407
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,370
She must be heartbroken.

408
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,320
Stop gossiping.

409
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,020
Learn from Xiaomian.

410
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,110
She’s sick and still comes to work.

411
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,570
The live stream data is increasing rapidly.

412
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,620
As the saying goes,

413
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,730
if you don't suffer when you are young,

414
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,140
you will eat dirt after you become an adult.

415
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,330
Talking during working hours

416
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,520
and you are so happy?

417
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,290
Where is Ms. Yin?

418
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,140
Yike.

419
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,640
She went out for a meeting.

420
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,270
She's not here.

421
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,400
All of you are idle.

422
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,210
Is there any problem

423
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,700
at work?

424
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,480
What?

425
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,220
Do you need my help?

426
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,070
Jiang Man.

427
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,320
We're not in trouble.

428
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,650
No？

429
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,420
Have you finished the marketing plan

430
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,620
for the next quarter?

431
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,850
Yes.

432
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,390
Frank also approved it.

433
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,140
Did the live stream data last week

434
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,930
reach the standard?

435
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,020
Not only that,

436
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,790
we also exceeded the standard.

437
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,020
Is there a live streamer's data

438
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,410
that is not good enough?

439
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,180
Shut up!

440
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,870
I haven't finished my manuscript yet.

441
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,540
The exceeded data is achieved by me,

442
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,970
Xia Xiaomian by working overtime.

443
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,860
Do you have any other questions?

444
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,470
No.

445
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,170
No.

446
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,910
Good luck.

447
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,110
Xiaomian, you…

448
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,240
Are you alright?

449
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,400
Did you catch a cold?

450
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,200
Just a cold.

451
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,550
I’m fine.

452
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,200
Xiaomian.

453
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,400
Thanks.

454
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,190
I still have something

455
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,180
to tidy up in the live streaming room.

456
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,440
You guys keep working.

457
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,780
Xiaomian, take care.

458
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,260
This is the preliminary advertisement plan

459
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,940
for this new online exclusive products.

460
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,860
In a word,

461
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,900
I hope half of it would be real people,

462
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,300
and half animated characters

463
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,370
and use that combination

464
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,500
to increase the sense of fantasy.

465
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,550
A sense of connection.

466
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,930
It mainly focuses on

467
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,740
young spokesperson and ACGN virtual characters.

468
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,180
As for the clothing,

469
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,650
I also found Aiwen Office

470
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,970
which is top in the industry

471
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,970
to help us with it.

472
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,460
Then your company

473
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,810
should make a visual mockup

474
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,010
for me to have a look.

475
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,000
I hope

476
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,610
there are more elements and style

477
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,540
of young people.

478
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,250
OK.

479
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,530
I'll note down

480
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,360
your opinions.

481
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,990
We will do some research

482
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,000
after I go back.

483
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:47,840
I find your company

484
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,300
has quite a wide range of business.

485
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,510
Do you make animation movies?

486
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,510
What? Ms. Yin, do you have a project?

487
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,220
My friend's company

488
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,420
is looking for a partner.

489
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,640
So I thought I'd just ask you.

490
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,340
Here's the thing.

491
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,150
Our company

492
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,770
is still focusing on

493
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,880
ad videos.

494
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,840
Animation is just

495
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,200
being done on the side.

496
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,330
Animation movies

497
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,490
are too risky.

498
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,790
Our company is not capable of doing it.

499
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,460
Ms. Yin, I can only say sorry.

500
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,170
It's okay.

501
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,430
I was just asking.

502
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,970
We've been talking for a long time.

503
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,810
Ms. Yin, have some coffee.

504
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,470
Have a rest.

505
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,170
The ribs are nice.

506
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
It's been a long time

507
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,300
since Guangxi came back for dinner.

508
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,630
Why isn't he here today?

509
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,880
He's working overtime today.

510
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,340
It's good to be busy.

511
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,450
He's ambitious.

512
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,330
Unlike him,

513
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,990
who is idle

514
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
and does nothing.

515
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,420
Dad.

516
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,910
Why did you change so fast?

517
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,470
Didn't you two

518
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,020
not like each other some time earlier?

519
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,830
Why are you bribed now?

520
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,020
Also, I've been studying

521
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,740
very hard recently.

522
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,380
My eyes are all messed up.

523
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
Do you want to eat?

524
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,450
Yes.

525
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,530
Did you two fight?

526
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,620
No, of course not.

527
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,260
There must be something.

528
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,820
Can you hide this from me?

529
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,850
No matter what happened,

530
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:12,900
tell me.

531
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:14,910
You

532
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,820
always meddled in it.

533
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,700
She was afraid of you.

534
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,740
So she didn't dare to tell you.

535
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,340
It's okay.

536
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,100
Tell me

537
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,140
what happened between you two?

538
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,800
No, no.

539
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,870
My daughter is afraid of me?

540
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,030
You're afraid of me?

541
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,210
Dad.

542
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,530
It's nothing serious.

543
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,530
It's just that a project

544
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,190
Guangxi worked for a long time

545
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,230
was plagiarized.

546
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,440
His company

547
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,460
is in diffuculty.

548
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,380
I didn't want to pressure him,

549
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,790
so I came back to eat with you.

550
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,020
I'll pack some delicious food

551
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,780
for him later.

552
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,250
Isn't this a big deal?

553
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,900
Doesn't that mean all the hard work

554
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,390
Guangxi did

555
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,500
is nothing now?

556
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,140
I said you shouldn't look for someone younger.

557
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,780
Not someone younger.

558
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,230
Look.

559
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,660
You'll suffer in the end.

560
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,520
What are you talking about again?

561
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,120
The truth.

562
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,330
Ke.

563
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,620
Tell me the truth.

564
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,610
Is he alright?

565
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,690
He's indeed in a bad mood lately.

566
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,830
But Aunt Lan,

567
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,450
don't ask him.

568
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,140
I don't want to pressure him.

569
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,660
Okay.

570
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,990
Look at him.

571
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,450
Look.

572
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,050
Take this.

573
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,490
Dad, this is...

574
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
I said I don't care.

575
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,900
Can I really not care?

576
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,520
You are my daughter.

577
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,280
I know

578
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,180
the work Guangxi is working on

579
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,140
has a bright future.

580
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,700
It's just some difficulties.

581
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,590
Every young man

582
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,900
would encounter some difficulties (in life).

583
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,780
Don't worry too much.

584
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,340
Just get over it.

585
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,180
Right?

586
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,060
Let's eat.

587
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,820
Dad.

588
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,660
This matter

589
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,260
has nothing to do with money.

590
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,430
Take this card back.

591
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,450
Take it.

592
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,700
I feel better if you take it.

593
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,820
Don't forget

594
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,360
I'm here for you no matter what.

595
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,160
You have nothing to be afraid of.

596
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,940
Let's eat.

597
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,570
Dad.

598
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,250
Dad.

599
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:09,890
I...

600
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,490
I have some financial problems

601
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,130
in my live stream.

602
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,000
-Can you... -Raising a daughter with money, and contrary for a son.

603
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,820
This is our rule.

604
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,990
Shut up.

605
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,980
Enough. Look at you.

606
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,860
As we speak...

607
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,180
things become serious again.

608
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,900
Come on, let's eat.

609
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,600
What?

610
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,330
I'm the most cared for

611
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,470
in the family now?

612
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,700
Even you are here to help.

613
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,280
Sister,

614
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,540
has your Live Stream Department been busy recently?

615
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,220
Yes.

616
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,660
I just got promoted

617
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,180
and the Live Stream Department is a key department.

618
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,840
Super busy.

619
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,700
Super busy.

620
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,780
How busy is it?

621
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,320
You don't even have time to reply messages kind of busy?

622
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,890
What?

623
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,210
Did you quarrel with Xia Xiaomian?

624
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,980
How is that possible?

625
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
Xia Xiaomian has changed

626
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,540
her clothing style.

627
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,940
She even told me on her own accord

628
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,700
that after work

629
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,620
she wanted to do additional live streams.

630
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,530
And...

631
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,040
What?

632
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,820
Besides,

633
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,790
the upset look

634
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,270
on your face is so blatant.

635
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,210
Is it that obvious?

636
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,830
It's too obvious, okay?

637
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,390
You're an adult.

638
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,100
You don't need me

639
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,440
to teach you how to date, right?

640
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,340
If you like her,

641
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,540
take the initiative.

642
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,180
How could I like her?

643
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,720
You don't like her?

644
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,910
Forget it then.

645
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,700
I had some information

646
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,660
I wanted to tell you.

647
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,720
What information?

648
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,100
Didn't you say you don't like her?

649
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,470
I...

650
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,480
I just think she's different.

651
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,660
How?

652
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,160
Four eyes and two noses?

653
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,520
No, sister.

654
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,200
Other girls

655
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,780
need boys to protect them.

656
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,850
But instead, Xia Xiaomian is always here for me

657
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,150
whenever I’m in trouble.

658
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,340
And she always helps me

659
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,070
solve the problem just in time.

660
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,690
Including

661
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,010
when our dad was hospitalized last time,

662
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,470
she gave me her bank card

663
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,180
and said she wanted to help our family overcome the difficulties.

664
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,190
Also,

665
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,750
the strange stuff of girls.

666
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,100
I don't know how to say it, sister.

667
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,860
I...

668
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,020
She's just different to me.

669
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,620
-You, you... -Okay, I got it.

670
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,710
So you like

671
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,280
being protected.

672
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,140
Xia Xiaomian is sick.

673
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,050
Sick?

674
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,810
When I watched her live stream today,

675
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,890
she kept coughing,

676
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,780
and she's still holding on.

677
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,480
What should I do?

678
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
Are you asking me?

679
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,260
What are you waiting for?

680
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,420
Go and see her.

681
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,430
-Yes. -Wait.

682
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,500
She seems to have a fever.

683
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,830
Take the cold medicine.

684
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,350
Okay, I got it.

685
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,130
I'm leaving.

686
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,700
Thank you for reminding me.

687
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,610
Come on.

688
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,120
Of course.

689
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,620
Fever, cold.

690
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,630
Hello, boss.

691
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,520
Prepare a

692
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,700
woman's T-shirt for me.

693
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,830
I'm coming to get it from your shop now.

694
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,530
Okay, thank you.

695
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:22,960
Bye.

696
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,660
When will this hellish working hours

697
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,490
come to an end?

698
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,730
I will fall sick even

699
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,500
before I catch the fish.

700
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,190
Leave the parcel at the door.

701
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,540
I told you to leave it...

702
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,700
I heard my sister say you're sick.

703
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,960
I bought you some food.

704
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,150
I can order takeout for myself.

705
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,400
I also brought you cold medicine.

706
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,800
Targeting your symptoms.

707
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,470
If I'm sick,

708
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,900
I can see a doctor myself.

709
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,140
Wait.

710
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:22,900
Wait.

711
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,010
I... I brought you a script.

712
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,670
I can help you with your lines.

713
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,170
I don't need it.

714
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,670
How many times do I have to tell you?

715
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,500
Leave now!

716
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,170
Let me explain.

717
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,030
I don’t want to listen. Leave now!

718
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,170
Xiaomian!

719
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,070
Xiaomian!

720
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,360
Gosh, it’s hot.

721
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,470
Gosh, you temperature is still so high.

722
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,020
Wait for me.

723
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,080
I'll go get a towel.

724
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,170
You...

725
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,580
Why are you

726
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,880
suddenly so nice to me?

727
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,760
Because

728
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,300
we are friends.

729
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,400
Do you take care of your friend

730
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,050
in the middle of the night?

731
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,300
My bangs are wet.

732
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,060
Sorry.

733
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,300
I think

734
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,310
we are closer

735
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,770
than friends.

736
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,270
Aren't there

737
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,550

738
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,230
to describe

739
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,450
our relationship?

740
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,580
That day...

741
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,390
What happened that day.

742
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,390
It's my...

743
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,080
I...

744
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,200
Alright.

745
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,820
Stop it.

746
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,280
I don't...

747
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,370
No, I don't want to hear your excuses.

748
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,940
I'm sleepy.

749
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,040
Hurry up and leave.

750
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,860
Wait a minute.

751
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,470
I brought,

752
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,230
I brought you an apology gift.

753
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,530
And there's medicine in it.

754
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,800
White ones for the day.

755
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,150
Blue ones for the night.

756
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,660
And purple ones

757
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,690
should be taken before meals.

758
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,380
The red ones are taken after meals.

759
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,850
If you have a fever,

760
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,940
the blue ones

761
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,300
are the most effective.

762
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,680
The red one and the green one...

763
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,060
I'm leaving. Take care of yourself.

764
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,780
The water is here.

765
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,940
Call me if you need anything.

766
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,500
Bye.

Yike.

770
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,770
What does he mean?

771
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,340
He said he was unreasonable.

772
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,100
That's okay.

773
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,219
Why did he say I'm making a scene?

774
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,810
Yike, why are you laughing at me?

775
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,260
I'm so professional

776
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,230
and capable now.

777
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm not making a scene.

778
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,620
Tell me.

779
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,380
What happened between you two?

780
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,620
What else can happen between us?

781
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,270
You know that

782
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,850
I used to show excessive passion

783
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,460
to his cold face.

784
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,900
But recently,

785
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,090
we...

786
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,200
Well...

787
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,900
Well...

788
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,540
We kissed.

789
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,000
But,

790
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,150
after the kiss

791
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,300
he said he forgot it the next day.

792
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,470
It's okay that he forgot it.

793
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,940
He actually told me that he lost his memory.

794
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,260
He doesn't remember anything.

795
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,610
Is there such a person?

796
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,730
Speaking of this, I'm angry.

797
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,300
How did you teach your brother?

798
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,660
He has the final say in everything.

799
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Why?

800
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,180
Xiaomian, calm down.

801
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,820
Do you feel better for your cold?

802
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,420
Yike, that's not the point.

803
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,430
The point is

804
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,540
when I am sick,

805
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,020
when I am most vulnerable,

806
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,860
he sent me this,

807
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:36,730
saying he was unreasonable.

808
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,340
That's okay.

809
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,870
Why did he say I made a scene?

810
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,460
He said he was unreasonable.

811
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,430
That's right.

812
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,320
But he didn't say you made a scene.

813
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,990
What does that mean?

814
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,060
Making a scene?

815
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,660
Yes.

816
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,700
How dare he judges me?

817
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,990

818
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,150
Think about idioms.

819
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,270
I know idioms.

827
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,960

Wu Li Qu Nao.(Qu has the similar sound to marry in Chinese)

831
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,120
Does this mean he confessed to me?

832
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,440
Although my brother

833
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,080
is not good at talking,

834
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,180
this time,

835
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,100
I'm still on my brother's side.

836
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,060
I didn't say I would forgive him.

837
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,420
It's hard to make me forgive someone after I'm angry.

838
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,240
I'll keep the clothes for you.

839
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,980
I just thought about it.

840
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,540
I was really making a scene.

841
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,740
I still have a lot of work to do.

842
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,200
Yike, I'll think about it.

843
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,100
Think about it later.

844
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,980
I still have a lot of work to do.

845
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,540
Yike.

846
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,270

848
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,110

849
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,860
I called you several times for the meal.

850
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,960
What are you doing?

851
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,170
Hurry up and eat. I have something to do.

852
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,340
Where's Aunt Lan?

853
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,420
She went to that elderly society university

854
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,850
and art show.

855
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,020
I have to pick her up

856
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,000
after the meal

857
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,720
What are you doing? I've been calling you for some time.

858
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,380
What's wrong?

859
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,180
Why are you so down?

860
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,610
What happened?

861
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,140
Nothing.

862
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,430
Nothing?

863
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,430
Did you quarrel with that girl?

864
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,280
She likes you.

865
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,090
How can you tell that?

866
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,950
If she doesn't like you,

867
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,570
how can she come here

868
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,270
in the middle of the night to lick my shoes

869
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,870
and teach me live streaming?

870
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,170
You can tell?

871
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,610
Why didn't you remind me?

872
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,020
You only care about my sister.

873
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,900
Your sister is a girl.

874
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,650
Of course I have to take care of her.

875
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,130
You don't need me to worry about.

876
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,230
If you had,

877
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
I wouldn't have quarreled with her.

878
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,670
Son,

879
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,580
I should remind you about this?

880
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,820
Are you a pig?

881
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,590
You gave birth to a pig.

882
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,950
Do you want to be beaten?

883
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,150
Okay, dad.

884
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,210
I'll be honest with you.

885
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,290
Don't scold me.

886
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,760
We did quarrel.

887
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,220
I searched

888
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,460
on the Internet.

889
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,540
Giving gifts and flowers

890
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,640
Nothing worked.

891
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,260
Since we've talked about it,

892
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,480
can you teach me something?

893
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,740
How did you win Auntie Lan's heart?

894
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,600
Back then,

895
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,970
when I was pursuing her,

896
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,560
she was hesitant too.

897
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,790
I asked her

898
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,260
are you happy

899
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,220
with me today?

900
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,160
She said happy.

901
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,900
I said OK.

902
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,710
Tomorrow,

903
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,970
I will try to make you happy.

904
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,980
We don't have to think long.

905
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
It goes like this.

906
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,270
I'll protect you.

907
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,460
You'll guard me.

908
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,460
Let's live

909
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,030
every day happily.

910
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,710
Then, day by day,

911
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,240
and

912
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,120
a lifetime

913
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,210
will pass.

914
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,510
Her eyes

915
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,810
suddenly lit up.

916
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,460
I knew it.

917
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,920
It worked.

918
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,640
That's all?

919
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,560
No.

920
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,620
No flowers?

921
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,530
No.

922
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,860
A romantic scene?

923
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,690
No.

924
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,560
Sweet love words?

925
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,910
It's useless

926
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,610
to have those garish things.

927
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,950
Not every woman

928
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,790
likes it.

929
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,000
Son,

930
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,950
if you truly

931
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,500
care about this girl,

932
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,160
she'll know it.

933
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:33,940
Understand?

934
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,860
Yes.

935
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,350
Why are you still eating?

936
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,340
Go find that girl.

937
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,340
Tell her

938
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,490
what you have in mind.

939
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,370
Dad, I see.

940
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:49,990
I'll go.

941
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,490
Son.

942
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,780
Sincerity.

943
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,850
Got it.

944
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,420
Xia Xiaomian.

945
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,600
I...

946
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,380
Hello, everyone.

947
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,130
Welcome to SC's So Good Live Room.

948
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,240
The most important thing for girls

949
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,970
is attitude.

950
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,830
Go.

951
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,910
Little Xiaomian.

952
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,700
This is our product today.

953
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,730
Heart Flutter.

954
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:37,410
Hello, everyone.

955
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,700
This is Dan from Xiafei Road.

956
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,140
I will take

957
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,050
this time of everyone.

958
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,020
I want to say something to Xiaomian.

959
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,550
I have nothing to say to you.

960
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,340
Well...

961
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,580
Babies, ignore him.

962
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,740
Let's continue our live stream.

963
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,340
I like you.

Here are the noodles.

970
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,280
-Enjoy. -Thank you.

971
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,170
Yibo, have some noodles.

972
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,820
Although this restaurant is a street stall,

973
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,190
it tastes very good.

974
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,280
I like it very much.

975
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,100
Try it.

976
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,940
Try it.

977
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,410
Is something bothering you?

978
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,420
Yibo,

979
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,380
I haven't seen that girl

980
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,380
for a long time.

981
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,460
Last time,

982
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,300
when you were drunk,

983
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,580
she sent you back.

984
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,170
Last time,

985
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,700
she sent me back?

986
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,400
Yes.

987
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,860
Don't you remember?

988
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,780
You were drunk

989
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,030
and let a little girl

990
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,200
carry you back.

991
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,630
That girl is quite nice.

992
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,770
She's quite lively

993
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,740
and warm-hearted.

994
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,080
She's pretty too.

995
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,070
Your dad and I both

996
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,670
think she's good.

997
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,290
You both think so?

998
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,650
But let me remind you.

999
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,070
You have to

1000
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,860
think it through on your own.

1001
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
Don't regret it

1002
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,540
when you lose it.

1003
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,870
Thank you, Aunt Lan.

1004
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,780
Silly boy.

1005
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,440
Don't mention it. We're family.

1006
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,060
Come on, have some noodles.

1007
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,320
The noodles are soggy.
