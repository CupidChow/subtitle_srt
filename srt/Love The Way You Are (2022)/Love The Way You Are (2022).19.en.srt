Flower World called me

132
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,880

133
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,820
You're indeed a great lawyer.

You're so efficient.

135

Don't you know my work style?

136
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,930
Efficiency is important for me.

137
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,670
I checked it.

138
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,380
Flower World is close to your home.

139
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,570
So I came to pick you up.

140
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,370
It's for work.

141
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,300
Can I

142
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,560
take care of you today?

143
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,140
What are you doing?

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,340
Illegal parking.

145

I've recorded it for the traffic police

146

147
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,870
and you run away.

148
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,140
Are you kidding me?

149
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,020
I'm here to pick Yike up.

150
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,650
You have to obey the law, no matter who you pick up.

00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,650
Not to mention that you're a lawyer.

Let me give you a lift.

155
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,300
Have you forgotten what I told you before?

156
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,630
I installed a navigation system.

157
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,630
I exchanged points for garage kits.

158
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,360
You exchanged points for garage kits?

159
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,480
How will you pay my money back?

160
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,950
You don't understand.

161
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,950
Lawyers usually pursue victory.

162
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,700
I usually pursue happiness.

163
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,100
Opening blind boxes is exciting, right?

164
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,990
I'll let Guangxi give me a lift.

165
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,650
I promised to give him points.

166

Mr. Xu will drive for you.

169
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:16,900
Let me drive.

170

171
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,900
I found

173
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,190
you became

174
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,380
a devil brother.

175
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,150
I made this early in the morning.

176
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,080
You must finish it. Don't waste it.

177
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,830
It's a heart-shaped fried egg.

178
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,820
It looks like my life

179
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,220
will be taken over by you.

180
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,700
What? You don't accept?

181
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
I accept.

182
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,670
It's good for me.

183
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,960
I'm not stupid.

184
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,130
Let's go home tonight

185
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:05,820
and have dinner together.

186
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,700
Yes,

187
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,530
Mr. Xu.

188
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,330
Guangxi.

189
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,660
Drive my car to your company.

190
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,500
I'll see you after work.

191
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:41,860
Okay.

192
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,460
Yike.

193
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,410
Register at the reception first.

194
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,410
I'll come there after I park the car.

195
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,770
I'll get back to work.

196
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,790
Thank you.

197
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,020
Driver.

198
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,300
But some things

199
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,090
can only be solved by me.

200
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,510
Your brother cares about you.

201
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,070
Do you need me

202
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,900
to cooperate with you later?

203
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,780
Flower World

204
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,640
is quite tough.

205
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,150
No need.

206
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,680
I'll handle it for you.

207
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,500
I mean,

208
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,860
I'll do my best to protect SC's interests.

209
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,820
Thank you, driver.

210
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,780
But some things

211
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,460
can only be solved by me.

212
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,960
Baba hasn't come back yet.

213
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,980
Do we

214
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,790
lose hope again this time?

215
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,350
Will we fail?

216
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,730
If we failed,

217
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,640
we would have no money this month.

218
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,660
He's gone there for so long.

219
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,880
Can we succeed this time?

220
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,940
Do we have to revise the script again?

221
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,100
I'm tired.

222
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,830
You're wrong.

223
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,980
Having chances to revise it is better than having no chances.

224
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,820
Having chances means there's still hope.

225
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,700
For our dreams,

226
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,020
strive.

227
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,040
Revise it.

228
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,860
But we

229
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,820
are almost bald.

230
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,940
They never recommend it.

231
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,750
Then we...

232
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,930
Having ideas is good,

233
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,140
but revising the script takes much time.

234
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,900
Revise it.

235
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,300
The script belongs to us.

236
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,900
Just revise it for fun.

237
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,180
They also

238
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,830
make some valuable suggestions.

239
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,020
But what if

240
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,900
they trick us?

241
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,370
What if we spend all our time

242
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,850
without making any money?

243
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,320
What a waste of time!

244
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,640
Let me tell you another secret.

245
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,330
We already have a client

246
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,220
who has invested in our company.

247
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,070
Really?

248
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,870
Money is not a problem.

249
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,340
I think the one who invested in our company

250
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,220
is crazy.

251
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,460
Exactly.

252
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,140
This company has no development.

253
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,370
Let me ask you.

254
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,100
Who paid the water bill, the electricity bill and the rent

255
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,050
last time?

256
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,840
Use your brain to think about it.

257
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,610
I am

258
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,410
the boss you mentioned.

259
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,700
The water bill and the electricity bill

260
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,560
was paid by Chen

261
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,370
with my tuition fees.

262
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,610
Babes,

263
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,180
I'm back.

264
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,890
I have good news

265
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,790
and bad news.

266
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,750
Which one do you want to hear first?

267
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,340
Both.

268
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,750
Why are you suddenly...

269
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,420
The good news is

270
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,910
Mr. Xie has watched

271
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,900
our demo.

272
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,170
He thinks it's very good.

273
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,490
He's very satisfied.

274
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,060
But the bad news is

275
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,070
they made a few

276
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,060
suggestions.

277
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,619
I know you've been busy

278
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,740
and revised it many times lately.

279
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,640
But these...

280
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,630
I'll revise the movements.

281
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,859
Leave the voice-over to me.

282
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,880
I'll revise the text.

283
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,010
I'll revise colors.

284
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,660
These opinions

285
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,829
are quite professional.

286
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,740
But some creative details

287
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,000
they mentioned are...

288
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,329
I'll adjust it.

289
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:23,589
Let's have a meeting in the meeting room.

290
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,470
These creative details

291
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,910
are really

292
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,130
easy to adjust.

293
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,990
I've read

294
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,100
your statement of response.

295
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,630
The amount of compensation

296
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,030
is still a little small.

297
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,480
We can't accept it.

298
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,470
Our request is

299
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:49,980
two million.

300
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,650
This is different.

301
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,910
After all, the third party involved

302
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,970
was once an employee of your company.

303
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,110
There are still some controversies.

304
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,290
We cannot just

305
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,180
base on the previous cases.

306
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,690
Now SC is willing to pay compensation.

307
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,940
It is the most sincere way

308
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,070
of reconciliation.

309
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,940
After all,

310
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,110
your official seal was counterfeited.

311
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,100
You'll be criticized

312
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,420
by the public.

313
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,580
Mr. Li.

314
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,300
Are you threatening us?

315
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,520
Actually, in this matter,

316
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,970
SC didn't bring

317
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,980
negative impacts

318
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,380
to your corporate image.

319
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,220
On the contrary,

320
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,220
the promotion, including presales,

321
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,720
we did in advance

322
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,510
had a very positive result.

323
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,510
In fact,

324
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,500
it also helped your company

325
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,210
attract more attention and do promotion.

326
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,260
Can we

327
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,900
talk about the compensation agreement

328
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,620
based on

329
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,380
the value of this part?

330
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,840
Of course,

331
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,460
SC is actually a very good fragrance brand

332
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,180
on the market.

333
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,790
We also hope

334
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,220
we can turn this false cooperation

335
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,550
into real cooperation.

336
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,380
This...

337
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,380
This isn't

338
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,220
about the law.

339
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,620
We can't make a decision.

340
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,420
So I've always wanted

341
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,700
to meet Ms. Xu.

342
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,460
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,750
Excuse me.

344
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,180
I think your company has seen

345
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,660
Miss Yin's sincerity.

346
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,410
If you

347
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,510
filed a lawsuit,

348
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,290
the legal costs

349
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,610
would be huge.

350
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,030
For both companies,

351
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,780
it would be a huge loss.

352
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,310
And I also called

353
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,070
Mr. Zhou of your headquarters.

354
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,550
He said the same thing.

355
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,460
I think we should

356
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,460
discuss it again.

357
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,210
Let's talk about it later.

358
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,140
How about this?

359
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,780
We'll consult Ms. Xu.

360
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,840
Eye tracking isn't sensitive enough.

361
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,440
The shot isn't realistic enough.

362
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,330
Adjust it.

363
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,350
Okay, Ms. Xu.

364
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:55,940
Ms. Xu.

365
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,660
How is it?

366
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,870
These are the minutes of the meeting.

367
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,300
He used Mr. Zhou to threaten me?

368
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,140
Doesn't he know Flower World

369
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,180
is independent

370
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,070
and doesn't let the headquarters intervene?

371
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,140
But Miss Yin's ideas

372
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,820
are good.

373
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,460
Don't change the compensation.

374
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,220
I want to know

375
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,350
what aces they have.

376
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,300
Got it, Ms. Xu.

377
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,870
Chen,

378
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,830
when will we

379
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,060
look for mommy?

380
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,850
Baba! Baba! Baba!

381
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,680
Baba.

382
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,460
Are you going to accomplish

383
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,190
your dreams

384
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:44,980
before

385
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,060
accomplishing ours?

386
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,010
Right.

387
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,300
Right, Baba. Go now.

388
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,490
What are you talking about?

389
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,690
Have a meeting first.

390
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:54,900
Come on.

391
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,510
So I think

392
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,940
this palette...

393
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,860
Yu.

394
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,910
Firstly, you can't call

395
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,820
that miss mom.

396
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,540
She'll get mad if she hears it.

397
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,170
Okay?

398
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,940
Secondly,

399
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,880
I'm really busy now.

400
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,180
Go and play with yourself.

401
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,690
Okay?

402
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,500
When I'm done,

403
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,220
I'll take you to eat hamburgers.

404
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,660
Okay?

405
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,690
Okay, go ahead.

406
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,280
Okay. Thank you, Yu.

407
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,170
The packaging of this perfume pencil

408
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,220
is too big.

409
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,230
Small decorative bags

410
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,650
are in fashion this year.

411
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,710
Even large-screen phones cannot fit in them.

412
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,610
If our products

413
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,410
can't fit in them,

414
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,020
we will lose

415
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,550
many potential customers.

416
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,740
Adjust it.

417
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,980
Yiran.

418
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,260
There's a kid looking for you.

419
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,860
A kid?

420
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,410
Mom.

421
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,600
Mom. A cold.

422
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,080
Yiran.

423
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,110
You did something big in silence.

424
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,700
Godson.

425
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,210
This is my godson.

426
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,860
Yu.

427
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,840
Come with me.

428
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,250
She has a child?

429
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,140
What's going on?

430
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,810
What's going on?

431
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,620
Chen Ye.

432
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,810
Chen Ye.

433
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,050
Chen Ye.

434
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,450
Chen...

435
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,310
Come out.

436
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,550
Oh no.

437
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,890
Qin Yiran who is from SC?

438
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,640
That's her.

439
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,380
Medicine.

440
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,010
Here, kid.

441
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,540
At this age,

442
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,770
can you be more reliable?

443
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,100
Why are you so nice to me?

444
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,980
I made you so angry,

445
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,930
but you bought me medicine.

446
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,010
Are you crazy?

447
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,900
This is for kids.

448
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,650
Are you sick?

449
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,810
When did you get sick?

450
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,260
Mom, it is Chen who is sick.

451
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,320
Not me.

452
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,470
No.

453
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,300
Why

454
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,460
didn't you say it clearly?

455
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,410
What did you tell her?

456
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,860
I told her about a cold.

457
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,370
She didn't ask me who caught a cold.

458
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,660
Then she took me to buy medicine.

459
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,620
She is such a kind person.

460
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,940
I thought you were sick, so I...

461
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,340
I didn't know your dad...

462
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,450
Anyway,

463
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,450
I'll repay my son's debt.

464
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,940
Thank you.

465
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,840
No need.

466
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,150
I'm leaving.

467
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,710
Come here again.

468
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,870
Chen, I'm hungry.

469
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,980
Can you wait a little longer?

470
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,910
I'm in a meeting.

471
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,870
When I'm done,

472
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,820
I'll take you to eat hamburgers.

473
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,890
Hold on for a while.

474
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,330
Cool!

475
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,820
Mom! Mom!

476
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,660
Mom.

477
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,650
What?

478
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,330
Mom, eat with me.

479
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,630
Chen is too busy.

480
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,020
He's not free.

481
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,740
Me too.

482
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,140
Mom.

483
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,550
I'm so pitiful.

484
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,810
Please accompany me.

485
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,280
Please. Please.

486
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,620
Please.

487
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,730
All right.

488
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,220
Let's go.

489
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,560
Didn't I tell you

490
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,490
I would be in charge of everything?

491
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,450
I've broken down

492
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,140
all the barriers.

493
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,260
Now you're talking about cooperation with them.

494
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,820
You ruined my plan.

495
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,220
But I think this is the most efficient way

496
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,540
to promote cooperation.

497
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,000
And they didn't reject it.

498
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,160
Please.

499
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,860
There are things you don't understand.

500
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,210
If you don't fix the compensation,

501
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,250
once you fail

502
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,890
to cooperate with them,

503
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,090
you'll have no way back.

504
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,860
Do you understand?

505
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,650
That's probably because

506
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,110
we see things from different perspectives.

507
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,060
I'm sorry.

508
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,140
I

509
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,830
really want to help you.

510
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,140
Mr. Li,

511
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,610
I want you to understand one thing.

512
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,080
You're not helping me now.

513
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,330
You're serving SC.

514
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,740
I just want to help the company

515
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,970
get the best result.

516
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,820
Okay.

517
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,260
Well,

518
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,700
we have to make plans for the worst result.

519
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,340
What are you going to do?

520
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,360
If they sued us,

521
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,510
there would still be a chance of winning.

522
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,350
But we need

523
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,820
to spend more time proving

524
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,930
that it is their employee

525
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,900
who counterfeited the official seal.

526
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,240
Then we can become

527
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,510
a bona fide third party to make peace.

528
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,260
We need to have more than one string to our bow.

529
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,200
I need all the details

530
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,800
of your contract with Mr. Ma.

531
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,580
Then you need to go back to the company with me.

532
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,030
I'll get the car.

533
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,260
I'm working hard.

534
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,290
I'll wait for you after work.

535
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,660
Things are going smoothly.

536
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,300
I'm going back to the company now.

537
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,340
I'm doing my job.

538
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,800
Don't worry about me.

539
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,070
I'll share my fries with you.

540
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,490
No need. I'm on a diet.

541
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,970
The calories are too high.

542
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,350
You refused

543
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,370
to eat my favorite fries.

544
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,900
I'm in a bad mood. My dad was also

545
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,920
in a bad mood when he got wet that day.

546
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,940
Is your dad

547
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,270
okay?

548
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,180
He's fine. He's just sick.

549
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,820
My teacher said in class

550
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,420
that a cold was a virus.

551
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,470
It'll take seven days to get well,

552
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,200
whether by injection or medication.

553
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,570
It takes time to get well.

554
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,170
It's like being in a bad mood.

555
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,270
Don't blame it on me.

556
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,780
He lied to me first.

557
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,990
He deserves to be misunderstood.

558
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,900
My dad did it

559
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,920
because he likes you so much.

560
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,660
Mom, I don't blame you.

561
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,610
But

562
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,210
it would be nice if you could

563
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,130
smile at him.

564
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,420
It may save

565
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,610
an innocent child.

566
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,990
You are

567
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,940
really good at talking.

568
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,820
Let me tell you a secret.

569
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,200
What is it?

570
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,320
I found that

571
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,070
my dad used my tuition fees

572
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,140
to pay his employees.

573
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,140
I asked him why he did that.

574
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,660
He said besides me,

575
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,100
there were still a few kids in the company.

576
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,300
After this summer vacation,

577
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,810
I can't go to school.

578
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,800
I'll be a wild child from now on.

579
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,150
How about

580
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,340
I live with you?

581
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,170
I...

582
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,100
Let me ask you.

583
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,550
Where is your biological mother?

584
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,270
I don't have mother.

585
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,220
My mother abandoned me long ago.

586
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,060
This...

587
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,180
Nonsense.

588
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,540
Even if they broke up,

589
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,220
why did your mother abandon you?

590
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,210
She left as soon as I was born.

591
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,370
I don't even know

592
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,990
what she looks like.

593
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,450
I think my mom doesn't love me

594
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,860
and dad.

595
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,030
I was raised by my dad,

596
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,820
although

597
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,980
I always wore wrong socks.

598
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,290
Poor boy.

599
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,410
Next time,

600
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,970
I'll buy you a new pair.

601
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,380
On my birthday,

602
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,940
I made a wish to Santa Claus.

603
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,900
I hope I can have a mom who loves my dad

604
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,130
and loves me incidentally.

605
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,860
For example, someone like you.

606
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,870
Why do you want her to love you incidentally?

607
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,940
Because when I grow up,

608
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,340
I'll have a wife.

609
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,260
At that time,

610
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,390
my dad will be alone.

611
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,540
You're smart.

612
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,820
Your smile means you promised me.

613
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,710
I can consider agreeing.

614
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,860
But I won't accept your dad

615
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,220
temporarily.

616
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,900
Yu.

617
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,970
I'm sorry.

618
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,380
How can I let you spend money?

619
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:12,850
Come on.

620
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,900
Thank her for the meal.

621
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,430
Hurry up.

622
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,100
Thank you for the meal, pretty aunt.

623
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,180
Did he trouble you?

624
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,860
Well,

625
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,260
let me ask you.

626
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,930
You didn't show up at our appointment

627
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,180
because you picked him up?

628
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,780
Yes.

629
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,420
But I know

630
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,450
this can't be a reason

631
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,650
for being a no-show.

632
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,700
I still have

633
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,220
to sincerely apologize to you.

634
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,500
I'm sorry.

635
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,880
All right.

636
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,620
Since it's a misunderstanding,

637
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,140
just forget it.

638
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,500
Keep an eye on him.

639
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,180
Don't let him run around.

640
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:46,690
Okay.

641
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,150
I'm leaving.

642
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:48,810
Bye.

643
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,620
You're leaving?

644
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,580
Thank you.

645
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,810
Thank you.

646
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,650
What did you tell her?

647
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,630
She said

648
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,460
she would consider being my mom.

649
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,700
Yu.

650
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,850
You would be eaten by a tiger if you lied.

651
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,540
She's considering being my mom,

652
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,460
not your girlfriend.

653
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,880
You have to work harder.

654
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,130
For example, buy me an ice-cream cone.

655
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,100
You know how to take advantage of me,

656
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,210
right?

657
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,380
Wait a moment.

658
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,580
I'll buy you an ice-cream cone.

659
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,210
Hurray!

660
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,080
Mr. Li.

661
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:55,980
I've already told you

662
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,740
all the details

663
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,600
about the case.

664
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,540
Is there anything else

665
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,070
that needs my cooperation?

666
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,260
Let me see.

667
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,260
This is how to tease out details.

668
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,420
Every minute and every second are important.

669
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,480
Maybe in some part,

670
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,230
we can find more chances to win.

671
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,940
Let's go over

672
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,780
the details of the contract

673
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,410
later.

674
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:19,980
As you know,

675
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,350
this case can't be delayed for long.

676
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,950
We must solve it quickly.

677
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,580
It's already 6:30.

678
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,660
I'm really hungry.

679
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,380
Why don't we eat something first?

680
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,640
We'll continue later.

681
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,960
I'm not hungry.

682
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,740
Let me order some food for you.

683
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,300
No need.

684
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
I've arranged it.

685
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,460
It's time.

686
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,490
I'll go and get it.

687
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,300
Wait a moment.

688
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:04,910
I'm sorry.

689
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,180
I might not be able

690
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,010
to finish the work on time.

691
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,740
You go first. Don't wait for me.

692
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,120
Don't wait for her.

693
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,240
She won't come.

694
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,670
Why are you here?

695
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,740
I...

696
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,140
Yike is working overtime. I'm here to accompany her.

697
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,900
By the way,

698
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,460
I promised to pay you back for the gift.

699
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,100
Take it.

700
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,390
It's not easy to save money, right?

701
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,590
Keep it for yourself.

702
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,580
It's easy.

703
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,260
I just need to draw some pictures

704
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,660
and do some private work.

705
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,730
An artist have to bow to money

706
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,740
because of love.

707
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,530
It's very touching.

708
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,060
It's none of your business.

709
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,150
You like Yike, right?

710
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,780
What do you mean?

711
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,160
Because

712
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,340
I don't want to give up her either.

713
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,120
I'm sorry.

714
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,880
You're just her ex.

715
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,030
I know

716
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,940
you're in a relationship.

717
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,180
That's quick.

718
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,450
But it's useless.

719
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,140
If I'm right,

720
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,780
when your family

721
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
gather together,

722
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,770
your identity

723
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,900
is still her younger brother.

724
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,310
I think it doesn't matter.

725
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,650
No matter who I am,

726
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,010
I want to protect her.

727
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,750
I never think

728
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,170
there's anything wrong.

729
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,830
The passion of young people

730
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,220
is really valuable.

731
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,340
You're like me when I was young.

732
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,180
Yes.

733
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,130
There are some problems between us.

734
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,370
But it doesn't matter.

735
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,960
Just take it as a vacation.

736
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,650
I let her take a break.

737
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,790
As time goes by, she'll know

738
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,100
it's useless to choose love

739
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,360
when there's no money.

740
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,710
What do you mean?

741
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,010
You cannot win.

742
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,020
You've made

743
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,090
every effort.

744
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,620
Although you tried your best,

745
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,880
you only took the right to give her a lift

746
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,120
away from me.

747
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,000
But I am

748
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,110
the one who can really help her.

749
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,100
Are you angry?

750
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,080
Just put up with it

751
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,940
for her sake.

752
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,660
Of course,

753
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,460
you can go to her now.

754
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,860
I think

755
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,220
she'll think you're childish

756
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,500
and jealous.

757
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,370
You'll also hinder her work.

758
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,240
I know Yin Yike very well.

759
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,490
She never

760
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,530
flaunts things

761
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,780
or people

762
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,060
she has no confidence in.

763
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,360
Think about it.

764
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,420
By the way,

765
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,410
she's been working all day.

766
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,090
I think Yike must be hungry.

767
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,840
I'll buy her something to eat.

768
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,940
Lekvar chicken kebabs

769
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,380
and udon.

770
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,240
These are your favorites.

771
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,420
Thank you.

772
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,420
But you don't have to waste your time

773
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,150
going so far.

774
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,770
You thanked me.

775
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,380
It made me feel I was an outsider.

776
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,780
Eat it, or it'll get cold.

777
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,510
You eat it.

778
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,370
Let's start after you finish it.

779
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,060
Am I too serious?

780
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,160
My secretary always says

781
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,630
I'm not friendly enough.

782
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,390
As a lawyer,

783
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,070
it's right to have an aura of respectability.

784
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:09,960
Anyway,

785
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,790
this is the first time

786
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,989
I've worked with you.

787
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,100
It's different from what I thought.

788
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,429
What's the difference?

789
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,790
You're capable and steady.

790
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,460
Although it's a serious matter,

791
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,580
I didn't see you panic.

792
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,540
Just solve the problems when we face them.

793
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,780
There's no other way.

794
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,150
Hurry up.

795
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,040
Otherwise, it'll get cold.

796
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,670
You eat it.

797
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:52,650
Yike.

798
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,199
Try this.

799
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,280
This is the most popular one now.

800
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,090
Yes.

801
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,580
There are some problems between us.

802
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,880
But it doesn't matter.

803
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,140
Just take it as a vacation.

804
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,900
I let her take a break.

805
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,220
As time goes by, she'll know

806
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,260
it's useless to choose love

807
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,440
when there's no money.

808
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,120
Thank you,

809
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,420
driver.

810
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,580
But some things

811
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,410
can only be solved by me.

Hello, Chen Musen.

838
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,550
Is Guangxi back?

839
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,190
Guangxi?

840
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,390
He came back early.

But when he got off work,

842
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,020
he met Mr. Li.

843
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,900
He locked himself in his room

844
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
when he came back.

845
