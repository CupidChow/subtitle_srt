00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,960
By the way,

180
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,840
you can play

181
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,920
as late as you want to.

182
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,450
You don't have to come back.

183
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,980
I need to take this call.

184
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,620
Go. Go.

185
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,580
Hurry up.

186
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,660
Hello, sis?

187
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,460
Why are you calling me now?

188
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,540
Listen.

189
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,060
Don't show off your affection to me.

190
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,940
I got stood up.

191
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,270
Okay, okay.

192
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,740
What? I didn't hear you.

193
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,980
I said

194
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,140
have fun.

195
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,690
Okay, it's fun.

196
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,110
You too.

197
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,310
Love you. Bye.

198
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,220
Hurry up.

199
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,650
The night falls again.

200
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,340
The busy day is finally over.

201
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,120
Go meet the person you want to see.

202
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,690
Remove all your tiredness

203
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,540
and feel

204
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,000
your temperature of love.

205
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,650
You have to hug your lover every day.

206
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,850
You have to be hugged by your lover

207
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,450
every day.

208
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,710
After all, long-term separation

209
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,930
is against the intention of love.

210
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,110
People have short hands.

211
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,200
Only over one meter.

212
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,110
You can't hug someone far away.

213
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,590
Time to eat.

214
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,590
Time to eat.

215
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:16,910
Coming.

216
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,860
Stop playing.

217
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,510
Right away.

218
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:27,910
Hurry up.

219
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,070
Coming.

220
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,710
Look.

221
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,920
Why are you playing golf club

222
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,450
since it's time for dinner?

223
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,150
Let's eat.

224
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,790
Let's eat.

225
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,890
Here, the bowl.

226
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,270
Braised pork.

227
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,760
The golf club

228
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,100
Zelin gave to me

229
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,270
looks expensive.

230
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,190
That's the symbol of identity.

231
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,550
Zelin told me

232
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,350
he just became a partner of the law firm.

233
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,020
That means he's a boss.

234
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,640
If he marries Ke this year,

235
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,490
that will be double happiness.

236
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:01,970
Really?

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,660
My sister is getting married this year?

238
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,250
Does that mean

239
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,450
I can have my own room?

240
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,920
You don't have a room now?

241
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,070
Dad.

242
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,310
Is the attic with a tiger skylight

243
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,000
also a room?

244
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,400
Of course.

245
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,980
Just stay there.

246
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,310
Even if your sister is married,

247
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,720
the room needs to be saved for her.

248
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,080
She has to come back to her parents' house.

249
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,870
-Dad. -Look at you, father and son.

250
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,410
always talking about house.

251
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,290
In my opinion,

252
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,920
Zelin needs to work in Beijing

253
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
for so many years.

254
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,200
If Yike marries him,

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,480
he needs to travel between Beijing and Shanghai.

256
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
How tiring.

257
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,040
It's simple for Yike

258
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,280
to ask Zelin to come back to Shanghai.

259
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,920
Little thing,

260
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,150
why are you here?

261
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,960
You haven't had dinner, have you?

262
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,070
Here.

263
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,540
There's a sausage.

264
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,200
Dad is going to

265
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,370
be an exclusive car driver for you

266
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,900
and urge you to get married.

267
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,390
Dad,

268
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,510
don't pick me up.

269
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,780
I still don't know when I can finish.

270
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,750
We are eating Japanese food of Michelin.

271
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,260
The dishes are served one by one.

272
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,140
So particular.

273
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,330
I ate very well.

274
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,600
There's caviar，

275
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,220
king crab,

276
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,980
and my favorite hot spring egg.

277
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:14,950
Hello?

278
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,000
Hello?

279
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,240
I...

280
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Should I say I didn't hear anything?

281
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,410
I'm sorry.

282
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,210
Can I

283
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,190
lend your phone?

284
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,960
Here you are.

285
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:43,830
Thank you.

286
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,180
Dad.

287
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,790
My phone is dead.

288
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,080
I'm calling you with the waiter's phone.

289
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,260
Dad, don't pick me up.

290
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,550
Yes.

291
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,530
I'll definitely come back today.

292
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,390
♫The sky is sapphire♫

293
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,990
♫The streets are golden♫

294

♫My heart for you♫

304
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,880
The last bottle of iced coke.

305
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,410
Here.

306
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,790
Well,

307
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,290
I'll return the favor.

308
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,730
Well, this is for you.

309
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,460
This is my company's sample.

310
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,690
Most suitable

311
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,370
at your age.

312
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,070
Is this a promotion?

313
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,810
I didn't mean that.

314
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,770
It's just

315
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,830
occupational habit.

316
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,080
Occupational habit?

317
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,000
You...

318
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,810
What's your name?

319
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,920
I think

320
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,210
you look like someone.

321
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,040
What era is it now?

322
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,520
You hit on me in this way?

323
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,630
Shanghai is so big.

324
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,350
We might not

325
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,550
see each other again.

326
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,330
You don't need to know my name.

327
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,350
You're right.

328
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,510
I'll disturb you

329
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,610
when we meet again.

330
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,970
Thank you for today.

331
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,220
♫Your eyes♫

332
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,980

♫You'll realize♫

♫It's a portrait of you♫

342
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,420
Baby, I'm home.

343
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,070
I miss you so much.

344
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,840
You're back.

345
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,060
Guang... Guangxi.

346
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,200
You're back.

347
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,860
Good brother.

348
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,600
Give me a hug.

349
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,050
Let me see.

350
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,400
You've become stronger.

351
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,260
The foreign boss treats you well.

352
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,380
Baby,

353
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,670
let me introduce

354
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,950
my junior in college.

355
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,990
-Best friend, Xu Guangxi. -Hello, handsome.

356
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,720
Handsome.

357
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,770
Just a little bit not as good as me.

358
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,200
In school,

359
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,190
under my guidance,

360
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,560
he got Oscar.

361
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,190
So amazing.

362
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,950
It's not the real Oscar.

363
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,890
Student Oscar.

364
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,710
Student Oscar

365
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,910
is also Oscar, right?

366
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,620
Someone bought his works

367
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,180
at a high price them.

368
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,260
With my hard work,

369
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,240
he was back for my company.

370
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,990
You haven't succeeded yet, okay?

371
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,290
As my junior,

372
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,830
can you give me some faces?

373
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,040
Enough.

374
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,330
By the way, your mom came in the afternoon.

375
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,500
It's full in the refrigerator.

376
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,950
I'm afraid it's enough for a year.

377
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,800
Let me ask you.

378
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,530
Baby.

379
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,430
Does this handsome guy

380
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,310
have a girlfriend?

381
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,070
No.

382
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,300
I have a bestie.

383
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,000
Let me introduce her to him.

384
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,020
I'm back.

385
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,800
What did you have for dinner?

386
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,200
You finished it so early.

387
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,710
Don't you want to say happy birthday to me?

388
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,960
Did you drink?

389
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,730
Zelin didn't come.

390
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,000
Who did you drink with?

391
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,150
He just called

392
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,490
to tell you

393
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,030
not to lose your temper.

394
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,910
Why did you turn off your phone?

395
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,280
Zelin

396
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,270
couldn't reach you.

397
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,190
He called me

398
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,280
and kept apologizing.

399
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,870
The gifts

400
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,510
were sent to our home as well.

401
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,410
His parents made a last-minute decision.

402
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,260
He had no choice.

403
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,600
You should understand each other.

404
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,330
Why did you turn off your phone?

405
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,480
Why are you angry?

406
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,150
Dad, my phone is dead.

407
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,310
I thought you've...

408
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,490
started eating, so I...

409
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,880
Yes, I got the call.

410
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,090
Can we eat well?

411
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,700
Besides, he's not here.

412
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,830
Why didn't you come home and eat

413
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,410
and we can celebrate

414
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,210
your birthday together?

415
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,540
Whom did you drink with?

416
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,620
Can you stop talking?

417
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,670
Ke just meets Zelin

418
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,040
a few times a year.

419
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,030
Today is her birthday, and she waited for nothing.

420
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,310
Anyone would be angry.

421
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,180
Why can't you

422
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:54,760
share the feelings with our daughter?

423
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,670
I just feel sorry for her.

424
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,880
I say this

425
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,970
for their own good.

426
00:24:59,280 --> 00:24:59,900
It's not easy

427
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,070
to have such a good son-in-law.

428
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,550
What...

429
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,140
Why are you angry?

430
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,130
Come on.

431
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,800
Let's go.

432
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,160
Take a shower.

433
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,260
Charge your phone.

434
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:08,750
Call Zelin

435
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,170
and explain it to him.

436
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,480
Say hello to her parents.

437
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,960
I know.

438
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,010
Sister,

439
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,560
Zelin knew he could not come back

440
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,150
and felt sorry.

441
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,790
So he sent the love

442
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,840
to our home.

443
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,750
Also,

444
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,360
doesn't he know

445
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,610
you are allergic to pollen?

446
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,760
I'll deal with it.

447
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,430
Happy birthday.

448
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:04,750
Yike.

449
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,010
Are you angry?

450
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,450
It's my fault.

451
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,440
I'll be back in a few days.

452
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,080
Sorry.

453
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,560
Happy birthday.

454
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,750
Please open your fridge.

455
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,870
You will thank me.

456
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,540
Yin Yike.

457
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,620
Happy birthday to you and wish you a big fortune.

458
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,250
Yin Yike.

459
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,400
Happy birthday.

460
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,440
Hello, what's wrong?

461
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,000
Yike, bad news.

462
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,670
Our spokesperson is pregnant.

463
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,350
Pregnant?

464
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,660
Isn't it a good thing?

465
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,960
Congratulations to her.

466
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,120
Rumor has it that

467
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,630
it's not her husband's child.

468
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,260
What?

469
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,910
Mr. Zheng asked us to withdraw

470
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,390
all advertisements with

471
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,460
the image of the spokesperson.

472
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:29,970
No way.

473
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,750
It's been revised for 89 times before release.

474
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,550
It's no use even if it's 890 times.

475
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,160
Shiyi.

476
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,810
Go to contact the media department

477
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,850
and ask them to change

478
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,230
the pictures on all the social networking sites and the official website.

479
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:37,590
Okay.

480
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,730
I'll kneel down to them

481
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,980
and ask them to work overtime.

482
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,020
Anything else?

483
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,590
Yes.

484
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,230
The posters of direct-sale stores

485
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,290
all have problems.

486
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,710
What about the lipstick?

487
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,190
And?

488
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,870
Hongqiao Store and Pudong Store.

489
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,280
They also need backup posters.

490
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,830
Chacha.

491
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,260
Do you have any spare posters?

492
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,670
Send it to Huaihai Road immediately.

493
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,600
I'll change the poster

494
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,310
at No. 1 Store first.

495
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,030
Yes, there is a backup in my computer.

496
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,710
There are some samples in the company's warehouse.

497
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,320
I'll go to the company

498
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,720
and get the poster first.

499
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,570
See you later.

500
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,940
How did you drive?

501
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,910
It's scratched like this.

502
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,230
-I'm sorry. Sorry. -No. You.

503
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,140
I'm in an emergency.

504
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,150
This is my business card.

505
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,490
Call me when you get off work.

506
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,250
I'm sorry.

507
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,200
Why am I so unlucky?

508
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,360
What's wrong?

509
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,800
That girl.

510
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,000
Why are superwomen

511
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,050
so arrogant now?

512
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,130
She just gave me her business card.

513
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,830
[Yin Yike]

514
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,920
Yin Yike.

515
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,950
Who cares who she is.

516
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,200
She can't hit my car.

517
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,210
Is this company

518
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,750
in the same building as yours?

519
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,630
Of course.

520
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,660
We're a Class A office building.

521
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,830
There are many beauties

522
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
in this building.

523
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,720
Forget about that beauty just now.

524
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
She's too fierce.

525
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,170
She will be not easy to handle.

526
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,820
But there are

00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,950
Because from today on,

703
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,700
I hope our story

704
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,470
has a new beginning.

705
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,430
Baby,

706
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,820
this is a gift for you.

707
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,560
Why are you giving me a scarf

708
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,160
in summer?

709
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,990
Are you still playing this trick?

710
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,710
I saw this wool trick

711
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,830
in elementary school.

712
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,550
Marry him!

713
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,650
Marry him!

714
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,630
Marry him!

715
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,470
This is so embarrassing.

716
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,640
Baby,

717
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,460
will you marry me?

718
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,230
We've only known each other for a few months.

719
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,490
You want to get married

720
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,830
after just a few months?

721
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Do you have money?

722
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,060
Who gives a scarf

723
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,350
in summer for proposing?

724
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,000
Who will support who in the future?

725
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,610
Baby,

726
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,130
although I don't have money now,

727
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,790
I'll work hard to support you.

728
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,210
Who wants to wait for the future of you?

729
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,050
Are you crazy? It’s so awkward.

730
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,050
Miaomiao.

731
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,790
It's okay.

732
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,590
It's okay.

733
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,490
Dad.

734
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,470
I was abandoned again.

735
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,170
Come, give me a hug.

736
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,650
So poor.

737
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,230
When do you think I can

738
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,990
tell him about the car scratch?

739
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,030
What's wrong with getting married?

740
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,990
Let's see how he is

741
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,550
after a while.

742
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,870
Until the end of life,

743
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,240
until the sea withers and rocks rot,

744
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,670
and until the end of the world.

745
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,000
Yes.

746
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,350
Yes.

747
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,590
Until the calming period is over.

748
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,250
Listen to me.

749
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,650
It's the advice from my experience.

750
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,940
Marriage is not good.

751
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,550
What's the point of

752
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,430
getting married and divorced and over and over?

753
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,830
Half of the property is gone every time.

754
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,710
Calm down.

755
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,270
Yes.

756
00:37:59,310 --> 00:37:59,920
Yes.

757
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,640
Marriage?

758
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,070
I don't need to calm down.

759
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,020
They don't cherish me.

760
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,120
They don't love me and like me enough.

761
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,380
Isn't it because I don't have money?

762
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,840
If others earn one million,

763
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,910
and spend 10,000 for them,

764
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,780
it equals to that I earn 100

765
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,710
and spend 100 for them.

766
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,680
Is that the same?

767
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,130
It's different.

768
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,910
It's different.

769
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,350
Come on, cheers.

770
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,040
Cheers!

771
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,990
Cheers.

772
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,060
Let's talk to him another day.

773
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,790
We're leaving.

774
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,340
-I will send you home. -Okay.

775
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,380
Stop right there!

776
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,110
Xu Guangxi.

777
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,200
Your brother just broke up.

778
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,310
Are you going to abandon me

779
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,030
at this moment?

780
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,430
Are you still my brother?

781
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,110
I'm telling you now.

782
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,830
Women are all the same.

783
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,830
Both girls and ladies.

784
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,510
Don't be fooled by her.

785
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,620
Brother,

786
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,330
listen to me.

787
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,380
If a woman

788
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,310
starts to covet your money,

789
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:41,840
it means

790
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,490
you have nothing else

791
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,430
to be drawn by her.

792
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,320
Who said that?

793
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,740
I'm better than you.

794
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,980
Where?

795
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,440
I...

796
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,090
OK. OK. OK.

797
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,310
Come on! Come on! Come on!

798
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,470
Go! Go! Go!

799
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,750
Go! Go! Go!

800
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,930
Be careful.

801
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,740
Wait.

802
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,970
The door is over there.

803
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,760
I know.

804
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,380
Let me take a look at the toilet. I can walk.

805
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,670
Why do you look at the toilet?

806
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,720
Watch the door.

807
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,920
Are you okay?

808
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,600
Let me see.

809
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,860
The glass is fine.

810
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,830
The quality is great.

811
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,090
The door is over there.

812
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:48,670
Where?

813
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:49,910
Let's go.

814
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,430
