[Episode 18]

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,930
They say that

17
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,660
everyone is born

18
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,780
incomplete,

19
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,190
split into two by God.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,810
So we are so lonely,

21
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,450
unceasingly

22
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,580
pursuing

23
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,110
the lost part of ourselves.

24
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,889
In this pursuit,

25
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,100
love

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,380
comes along.

27
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,430
It's the slight stickiness

28
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,780
in the hand of lovers

29
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,450
in summer night breeze.

30
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,020
It's like you've come back

31
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,300
to the complete self

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,960
before being split by God.

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,220
Maybe it's the loneliness after hallucination,

34
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,860
or a heavy cold after a storm.

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,020
You become

36
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,829
the incomplete half again.

37
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,620
Love is a pursuit,

38
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
and an adventure.

39
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,130
We all know that

40
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,380
love may turn into sorrow.

41
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,890
It may disappear

42
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,300
in the blink of an eye.

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,960
But, whatever.

It's your dad's birthday in two days.

Don't work overtime that day.

Come back early.

57
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,050
Okay. I've asked Guangxi

58
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,360
to come and celebrate dad's birthday too.

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,210
Don't worry.

Morning, Mom.

62
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Don't call me mom.

Chen.

64
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,780
Why don't you talk to Mom?

65
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,270
Don't call her that. She's not Mom.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,620
Mom looks pale.

67
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,270
Chen,

68
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,020
can't you make more efforts?

69
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,220
They are all taller than you.

70
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,460
But they may not be as mature as you.

71
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,200
Understand?

72
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,620
They are all babies.

73
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,390
Isn't this a female?

74
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,240
Guys, come on.

75
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,600
Gather around.

76
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,610
I have a small announcement.

77
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,340
Here's the thing.

78
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,300
First, I apologize.

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,370
I'm really sorry

80
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,470
for keeping it from you for so long.

81
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,100
Second,

82
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,040
This is my son. Say hello.

83
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,620
Hello, I'm Chen Yu.

84
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,900
You can call me Yu.

85
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,750
What?

86
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,140
Dad,

87
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,180
this is breaking news!

88
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:48,610
Dad.

89
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,430
Hello, Mom.

90
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,350
You hid a child from us.

91
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,760
And he's already this old.

92
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,820
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

93
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,230
Hello, Godfather No.2.

94
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,060
Good morning.

95
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,250
Godfather No.2?

96
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,700
I just found out yesterday.

97
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,130
I've become Godfather No.2 all of a sudden.

98
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,100
All of a sudden?

99
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,960
Why didn't you tell us?

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,910
Godfather No.1,

101
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,620
when will you treat me to perm my hair?

102
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,360
Godfather No.1?

103
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,620
Well, Yu,

104
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,660
let's talk about it after I survive today.

105
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,450
You are even taking him to perm his hair?

106
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,500
Two dads?

107
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,510
Chen Musen.

108
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,960
Tell me the truth.

109
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,660
What happened?

110
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,460
We didn't know.

111
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,260
We were all kept in the dark.

112
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,900
That's right.

113
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,430
Are we

114
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,100
in the same company or not?

115
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,530
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

116
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,420
At first,

117
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,060
I didn't think it's a big deal.

118
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,760
I didn't think it's necessary to tell you.

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,659
Dad likes Qin Yiran.

120
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,210
Especially you, Guangxi.

121
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,050
Your sister and Qin Yiran

122
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,980
are besties.

123
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,740
I'm afraid if I told you, you would have slipped it out.

124
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,470
It would ruin Dad's happiness.

125
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,570
Right, Yu?

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,040
I think

127
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,640
Dad's happiness

128
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,350
was hindered by

129
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,650
the Godfather No.1 who helped you hide.

130
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,270
I...

131
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,980
Alright.

132
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,030
Let's move on.

133
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,730
Come on, Yu.

134
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,659
Come here.

135
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,780
We didn't know.

136
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,500
I'd like to officially discuss this

137
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,220
with you.

138
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,710
Mars Animation

139
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,940
has a tight schedule.

140
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,630
I have to stay here

141
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,780
and go through this with you.

142
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,310
It's summer vacation now.

143
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,460
He has nowhere to go.

144
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,430
So I thought

145
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,660
I could bring him here

146
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,900
and work with us.

147
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,990
I promise

148
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,180
he will be good.

149
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,740
He won't mess with your creation.

150
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,410
OK?

151
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,290
No problem.

152
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,210
Me too, Dad.

153
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,140
Of course.

154
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,050
No problem.

155
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,090
Yu.

156
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,780
Thank you.

157
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,930
In this summer vacation,

158
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,510
I'll be your little boss.

159
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,780
I'll supervise you

160
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,220
coming to work every day.

161
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,180
Little yet naughty.

162
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,750
He's already domineering.

163
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,380
It only represents his personal opinion.

164
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,909
It has nothing to do with me.

165
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,500
Hello, Yu.

166
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,850
Get up.

167
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,320
Chen, don't worry.

168
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,940
I'll set an example

169
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,640
and lead my brothers to overcome the difficulties.

170
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,880
Yu, you're really...

171
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,290
You're really great.

172
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,850
Now I'm going to supervise you.

173
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,700
Time to work.

174
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,660
Let's go, little boss.

175
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,700
Come play with me.

176
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,900
Your hair looks cool.

177
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,130
Where did you perm it?

178
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,260
Here. Come to uncle.

179
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,500
Women who have been moisturized by love

180
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,740
are indeed different.

181
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,070
Don't shush me. It's written on your face.

182
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,940
By the way, you and Dad Chen...

183
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,070
Are you really over?

184
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,409
Stop it.

185
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,580
I won't talk to you again if you keep mentioning this.

186
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,460
Seriously?

187
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,299
Yes.

188
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,380
Dad Chen. Dad Chen.

189
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,470
Yin Yike.

190
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,620
You've really

191
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,010
turned evil now.

192
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,350
I really think he's not bad.

193
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,740
-Impossible. -Yike.

194
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,510
-Don't mention him. -Yike.

195
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,380
I'm here to for gossip.

196
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:54,940
I'm here to for gossip.

197
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,620
Who is that kid

198
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,420
the other day?

199
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,950
What kid?

200
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,510
The kid that day.

201
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,710
It's the adults' business.

202
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,950
Don't ask about.

203
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,830
Did I say something wrong?

204
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,640
I told you, it's the adults' business.

205
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,880
Don't ask around.

206
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,950
Why were you looking for me?

207
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,540
I remember it.

208
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,110
I need to inform

209
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,500
you of something.

210
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,420
You're already

211
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,020
reserved as my husband's sister.

212
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,690
We'll be a family in the future.

213
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,570
What are you talking about, reserved?

214
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,060
What do you mean by "reserved as my husband's sister"?

215
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,100
It means

216
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,540
I'm still enjoying

217
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,860
the joy of flirting.

218
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,620
From now on,

219
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,260
you can date Guangxi freely.

220
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,420
Keep it down.

221
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,570
We're still in the company.

222
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,120
Don't cotton up with me.

223
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,660
Yes, madam.

224
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,590
I think

225
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,610
the packaging color

226
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,740
should be brighter.

227
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,900
Yes.

228
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,460
The bright color is more eye-catching.

229
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,260
It can also stimulate

230
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,580
the consumers' desire to buy it.

231
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,210
Okay.

232
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,080
Yike,

233
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,140
I'll contact the Design Department

234
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,330
and ask them to adjust it.

235
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:08,840
Okay.

236
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,160
Yike.

237
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,090
What about that?

238
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,270
I think this one

239
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,820
suits the summer temperament.

240
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,640
We can prepare some slogans

241
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,710
for this.

242
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,380
Sure.

243
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,150
I want to buy more clothes

244
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,860
to match this color.

245
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,500
You just want to buy clothes, right?

246
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,340
Go get ready.

247
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,020
Okay.

248
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,530
Yike.

249
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,900
Frank asked the manager-level staff of Marketing Department

250
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,420
to attend the meeting.

251
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,500
Didn't I report to him

252
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,560
about the collaboration yesterday?

253
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,860
Why is there another meeting?

254
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,420
I don't know.

255
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,680
But on my way here,

256
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,810
I ran into Ms. Zheng.

257
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,650
She didn't look well.

258
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,000
Be careful.

259
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,990
Okay, I got it.

260
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,840
I'll go take a look.

261
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,100
I gathered you here today

262
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,730
because something big happened

263
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,390
in the Marketing Department.

264
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,010
Flower World made a statement

265
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,700
that they have never collaborated with

266
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,580
or authorized

267
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,900
any co-branded products

268
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,700
to SC.

269
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,220
The lawyer's letter

270
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,860
has been sent to the Legal Department,

271
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,770
asking us for compensation.

272
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,490
Frank,

273
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,580
we have a clear authorization

274
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,540
and publicity agreement

275
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,610
with Flower World.

276
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,580
Is there

277
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,980
some misunderstanding?

278
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,100
Can you give me some time?

279
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,140
I'll report to you after I figure it out.

280
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,700
Okay.

281
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,830
Try to minimize it.

282
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,980
And make it quick.

283
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,310
You scared me.

284
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,870
Let's go.

285
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,200
They are waiting for us.

286
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,510
This is the cake

287
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,110
I ordered for Uncle.

288
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,340
It's said to be from an Internet celebrity shop.

289
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,190
This is the massage device

290
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,460
I bought for you.

291
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,110
It can protect the neck.

292
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,430
What do you think?

293
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,450
Are you troubled by something again?

294
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,970
Nothing.

295
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,660
I don't know why

296
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,560
I've been receiving lots of legal letters lately.

297
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,850
My company

298
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,620
had a co-branded product with a gaming company before,

299
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,020
right?

300
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,180
Now the product is going online,

301
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,380
but the gaming company suddenly said

302
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,890
they never authorized us to do it.

303
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,550
This afternoon,

304
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,810
I checked and found out

305
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,070
the contact person

306
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,350
has already resigned.

307
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,140
Why should something like this

308
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,930
happen to me?

309
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,370
But it's not entirely your fault.

310
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,690
The Legal Department

311
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,510
should take some responsibilities

312
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,770
for going through the process.

313
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,630
Did your boss give you a hard time?

314
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,020
He's fine.

315
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,660
The company's lawyer will coordinate this

316
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,180
for such a big matter.

317
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,140
It's just the live streaming plan

318
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,500
I made for this case

319
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,180
is in vain.

320
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,610
I planned to

321
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,340
tell my dad about us

322
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,080
after this.

323
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,090
You don't have to consider my feelings.

324
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,620
But you have to go through some more hard time.

325
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,520
Why is that?

326
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,820
Well,

327
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,230
someone slept until 4 a.m,

328
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,220
got up and got dressed,

329
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,070
and went home secretly.

330
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,060
Xu Guangxi, are you

331
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,430
getting bolder?

332
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,980
What are you talking about?

333
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,380
100 points.

334
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,180
What do you mean by 100 points?

335
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,260
Your smile was 100 points.

336
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,970
Take the cake.

337
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,780
Yin,

338
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,550
your house is old.

339
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,300
If it's demolished,

340
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,100
you'll be rich.

341
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Of course.

342
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,520
This house won't be demolished.

343
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,630
Not necessarily.

344
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,420
Let me tell you.

345
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,340
The district is different.

346
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm telling you, it won't be demolished.

347
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,880
No.

348
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,740
About that,

349
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,250
the house can't afford to be demolished.

350
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,310
It's a protective historical building.

351
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,410
Yes.

352
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,540
Do you remember

353
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,900
when we first moved in?

354
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,800
Why are so many people here today?

355
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,340
Jumping up and down.

356
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,620
My dad is very prideful.

357
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,250
He hasn't contacted with these uncles

358
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,500
in a long time.

359
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,450
That one

360
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,090
has a house bigger than his.

361
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,620
The two sons of that one

362
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,820
went to Tsinghua or Peking University.

363
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,640
They invited them all here today.

364
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,870
Let's take a look first.

365
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,120
Let's go.

366
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,000
Dad.

367
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,730
Hello, uncle.

368
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,230
My daughter is back.

369
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,090
Ke.

370
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,860
Isn't she pretty?

371
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,740
Hello, uncle.

372
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,340
Your daughter?

373
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,660
Yes.

374
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,420
She's got prettier.

375
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,380
Of course.

376
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,140
Girls turn prettier as they grow up.

377
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,200
This is also my son.

378
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,170
He just came back from abroad.

379
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,350
He's a director.

380
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,240
Hello, uncles.

381
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,540
Jin Lan's son.

382
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,500
Dad.

383
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,620
This is a gift for you

384
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,750
from Guangxi and me.

385
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,390
Okay.

386
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,500
Uncle, this is a cake.

387
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,100
Yes, he queued up

388
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,710
for a long time to get this.

389
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,310
This kid is so filial.

390
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,200
Both of them are filial.

391
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,640
Yin,

392
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,180
you penny pincher

393
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,150
are finally

394
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,600
treating us to dinner.

395
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,580
Guys,

396
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,700
I think

397
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,980
Yin must have

398
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,980
something important

399
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,020
to show off to us.

400
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,840
Otherwise,

401
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,710
he wouldn't have made such a big gesture.

402
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,780
It's a big deal.

403
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,420
What's there to show off?

404
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,970
Nothing to show off.

405
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,300
Open the door.

406
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,140
Hurry up.

407
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,420
-Who is it? -I knew. It's Yin's birthday.

408
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,570
Many people

409
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,460
must come here.

410
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,060
Brother-in-law.

411
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,720
Yibo.

412
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,760
Well, Zelin.

413
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,050
-Why are you here? -You've grown taller.

414
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,670
Uncle.

415
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,980
The flight was late.

416
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,120
Sorry to keep you waiting.

417
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,900
No hurry.

418
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,580
Let me introduce.

419
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,660
Li Zelin.

420
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,180
He's a partner of

421
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,910
Chengtian Law Firm,

422
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,000
and my son-in-law.

423
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,380
Uncle.

424
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,700
Happy birthday.

425
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,980
This is a gift for you.

426
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,540
There's a watch

427
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,750
and some supplements,

428
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,070
Cordyceps and bird's nest.

429
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,580
I bought them in a hurry. Please don't mind.

430
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,060
As long as it's from you,

431
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,140
I don't mind.

432
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,180
Yin, you're so arrogant.

433
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,320
Ke.

434
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,220
Zelin is very attentive.

435
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,660
He specially flew here

436
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,700
to celebrate my birthday.

437
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,830
I couldn't stop him.

438
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,780
I know

439
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,200
it's not because of me.

440
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,550
It's because of you.

441
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,740
Where can you find such a good boyfriend?

442
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,610
Sit down.

443
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,060
Dad.

444
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,110
Happy birthday.

445
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,280
He's great, right?

446
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,980
Not bad.

447
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,140
Not bad.

448
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:17,730
Yin,

449
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,330
so this is the great lawyer

450
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,490
you mentioned to us.

451
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,650
Now he's a partner

452
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,520
and a boss.

453
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,540
Hello, uncle.

454
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,660
Good.

455
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,460
Look.

456
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,970
He's so approachable

457
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,220
and handsome.

458
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,490
Yin,

459
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,550
we used to...

460
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,500
Long time no see.

461
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,580
How have you been?

462
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,880
It seems to be true now.

463
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,740
Of course it's true.

464
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,400
How could you brag about this?

465
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,890
Don't just talk.

466
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,700
When are you going to invite us to the wedding?

467
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,100
Right.

468
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,860
This year.

469
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,400
I'll definitely invite you to the wedding

470
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,000
this year.

471
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,460
Good.

472
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,860
I'll give you a big red packet.

473
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
I've said it.

474
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,620
One big packet from each of you.

475
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,530
You must give it.

476
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,380
I will.

477
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,580
Yin,

478
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,740
time to eat.

479
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,540
Yes.

480
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:53,860
Let's eat.

481
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,690
Let's eat.

482
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,900
Let's go for a drink.

483
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,120
Come on, let's eat.

484
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,060
Let's go.

485
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,860
Come, sit down.

486
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,650
Have a seat.

487
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,060
Come, sit inside.

488
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,470
Well, Yike.

489
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,660
That day,

490
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,609
I was attending

491
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,140
a blind date party with my friends,

492
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,780
and I got a call from Uncle.

493
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,380
I was happy and

494
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,770
I thought you regretted it.

495
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,609
So I agreed.

496
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,660
I'm really sorry

497
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,060
for what happened today.

498
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,400
My dad made the decision on his own.

499
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,650
Don't get me wrong.

500
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,460
Thank you for covering it up for me.

501
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,420
I'll explain this

502
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,700
to my father later.

503
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,220
You're welcome.

504
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,420
I'm also here

505
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,660
for business.

506
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,550
I just came by to celebrate

507
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,760
Uncle's birthday.

508
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,460
Mr. Li,

509
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,620
thank you for your concern.

510
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,770
I'll pay you back later.

511
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,190
It's nothing expensive.

512
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,120
There's no need.

513
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,620
Of course I need to.

514
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,850
To drive away mosquitoes and flies.

515
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,720
Your car is here.

516
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,180
I'll get going then.

517
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,630
Guangxi.

518
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,020
I didn't know he'd come today.

519
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,940
I wasn't full.

520
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,020
Buy me dinner.

521
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,030
Let's go.

522
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,340
Let's tell Dad.

523
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,650
Guangxi.

524
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,620
I know you've always been

525
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,680
looking out for me.

526
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
But I don't want you to feel wronged.

527
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,180
You know my dad.

528
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,620
He's just

529
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,290
very prideful.

530
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,460
Yike.

531
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,980
I didn't feel wronged.

532
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,480
I think your happiness

533
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,000
is the most important.

534
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,140
There are some things

535
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,490
we don't need to rush.

536
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,390
We still have a lot of time.

537
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,910
Just like now.

538
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,160
I can peel shrimps for you.

539
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,660
I can also feed you shrimp.

540
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,940
Let's

541
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,270
go out to eat more often.

542
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,690
I don't want to come home for dinner all the time.

543
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,500
I have to hear dad nagging again.

544
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,020
Let me tell you a secret.

545
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,230
Our company

546
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,430
just developed

547
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,320
a very powerful weapon recently.

548
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,140
What weapon?

549
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,090
Its name is

550
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,640
"going in one ear and out from the other".

551
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,680
Why didn't you introduce

552
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,100
such a good thing to me earlier?

553
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,230
I'll take it out to show you

554
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,560
in the next assessment.

555
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,780
Guangxi.

556
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,230
You've given me

557
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,700
everything you can.

558
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,160
What? Is it not enough?

559
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,760
I'll scan the QR code for you.

560
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,820
Save some money.

561
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,230
Who said he would

562
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,540
return the money of the watch Zelin got for my father

563
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,230
to him?

564
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,860
Yes, I was going to return it.

565
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,450
What's wrong?

566
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,110
That watch is very expensive.

567
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,380
Do you think your boyfriend

568
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,200
gets paid very little

569
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,260
to draw for others?

570
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,140
Are you jealous?

571
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,570
No.

572
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,830
I prefer having lemon.

573
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,660
You really let me have it. Oh my god.

574
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,430
I...

575
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,150
Sour.

576
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,980
Come on.

577
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,300
Annie,

578
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,020
send the files of that case

579
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,900
to my phone.

580
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,060
Mr. Li.

581
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,140
Are you sure you want to take this case?

582
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,870
It's hard and won't be paid off.

583
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,500
Don't you want to

584
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,130
try to get the big client from the director again?

585
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,250
Do you think

586
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,690
if he really wants to hand him over

587
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,380
to me,

588
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,860
he would be so hesitant?

589
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,650
Yes.

590
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,120
Is it because of Yike?

591
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,470
Don't mind

592
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,930
the rumors in the firm.

593
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,340
What did they say?

594
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,510
Nothing.

595
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,500
I can't even handle what's happening around me.

596
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,010
I can't handle big clients,

597
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:37,570
right?

598
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,540
Mr. Li.

599
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,060
Don't worry about it.

600
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,140
Don't worry.

601
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,140
I will get everything

602
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,600
back to my plan.

603
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,980
For me,

604
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,050
there won't be any accident.

605
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,980
Come and have a look.

606
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,920
The shoes are from my daughter

607
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,740
and the clothes are from my son-in-law.

608
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,340
Look.

609
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,150
It happens to be a match.

610
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,500
They are so consistent with each other

611
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,960
even when they buy things.

612
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,540
Look at this watch.

613
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,200
I'm telling you, it cost a lot.

614
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,500
Very powerful.

615
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,930
Yin,

616
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,090
do you really want Yike

617
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,610
to marry Zelin?

618
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,540
Yes.

619
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,430
Ke is not young anymore.

620
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,140
It's not easy

621
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,540
to find such a boyfriend.

622
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,250
So...

623
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,700
she must marry him.

624
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,180
But I think Zelin

625
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,460
might not come back

626
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,580
from Beijing due to his work.

627
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,360
Are you willing to let Yike marry and move so far away?

628
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,740
Zelin told me today

629
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,340
that he'll move his law firm

630
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,140
to Shanghai.

631
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,230
Even if he can't move,

632
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,940
they have to get married this year.

633
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,260
I've already bragged about it

634
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,660
in front of my friends that

635
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,580
we'll invite them to the wedding this year.

636
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,300
Well...

637
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,420
If they don't get married,

638
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,260
how embarrassing

639
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,940
it will be.

640
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,870
If...

641
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,290
What if...

642
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,340
Ke doesn't want to

643
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,350
marry Zelin?

644
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,840
There's no such possibility.

645
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,720
Look how happy Ke was

646
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,210
that Zelin was here today.

647
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,310
Impossible.

648
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,620
Where are you going at this hour?

649
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,710
Well,

650
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,630
the community is having a rehearsal

651
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,500
for the civilization activity.

652
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,460
I'll go.

653
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,670
Tell our daughter

654
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,730
to stop delaying.

655
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,780
Okay.

656
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,420
Mom.

657
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,420
Why are you here?

658
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,300
Do you want some water?

659
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,430
You've really grown up.

660
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,410
Guangxi.

661
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,320
Can you tell me?

662
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,680
Do you really

663
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,960
have a girlfriend?

664
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,260
Mom,

665
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,730
I do have someone I love now.

666
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,180
But

667
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,920
this is not a good time

668
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
to tell everyone.

669
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,780
Please give me some time.

670
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,910
I just hope that you two

671
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,210
can be faithful

672
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,930
to each other.

673
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,890
Don't hurt girls.

674
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,820
Don't be like your dad.

675
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,260
Mom.

676
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,680
I know what you're worried about.

677
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,980
Although you never talked about

678
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,210
how much you suffered back then,

679
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,370
I know

680
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,310
that

681
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,840
his irresponsible attitude

682
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,700
hurt you badly.

683
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,290
Don't worry.

684
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,120
In terms of relationship,

685
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,030
I won't be like him.

686
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,820
I will be very serious

687
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,250
to that girl.

688
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,300
My mom seems to know about

689
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,360
our relationship.

690
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,340
Guangxi. Honey.

691
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,100
Mr. Xie suddenly called me

692
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
and said the deadline was advanced.

693
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
I have no choice.

694
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,340
I've informed everyone

695
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,070
to come back and work overtime.

696
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,630
You should come back soon.

697
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,290
It can't be done without you.

698
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,820
Okay, I got it.

699
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,510
How did it go?

700
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,770
Chen Musen.

701
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,030
Are you asleep?

702
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,230
How long will it take for you to render it?

703
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,830
The progress bar says

704
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,790
it will take more than three hours.

705
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,510
Okay.

706
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,700
Is the biography

707
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,420
on your computer too?

708
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,340
Let me see it.

709
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,860
Babes,

710
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,880
this is the final darkness

711
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,170
before dawn.

712
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,060
Tomorrow is

713
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,270
the deadline.

714
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,620
Although we have to submit it in advance,

715
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,940
it's the best time

716
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,090
to test our ability.

717
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,640
Now we need to

718
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,740
march to the final victory.

719
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,860
Work hard!

720
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,380
Fight!

721
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,720
Come on!

722
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,530
Come on!

723
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,250
I'll buy you food and drinks.

724
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,490
Hang in there until I come back.

725
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,330
Don't die.

726
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,020
Bye.

727
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,930
Hello.

728
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,740
I'm the manager of SC Live Stream Department,

729
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,380
Yin Yike.

730
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,780
Hello?

731
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,300
Hello?

732
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,730
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

733
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,300
Please try again later.

734
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,610
Shen Xin.

735
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,480
Can I borrow your phone?

736
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,420
Look at this.

737
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,620
There seems to be something wrong.

738
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,270
Yike.

739
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,900
Thank you.

740
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,560
Hello?

741
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,980
Hello?

742
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,340
About SC 's infringement on Flower World,

743
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,050
I'd like to...

744
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,670
Miss Yin,

745
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,300
we've already sent the lawyer's letter.

746
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,180
Everything will be handled according to the law.

747
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,300
Please do it in a formal way

748
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,860
and stop calling me.

749
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,580
Yike.

750
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,820
Don't be too anxious.

751
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,150
It's okay, Yike.

752
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,060
Ms. Zheng found that person anyway.

753
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,770
Even if the sky falls,

754
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,100
you still have a taller one to support you.

755
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,500
Just because Ms. Zheng found him,

756
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,700
I was also negligent.

757
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,640
If it's not taken care of properly,

758
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,490
Kong Xianzhe definitely

759
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,890
won't let go of Ms. Zheng.

760
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,780
Yike,

761
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,460
I'm also responsible for this.

762
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,340
-Otherwise... -This is not the time to hold people accountable.

763
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,780
They are very tough.

764
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,540
We really need to think of a way.

765
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,980
Besides, there's something wrong

766
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,940
with the co-branded product.

767
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,740
You have to think about

768
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,700
the replacement plan for live streaming.

769
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,780
Don't make it vacant.

770
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,580
Understand?

771
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,300
Yes.

772
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,420
Yike.

773
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,340
Frank wants to see you

774
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,180
in the meeting room.

775
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
It seems that the lawyer

776
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,220
hired by the Legal Department is here.

777
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,750
Okay.

778
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,540
Come in.

779
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,780
I'm Li Zelin,

780
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,550
Chengtian Law Firm's partner.

781
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,660
I will help your company

782
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,580
to go through

783
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,530
the following legal procedures.

784
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,240
Nice to meet you, Miss Yin.

785
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,100
Nice to meet you.

786
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,930
Okay, go ahead.

787
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,500
Mr. Li is here in person.

788
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,950
It seems that

789
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,510
this case is really tricky.

790
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,410
Miss Yin,

791
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,980
your Live Stream Department

792
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,980
wants the packaging in such a hurry.

793
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,940
All departments in the company

794
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,090
had to make way for you.

795
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,040
Now the factory

796
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,520
has been working overtime

797
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,450
to produce.

798
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,660
But something like this happened.

799
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,000
I also heard that

800
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,620
you gave many electronic exchange coupons

801
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,180
to Flower World.

802
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,300
Frank,

803
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,030
our company must suffer

804
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,100
a huge loss this time.

805
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,730
We also need to pay for the lawsuit.

806
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,340
Miss Yin,

807
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,500
it seems that "it never rains but it pours"

808
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,700
goes well with Live Stream Department.

809
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,580
The contact person of Flower World

810
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,290
resigned.

811
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,930
He took a fake seal

812
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,170
to sign the contract.

813
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,900
Speaking of responsibility,

814
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,410
your Legal Department

815
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,690
should shoulder more.

816
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,160
Does it have nothing to do

817
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,720
with the Live Stream Department at all?

818
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,460
Your company's request is

819
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,110
to solve the problem,

820
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,770
not to shirk responsibility.

821
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,860
Frank,

822
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,300
should we hurry up and

823
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,470
review it?

824
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,820
Mr. Li,

825
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,870
I'll leave this to you.

826
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,900
Fortunately, it's not a big loss now.

827
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,590
The suspect

828
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,420
has been transferred to the police.

829
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,490
But what's troublesome is that

830
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,340
Flower World is suing

831
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,540
your company for

832
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,320
infringement in the name of publicizing and making profit.

833
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,400
Can SC

834
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,180
also use this

835
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,410
as a bargaining chip

836
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,820
to ask for

837
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,110
settlement?

838
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,510
These two cases

839
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,490
are not tied.

840
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,890
There's an order in it.

841
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,100
So SC

842
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,220
has to solve this lawsuit with Flower World

843
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,140
no matter what.

844
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,730
After that, you can try to get compensation

845
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,190
from the former employee.

846
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,770
As far as I know,

847
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,380
the intellectual property lawsuits are the hardest.

848
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,110
The compensation is also high.

849
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,320
What do you suggest?

850
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,260
I have some connections

851
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,060
that I can use.

852
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,300
I will try my best

853
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,980
to facilitate this settlement

854
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,250
to ensure SC's rights.

855
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,440
However,

856
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,750
in terms of public relations and brand maintenance,

857
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,820
if Miss Yin

858
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,720
can join us,

859
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,870
it would be the best.

860
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,400
After all, she's an expert.

861
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,040
No matter what happens,

862
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,700
Miss Yin

863
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,260
has always been very lucky.

864
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,130
When Chen Zicheng had a scandal,

865
00:31:59,150 --> 00:31:59,910
didn't Mr. Li

866
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,320
issue the lawyer's letter?

867
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,780
Something happened again.

868
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,430
Mr. Li

869
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,780
came all the way from Beijing.

870
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,780
You're so generous.

871
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,420
Frank,

872
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,750
I don't think I should be involved

873
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,830
this time.

874
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,660
Miss Yin.

875
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,670
Mr. Li,

876
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,460
a senior partner of a law firm,

877
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,700
came here to help.

878
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,340
You are chickening out now?

879
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,260
Where is your professional spirit?

880
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,980
If you can't handle

881
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,180
this matter well,

882
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,610
Zheng Ying can just go home and take care of her kid.

883
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,410
And the Live Stream Department will be disbanded.

884
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,660
Frank,

885
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,310
I'll do my best

886
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,380
to get this done.

887
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,620
Okay.

888
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,680
Everyone.

889
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,840
Big news! Big news!

890
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,850
What's wrong?

891
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,780
-What happened? -Guess

892
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,100
who the lawyer is?

893
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:51,790
Who?

894
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,860
It doesn't matter who it is.

895
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,060
It's still hard to deal with.

896
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,520
It's our brother-in-law.

897
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,020
Who?

898
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,020
Brother-in-law.

899
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,580
Whose brother-in-law?

900
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,630
Wait.

901
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,090
What brother-in-law?

902
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,140
Brother-in-law.

903
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,470
It's Yike's boyfriend.

904
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,850
You and Yurou came late.

905
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,020
Maybe you don't know yet.

906
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,460
He's a famous

907
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,800
lawyer.

908
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,740
So the hero rescuing the beauty

909
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,620
is never outdated.

910
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,650
Wait, wait, wait.

911
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,750
Boyfriend?

912
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,530
Yes.

913
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,230
But...

914
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,170
I'm on the side of Yike and Guangxi.

915
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,840
My couple has parted?

916
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,130
What couple?

917
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:23,660
Yike and Guangxi.

918
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:23,980
Yike and Guangxi?

919
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,510
What are you talking about?

920
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,220
You said you had something to do in Shanghai.

921
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,980
Is that it?

922
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,420
Yes.

923
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,890
Then why didn't you

924
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:39,840
tell me earlier?

925
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:40,950
To be honest,

926
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,090
I was afraid you would turn it down.

927
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,130
Zelin,

928
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,330
we've broken up.

929
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,750
That's why I was afraid

930
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,750
you would refuse.

931
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,590
I was just afraid that you have some concerns.

932
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,870
But you don't have to.

933
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,670
This case

934
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,280
is my work arrangement.

935
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,300
Don't forget

936
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,110
our law firm has always

937
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,370
served your company.

938
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,370
We met because of this back then.

939
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,250
Sorry.

940
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,100
I wanted to say that

941
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,600
I'm a hired lawyer of SC.

942
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,900
You are my client.

943
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,940
You can totally

944
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,469
trust my professionalism.

945
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,230
I'm sorry.

946
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,739
Maybe I thought too much.

947
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:26,929
Well,

948
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,370
let's begin.

949
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,610
Okay, let's go to my office.

950
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,889
I'll tell you about the case.

951
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:32,460
Okay.

952
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,340
Yike.

953
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,409
Yike.

954
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,800
This is Mr. Li, the lawyer.

955
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,000
He's in charge of the Flower World case.

956
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,060
Hello, Mr. Li.

957
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,699
Hello.

958
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,500
Go back to work.

959
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,230
Let's go.

960
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,270
This is the information of Flower World

961
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,420
and our contract.

962
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:53,820
This is the product

963
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,750
we made for them.

964
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,290
I think

965
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,220
no matter what,

966
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,620
it was our mistake.

967
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,140
So should we

968
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,640
release a signal to admit our mistake first?

969
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,930
You're wrong.

970
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,420
Even if we are not in advantage now,

971
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,970
we should be stronger.

972
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,060
Otherwise, the compensation

973
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,180
won't get lower.

974
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,130
I'm just thinking

975
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,740
if there is a win-win plan.

976
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,430
You're too naive.

977
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,300
In the cases that I handle,

978
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,300
there is no win-win.

979
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,060
Only I win.

980
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,860
Sorry.

981
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,060
Yike.

982
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,810
You can also share

983
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,140
your opinion.

984
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,890
We can discuss it together.

985
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,720
These are some of the data of Flower World I ran

986
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,310
before the collaboration.

987
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,370
See if you need it.

988
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,910
These are all theirs?

989
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,530
Yes.

990
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,680
The charm of a mature woman.

991
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,290
The color is fine now.

992
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,380
When the palette is out,

993
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,310
it's more clear.

994
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,100
If we are sure about

995
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,370
the world view and biography,

996
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,540
print out

997
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,340
more copies.

998
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,840
We'll need them tomorrow.

999
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,090
Chen Musen.

1000
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,290
But the rendering...

1001
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,580
Chen Musen.

1002
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,460
What's wrong?

1003
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,460
You did a good job.

1004
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,500
-Really? -Yes.

1005
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,490
-Really? -Indeed.

1006
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,210
Yes.

1007
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,530
You guys are

1008
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,150
much better than I expected.

1009
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,200
How about this?

1010
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,980
Go back and recharge yourselves.

1011
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,290
We have a tough battle tomorrow.

1012
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,460
Leave the rest to me.

1013
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,540
Remember to print that

1014
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,570
tomorrow.

1015
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,080
Okay.

1016
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,440
Go get some rest.

1017
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,570
Thank you, Guangxi.

1018
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,260
My good brother.

1019
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,000
OK. Good night.

1020
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:37,940
Thank you.

1021
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,450
Please do your best in this case.

1022
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,390
If you need my help,

1023
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,320
just let me know.

1024
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,090
Yike.

1025
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,660
I didn't mean to go against you

1026
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,980
in the meeting.

1027
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,260
It's just business.

1028
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,060
I understand.

1029
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,830
Your car is here.

1030
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,930
It's late. Let me give you a ride.

1031
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,830
No, I drove here.

1032
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,210
Are you mad at me

1033
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,030
because of

1034
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,390
our difference at work?

1035
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,860
I was too busy and

1036
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,740
didn't have a chance to pick you up.

1037
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,060
Now as your partner,

1038
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,780
give me a chance to make up for it.

1039
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,020
I've finished work.

1040
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,970
Are you home?

1041
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,980
Hello.

1042
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,390
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

1043
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,720
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

1044
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,190
You're off work, Mr. Li.

1045
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,250
♫Your eyes♫

1046
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,350
