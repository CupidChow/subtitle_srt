[Episode 5]

16
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,509
My company is shooting an advertisement in two days.

17
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,120
I have an appointment with the artist's agent

18
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,570
to discuss the details.

19
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,220
Can we make an appointment in two days?

20
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,580
Are you running away?

21
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,100
Let's meet another day. I promise.

22
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,060
It's off work now.

23
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,780
Can't you even have a meal?

24
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,020
To meet you,

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,880
I've rejected a major client.

26
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,020
I even postponed

27
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,740
to go back to Beijing.

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,620
Zelin.

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,770
I don't want to waste your time.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,150
I don't want to delay your work either.

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,360
But we really need some time

32
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,730
to calm down and think about it.

33
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,850
I'm really leaving.

34
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,900
Yin Yike,

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,009
You'd better think carefully.

36
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,560
I think...

37
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,260
Do you have

38
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,450
better choice than me?

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,500
Let go of me first.

40
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,740
Let go.

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,610
Mr. Li.

42
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,950
I don't care why.

43
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,800
I'll count to three.

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,300
If you don't let go,

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,100
I'll call the police and say

46
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,710
that someone harassed women in public.

47
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,930
This is our domestic matter.

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,460
None of your business.

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,060
Speaking of domestic matters,

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,820
I'm more qualified.

51
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,570
You dare to touch my friend.

52
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,630
Ask me if I agree.

53
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,650
Ask us.

54
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,329
What?

55
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,380
What do you want?

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,750
-What do you want? -What? What?

57
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,340
Enough.

58
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,340
Stop arguing.

59
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,460
Zelin.

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,700
I really have something to do today.

61
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,100
Go back first.

62
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,579
Crazy.

63
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,790
Who are you calling crazy?

64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,970
Stand here.

65
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,780
Come back.

66
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,530
Dismiss.

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,700
Guangxi.

68
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,090
Call a taxi for me.

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,910
I broke my phone.

70
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:15,810
Okay.

71
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,380
Yike.

72
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,420
I trust

73
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,530
your company's brand.

74
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,430
But what I want to say is,

75
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,110
Zicheng will join the film crew soon.

76
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,420
And this time his part

77
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,650
is very important,

78
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,940
also very hard.

79
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,430
He may not be able to take a leave to fly back and forth.

80
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,770
So can you postpone the shooting?

81
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,230
Our advertisement

82
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,890
has been planned long ago,

83
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
including on new media

84
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,340
and advertisements on the street.

85
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,500
If delayed,

86
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,290
the advertising profit will be greatly reduced.

87
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,530
It's not good

88
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,320
for Zicheng's data.

89
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,060
How about this?

90
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,260
I can ask the company

91
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,050
for the budget.

92
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,170
I promise

93
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,550
in a lively neighborhood,

94
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,070
as long as there are billboards,

95
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,500
there will be Zicheng's ad.

96
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,530
Add budget.

97
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,760
Then you can come to Che Dun.

98
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,220
It's near the crew.

99
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,480
We can make it

100
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,630
after the drama shooting.

101
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,950
If we rush like this, the quality...

102
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,310
I believe in your ability.

103
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,530
OK.

104
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,230
I'll arrange the shooting

105
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,140
at Che Dun.

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,370
But please

107
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,430
tell Zicheng.

108
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,650
Tell him to spare as much time as possible

109
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,300
for us.

110
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:51,970
Okay.

111
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,540
Okay, let me show you

112
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,780
our storyboard this time.

113
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,740
Xu Guangxi.

114
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,130
Why are you here?

115
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,510
Don't treat me

116
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,460
as you treat other girls.

117
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,890
How about this?

118
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,950
What is this?

119
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,440
You...

120
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,940
If you're not lucky enough to meet me,

121
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,370
you won't even be able to go home today.

122
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
I'm already unlucky today.

123
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,890
Stop laughing at me.

124
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
You bought this for me?

125
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,580
It's a birthday gift

126
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,330
for you.

127
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,660
It's falling-proof.

128
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,300
This is too expensive.

129
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,720
I'll transfer the money to you later.

130
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,400
What's expensive is not a phone,

131
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,010
but memories in the phone.

132
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,570
I can't help you with that.

133
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,780
Let's just start over.

134
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,510
You're right.

135
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,890
You put on the phone shell?

136
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,100
Thanks.

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,480
I'll make it up to you

138
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,300
on your birthday.

139
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,560
Don't wait for my next birthday.

140
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm hungry now.

141
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,270
Buy me dinner.

142
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,060
What do you want to eat?

143
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,860
Something expensive.

144
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,270
In your dreams.

145
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,700
-It must be something expensive. -You're really calculating.

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,760
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.,

147
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,750
we gather at Che Dun.

148
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,770
We can't be late.

149
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,180
Okay.

150
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,620
Yes.

151
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,020
Focus on all the details

152
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,010
and send them to the group chat.

153
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,640
All of us should confirm

154
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,500
again.

155
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,340
Okay, I've already talked to liaison staff

156
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,700
about what you said.

157
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,390
See you tomorrow.

158
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,400
Good luck tomorrow.

159
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,380
Do your best.

160
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,220
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,620
I promised to treat you to dinner.

162
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,460
I've been busy with work.

163
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,100
It's fine.

164
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,890
You look pretty at work.

165
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,740
Where are your manners?

166
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,730
Let's eat.

167
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,980
Thank you for today.

168
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,830
You and Li Zelin...

169
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,930
As for this matter,

170
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,040
as usual.

171
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,340
Sir, two cans of coke.

172
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,460
Your iced coke.

173
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,980
You quit drinking?

174
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,930
We broke up.

175
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,470
Quit drinking can remove my sorrows.

176
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,360
What do you mean?

177
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,590
Why are you laughing?

178
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,280
Are you gloating?

179
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,580
Let's drink coke to drown the sorrows.

180
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,000
Cheers.

181
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,710
By the way, thank you

182
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,660
for buying me a phone today.

183
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,940
I'll return it to you later.

184
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:22,980
Do you know how to use it?

185
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,150
Why not?

186
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,940
Do you know

187
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,580
its latest functions?

188
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
The latest functions.

189
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,780
You don't even know this.

190
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,690
You said you can use it.

191
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,800
First,

192
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,929
we need to open the album

193
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,610
and choose a photo as a screensaver.

194
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,420
When did you draw it?

195
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,020
Just now.

196
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,270
A female comrade

197
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,740
was working very hard.

198
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,660
It's my occupational disease.

199
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,890
I took up my pencil and recorded it.

200
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,540
Kid,

201
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,950
You're quite a playboy.

202
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,780
Why did you hit me again?

203
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,490
What?

204
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,860
Do you want a beating?

205
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,210
Sit over there. Eat well.

206
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,700
Eat more.

207
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,180
We have to

208
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,250
celebrate today.

209
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,860
Celebrate what?

210
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,810
Just celebrating.

211
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,740
Try this too.

212
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,020
That's enough.

213
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,670
Eat more.

214
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,940
You work so hard.

215
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,380
Why are you still calling at this hour?

216
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,290
Is it for you?

217
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,780
Just leave the parcel at the door.

218
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,640
You're so lazy.

219
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,300
I'll go.

220
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,090
Don't eat it secretly.

221
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,660
Guangxi.

222
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,220
Long time no see.

223
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,730
Do you remember me?

224
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,540
You are...

225
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,140
Give you some hints.

226
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,900
Everyone at the school gate

227
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,900
is waiting for me.

228
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,280
Everyone loves me

229
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,830
and even the flowers blossom for me.

230
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,590
When you first became my tutor,

231
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,270
you glared at me as soon as you saw me.

232
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,500
Because I couldn't learn

233
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,000
math and physics well.

234
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,010
I almost pissed you off.

235
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,600
Xia…

236
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,500
Xiaomian.

237
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,140
I knew you

238
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,370
you won't forget me.

239
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,660
How do you know I live here?

240
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,500
What can I do for you?

241
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,410
Well,

242
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,670
I can't even get into a community college.

243
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,690
I can only wash dishes in England.

244
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,680
I can only go back to China.

245
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,340
In the end, I found out

246
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,170
Guangxi, you're back too.

247
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,870
Do you think

248
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,660
is there anything more coincidental than this?

249
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,480
You live here?

250
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,220
It looks fine.

251
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,020
I'm thirsty.

252
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,940
I want juice.

253
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,150
It's all because of those yellow-haired

254
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,300
don't know how to appreciate

255
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,980
oriental beauty.

256
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,900
They said my eyes are too round.

257
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
My face is too small.

258
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,450
I'm too short and low

259
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,500
that I can't be a model.

260
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,900
What do they know?

261
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,420
I can shine

262
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,790
with only a facial mask

263
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,520
and attract 10 million people.

264
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,350
And my fans said

265
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,660
that I just pout

266
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,630
on the video blog

267
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,180
that I'll get thousands more fans.

268
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,510
I can be a star in China

269
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,150
and make a lot of money.

270
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,060
A beggar could even

271
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,380
come to one's house.

272
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,480
Don't talk nonsense.

273
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,140
I don't care.

274
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,900
You can't let her stay.

275
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,540
Go.

276
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,650
Xiaomian,

277
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,190
if you come in like this,

278
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,490
it's not that convenient

279
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,500
since we are not

280
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,840
familiar enough.

281
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,980
No, it's very convenient.

282
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,610
If you don't have money to stay in a hotel,

283
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,180
I can lend it to you.

284
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,680
How can a little fairy stay in a hotel?

285
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,460
No, she can't stay here.

286
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,860
When you came in,

287
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,830
didn't you notice two men

288
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,140
in this room?

289
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,830
As a girl,

290
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,330
you should know how to protect yourself.

291
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,260
Right?

292
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,500
It's okay, Guangxi.

293
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,360
I believe you would

294
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,140
protect me well.

295
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,980
How about this?

296
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,220
Let me stay for

297
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,710
seven days.

298
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,150
Seven days.

299
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,750
A week?

300
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,810
Isn't it seven days a week?

301
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,380
How about this?

302
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,820
I'll go out to work as soon as possible.

303
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,820
I'm an Internet celebrity after all.

304
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,030
I make money fast.

305
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,000
As long as I make money,

306
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,430
I'll move out immediately.

307
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,690
I won't disturb you.

308
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,310
As a girl,

309
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,330
living in Shanghai,

310
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,070
I'm alone

311
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,060
and not safe.

312
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,530
It's dangerous.

313
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,370
Right?

314
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,920
It's too dangerous.

315
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,590
How can a little girl like you

316
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,740
live alone in Shanghai?

317
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,270
That's right.

318
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,130
I've decided.

319
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,260
You can live here.

320
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,890
Uncle, you're right.

321
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,970
Poor thing.

322
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,540
You...

323
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,770
You promised.

324
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,180
Take care of her.

325
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,600
Thank you, uncle.

326
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,010
I'm in a hurry. I'm going out.

327
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,660
Wait.

328
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,870
Why did she call you brother,

329
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,690
but me uncle?

330
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:56,740
Uncle.

331
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,990
This mask is for you.

332
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,800
Forever youth.

333
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,490
Okay.

334
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,860
Apply a mask.

335
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,170
Luckily, you're here.

336
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,980
Otherwise, all these will be wasted.

337
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,790
Ke went to work

338
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,990
in a hurry this morning.

339
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,020
She didn't even eat.

340
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
She said she was afraid of traffic.

341
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,880
It's the weekend.

342
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,280
It's so hard to work overtime on the weekend.

343
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,460
You stubborn old man.

344
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,650
Time for breakfast.

345
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,520
Let's...

346
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,670
Son, you're here.

347
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,420
Hello, uncle.

348
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,060
Well,

349
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,980
our daughter's job

350
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,620
is a good job.

351
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,170
It's a decent to tell others.

352
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,630
She said

353
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,980
she is taking photos for some celebrity today, right?

354
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,090
It's good to work with a celebrity.

355
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,370
You eat well and drink well.

356
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,460
You can go places

357
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
that are not for ordinary people.

358
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,760
How fashionable.

359
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,660
Yesterday,

360
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,820
I told Zhou of the fleet that

361
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,250
Zhou would like

362
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,710
to beg our daughter

363
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,730
to get his daughter an autograph.

364
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,180
You speak faster

365
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,760
than you drive.

366
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,640
Well,

367
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,980
It's such a good thing.

368
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,580
It's too late.

369
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,620
It makes me proud.

370
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,310
Eat with your mom.

371
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,220
I... will go out.

372
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,370
Where are you going?

373
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,300
Why do you care so much?

374
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,300
You stay with her.

375
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,520
Sit with your mother for a while.

376
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,320
Your Uncle Yin

377
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,870
must go to brag

378
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,860
with his old friends.

379
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,300
He would say Ke is very capable.

380
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,900
Eat up, mom.

381
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,180
There was a traffic jam,

382
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,190
so I left early.

383
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,390
I've received your gift.

384
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,500
Alright, stop playing with your phone.

385
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,020
Okay.

386
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,700
Thank you, mom.

387
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,750
Yike, look at this.

388
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,690
Let me see.

389
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,650
And...

390
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,260
This is

391
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,730
the storyboard.

392
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,140
This is also printed there.

393
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,010
Put this on it.

394
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,180
I'll go and say hello.

395
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,980
Take care of the work for me.

396
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,820
Okay, no problem. Don't worry.

397
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,180
Okay.

398
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,220
Zicheng.

399
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,420
Hello.

400
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,240
I'm Yin Yike from SC

401
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,980
who is in charge of this shooting.

402
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,520
I bought you some iced coffee.

403
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,460
I heard

404
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,880
you gave my agent

405
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,270
a lot of sleeping aid products.

406
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,300
Give it to me.

407
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,650
Coffee.

408
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,520
What?

409
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,090
My agent needs sleep,

410
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,780
I don't

411
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,360
Of course not.

412
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,700
Or what would you like to drink?

413
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,420
I can drive

414
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,220
to buy it for you.

415
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,450
Forget it. Let's take photos.

416
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,620
Let's finish early.

417
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,210
Ms. Shen, where should I put the flowers?

418
00:16:59,210 --> 00:16:59,970
Let me see.

419
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,220
Be careful.

420
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,100
Don't let the flowers get tanned.

421
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,020
This one is especially delicate.

422
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,099
Spray water

423
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,950
every ten minutes.

424
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,500
Understand?

425
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,380
Okay, I'll check

426
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,020
if it's broken.

427
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,630
Let's change the front scene flowers

428
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,530
into fake flowers.

429
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,730
You can use real flowers for the backstage.

430
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,060
The effect will be discounted.

431
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,660
Yike.

432
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,250
The celebrity should be allergic to flowers.

433
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,099
Let's take care of him.

434
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,339
We can work on it later.

435
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,180
It should be fine.

436
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,420
Okay, I got it. I'll take care of it.

437
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,930
Okay, go ahead.

438
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,480
Let's go.

439
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,339
Yike.

440
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:24,750
Let's go through

441
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,740
the procedure.

442
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,650
Take a look.

443
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,180
Boss's Ninja Art

444
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,210
is excellent.

445
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,860
Otherwise, she's the boss

446
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,350
and you run errands?

447
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,730
I...

448
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,370
Don't hit me.

449
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,860
You must learn from her how to bear.

450
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,340
Let's go.

451
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,490
Hello, Ms. Zheng.

452
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,070
Don't worry.

453
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,630
Our progress is going well.

454
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,910
There's another press conference.

455
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,180
I've gone through the process.

456
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,590
How many times have I told you

457
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
not to come,

458
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,360
but you didn't listen

459
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,270
and went to the set.

460
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,290
But you're sick.

461
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,860
I'm worried about you.

462
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,420
It seems we can't hide it this time.

463
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,820
Why don't we make it public?

464
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,410
I don't want to always

465
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,130
look like thieves

466
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,990
when we meet.

467
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,300
Hello?

468
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,860
Okay.

469
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,780
I'll take care of it.

470
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,540
I was just inside.

471
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,480
Don't be nervous.

472
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,540
I'm here to help solve the problem.

473
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,550
Will you be so kind?

474
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,980
This is my project.

475
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,170
I must reduce the cost

476
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,960
to the minimum.

477
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,300
But I have a question.

478
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,540
Are you two serious

479
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,420
with each other?

480
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,140
We must find a way

481
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,740
to get out of here.

482
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,620
This way.

483
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,410
You two go there.

484
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,750
Come with me.

485
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,370
Be careful.

486
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,090
Be careful.

487
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,410
Chen Zicheng and I will

488
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,980
go out first.

489
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,700
You hide here.

490
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,950
If someone finds out,

491
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,340
just say you're a staff.

492
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,580
Okay, but...

493
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,910
If we two go out,

494
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,300
we would also be gossiped.

495
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,770
There's no connection

496
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
between us.

497
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,100
And there was a video at the scene.

498
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,640
It can prove

499
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,770
we are working partners.

500
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,000
But if you two

501
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,740
get out,

502
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,760
you can imagine the consequences.

503
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,900
Thank you.

504
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,690
Alright.

505
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,680
Don't say thank you.

506
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,710
Come on. Hide.

507
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,030
If you're bored,

508
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,510
open the box.

509
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,170
Okay.

510
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,520
Let's go.

511
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,340
Come in.

512
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,550
Mr. Li.

513
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,180
The big boss called you.

514
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,430
He didn't speak well.

515
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,480
I'll put him through.

516
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,590
Hello, boss.

517
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,060
Zelin.

518
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,450
how is the case in Shanghai?

519
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,300
Don't worry.

520
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,520
Everything is going well.

521
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,200
Did you hear

522
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,220
the gossip in our office?

523
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,650
Boss.

524
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,890
I'm sorry.

525
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,700
It's useless to apologize to me.

526
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,570
You know the rumours are fearful.

527
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,720
Now you just got promoted

528
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,600
a partner of the law firm,

529
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,100
with many cases.

530
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,740
Many people are watching you.

531
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,770
You'd better take good care of

532
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,680
these private matters.

533
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
Don't let them affect your future.

534
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,860
Got it.

535
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,050
I'll take care of these.

536
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,740
Sorry,

537
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,620
the subscriber you dialed

538
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,930
is busy.

539
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,330
Please redial later.

540
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,580
These are paparazzi's

541
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,580
fabrication.

542
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,630
The whole shooting process

543
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,940
was recorded by short videos.

544
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,460
We can remove the rumor immediately.

545
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,700
It is easy to create rumors

546
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,850
and difficult to dispel them.

547
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,820
Miss Yin

548
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,790
is experienced.

549
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,040
You should show up

550
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,420
and disappear

551
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,980
when it's time.

552
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,910
Keep a safe distance

553
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,780
with artists.

554
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,900
Don't you understand

555
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,750
that simple principle?

556
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,900
I'm sorry about that.

557
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,770
I'll contact the editing department

558
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,000
to edit the video

559
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,730
to prevent rumors.

560
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,720
PR crisis

561
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,160
cost a lot of money.

562
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,290
Where will you get the budget?

563
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't think

564
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,260
you should worry about.

565
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,300
Frank,

566
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,420
We've contacted

567
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,300
Chen Zicheng.

568
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,580
They will release

569
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,450
clarification news

570
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,890
to cooperate with us

571
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,030
to spread the truth.

572
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,930
Ms. Zheng.

573
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:56,810
Mr. Kong.

574
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,180
I think

575
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,510
this is a rare

576
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,620
pre-stage publicity.

577
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,110
With the aid of the attention,

578
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,700
we should prepare

579
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,060
Chen Zicheng's new materials.

580
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,860
Then, release them

581
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,080
with the clarification video.

582
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,180
I'll hurry up

583
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,350
to make sure the advertisements and posters

584
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,810
and turn the crisis into an opportunity.

585
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,260
Miss. Yin.

586
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,310
We must

587
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,140
seize this opportunity.

588
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,340
Hey!

589
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,220
Guangxi.

590
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,200
Let me tell you.

591
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,680
I received a big order

592
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,940
and got 50,000 fans in one night.

593
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,030
Now I'm waiting for

594
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,930
the boss to send me money.

595
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,950
I'll treat you to dinner.

596
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,270
No need.

597
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,930
You should move earlier.

598
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,940
Don't reject me so soon.

599
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,020
It hurts.

600
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,010
I'm busy. I'll talk to you later.

601
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,090
Hurry up.

602
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,290
Come and see.

603
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,290
Guangxi.

604
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,150
Your sister.

605
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,340
They scold so badly?

606
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,430
Just take a look.

607
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,380
Don't take it to heart.

608
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,220
If you covet my husband, you'll die.

609
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,530
You're not young anymore.

610
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,080
I advise her to be kind.

611
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,930
The brand is blind.

612
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,450
An angelic bitch.

613
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,090
Check carefully.

614
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,630
We must get the face.

615
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,420
Hello.

616
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,430
Can you help me

617
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,540
give this to Yin Yike?

618
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,590
Yes.

619
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,700
Who are you?

620
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,630
I'm her brother.

621
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,300
Leave it to me.

622
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,380
Wait.

623
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,270
Do you have paper and pen?

624
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,050
Yes.

625
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,060
Thank you.

626
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:49,850
You're welcome.

627
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,890
Cut this part shorter.

628
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,580
-Okay. -You should be fast-paced.

629
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:06,940
Yike.

630
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,420
I've checked this document.

631
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,100
Take a look.

632
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,950
Yike.

633
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,310
This is the milk tea

634
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,340
from the animation company upstairs.

635
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,410
Brother Fairy is so nice.

636
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,140
Yike,

637
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,700
This is for you, right?

638
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,780
Sir.

639
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,070
Thank you.

640
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,050
Cha Cha.

641
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,570
[There are a lot of people downstairs. You have to be careful]

642
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,570
[If you have problems, feel free to call me.]

643
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,550
Yike.

644
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:40,920
Yike.

645
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,770
Something happened.

646
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,070
Some KOL

647
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,590
sent your information

648
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,370
online.

649
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,950
Everyone is talking about you.

650
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,560
Well,

651
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,470
They did it on purpose.

652
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,270
No matter it's true or not,

653
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,850
they will destroy you first.

654
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,780
How about this, Yike?

655
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,310
I'll call Chen Zicheng's agent.

656
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:56,980
Ask them

657
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,220
to clarify it first.

658
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,770
Anyway, our video is ready

659
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,570
a long time ago.

660
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,500
Yes.

661
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,610
We've stayed up for so many days.

662
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,990
We can't affect the company's interests

663
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,980
because of me.

664
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,440
Let's follow the original pace.

665
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,610
At worst,

666
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,310
I'll sleep here.

667
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,220
I'm not going downstairs.

668
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,650
Are you kidding me?

669
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,870
Do you think they won't continue

670
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,750
to wait for you

671
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,570
at the gate tomorrow?

672
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:19,850
Come with me.

673
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,740
Where are we going?

674
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,940
Turn dragon into a phoenix.

675
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,010
A cicada sloughing off its skin.

676
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,990
Will it really work?

677
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,070
Don't worry.

678
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,780
That's her.

679
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,700
Hurry up.

680
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,060
Slow down.

681
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,940
Guangxi. She looks like your sister.

682
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,430
This...

683
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,980
What's going on?

684
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,530
This is a good move.

685
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,300
A cicada sloughing off its skin.

686
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,690
A cicada sloughing off its skin.

687
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,100
What cicada?

688
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,380
What skin?

689
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,960
Why are you running?

690
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,520
I don't know. Why are you running?

691
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,340
Of course. Someone is chasing me.

692
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,180
Me too.

693
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,060
It's over.

694
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,610
How could you think of this?

695
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,190
Hide in the trash can.

696
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,570
Be smart.

697
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,140
Wait, why should I hide?

698
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,260
You took me away.

699
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,060
No, you ran away first.

700
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,260
That's why I followed you.

701
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,310
Why are you

702
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,250
being mean?

703
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,450
Go away!

704
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,080
Be careful.

705
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:50,730
Be careful.

706
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,050
Be careful.

707
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,580
Be careful.

708
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,430
Be careful.

709
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,090
My shoes.

710
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,930
Be careful.

711
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,250
Cool.

712
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,920
Yike.

713
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,340
You didn't answer my call.

714
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,730
I've been looking for you.

715
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,240
What happened to the news?

716
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,900
I'm really tired right now.

717
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,260
Can we not talk about this first?

718
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,350
I just want to

719
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,140
hear your explanation.

720
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,120
What kind of attitude is that?

721
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,380
I have nothing to explain.

722
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,910
What's there to explain?

723
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,860
If it's true,

724
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,080
you should make it clear.

725
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,980
Now even my boss

726
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,240
called me in person and asked

727
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,810
why my girlfriend

728
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,060
is on the entertainment page?

729
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,000
My colleagues and friends

730
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,940
are laughing at me.

731
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,570
You know?

732
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,780
Then I won't be your girlfriend.

733
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,340
Okay?

734
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,100
Yin Yike.

735
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,580
What do you mean?

736
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,150
It's just you are not satisfied

737
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,930
with my proposal.

738
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,810
Is that necessary?

739
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,010
You want to break up so soon?

740
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,780
Could it be

741
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,130
the photo is real?

742
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,380
Is that how you think of me?

743
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,410
Fine.

744
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,010
Even if it's not true,

745
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:21,950
you shouldn't

746
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,410
get so close

747
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,500
to that man.

748
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,790
I've warned you.

749
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,930
A woman with your appearance

750
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,190
should know better than other women

751
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,570
how to keep distance with men.

752
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,380
Are you done?

753
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,810
She's over there.

754
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,690
Hurry! Over there!

755
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,560
Get in the car.

756
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,500
Miss Yin.

757
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,510
How long have you been together?

758
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,310
Please say something.

759
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:39,940
Miss Yin.

760
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,310
I lost my contact lenses.

761
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,260
Hurry up and find it for me.

762
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,300
Miss.

763
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,430
What are you doing?

764
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,410
Are you looking for me?

765
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,900
I'm sorry.

766
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,820
I'm sorry.

767
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,200
I'm sorry.

768
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,480
Contact lenses.

769
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,220
Here.

770
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,490
Here.

771
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,390
Use your finger.

772
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:22,940
Okay?

773
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,550
Got them?

774
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,030
Can you do it yourself?

775
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,690
Do you need help?

776
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,750
I'm not blind.

777
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,600
Today,

778
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,890
I offered a little help to you.

779
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,860
I didn't ask for your help.

780
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,050
You can't say that.

781
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,700
Right?

782
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,290
I'm a man.

783
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,440
You're a little girl

784
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,780
being chased by so many people.

785
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,280
I can't ignore it if I see it.

786
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,120
Then why were you hiding?

787
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,160
That's not hiding.

788
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,480
It's called tactical retreat.

789
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,900
We have status

790
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,890
in society.

791
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,140
Why make ourselves being posted

792
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,370
on the Internet?

793
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,620
It's no fun, right?

794
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,430
How dare you say you have a status?

795
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,020
Who do you think you are?

796
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,300
I'm not...

797
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,350
I don't want to introduce myself.

798
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,380
Well...

799
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,760
It's the boss

800
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,780
of a big animation company.

801
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,260
Chen Ye.

802
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,710
When I heard Yin Yike talking

803
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,910
about your company name,

804
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,600
I thought

805
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,020
who are these people?

806
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,730
Why do you use such a stupid company name?

807
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,610
I didn't expect you

808
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,770
to be middle aged and childlike.

809
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,530
The contrast is cute.

810
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,900
The contrast is cute.

811
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,030
You're really good at following the lead.

812
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,340
Thank you.

813
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,960
Well...

814
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,700
Anyway,

815
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,060
thank you for today.

816
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,150
You're welcome.

817
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,470
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

818
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,120
Okay.

819
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,460
Are you OK?

820
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,460
I'll call a taxi for you?

821
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,090
[Li Zilin]

822
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,290
Yike, where are you?

823
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,960
I'll go find you.

824
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,890
That's not what I meant.

825
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,940
I was just too anxious.

826
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,210
You have to solve this quickly.

827
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,230
I have ideas.

828
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,380
Don't worry about those photos.

829
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,550
It's okay.

830
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,580
Guangxi.

831
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,120
Everyone seeing

832
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,740
those photos

833
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,860
would have bad thoughts.

834
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,400
I don't.

835
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,100
I have no bad thoughts.

836
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,310
I know Yin Yike

837
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,500
has her reasons

838
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,360
for everything she does.

839
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,100
She must be trying to help others.

840
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,950
Cry if you want.

841
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,440
Don't hide it.

842
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,300
I'm fine.

843
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,020
It's just I stayed up late

844
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,330
so that my eyes are sore.

845
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,820
The netizens

846
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,000
are really too idle.

847
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,900
That's because

848
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,300
Yin Yike is too beautiful.

849
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,020
Otherwise, who would believe it?

850
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,659
You said you didn't have bad thoughts.

851
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,980
What are you thinking?

852
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,699
Chen Zicheng is younger than you.

853
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,850
He's in his early 20s.

854
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,699
So what?

855
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,130
A man in his 20s

856
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,260
is protecting you now.

857
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,380
Do you feel

858
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,020
you are like a blanket

859
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,600
which warms others

860
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,670
but not yourself?

861
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:31,710
What kind of

862
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,179
weird metaphors.

863
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,820
You should think more about yourself.

864
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,719
The Internet memory can only lasts

865
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,860
for about seven seconds.

866
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,340
Tomorrow morning,

867
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,320
the top news will be changed.

868
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,820
No one will remember.

869
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,540
Hello, Yiran, are you okay?

870
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,900
I'm fine.

871
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,240
If anything happens, it's someone else.

872
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,260
How are you?

873
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,300
Did you retreat safely?

874
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,320
I'm fine.

875
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
I've left the company.

876
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,140
Why don't you come to my house tonight?

877
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,430
I'm afraid they will follow you home.

878
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,210
I can lie to your parents

879
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,870
for you

880
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,090
so that they won't worry.

881
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,280
It's okay.

882
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,660
It's better for us to be scattered.

883
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,090
No.

884
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,740
Do you have any plans tonight?

885
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,290
Not yet.

886
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,820
Let's find a hotel later.

887
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,100
Okay.

888
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,880
Be careful.

889
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:24,830
If you need anything,

890
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,800
feel free to text me via WeChat.

891
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,540
Got it?

892
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,780
Bye.

893
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,660
I don't think anyone is after us now.

894
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,010
But it's not safe

895
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,390
for you to go to the hotel at night.

896
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,700
Where can I go?

897
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,460
I'll take you somewhere.

898
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,850
Why did you steal my playlist?

899
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,580
Do you like this song too?

900
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,720
This song was on my playlist

901
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,870
800 years ago.

902
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,520
♫Oh, love should be♫

903
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,600
♫Like songbirds soaring to the sun♫

904
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,580
♫My dear♫

905
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,300
♫When you walk with me♫

906
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,710
♫The cloves♫

907
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,460
♫are dancing at my feet♫

908
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,970
I remember there's a line

909
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,060
in La La Land,

910
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,140
a good line.

911
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,130
At some point in time,

912
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,200
a person meets another,

913
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,970
they grow together

914
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,820
and encourage each other,

915
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,460
there is happiness, there is pain

916
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,270
there is growth, there is regret,

917
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,220
this is life.

918
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,740
I agree with you.

919
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,290
But when it comes to movies,

920
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,420
I prefer Titanic.

921
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,510
That was the movie I watched

922
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,250
in elementary school.

923
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,180
That was also the movie I watched

924
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,260
when I was in elementary school.

925
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,130
We watched

926
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,940
in the same theater.

927
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,050
Do you believe it?

928
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,140
Which one?

929
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,950
The one

930
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,970
at the alley entrance.

931
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,500
Happiness Theater?

932
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,440
Can you understand the content?

933
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,690
♫Oh, love should be♫

934
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,720

941

♫I hear church bells ring♫

♫Don't know why. I suddenly♫

957
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,390
♫Hate to calculate the distance between you♫

958
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,860
♫I fear I cannot see you in the next second♫

959

960
