00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,620
it depends on yourself.

Keep up with her.

178

Go.

Yes!

You two are a team.

183
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,900
If you want to recommend me

184
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,740
to buy a bottle of perfume,

185
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,800
what would you say?

186
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,610
May I

187
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,230
ask an extra question first?

188
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,620
What kind of person

189
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,310
will meet SC's expectation for live streamers?

190
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,220
This person should be professional,

191
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,930
serious,

192
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,900
and modest.

193
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,480
I think if I work hard,

194
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,880
I can meet the standards.

195
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,480
This male fragrance is called French lover.

196
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,980
It has the texture of advanced customization.

197
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,310
It's full of the quality

198
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,460
showing the arrogance and elegance of a French man.

199
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,490
It looks like a type of

200
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,140
chic fragrance that costs no effort,

201
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,270
but it also shows a little ruggedness.

202
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,130
I think it's the standard fragrance to attract women,

203
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,780
just like the impression

204
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,420
of this gentleman to others.

205
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,790
Sorry.

206
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,970
Maybe I don't use

207
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,370
the fragrance you chose.

208
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,180
But

209
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,980
you're quite right

210
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,220
about my personality.

211
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,820
Thank you.

212
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
I admit that I still have

213
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,680
a lot of shortcomings.

214
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,410
But this is also the reason why

215
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,780
I want to join SC to hone my skills.

give me more advice.

219
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,940

I would recommend this one to you.

This perfume

229
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,140
is really weird.

Why is it weird?

At the beginning,

00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,410
it smells very normal.

But...

234

Remember this "but".

After a while,

236
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,300
it will smell

237
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,550
like the toilet of a high-class club.

238
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
If you want to become

a type of perfume you like?

This one.

247

At first, when you smell

this perfume,

249
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,070
it's just ordinary,

250
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,270
but by smelling it more closely,

251
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,230
it feels like...

252
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,210

you can't say anything.

Speechless, right?

311
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,330
But I think Yurou

is more stable.

313

That's a good idea.

314
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
But the funds are not enough, right?

Yike, what do you think?

316
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,950
I'll think about it.

317

Here comes the lift. Let's go.

318

is more suitable to be a live streamer.

Both are good.

Where's Guangxi?

332
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,460
I haven't seen him for a day.

333
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,790
I don't know where he is.

334
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,830
Is he absent from work for no reason?

335
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,210
For artists like us,

336
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,570
it's normal to be casual.

337
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,220
Yike, we have to work overtime.

338

You must be tired.

350
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,520
So many dishes.

351
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,120
Aunt Lan.

352
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,710
Xu Guangxi asks for mother's love.

353
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,780
What's wrong?

354
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,610
Maybe he caught a cold

355
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,650
while playing basketball.

356
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,980
He has a running nose and also sheds tears.

357
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,640
Is it serious?

358
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,660
He's fine.

359
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,140
He's a man.

360
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,140
He should be fine.

361
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,950
This kid...

362
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
You two eat first.

363
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,540
I'll go to the kitchen

364
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,940
to make some food for him.

365
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,780
Aunt Lan,

366
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,470
I'll go with you.

367
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,210
Okay.

368
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,900
No, I...

369
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,840
My finger is injured.

370
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,730
Why doesn't anyone care about me?

371
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,120
Mom, why are you here?

372
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,700
Didn't you say you weren't feeling well,

373
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,580
and that you had no food to eat?

374
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,990
I cooked for you.

375
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,740
How are you?

376
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,240
What's wrong with you?

377
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,670
I'm fine.

378
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,270
You're fine.

379
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,800
Indeed. There's no change in your voice.

380
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,160
Look.

381
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,570
Yibo

382
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,050
was exaggerating the truth.

383
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,780
Yike is also worried about you.

384
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,130
Where is she?

385
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,450
She came with me.

386
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,380
When she was downstairs,

387
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,380
she said a friend was looking for her.

388
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,320
Something urgent came up.

389
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,820
She's making a phone call downstairs.

390
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,930
Let's go in and eat.

391
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,450
Hurry up.

392
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,630
Hurry up.

393
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,310
Coming.

394
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,200
Come in and eat.

395
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,460
Mom.

396
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,870
Well,

397
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,280
since Yike has come here,

398
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,070
why doesn't she come upstairs?

399
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,030
Yike has been in a bad mood lately.

400
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,160
What happened?

401
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,220
Do you know she has broken up

402
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,350
with her boyfriend?

403
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,140
If you know, why don't you comfort her?

404
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,260
She seems

405
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,620
in a good mood recently.

406
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,620
Do you think

407
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,950
Yike is as insensitive

408
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,860
as you?

409
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,780
There are many problems on Yike's mind.

410
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,610
I mean,

411
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,470
we are not

412
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,630
her closest family.

413
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,870
If she wants to get over the sadness,

414
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,610
she has to rely on herself.

415
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,260
I feel

416
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,780
very sorry for Yike.

417
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,060
I hope there is a way

418
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,230
to help her get over it as soon as possible.

419
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,140
Mom,

420
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,880
maybe you can really help.

421
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,260
The method

422
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,050
most often used by parents like you

423
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,360
might work this time.

424
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,870
You mean to introduce a man to her to be her boyfriend?

425
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,100
I suggested it, but she refused.

426
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,060
Girls

427
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,440
tend to be shy.

428
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,360
But as soon as they really see each other...

429
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,800
How is Guangxi?

430
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,230
This kid

431
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,570
is sick but he didn't tell me,

432
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,970
and stayed at home alone.

433
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,120
But it seems

434
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
he is fine.

435
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,330
Why don't you go upstairs and see him?

436
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,780
Forget it. Let him rest.

437
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,330
Let's go.

438
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
I think it's good.

439
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,470
If Yike likes it,

440
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,160
remember to convey my wishes.

441
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,500
Good night, mom.

442
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,280
Perfect.

443
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,220
By the way,

444
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,420
have you checked the time of

445
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,370
the afternoon meeting with them?

446
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,160
Yes, I have.

447
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:08,910
So stingy.

448
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,900
Drink water. Drink water.

449
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,030
All you think about is spending money.

450
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,140
He still has the nerve to swagger through the streets?

451
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,470
Yiran, what did you say?

452
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,500
Nothing.

453
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,190
By the way,

454
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,110
do you have

455
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,470
empty perfume bottles?

456
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,110
Yes.

457
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,460
Our company made the molds for the samples,

458
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,340
and there are some left.

459
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,740
What do you want them for?

460
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,650
I've been learning to make fragrance lately.

461
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,850
I want to take a few bottles to practice.

462
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,100
Good!

463
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,420
Come on, Guangxi!

464
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,710
Go, go, go!

465
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,210
Go! Go! Go!

466
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,780
Come on! Come on! Guangxi!

467
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,270
Hurry! Defeat him!

468
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,690
Pass! Pass! Run!

469
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,670
Guangxi. Guangxi.

470
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,000
Over there. Over there.

471
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,370
Where is Chen Ye?

472
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,570
Baba, Baba, Baba!

473
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,970
Stop saying that!

474
00:18:59,250 --> 00:18:59,990
I'm asking you.

475
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,900
Our boss is not here.

476
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,140
Why did you come here?

477
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,560
This is for him.

478
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,020
[To Chen Ye]

479
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,020
[A Gift to Commemorate Our Date]

480
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,330
Just say it's from Qin Yiran.

481
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,580
Cool!

482
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,980
Baba is really amazing.

483
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,140
He got off work faster than us.

484
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,470
He flirted with girls faster than us, too.

485
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,180
This is SC's limited edition perfume.

486
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,740
It's out of production now.

487
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,170
Baba really deserves his reputation.

488
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,950
Then I'll open it secretly,

489
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,850
spray it...

490
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,770
And then put it back secretly.

491
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,150
I might get

492
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,810
some luck in love from him.

493
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,850
Maybe

494
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,990
Miss Fairy

495
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,480
will smile at me tomorrow.

496
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,020
I want it too! I want it too! I want it too!

497
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,900
I want it too!

498
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,040
What's that smell?

499
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,500
Did you receive the gift?

500
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,060
How does pigeon poop smell?

501
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,790
Pigeon poop?

502
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,660
Hello.

503
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,920
Guangxi, my baby.

504
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,670
Does our company

505
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,760
receive any gifts?

506
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,540
Well,

507
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,020
limited edition perfume.

508
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,660
Okay.

509
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,540
Got it.

510
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,160
Pigeon poop perfume.

511
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,430
Good for you.

512
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,220
Of course.

513
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,380
He stood me up.

514
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,940
I have to teach him a lesson.

515
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,490
Room 3 is really good.

516
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,360
Right?

517
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,640
It's newly developed.

518
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,590
As I predict it,

519
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,090
is that handsome boy

520
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,840
on the edge of

521
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,530
escaping?

522
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,440
Maybe the words I said were too harsh.

523
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,970
You have to seize the chance.

524
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,300
Favorable conditions

525
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,500
are required to ignite the flames.

526
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,530
To put it out only takes a second.

527
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,140
I'm talking about my friend.

528
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,870
A slip of tongue.

529
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,650
Friend.

530
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,230
Hello, Aunt Lan.

531
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,590
Ke.

532
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,440
I heard that there's a western restaurant

533
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,330
which is quite good.

534
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,530
Are you free tonight?

535
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,420
Go with me

536
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,250
to have steak.

537
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,320
I'll send you the address.

538
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,530
Why do you suddenly

539
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,510
think of having steak?

540
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,470
I want to

541
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,770
try different creative dishes.

542
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,780
Then I can make

543
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,280
different dishes at home.

544
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,980
Okay. See you later.

545
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,080
Just go. What a good daughter.

546
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:20,900
Bye.

547
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,690
Miss Yin, right?

548
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,340
Hello, my name is Chen Shuo.

549
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,070
Ms. Jin introduced me here.

550
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,240
Aunt Lan?

551
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,100
Yes.

552
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,900
I'm a straightforward man.

553
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,480
Let's get straight to the point.

554
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,690
I only have

555
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,060
three requirements for my future wife.

556
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,460
I've found you

557
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,890
the best man.

558
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,590
Enjoy your meal.

559
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,730
I think you're quite good.

560
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,740
Secondly,

561
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,180
I hope she is gentle and virtuous,

562
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,940
and can focus on her family after marriage.

563
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,430
Serve both the husband and the child.

564
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,690
Don't feel pressured.

565
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,810
If you think it's okay, just say yes. If no, just no.

566
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,020
Thirdly,

567
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,370
be economically rational for life.

568
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,730
Be industrious and thrifty in managing a household.

569
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,300
A too extravagant woman will dissipate the fortune

570
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,500
of her family easily.

571
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,200
That's all.

572
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,520
Guangxi helped to

573
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,790
select this man for you.

574
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,190
He said he would suit you.

575
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,820
What's wrong?

576
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,340
Let me tell you the truth.

577
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,860
My standard for my future husband

578
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,850
is quite simple.

579
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,150
I just hope

580
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,500
he can be handsome and take care of the family.

581
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,140
He can do housework and look after our child.

582
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,410
Not only can he take good care of me,

583
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,620
but also my parents.

584
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,930
The most important thing is

585
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,500
to be thrifty and considerate,

586
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,830
and not to make trouble.

587
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,860
How dare you, Xu Guangxi!

588
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,660
Where are you?

589
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,380
How dare you, Xu Guangxi!

590
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,180
Where are you?

591
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,320
At home.

592
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,370
Just wait.

593
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,090
Didn't you catch a cold?

594
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,580
Are you completely recovered?

595
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,500
If you had come to see me,

596
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,230
I would have recovered faster.

597
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,340
What do you want?

598
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:37,960
What did I do?

599
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,580
What right do you have

600
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,900
to choose a future husband for me?

601
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,780
Isn't it reasonable for the brother to select

602
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,580
a future husband for his sister?

603
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,760
I don't need it.

604
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,550
I don't want to be your sister.

605
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
I don't want to be a brother, either.

606
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,400
Chen Musen is not home tonight.

607
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,530
What does that have to do with me?

608
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,570
These are the places you've been to?

609
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,840
Yes.

610
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,380
Then why did you come back in the end?

611
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,110
Maybe because

612
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,590
I heard some kind of summoning.

613
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,140
This...

614
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,060
Isn't this my brooch?

615
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,860
Don't tell me you didn't

616
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,920
notice it till now?

617
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,460
That day,

618
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,770
after you held my hand,

619
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,100
you left in a hurry.

620
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,100
You didn't even know you had dropped your brooch.

621
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
You little fool.

622
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,730
What would you do without me?

623
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,130
-What would you do? -What's wrong with you?

624
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,670
Guangxi.

625
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
My mother is here.

626
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,010
Aunt Lan.

627
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,260
You...

628
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,150
Help me get my shoes up here.

629
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,590
Shoes?

630
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,520
-Shoes! -You...

631
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,380
Then you...

632
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,090
I'll hide.

633
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,850
Mom, I'm coming.

634
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,060
Mom, why are you here?

635
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:03,980
Guangxi.

636
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,750
Give it to me.

637
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,500
I've been knocking

638
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,660
at your door for a long time.

639
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,860
What took you so long?

640
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,020
What were you doing?

641
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,250
I had diarrhea.

642
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,700
Have you taken the medicine?

643
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,860
Yes, I have.

644
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,150
I told you

645
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,710
you can't eat takeout food.

646
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,390
Takeout food is not hygienic.

647
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,190
Look.

648
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,300
There's nothing in the fridge.

649
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,220
I've brought you some food.

650
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,590
I knew you are the best to me.

651
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,700
I'll help you clean up

652
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,100
your room today.

653
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,260
You just focus on your work.

654
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,270
I'll clean the room

655
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,120
by myself.

656
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,560
Your room is quite clean.

657
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,610
Where should I put the clothes?

658
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,320
Hang them in the wardrobe.

659
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,210
Mom.

660
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,600
What's wrong?

661
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,320
I don't keep these

662
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,520
these clothes in the wardrobe now.

663
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,130
I keep them all here.

664
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,570
OK.

665
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,880
You have a friend here?

666
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,150
Chen Musen left

667
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,180
it here just now.

668
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,660
I won't interfere in your privacy.

669
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,740
You're still young.

670
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,400
You should make more friends.

671
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,060
Let me see what other parts

672
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,720
of the room should be cleaned.

673
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,260
Is the bed sheet dirty?

674
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,740
Mom.

675
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,380
How about I change it for you?

676
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,680
Look.

677
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,410
It's very clean.

678
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,550
Don't get worried unnecessarily.

679
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,010
I'm not worried about you.

680
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,760
To be honest,

681
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,380
I'm worried about Ke.

682
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,810
Her mother

683
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,860
passed away early.

684
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,300
She has to

685
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,410
handle everything

686
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,210
for the family all by herself.

687
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,110
She's more mature than her age,

688
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,000
supporting the family silently.

689
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,840
As I see this, it breaks my heart.

690
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,460
Just think about it.

691
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,340
It's such a big deal to have broken up with her boyfriend,

692
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,800
but she doesn't dare to tell her dad about it.

693
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,360
Maybe she is afraid if you know it,

694
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,730
you'll also be worried.

695
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,250
Mom,

696
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,290
Yike is so good.

697
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,660
There must be someone

698
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,810
who likes her very much

699
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,470
and wants to protect her well.

700
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,460
Yes, you're right.

701
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,860
A good man will be blessed.

702
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,920
I believe it.

703
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,980
You little child,

704
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,900
don't always call her Yike.

705
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,500
If others hear you,

706
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,060
they would think you're impolite.

707
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,170
You're the younger brother.

708
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,230
You should call her sister, you know?

709
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,780
Okay.

710
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,640
Mom, I got it.

711
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,430
I won't bother you.

712
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,390
Go back to work.

713
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,340
I'm leaving now.

714
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,590
Mom, let me walk you to the door.

715
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,280
You can come out now.

716
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,990
After so many years,

717
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,340
why is my mom still the same as ever,

718
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,800
doing thing impatiently?

719
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:13,860
Now,

720
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,220
this

721
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,670
secret tree hole

722
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:18,750
is lent to you, too.

723
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Yin Yike, if you want to say anything

724
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,900
just say it.

725
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,850
I'm sorry.

726
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,820
I always have some concerns.

727
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,010
I think this is unfair to you.

728
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,170
You said it.

729
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,250
We still have a lot of time.

730
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,460
There's no rush for the answer.

731
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,130
Besides, I think

732
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,980
you should care about

733
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,380
your own feelings first,

734
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,470
instead of thinking about others.

735
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,370
But isn't it childish?

736
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,580
While you're here with me,

737
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,440
you have infinite rights to be childish.

738
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,060
Laugh and cry whenever you want.

739
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,860
If you want to be selfish, just be selfish.

740
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,300
Yike.

741
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,800
I like you.

742
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,370
I like you

743
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,820
as you're kind to others.

744
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,470
I like you as you're persistent to your dream.

745
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,980
Most importantly,

746
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,300
I like to be with you.

747
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,520
♫Your eyes♫

748
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,880
♫Tell the secrets of life♫

749
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,130
Every moment for us to be together

750
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,300
is very comfortable.

751
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,830
♫Your lips♫

752
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,510

♫Some day♫

754
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,659
I know there are seven years' differences in our age.

755
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,179
♫You'll realize♫

756
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,250

♫In the portrait♫

760
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,360

00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,540
We can be together if you're happy.

764
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,780
If you're unhappy,

765
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,120
I'll keep you company in another way,

766
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,940
making all the bad things around you

767
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,880
become good things.

768
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,000
My dad.

769
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,440
Hello, dad.

770
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,199
Girl.

771
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,380
Are you working overtime again tonight?

772
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,970
I'll go pick you up now.

773
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,250
Dad.

774
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,510
I'm on my way back.

775
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,970
Yes. I'll get home in half an hour.

776
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,220
Bye.

777
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,710
It looks like

778
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,580
the business hours of the tree hole

779
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,260
are over.

780
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,720
Please come again.

781
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,140
I am going home first.

782
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,220
Yike.

783
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:00,860
Don't worry.

784
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,760
We'll face everything

785
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,820
together.

786
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,010
I have to go.

787
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,380
What are you doing here?

788
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,030
I went to the toilet.

789
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,620
What's wrong with you?

790
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,750
You look flustered.

791
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,670
Well...

792
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,850
Go back to sleep.

793
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,180
What's going on recently?

794
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,380
You're acting weird.

795
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,840
[Guangxi]

796
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,710
Just wait.

797
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,450
What are going to show me?

798
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,070
Wait.

799
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,340
I want to see you.

800
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,640
Tell me how much money I should give

801
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,770
so that I can see you?

802
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,960
You need to get a membership card.

803
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,020
Do you provide a permanent membership?

804
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,080
I want to buy it now.

805
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,640
I'm coming.

806
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,530
Time management master.

807
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,940
What did you do just now?

808
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,590
It's not easy to be a woman.

809
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,030
Are you applying a mask?

810
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,900
Let me tell you.

811
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
I finally found a good thing

812
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,230
for seeing other without wearing makeup.

813
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,950
You're pretty whether you wear makeup or not.

814
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,700
You're so sweet, aren't you?

815
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,040
You've already washed up?

816
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,890
What are you doing?

817
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,220
I'm lying down, too.

818
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,270
I'm going to sleep, too.

819
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,990
Antlers.

820
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,740
I think they're

821
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,000
two hearts obviously.

822
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,800
Let me ask you.

823
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,260
In the future,

824
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,700
if I become an old lady,

825
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,140
will you still like me?

826
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,880
So greasy.

827
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,600
Alright. Let's chat for some more time.

828
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,460
Are you sleepy?

829
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,150
♫Travels to the end♫

830
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:13,110
♫Of the whole universe♫

831
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,740

00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,190
♫Guard the whole one world♫

833
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,720
Are you Miss Yin's brother?

834
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,360
Hello.

835
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,570
If you have anything to tell me, just say it.

836
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,570
I'm quite busy.

837
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,250
Here's the thing.

838
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,410
After seeing your photo,

839
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,240
my sister is very satisfied.

840
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,010
But

841
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,550
she is shy.

842
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,680
So she sent me

843
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,120
here to sound you out.

844
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,630
Brother-in-law.

845
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,850
Your sister's appearance

846
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,990
is really good.

847
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,950
However...

848
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,660
Though she's very pretty,

849
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,540
to be honest,

850
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,330
she's a bit old.

851
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,650
Besides, she has a car but no house.

852
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,790
As for me,

853
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,220
maybe my income

854
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,700
is not higher than your sister's.

855
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,140
But I work in a public institution.

856
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,010
Besides, I'm a local resident.

857
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,470
My job and life are stable.

858
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,320
I have both a house and a car.

859
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,620
Most importantly,

860
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,080
in terms of my spiritual outlook,

861
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,970
I'm quite a good match for your sister.

862
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,930
Indeed. Indeed.

863
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,180
And coincidentally,

864
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,040
my sister likes

865
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,260
confident men.

866
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,210
So you must show

867
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,110
your confidence tomorrow,

868
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,780
and tell her

869
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,020
