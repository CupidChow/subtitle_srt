00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,920
to your sister?

176
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,670
Yes.

177
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,920
Did she reply?

178
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,880
Not yet.

179
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,630
I was talking to her about this.

180
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,760
Guangxi.

181
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,710
Answer it.

182
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,300
Guangxi.

183
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,950
What if he hates me?

184
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,780
Are you chickening out, Xia Xiaomian?

185
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,000
Show me the courage you had

186
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,150
with those keyboard warriors.

187
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,100
I can be a coward in front of love.

188
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
What should I do?

189
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,890
Come to my place with me.

190
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,490
My sister...

191
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,180
Wait, wait.

192
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,310
My sister.

193
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,310
What did she say?

194
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,700
Oh no.

195
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,150
Oh no.

196
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,820
I'll make financial amends.

197
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,270
Just pay the loss.

198
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,430
But I have no money.

199
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,270
My sister said she's got the picture.

200
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,210
She asked me to

201
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,410
take good care of you.

202
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,730
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

203
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,460
You scared me.

204
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,830
You prankster.

205
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,380
I knew there's nothing that

206
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,340
can't be solved.

207
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,260
There's nothing to be afraid of.

208
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:27,940
Yes.

209
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,850
Then let's go find

210
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,930
your Guangxi.

211
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:35,990
Let's go, Xia Xiaomian.

212
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,520
Hurry up.

213
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,100
Hurry up. Keep up.

214
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,890
Let's go. Don't be afraid.

215
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,020
We're already here.

216
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,160
Guangxi.

217
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,780
You haven't eaten, have you?

218
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,640
I made noodles for you.

219
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,910
We've just had dinner.

220
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,870
No.

221
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,530
It just occurred to me that I'm still hungry.

222
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,780
I can eat. I can eat.

223
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,540
I can eat it.

224
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,600
I'm starving.

225
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,090
If you are really full,

226
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,690
it's okay.

227
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,390
Don't force yourself.

228
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,140
Then...

229
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,790
Guangxi,

230
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,300
are we still friends?

231
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,600
No.

232
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,420
Aren't we always

233
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,620
master and disciple?

234
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,340
As soon as I find a job,

235
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,870
I'll move out immediately.

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,870
Okay.

237
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,140
Let's not talk about this now.

238
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,500
Eat if you want to.

239
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,610
By the way,

240
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,620
you can leave the housework

241
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,600
to me.

242
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,940
I'll clean it up for you,

243
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,050
tidy and dustless.

244
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,930
Take care of yourself first.

245
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,190
Here, have some water.

246
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,640
Yes.

247
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,130
Yibo is right.

248
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,860
We are not mad at you.

249
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,430
Just take care of yourself.

250
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,660
All right.

251
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,490
Don't mention the past.

252
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,670
Here.

253
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:50,980
Beer.

254
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,380
Look, Guangxi

255
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,460
still cares about you.

256
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,140
He even cooked noodles for you.

257
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,390
As the saying goes,

258
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,010
nothing can't be solved

259
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,240
with a round of beers.

260
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,180
If there is, do another round.

261
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,060
Here.

262
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,580
Cheers,

263
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,980
and let go of our grudges.

264
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,310
Here.

265
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,170
Cheers.

266
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,700
Here.

267
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,300
Propose a toast to Guangxi.

268
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,520
Thank you, Master Guangxi.

269
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,220
Thank you, uncle.

270
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,380
What about me?

271
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,850
Thank you, Yibo.

272
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,980
That's more like it.

273
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,540
I'll get another one.

274
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,210
You...

275
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,640
Cheers.

276
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,980
Cheers.

277
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,180
Wait, wait.

278
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,460
What now?

279
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,990
I think it's bland.

280
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,560
You won't stop complaining, for not enough sugar,

281
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,220
or for not enough coffee.

282
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,280
And now it's bland.

283
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,920
You've adjusted a simple cup of coffee

284
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,350
for three times.

285
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,640
Just tell me if you don't want to go to work.

286
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,290
Why bother wandering around here?

287
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,750
Just change it again.

288
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,540
This is the last time.

289
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,660
Are you sure?

290
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Where is she?

291
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,310
Morning.

292
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,290
Morning, Guangxi.

293
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,380
Espresso double shot.

294
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,090
It's good for waking up in the morning.

295
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,690
Thanks.

296
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,950
Sorry.

297
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,160
It's okay.

298
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,100
Is there something on my face?

299
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,830
Why is it different?

300
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,120
Espresso double shot.

301
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,330
Delicious.

302
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,700
Nice environment.

303
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,630
It's much better

304
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,160
than I imagined.

305
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,620
Yes.

306
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,470
And I think it will be better

307
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,360
after we clean it up a little bit.

308
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,510
Why are you here?

309
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,620
Yike.

310
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,430
Yike.

311
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,130
You've got a new place.

312
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,180
How can you not take us here?

313
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,780
Exactly.

314
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,300
Yike,

315
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,140
we want to learn more

316
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,090
from you.

317
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,510
Let me tell you.

318
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,480
Your reasons are not valid.

319
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,230
I've made up my mind

320
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,140
and gritted

321
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,370
my porcelain teeth which are worth 200,000 yuan

322
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,030
to get here.

323
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,350
Yike, join us.

324
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,940
I'll leave if you don't do it now.

325
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,740
I was exiled to this department.

326
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,680
For your own career prospects,

327
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,260
go back.

328
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,110
Yike.

329
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,930
We've already applied to Ms. Zheng.

330
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,420
And we've already gone through the formalities

331
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,620
in the HR Department.

332
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,700
If you don't want us,

333
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,890
we might have to resign.

334
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,100
And Yike,

335
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,320
we really think highly of

336
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,040
your taste.

337
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,940
Live stream e-commerce mode

338
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,530
is the future Blue Ocean.

339
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,150
Thoughts shape the way out.

340
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,210
You're right.

341
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,260
Kong is ignorant.

342
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,380
But our bomb disposal team

343
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,220
always have an eye ahead.

344
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,020
That's right.

345
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,450
I'm not good at talking.

346
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,460
But I will show you with my actions

347
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,190
and lead you to make a comeback,

348
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,430
and try to double our year-end bonus.

349
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,740

Yes.

363

What is this?

A delicate project proposal.

I'm ordering you as the boss

to take a look.

Boss,

390
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,260
I have a very serious question

391
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,480
to ask.

392
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,480
Go ahead.

393
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,260
Why do you always ask us

394
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,460
to take on these quick-money projects?

395
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,020
Is our company short of money?

396
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,220
Of course not.

No matter judging from which aspect,

400
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,320
it's a rich company.

401
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,060
Then why do you

402
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,450
ask us to take on some stupid projects

403
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,410
again and again?

404
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,830
Honey.

405
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,580
As a company,

406
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,430
we need to think about the return rate.

407
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,900
We need cash flow.

408
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,020
What if you devote yourself

409
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,460
into Fengqi Shendu,

410
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,300

When I joined the company,

414
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,740

How did you put it?

Is there a problem?

418
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,900
The journey to pursue a dream can be very long.

419
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,810
And it's tiring.

420
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,210
You'll be hungry.

422

won't you stop and eat something?

423

488
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860

502
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,660
It's so eye-catching.

503
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,420
It so comfortable to look at.

504
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,130
Girls should know

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,380
how to use their advantages.

506
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,780
Look.

507
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,480
If you dress like that at work,

508
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,380
the promotion and raise

509
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,710
is only a matter of time.

510
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,030

511
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,030
struggle like us?

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,220
I think

517
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,620
the reason why she

518
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,740
can be trusted by the boss

519
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,280
is not only because she's pretty.

520
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,900
More importantly,

521
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,420
she's better at business than you.

522
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,100
It doesn't have much to do

523
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,860
with her looks

524
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,180
and what she wears to work.

525
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,330
Think about wearing the same clothes as her.

526
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,820
If you are the one to wear it,

527
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,700
the scene can't be described in a few words.

528
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,380
As a boss,

529
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,690
I think the top priority of employees

530
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,680
is to do their job well.

531
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,240
Right?

532
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,260
I...

533
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,550
You go first.

534
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,310
Alright.

535
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,170
Forget it.

536
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,290
Button up.

537
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,430
Done.

538
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,990
The bottom.

539
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,500
Thanks, boss.

540
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,670
You're welcome. I'm just passing by.

541
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,760
Miss, I'm wondering

542
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,990
if you have any plans

543
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,180
on that meal you reserved last time.

544
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,940
If you don't have a plan,

545
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,310
I happen to have one.

546
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,240
Morning this weekend.

547
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,460
-First, we can drink... -I don't have time.

548
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,070
Okay.

549
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Could you

550
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,200
add me on WeChat so that we can plan later?

551
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,670
Wait for me.

552
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,550
The old tree is blooming.

553
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,510
Old but vigorous.

554
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,660
Older but still licentious.

555
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,370
You're the only one with a mouth, right?

556
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,900
Don't talk if you don't know how to.

557
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,810
Look at you.

558
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,520
-Hitting me all the time. -Let's go.

559
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,720
Really licentious.

560
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,540
Manager, your coffee.

561
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,360
Ms. Qin.

562
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,750
Miss me?

563
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,880
Of course. We miss you so much.

564
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,060
Don't mention it.

565
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,090
Without you in the Marketing Department,

566
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,220
it's much harder for me

567
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,020
to promote the new product line.

568
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,860
You were implicated because of me.

569
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,940
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

570
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,340
Then I'll have a big meal.

571
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,140
Look at you.

572
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,580
It's unknown how many years you will spend

573
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,180
in the fruitless Live Stream Department.

574
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,200
At this point,

575
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,060
I'm out of the comfort zone.

576
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,360
Maybe it's a new opportunity.

577
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,560
You're quite optimistic at work.

578
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,340
Can you also work harder

579
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,600
on your relationship?

580
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,780
I'm not like you.

581
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,480
You are like you've put money into the love game.

582
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,210
No.

583
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,590
They're just gimmicks.

584
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,380
They are just lustful without courage.

585
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,610
What?

586
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,830
Is there a new gossip?

587
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,070
No, no.

588
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,220
I'm talking about you.

589
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,480
Don't make it about me.

590
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,970
How about

591
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,490
coming to my place tonight?

592
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,550
Switch your taste.

593
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,500
When I went with you last time,

594
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,650
it made my head ache.

595
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,460
I have an appointment with Mengtian tonight.

596
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
She wants to talk about her resignation.

597
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,700
Why did you ask her out?

598
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,030
You should ask a man out.

599
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,090
Enough of that.

600
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,750
Don't worry about me.

601
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,540
I've really had enough.

602
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,930
What are you going to do?

603
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,070
Are you coming tonight or not?

604
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,900
What are you busy with? Dinner?

605
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,800
How should I put it?

606
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,920
Something happened.

607
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,890
What happened?

608
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,020
Something popped up just now.

609
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Business, right?

610
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,200
I have an appointment with Mengtian

611
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,810
to have dinner at the mall next door.

612
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,740
But if you are not in a rush to get off work,

613
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,870
we can meet up for a drink after dinner.

614
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,940
It should be my treat.

615
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,480
Why did you pay again?

616
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,840
And you ordered so much.

617
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,780
Don't mention it.

618
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,500
I heard that it's delicious here.

619
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,300
So I thought I'd bring you here to try it.

620
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,430
Try this cake.

621
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,090
Is it your favorite

622
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,350
that you talked about?

623
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,660
Thank you.

624
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,240
It's delicious.

625
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,120
Yike,

626
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,060
I know you've always

627
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,650
taken care of me at work.

628
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,220
Are you disappointed

629
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,540
about my resignation

630
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,750
and with me?

631
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,060
Just come to me

632
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,990
anytime

633
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,260
if anything happens.

634
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,470
What can possibly happen to me?

635
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,740
We used to work

636
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,940
like fighting battles every day.

637
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,670
I can finally enjoy my life now.

638
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,870
It's comfortable.

639
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,090
That's good.

640
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,180
My child is still little.

641
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,040
I don't want to miss

642
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,220
any second of his growth.

643
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,170
Maybe this kind of slow life

644
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,550
is more suitable for me.

645
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,620
I chose it myself.

646
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,070
I can live it right.

647
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,460
Yes.

648
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,910
You too.

649
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,740
Don't tire yourself out at work.

650
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,480
Think about

651
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,100
your boyfriend's feelings.

652
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,420
It's been so many years.

653
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,690
When are you getting married?

654
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,290
Call me when you get married.

655
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,510
I broke up with him.

656
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,860
You broke up?

657
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,610
I think your boyfriend

658
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,660
is quite good.

659
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,760
Let me tell you.

660
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,490
There are things that we should turn a blind eye to

661
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,730
and let go.

662
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,390
After all, his conditions are great.

663
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,920
You should seize it.

664
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,870
How should I put it?

665
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,360
Maybe I'm just reluctant.

666
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,440
I always want to make it right.

667
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,570
I don't want to regret it

668
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,220
when I think about it in the future.

669
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,270
I think

670
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,640
you're being too idealistic.

671
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,420
Even if you get together with another person,

672
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,100
in the end,

673
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,700
it's still living together.

674
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,160
As women,

675
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,940
the older we become, the greater the risks are.

676
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,680
Try the Chilled Mango Sago Cream with Pomelo.

677
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,740
It is said to be the most popular here.

678
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,320
Mom.

679
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,330
Where have you been?

680
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,580
You didn't watch my grandson at home.

681
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,660
How dangerous it is

682
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,940
to let him be alone with the babysitter, don't you know?

683
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,060
Haven't you watched the news?

684
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,700
Come back quickly.

685
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,420
Mom.

686
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,860
I'm here for my resignation.

687
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,720
I'll be back soon.

688
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,560
I'll be back soon.

689
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,540
I'll call my husband.

690
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,140
Hello.

691
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,220
The subscriber you dialed

692
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,340
is busy.

693
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,980
Please try again later.

694
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,880
Hello, the subscriber you dialed...

695
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,590
Mengtian.

696
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,760
If you have something urgent,

697
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,960
you can go back first.

698
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,550
Family is more important.

699
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,020
Fine.

700
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,320
I've paid the bill.

701
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,860
Enjoy your meal here.

702
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,460
I'll leave you here.

703
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,180
-Go ahead. -I'll treat you some other day.

704
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,660
Okay.

705
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,150
I'm leaving, Yike.

706
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,270
Take care.

707
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,240
Bye.

708
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,170
Call me if anything happens.

709
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:36,660
Okay.

710
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,020
Bye.

711
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,420
Bye.

712
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,540
Baby,

713
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,420
let me tell you.

714
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,550
This place is great.

715
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,500
Why are you only bringing me here now?

716
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,430
You must like it.

717
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,430
My baby.

718
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,630
Don't be angry.

719
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,320
Be good.

720
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:41,980
Baby,

721
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,470
aren't you getting your nails done today?

722
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,790
Nice.

723
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,770
The color

724
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,380
suits your skin.

725
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,740
You won't let me come home with you

726
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,530
or visit you at work.

727
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,070
You don't have broad shoulders,

728
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,530
but you like to intervene.

729
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,330
I don't want a delicate girl like you

730
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,590
to have to work so hard.

731
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,850
Who wants to be idle?

732
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,150
I don't know

733
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,740
how I'll be wandering on the streets

734
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,940
if you dump me one day.

735
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,920
Why would you say this?

736
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,120
I love you so much.

737
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,220
Waiter, please.

738
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,460
Give me the key

739
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,490
to that Maserati.

740
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,450
You're his...?

741
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,820
Do you know what kind of women

742
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,260
in the world is the last one you should mess with?

743
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,740
The wife of a cheater.

744
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:07,980
Let's go to...

745
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,720
What are you doing?

746
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,200
Watch where you're going.

747
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,170
I was looking at my phone.

748
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,670
Watch where you're going.

749
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,580
What's wrong?

750
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:16,980
I just don't like

751
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,940
you people whose eyes are glued to the phone.

752
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,540
Is it wrong to check my phone?

753
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,740
Apologize to me now.

754
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
Why?

755
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,710
Alright, wait here.

756
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,490
Wait.

757
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,940
Didn't you ask me to apologize?

758
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,470
Go ahead.

759
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,680
I'll do it next time.

760
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,340
You...

761
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,870
Let's go.

762
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,490
What's wrong with him?

763
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,420
Sir, calm down.

764
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,260
I'm really sorry.

765
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,000
-Please forgive him. -Alright.

766
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,510
Honey,

767
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,340
I forgot my phone.

768
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,240
I'll go get it.

769
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,630
What are you doing?

770
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,470
Why are you so mysterious?

771
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,020
What were you doing

772
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,900
in his car?

773
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,020
What's wrong, baby?

774
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,920
Are you cheating on me?

775
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,230
Aren't you afraid of breaking your back?

776
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,460
What is this?

777
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:39,930
Baby.

778
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:40,780
Baby.

779
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,800
Baby.

780
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,650
Baby.

781
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,370
It's not what you think.

782
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:45,860
Really?

783
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:47,710
You...

784
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:48,980
You hit me.

785
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,580
Honey,

786
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,710
how could you hit me?

787
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,650
I'm your honey.

788
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,500
Don't lie to me.

789
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,870
Last time when you didn't let me go to your place,

790
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,020
I suspected that you lied to me.

791
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,850
Now I have the evidence.

792
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,230
What else do you have to say?

793
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,940
You scumbag!

794
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,690
You're wasting my youth.

795
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,060
No.

796
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,260
Why are you still hitting me?

797
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,060
Do you think you're blocking it?

798
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,940
Well done.

799
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,480
That's how a scumbag should be treated.

800
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,610
He doesn't want such a beautiful wife.

801
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,860
I think so too.

802
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,490
He deserves to be beaten.

803
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,690
He asked for it.

804
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,350
Why are you here?

805
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,810
Didn't someone say

806
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,330
we'll have dinner together

807
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,990
and have a drink after dinner?

808
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,940
You saw it.

809
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,890
Should I say I didn't see it?

810
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,420
Since you threatened the security,

811
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,100
I didn't see anything.

812
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,320
This is the secret

813
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,980
between us.

814
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,120
Don't tell anyone.

815
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,480
OK?

816
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:40,900
Deal.

817
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,390
Let's go.

818
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,650
Bend your knees slightly.

819
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,770
And let your hands naturally drop.

820
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,220
I see.

821
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,690
What's so hard about that?

822
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,690
Make your hands and the club a whole.

823
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,150
Move it with the strength of the waist.

824
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,130
When we swing,

825
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,680
we can't do it this way

826
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,900
or that way.

827
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,750
What are you doing?

828
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,540
What are you doing, Dad?

829
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,820
So armed at home.

830
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,780
If Zelin asks me to play golf one day,

831
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,890
and I don't know how,

832
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,620
I would embarrass your sister.

833
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,340
My posture just now wasn't right.

834
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,850
I think it's more comfortable like this.

835
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,300
Look.

836
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,130
Isn't this a croquet pose?

837
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,360
What croquet?

838
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,160
It's golf.

839
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,810
Golf...

840
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,790
Look.

841
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,030
-Is it in? -Awesome.

842
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,730
Don't be so nervous.

843
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,990
You are so nervous that

844
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,300
I can't tell who's in a relationship, you

845
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,260
or my sister.

846
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,250
What nonsense are you talking about?

847
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,340
Of course it's your sister.

848
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,960
I...

849
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,860
If your club

850
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,540
hits me,

851
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,460
it will also hurt you in your heart.

852
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,140
And why is it

853
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,680
wearing shoes?

854
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,310
It's new.

855
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,460
What if I break it?

856
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,060
I'm practicing. I don't care about that.

857
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,340
Aren't you studying

858
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,120
in the room?

859
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,760
How many times have you been out this night?

860
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,350
I was just getting some drinks. I'm thirsty.

861
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,380
Okay, hurry up.

862
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,720
Don't hurt your waist.

863
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,670
What are you doing? Old but playful.

864
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,470
I...

865
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,060
I'm practicing.

866
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,700
It's time. Take your medicine.

867
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,820
Hypertension pills.

868
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,220
Hurry.

869
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,780
Turn on the light.

870
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,020
It's dark inside.

871
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:36,660
Why are you

872
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,890
saving electricity?

873
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,730
Glasses.

874
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,110
You are wearing sunglasses.

875
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,100
I forgot.

876
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,870
I forgot.

877
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,430
Your hat.

878
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,320
Open your mouth.

879
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,080
Am I handsome?

880
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,380
Yes.

881
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:54,880
Come on.

882
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,810
Alright.

883
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,760
It's almost time.

884
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,160
It's 10:30. Time to rest.

885
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,750
It's already 10:30.

886
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,530
Why isn't Ke home yet?

887
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,340
It's a rule

888
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,610
to come back home at 10:30.

889
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,199
Why is she getting more and more unruly?

890
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,090
You old man.

891
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,969
You're in charge of everything.

892
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,260
The child has grown up.

893
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,460
Don't worry too much.

894
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,659
Stop playing.

895
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,139
I'm also exercising.

896
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,389
I feel refreshed.

897
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,460
That move just now

898
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,170
has been simulated

899
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,540
in your mind for many times, right?

900
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,310
No.

901
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,300
If it weren't for you,

902
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,460
I almost got caught.

903
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,650
I just think you've watched

904
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,850
too many soap operas.

905
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,110
So the man just now

906
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:38,790
is the one

907
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,020
you showed me before.

908
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,080
The playboy father

909
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,739
who flirts with girls, right?

910
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:44,260
Yes.

911
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,540
I listened to you

912
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,550
and taught him a lesson

913
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,800
to let him suffer.

914
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,900
Shouldn't we be going

915
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,980
for a drink now?

916
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,949
But it's late now.

917
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,830
We have to work tomorrow morning.

918
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,550
We can hurry.

919
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,300
I'll take you to a place.

920
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,660
It can make you nostalgic.

921
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,430
Nostalgic?

922
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,780
Just for a while.

923
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,900
I thought it was demolished.

924
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,180
Watch out. There are stairs.

925
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,550
Do you remember this place?

926
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,660
It's been so many years.

927
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,790
These things are still here.

928
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,890
I didn't expect

929
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,380
the mark was still there.

930
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,540
No wonder I thought

931
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,900
it was familiar

932
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,070
when you drew on the wall of my company.

933
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,010
Your drawing style hasn't changed

934
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,470
since when you were young.

935
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,870
I remember something, too.

936
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,220
The reason why I opened up

937
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,860
this secret area for you

938
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,450
is because when you were little,

939
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,770
your father didn't allow you to go to the Ocean Park

940
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,050
with your classmates.

941
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,350
You felt very wronged.

942
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,580
You wouldn't go home.

943
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,550
What?

944
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,070
That day,

945
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,620
you wanted to come over at night,

946
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,420
but you were afraid of the darkness.

947
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,080
You didn't dare to come alone.

948
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,940
You dragged me

949
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,520
to boost your courage, right?

950
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,810
You could see that?

951
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,430
Thank you, Guangxi.

952
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,620
I didn't expect that the one who I thought

953
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,480
was just doodling in our childhood

954
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,610
can now make a living

955
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,360
by it.

956
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,700
If you want to thank something, thank the earth for being round.

957
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,500
I draw while walking,

958
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,700
and finally get back to the beginning.

959
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,360
But what a coincidence.

960
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,910
You're still here.

961
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,700
It's nice.

962
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,420
Let me kiss you.

963
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,600
No, you're so annoying.

964
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,150
I miss you so much.

965
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,380
It's not appropriate for a young girl.

966
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,260
What?

967
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,460
I'm over 30 years old.

968
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,720
I've seen everything.

969
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,190
What's that sound?

970
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,540
I'm scared. Let's go.

971
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,010
Let's go.

972
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,740
All right.

973
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,450
I'm here.

974
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,320
You are guarding

975
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,710
my secret base.

976
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,550
I just suddenly found

977
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,590
my wolf teammate.

978
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,420
It's dawn, couples run.

979
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,010
I didn't expect someone will be here

980
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,030
at this hour.

981
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,900
It's normal.

982
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:18,460
At night,

983
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,090
there are many couples here.

984
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,580
You know it so well.

985
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,220
You must have brought many girls

986
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,700
here.

987
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,900
In all honesty,

988
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,730
you are the only girl

989
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,060
I've ever brought here.

990
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:32,790
Let's go.

991
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,000
Step on the gas.

992
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,300
Yike, look.

993
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,310
Yike.

994
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,470
Yike.

995
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,380
Why are you unhappy?

996
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,830
I'm fine.

997
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:06,750
Yibo said

998
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,160
you went to

999
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,150
visit the aquarium today.

1000
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,420
Wasn't it fun?

1001
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,340
My dad

1002
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,100
didn't let me go.

1003
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,330
He said these extracurricular activities

1004
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,300
is a waste of money and will mess up my study.

1005
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:17,830
But

1006
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,140
I've promised my classmates.

1007
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,330
If this goes on,

1008
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,880
I'll lose my friends.

1009
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,800
Yike, it's okay.

1010
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,600
I can be your friend.

1011
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,690
I can take you to the aquarium.

1012
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,210
Really?

1013
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,570
♫Can't suppress♫

1014

1042
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,120
♫I just feel it too♫

1043
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:03,000
♫It's like the coffee with full caramel milk foam♫

1044
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:08,150
♫The air has the fragrance of missing you♫

1045
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,340
♫Baby, from now on, come to me♫

00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,390
♫Come to me♫

1047
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,790
♫I want to be an umbrella for you♫

1048
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,240
♫To shield you from rain and wind♫

1049
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,320
♫You are my luck♫

1050
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,690
♫I'm like an ice-cream beneath the sun♫

1051
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,910
♫Melt my heart into love♫

1052
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,860
♫Baby, from now on, come to me♫
