00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,020
Hello?

17
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,940
Hello? Why are you running?

18
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,650
Where are you?

19
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,039
Why don't I see you?

20
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,060
Look to your left.

21
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,060
I want to be the first

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,180
who cheers for you.

Hello, auntie.

26
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,070
Yike.

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,550
Please save Zelin.

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,890
Zelin?

29
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,639
Yike.

30
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,340
I want to ask you for a favor.

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,100
Zelin...

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,450
Zelin went to the hospital some time ago

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,850
because of his headache.

34
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,650
The doctor said

35
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,260
he was diagnosed

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,500
with glioma.

37
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,560
Even if he was cured,

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,820
there would be sequelae.

39
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,980
But Zelin's self-esteem

40
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,050
is too high.

41
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,040
He's unwilling

42
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,410
to cooperate with the treatment.

43
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,260
He's been in a bad mood in the hospital.

44
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,030
Instead, he wanted to die.

45
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,110
His father and I are

46
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,500

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,780
Can you

48
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,960
help me persuade him

49
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,620
for the sake of your past relationship?

50
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,290
Auntie.

51
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,160
But Zelin and I have broken up.

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,590
Ke.

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,900
It's not convenient.

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,350
I'm begging you.

55
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,570
OK.

56
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,900
Let me think.

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,210
Tell me what you think about first.

58
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,550
Everything came so suddenly.

59
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,740
How can a person

60
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,460
get a serious illness

61
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,780
so suddenly?

62
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,420
No matter what happened,

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,690
I've known him

64
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,890
for many years after all.

65
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,490
So you want to see him, right?

66
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,910
I'm not sure.

67
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,420
Are you worried about my feelings?

68
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,370
From my point of view,

69
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,290
I think his mother

70
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,890
imposed her morality on you.

71
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,440
And no matter what,

72
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,780
he was the one

73
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,950
who hurt you before.

74
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,710
Your life was endangered.

75
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,020
So you still think

76
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,050
I shouldn't go,

77
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,170
right?

78
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,940
But I don't want you

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
to be in a dilemma.

80
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,280
I know you too well.

81
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,820
Even if he was a stranger,

82
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,700
you would give him the greatest kindness.

83
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,730
Just like now.

84
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,870
If I don't let you go,

85
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,380
you'll definitely

86
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,810
keep thinking about this

87
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,200
and blaming yourself.

88
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,580
So I think

89
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,940
my feelings

90
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,209
and his mother's words

91
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,380
can't be the excuses

92
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,110
to force you to make a decision.

93
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,480
If you don't want to go,

94
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,400
I won't let anyone

95
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,020
force you to make a decision.

96
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,600
If you want to go,

97
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,530
I'll face it with you.

98
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,370
Hello.

99
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,810
Which hospital room

100
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,740
Li Zelin is in?

101
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,490
The last room.

102
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,680
You go in.

103
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,740
If there's an emergency,

104
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,870
remember to call me.

105
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,390
Okay.

106
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,660
See you later.

107
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,650
Transfer projects.

108
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,860
Rest temporarily.

109
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,650
Well said.

110
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,160
You want me to be a figurehead, right?

111
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,780
Mr. Li.

112
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,580
We're worried about your health.

113
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,980
We hope you can rest well.

114
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,990
You can come back

115
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,100
after you recover.

116
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,260
I know you applied

117
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,380
to work with Zhang

118
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,760
as soon as I became ill.

119
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,550
I didn't expect you

120
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,340
to be

121
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,870
such an ungrateful person.

122
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,470
Mr. Li.

123
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,420
I've worked with you for a long time.

124
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,909
I don't want to hurt you.

125
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,180
We're working in a law firm.

126
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,940
There are

127
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,409
new employees every day.

128
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,860
The past credit is not our protective umbrella.

129
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,570
The only criterion for staying is the winning percentage.

130
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,860
You've been in the firm longer than me.

131
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,190
You must know it better.

132
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,500
Take care.

133
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,150
Why are you here?

134
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,690
I'm here to bring you some fruit.

135
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,150
Are you here to laugh at me?

136
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,540
I am

137
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,860
half-dead now.

138
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,190
You and your younger boyfriend

139
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,310
must be happy.

140
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,120
Li Zelin.

141
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,810
You don't have to say that.

142
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,920
What should I say?

143
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,300
Should I say your Mother Teresa complex

144
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,159
let you persuade me to be treated?

145
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,790
Even if I recovered, then what?

146
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,700
I have nothing now.

147
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,630
Yin Yike, let me tell you.

148
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,530
I've worked hard in the law firm

149
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,550
for so many years.

150
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,820
In order to keep the winning percentage,

151
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,780
I took all the cases

152
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,810
that others didn't want to take.

153
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,740
I did all the work that were tiring.

154
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,860
I worked hard.

155
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,380
It was not easy for me

156
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,840
to achieve this position.

157
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,550
But

158
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,460
my illness

159
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,500
brought me to the bottom.

160
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,400
Those incompetent people

161
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,080
took my place.

162
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,410
And they said

163
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,150
all my efforts were in vain.

164
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,680
Everything is just a joke.

165
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,380
Li Zelin.

166
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,660
Think about those

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,220
who kicked you when you were down.

168
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,060
They must be happy

169
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,860
to see you

170
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,240
like this.

171
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,350
So the only thing you can do now

172
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,640
is to be treated.

173
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,040
Use your ability

174
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,630
to teach them a lesson.

175
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,810
Enough, Yin Yike.

176
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,820
It's my business whether I'll receive treatment or not.

177
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,350
It's none of your business.

178
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,260
You think talking to me like this

179
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,760
is awesome, don't you?

180
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,920
I think you're scared.

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,940
Everyone knows

182
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,080
giving up is the easiest thing

183
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,120
in this world.

184
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,180
You gave up without even trying.

185
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,640
You're too weak.

186
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,300
Your mom called me.

187
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,830
Many people

188
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,750
care about you.

189
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
Hello, darlings.

190
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,230
Welcome to SC's So Good Live Room.

191
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,500
I'm still

192
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,929
your sweet live streamer, Little Xiaomian.

193
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,770
This is today's

194
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,140
first extra live stream.

195
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,860
But I'll be with you

196
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,100
every night

197
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,950
that follows.

198
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,850
I'll recommend more

199
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,580
good fragrances to you.

200
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,620
Xia Xiaomian.

201
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,850
Why is she still livestreaming at this hour?

202
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,700
So it's very suitable

203
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,660
to be sent to your friends as a gift.

204
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,430
If you want it, please order it.

205
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,740
Don't miss it.

206
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,340
Your hairstyle

207
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,300
is very stylish.

208
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,380
You changed your hairstyle?

209
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,740
Did you break up with someone?

210
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,180
Darlings.

211
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,420
Breakup?

212
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,220
Don't mention

213
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,310
my sad memory.

214
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,830
I broke up with someone indeed.

215
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,590
But

216
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,310
after being hurt by love,

217
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,870
I finally saw

218
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,060
the path of life.

219
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,790
Boyfriends are temporary.

220
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,790
Darlings are eternal.

221
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,350
So I've decided

222
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,860
to focus on my career.

223
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,780
I hope you

224
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,230
can support me.

225
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,060
OK.

226
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,610
Let's see the next product.

227
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,470
You were hurt by love?

228
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,660
Breakup?

229
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,920
Xia Xiaomian, what's wrong?

230
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,210
She's been acting weird lately.

231
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,900
Roadside stall?

232
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,210
Okay, wait a moment.

233
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,570
Waiter. Beer.

234
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,690
Young man.

235
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,560
It's you.

236
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,320
Hello, boss.

237
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,370
You still remember me?

238
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,380
Yes.

239
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,280
Your girlfriend isn't here today?

240
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,380
Girlfriend?

241
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,650
The one that day.

242
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,420
She's not my girlfriend.

243
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,740
She's just my female friend.

244
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,620
She's not your girlfriend?

245
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,420
No, she isn't.

246
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,260
Nowadays kids

247
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,420
are too open.

248
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,900
She's not your girlfriend.

249
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,360
But you kissed so happily.

250
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:34,850
Kiss?

251
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:35,780
Dude.

252
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,300
You kissed well yesterday.

253
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,100
They scored a goal when you kissed.

254
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,690
Right.

255
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,460
Goal!

256
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,130
Again!

257
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,650
Dude, cheers.

258
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,100
Good.

259
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,140
Young man, you're lucky.

260
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,710
Boss,

261
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,620
we were discussing

262
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,260
whether our child

263
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,700
would study abroad

264
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,900
or study in Shanghai.

265
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,140
I look forward to hearing the patter of tiny feet.

266
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,430
When is your wedding banquet?

267
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,570
Come to my place for the banquet.

268
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,500
I'll give you 50 percent off.

269
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,800
Thank you, boss.

270
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,960
Who is married?

271
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,940
I'll propose another toast to him.

272
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,140
Happy wedding!

273
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,740
When will your girlfriend

274
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,810
come today?

275
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,580
-Right. -The game is about to start.

276
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,980
When will she come today?

277
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,050
I...

278
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,860
I'm sorry. You mistook me for someone else.

279
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,740
Don't go.

280
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,310
OK. If you want it,

281
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,500
please order it now.

282
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,420
That's all

283
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,680
for today's products.

284
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,130
See you tomorrow.

285
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,950
Bye.

286
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,990
Sorry, Xiaomian.

287
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,740
I was drunk that night.

288
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,310
Anyway, he thought

289
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,190
his illness

290
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,180
has taken away everything

291
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,850
he had

292
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,810
by hard working.

293
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,060
And he was

294
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,020
too emotional.

295
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,090
He didn't listen

296
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,220
to what I said to him.

297
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,140
You can persuade him

298
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,240
when he calms down.

299
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,700
Guangxi.

300
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,480
Are you unhappy?

301
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,350
Because I know

302
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,560
you're doing the right thing.

303
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,580
I support you.

304
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,730
Can you promise me

305
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,570
one thing?

306
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,000
This is a power bank.

307
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,870
From now on, when you're outside,

308
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,400
your phone must have power.

309
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,100
I need to contact you anytime

310
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,170
so that I can be relieved.

311
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,140
So this is for me.

312
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,260
Guangxi.

313
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,290
Thank you for always supporting me

314
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,350
unconditionally.

315
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,120
This is my super power.

316
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,260
I can make all bad things better.

317
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,940
Can your super power

318
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,680
let me make a wish now?

319
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,750
I'm so hungry.

320
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,430
I want to eat a bowl of noodles.

321
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,740
What noodles do you want?

322
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,180
The noodles you make.

323
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,100
Okay, boss.

324
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,380
You stayed up too late.

325
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,880
I don't want to wake you up.

326
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,590
I'll go to the hospital and try again.

327
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,950
I've brought the power bank.

328
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,880
See you tonight.

329
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,980
Although the operation is risky,

330
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,820
I suggest

331
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,410
you have the operation as soon as possible.

332
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,780
Think about those

333
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,070
who kicked you when you were down.

334
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,610
They must be happy

335
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,690
to see you

336
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,260
like this.

337
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,280
So the only thing you can do now

338
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,520
is to be treated.

339
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,940
Use your ability

340
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,560
to teach them a lesson.

341
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,230
Why are you here?

342
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,240
I've told you.

343
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,580
It's my business whether I'll receive treatment or not.

344
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,110
It's none of your business.

345
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,390
I'm not here

346
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,180
to talk about

347
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,880
whether you'll receive treatment or not.

348
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,540
I want to ask you

349
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,490
for a favor.

350
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
Here's the thing.

351
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,220
I have a friend.

352
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,620
His father is in trouble.

353
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,670
He asked me to find a lawyer for him.

354
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,500
After thinking about it,

355
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,260
the only lawyer I know

356
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,140
is you.

357
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,320
So I came to consult you.

358
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,830
My friend's father

359
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,750
was riding an e-bike

360
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,740
on his way to deliver.

361
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,170
He was rear-ended by a car behind him.

362
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,700
He fell down and got hurt.

363
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,540
He was hospitalized with a fracture.

364
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,800
He spent a lot of money.

365
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,290
He hasn't been able to work for a long time.

366
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,980
But when he applied

367
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,100
for compensation,

368
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,760
he found that he had no

369
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,540
labor agreement with his company.

370
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,319
His company didn't pay

371
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,020
social insurance for him either.

372
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,329
So he got into trouble.

373
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
But now,

374
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,740
his labor relations

375
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,700
have been confirmed

376
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,099
through labor arbitration.

377
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,569
His company didn't admit it

378
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,530
and wanted to appeal.

379
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,780
They're waiting for the court to handle it.

380
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,619
But my uncle

381
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,500
can't wait.

382
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,450
Tell me

383
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,190
what should they do now?

384
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,010
Ask the employer to pay social insurance.

385
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,670
The insurance will cover the medical expenses.

386
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,200
There's no need to appeal.

387
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,930
It's a good idea.

388
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,410
Just hire a lawyer.

389
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,260
Don't you think

390
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,520
this case is familiar?

391
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,500
They hired a lawyer.

392
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,160
That lawyer is you.

393
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:00,940
Your mother

394
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,200
gave me this document.

395
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,280
She said you cared about this case.

396
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,220
Because this was the first case

397
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,220
you won.

398
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,910
Everything you have

399
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,330
started here.

400
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,820
Zelin.

401
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,870
I remember

402
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,780
when you first met me,

403
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,680
you told me

404
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,800
lawyers

405
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,300
didn't just

406
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,340
make money

407
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,150
and that you would

408
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,150
take every case seriously

409
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,340
and be responsible for everyone

410
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,340
because each case

411
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,830
would influence other people's life.

412
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,960
Think about

413
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,250
how happy you were

414
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,300
when you won each case.

415
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:49,740
Right.

416
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,950
When did I start to change?

417
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,450
I only cared about money, fame and fortune.

418
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,310
I forgot my original aspiration.

419
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,090
It's not too late for you to know.

420
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,410
You can still find your original aspiration.

421
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,140
This is the real reason

422
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,540
why I came to you today.

423
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,100
But they probably can't

424
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,230
give you much money.

425
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,090
Consider whether you'll accept it.

426
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,660
How do I accept it?

427
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,010
I might have 50 percent chance of

428
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,140
not being able to walk

429
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,120
and see

430
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,100
and becoming stupid.

431
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,540
Think about the other 50 percent chance

432
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,140
of being who you were before.

433
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,060
Zelin.

434
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,510
Your life

435
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,070
doesn't only belong to you.

436
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,000
You have your parents.

437
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,180
They worked hard

438
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,350
and helped you become a lawyer.

439
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,220
I'm sure they don't want

440
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,350
to see you like this.

441
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,580
You'd better receive treatment

442
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
and get well soon.

443
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,580
There are still many people

444
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,640
who need your help.

445
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,750
You're not the same as before.

446
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,690
Maybe I've changed.

447
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,260
In the past,

448
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:41,980
I was afraid

449
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,070
of doing anything,

450
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,170
but now I'm confident

451
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,180
in being myself.

452
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,980
Consider

453
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,790
whether you'll accept it.

454
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,950
Rest early.

455
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,380
What a coincidence!

456
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,480
We meet again here.

457
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,090
Is this for me?

458
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,550
Thanks.

459
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,590
It's not for you.

460
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,220
Musen and Guangxi

461
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,090
are working overtime upstairs.

462
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,690
I bought the coffee for them.

463
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,090
You look sleepy.

464
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,790
I've been too busy lately. I didn't rest well.

465
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,580
Here.

466
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,310
One cup is enough for me.

467
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,450
Hold them for me.

468
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,410
This is for you.

469
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,330
Chrysanthemum tea.

470
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,230
It's mainly because

471
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,320
you really need

472
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,820
to nurture your health.

473
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,470
You always stayed up

474
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,380
too late.

475
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,830
Coffee can't

476
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,980
help you anymore.

477
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,700
You need to nurse yourself with the help of traditional Chinese medicine.

478
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,110
Chrysanthemum tea

479
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,870
is very good.

480
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,090
It'll benefit your eyesight, qi and blood.

481
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,740
Here you go. Thank you.

482
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,770
No.

483
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,260
Am I at the age

484
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,610
when people should nurture their health?

485
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,140
It's better to start early.

486
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,860
All right.

487
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,560
Thanks.

488
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,530
I heard that

489
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,680
you won the Valuation Adjustment, right?

490
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,440
How about we treat you to a meal

491
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,660
and celebrate it for you?

492
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,100
That's the matter for Yike's department.

493
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,630
Besides,

494
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,020
we've already celebrated.

495
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,400
We have a project

496
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,010
which has been submitted.

497
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,180
Why don't you celebrate it

498
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,770
for us?

499
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,690
Congratulations.

500
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,780
But I don't think there's a need

501
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,710
to celebrate it.

502
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,180
I need to nurture my health.

503
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,430
You can't have dinner.

504
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,830
Actually, lunch is fine.

505
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,690
Are you still working overtime?

506
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,490
How long will it take?

507
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,260
I still need some time.

508
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,920
Don't wait for me. Rest early.

509
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,980
You're back.

510
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,420
I'm so sleepy.

511
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,550
I'm going to bed.

512
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,560
Good night.

513
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,840
Yike.

514
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:11,830
Can you

515
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,590
come to the hospital tomorrow?

516
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,040
You must finish it.

517
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,850
You'll sign the contract successfully tomorrow.

518
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,030
The weather is so nice today.

519
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,000
Mr. Xiao.

520
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,860
You're doing a roaring trade?

521
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,280
Yes.

522
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,400
Have some.

523
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,960
Jin Lan made noodles for me.

524
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,900
She made noodles.

525
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,420
We don't eat anything casually outside.

526
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,170
Next time.

527
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,260
Aunt Li.

528
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,090
Good morning.

529
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,900
Good morning.

530
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,160
So cute.

531
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,070
Be good, Nan Nan.

532
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,170
You...

533
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,960
You look more and more like it.

534
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,980
Nonsense.

535
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,030
Owners

536
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,990
look more and more like their dogs.

537
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,060
So cute.

538
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,380
So cute.

539
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,740
Let's raise a dog in the future.

540
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,880
You can walk it.

541
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,990
OK.

542
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,280
It'll look more and more like you.

543
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,460
What are you talking about?

544
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,290
Who are you talking about?

545
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:57,780
I...

546
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,690
You know that, right?

547
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,250
What's wrong?

548
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,180
The stupid chess player

549
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,390
is playing chess here again.

550
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,420
-His daughter is in a relationship -I'll give him some advice.

551
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,550
with his wife's son.

552
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
Is it that lawyer?

553
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,340
Right.

554
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,540
Isn't she in a relationship

555
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,080
with that lawyer?

556
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,290
They broke up

557
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,220
because they're not suitable for each other.

558
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,940
And she immediately

559
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,600
started a relationship

560
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,710
with her younger brother

561
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,330
who just came back.

562
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,500
If word gets out,

563
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,940
their reputation will be ruined.

564
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,790
Right.

565
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,920
You all grew up by a beach?

566
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,300
You're so nosy.

567
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,030
My daughter

568
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,970
can be with whoever she wants.

569
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,050
She's happy.

570
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,070
It's none of your business.

571
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:33,710
Yin,

572
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,900
we said it

573
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,420
for your own good.

574
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,500
If they broke up,

575
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,970
how would you get along?

576
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,900
Thank you.

577
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,910
One is

578
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,820
Jin Lan's son.

579
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,070
One is my daughter.

580
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,530
It's the icing on the cake.

581
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,640
Mind your own business.

582
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,060
How ungrateful you are!

583
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,340
Right. You're really ungrateful.

584
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,580
Whether my daughter lives well or not

585
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
is our own business.

586
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,540
It's none of your business.

587
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,340
All right. Let's go.

588
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,800
I won't let you play chess.

589
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,740
I won't let you play chess.

590
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,390
Yin.

591
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,330
What are you doing?

592
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,860
-Jin Lan, look. -Let me tell you.

593
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,740
If anyone dares to talk about my daughter again,

594
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,000
I'll be angry with you.

595
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,540
-Jin Lan, look at your husband. -You gossiped first.

596
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,100
What's wrong with you, Yin?

597
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,130
No one is allowed to talk about my daughter.

598
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,040
I've signed the document.

599
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,490
Thank you, Zelin.

600
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,800
You'll get better.

601
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,310
Yike.

602
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:36,790
Actually,

603
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,950
I owe you an apology.

604
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,960
I was too arrogant before.

605
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,010
I thought what I did

606
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,730
gave you the best.

607
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,700
I've never heard about

608
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,830
your true feelings.

609
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,220
I didn't cherish you.

610
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,090
I missed you.

611
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,650
Don't think too much.

612
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,180
I don't mean anything else.

613
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,570
Seeing you like this,

614
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,180
I'm really happy for you.

615
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,820
I hope

616
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,770
we can still be friends.

617
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:06,920
No problem.

618
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,010
I also hope you can get better.

619
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,800
I have good news for you.

620
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,890
Your current indicators are normal.

621
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,940
In the next few days,

622
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,360
you need to eat light food

623
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,140
and have a pleasant mood.

624
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,100
The operation

625
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,660
is scheduled for the morning after tomorrow.

626
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,100
Later,

627
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,680
I'll give you a preoperative check-up.

628
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,010
Please pay the bill first, family member.

629
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,960
Thank you, doctor.

630
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,750
It's okay.

631
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,540
Don't worry.

632
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,940
We will do our best.

633
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,170
Aunt is not here.

634
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,570
I'll pay the bill for you.

635
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,350
Don't worry too much.

636
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,740
The doctor said

637
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,970
you must relax.

638
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,130
The operation will be a success.

639
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,590
Thank you.

640
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,220
You're welcome.

641
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,690
Guys,

642
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,160
we don't have to sell our souls

643
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,220
for our career anymore.

644
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,490
Let happiness come more fiercely!

645
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,920
Be happy.

646
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,420
It's a signing ceremony.

647
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,460
I always thought

648
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,670
our plan would fail.

649
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,970
I didn't expect

650
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,260
we could handle

651
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,890
Mr. Xie.

652
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,920
Mr. Xie is not capable.

653
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,640
But don't you think everything

654
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,700
goes too smoothly?

655
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,610
It's because we have talent,

656
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,450
ability and methods.

657
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,180
You know?

658
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,340
Because we used a right method.

659
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,220
Look at Mr. Xie.

660
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,880
He kept calling me

661
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,420
and pushing me.

662
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,550
I was not in a hurry.

663
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,530
When the film is released,

664
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,390
all of you

665
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,940
will become famous director,

666
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,010
famous scriptwriter,

667
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,110
famous animator,

668
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,600
and famous post producer.

669
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,030
I...

670
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,920
I'll count money

671
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,150
alone at home.

672
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,160
It's good.

673
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,880
Baba.

674
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,830
Oh no, Baba.

675
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,640
Look.

676
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,550
What's wrong?

677
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,390
What's going on?

678
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,570
The worldviews, characters and styles

679
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,460
are the same

680
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,550
as those in Shendu.

681
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,410
It was made by Mars Animation.

682
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,660
What the hell is this?

683
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,340
Wait a minute.

684
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,270
I'll make a call.

685
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,380
Hello, everyone.

686
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,790
I'm the legal director

687
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,850
of Mars Animation.

688
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,630
Today,

689
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,790
on behalf of Mr. Xie,

690
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,110
I'm here to sign a contract.

691
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,700
Didn't we agree on

692
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,870
a contract?

693
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,560
Why did you bring another one?

694
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,160
You still want to buy the copyright?

695
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,640
Mr. Xie said

696
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,030
your company's core originality is good.

697
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,430
But your qualifications are limited.

698
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,420
Of course,

699
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,450
Mr. Xie

700
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,580
is very appreciative

701
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,220
of your attitude

702
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,700
to this creation.

703
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:01,820
So,

704
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,650
the terms of this contract

705
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,850
are the compensation for your hard work.

706
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,720
If the quality was really bad,

707
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,200
why would you still use it?

708
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,280
You wanted to buy it before plagiarism.

709
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,610
Now you want to plagiarize before buying it.

710
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,380
Right.

711
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,190
This is our company's

712
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,280
business content.

713
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,490
We...

714
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,420
We can sue you for this.

715
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,970
We'll sue you.

716
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,650
Okay.

717
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,540
Welcome.

718
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,010
But from a professional point of view,

719
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,500
I have to remind you

720
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,860
that cases about intellectual property

721
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,220
are time-consuming and difficult.

722
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,720
Our company has a professional

723
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,650
legal team.

724
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,070
What about you?

725
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,950
So the terms

726
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,980
of this contract

727
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,970
are your best choice.

728
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,780
You are eager

729
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,020
to buy the copyright

730
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,510
and are determined

731
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,140
to get our core originality.

732
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,220
You want to force us to admit it, right?

733
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,740
Your problem

734
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,620
is not within my authority.

735
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,230
So I have nothing to say.

736
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,270
You don't admit?

737
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
Believe it or not.

738
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,680
-I'll hit you until you can't find your teeth. -Chen Musen. Chen Musen.

739
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,160
Enough!

740
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,970
Please tell Mr. Xie

741
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,630
I will do everything I can

742
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,890
to protect the benefit of my team.

743
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,540
I won't forget

744
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,840
what he did.

745
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,130
Tell him to be careful.

746
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,650
I'll tell him.

747
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,100
But I also keep the right

748
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,290
to sue you for insults.

749
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:34,870
You...

750
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,770
What should we do next?

751
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,130
Everyone has

752
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,530
reasonable explanations

753
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,390
for copyright.

754
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,780
It's hard to decide

755
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,740
who owns it.

756
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,080
So we have no chance of winning?

757
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,140
We have to sue them.

758
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,630
We must let them pay the price.

759
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,400
Sue them!

760
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,250
Enough. Stop shouting.

761
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,520
What's there to shout?

762
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,660
We'll cross that bridge

763
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,940
when we come to it.

764
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,500
There will be a way.

765
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,560
There will be a way.

766
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,490
Don't pull a long face.

767
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,860
It doesn't matter.

768
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,070
It's not a big deal.

769
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,310
Your salary will be paid.

770
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,020
Your salary will be paid.

771
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,020
Live your life.

772
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,990
I'll find a way.

773
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,960
Hello, I want to pay the bill.

774
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,560
Hello. Please wait a moment.

775
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,410
Thank you.

776
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,510
Director Xu, congratulations on the contract.

777
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,810
I might be held up.

778
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,100
We can celebrate it while having supper.

779
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,060
Hello, please sign here.

780
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,300
Thank you.

781
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,590
Dad Chen.

782
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,960
You don't have to send me home.

783
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:13,989
Guangxi.

784
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,429
I'm sorry

785
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,929
for what happened today.

786
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,560
I'm fine.

787
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,199
No.

788
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
I was so shameless

789
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,889
to let you work with me,

790
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,510
right?

791
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,469
We agreed to have a dream together.

792
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,090
But it turned out like this.

793
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,100
I really feel bad

794
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,870
about it.

795
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,780
I think I'm incompetent

796
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,100
as a boss.

797
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,880
What I said

798
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,060
really became a pie in the sky.

799
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,750
Dad Chen.

800
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,179
I said it's fine.

801
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,739
I

802
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,210
haven't been in the industry for long,

803
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,500
but I know

804
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,920
some projects

805
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,929
are doomed to failure.

806
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,180
Young man, don't be sad.

807
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,090
If you have feelings,

808
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,780
vent them.

809
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,600
Do you hear me?

810
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,120
What you said just now

811
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,010
not only applies to young people.

812
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,950
It applies to everyone.

813
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,230
You're a kid.

814
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,700
Who taught you that?

815
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,220
Why are you here?

816
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:53,250
[Longtangkou Grocery]

817
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,510
It seems

818
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,400
that we're in the same boat today.

819
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,560
There's nothing to eat and drink.

820
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,340
How about I let you

821
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,270
see my drawings?

822
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,220
This

823
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,690
is the project we worked hard on

824
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,860
for three months.

825
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,810
Sometimes,

826
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,220
life is like this.

827
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,270
Hope

828
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,100
may only bring disappointment.

829
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,710
But it's all over now.

830
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,280
Bye.

831
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,390
You're back.

832
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,910
Why are you home?

833
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,580
You said you'd come back late.

834
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,640
Because I missed you.

835
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,220
So you knew it?

836
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,300
I called Dad Chen.

837
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,140
But I didn't expect

838
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
that I heard

839
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,440
your affair

840
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,600
from a third person.

841
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,300
I'm sorry.

842
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,970
I picked them up for you this time.

843
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,570
Don't throw them away again.

844
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,200
Have a seat.

845
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,140
I still remember

846
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,460
when you showed me your drafts

847
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,580
for the first time,

848
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,340
you told me

849
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,130
this was the difference between dreams

850
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,860
and reality.

851
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,900
Praise

852
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,620
might be caused by kneeling.

853
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,350
If people want to have dignity,

854
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,820
they might be suppressed

855
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,710
and can only keep their work for themselves.

856
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,030
Isn't it childish?

857
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,250
No.

858
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,900
I remember you said

859
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,850
you would choose to stand

860
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,840
and keep your dignity.

861
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,510
Actually, I know

862
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,860
in this world,

863
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,090
being tactful

864
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,760
and drifting with the tide

865
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,130
are the easiest way

866
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,420
to adapt to this world.

867
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,820
But after getting hurt,

868
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,830
you can still be sincere

869
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,610
and kind.

870
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,380
You're really mentally strong.

871
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,350
That's also what makes you different.

872
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,700
It's okay.

873
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,290
You've been busy lately.

874
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,710
You still take care of my feelings.

875
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,090
Let me tell you a piece of good news.

876
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,570
Li Zelin

877
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,450
is willing to receive treatment.

878
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,240
So from now on,

879
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,590
I can keep you company.

880
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,420
Let's eat.

881
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:09,990
This

882
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,290
is a feast of eggs

883
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,790
I prepared for you.

884
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,230
Aren't you going to introduce them?

885
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:18,810
This

886
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,700
is fried eggs with green peppers.

887
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,050
If you eat it,

888
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,960
all the bad energy will be gone.

889
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,120
This is my favorite.

890
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,280
Fried eggs with tomatoes.

891
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,830
This

892
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,060
is fried Yike with Guangxi.

893
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,500
Drawn-out.
