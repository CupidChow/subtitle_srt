become a kindergarten style again?

What I'm looking forward to

34
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,579
is also sexy pajamas.

35
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,850
Why didn't you tell me when you woke up?

36
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,250
Were you eavesdropping?

37
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,340
No.

38
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,340
I just want to see

39
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,940
what evil thoughts you have.

What evil thoughts can I have?

41
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,260
It's Chen Musen's fault.

42
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,590
The RV doesn't play much of a role either.

I'm quite satisfied.

44

You are so sweet.

47
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,260
This place has bad feng shui.

48
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,790
I'll leave first. You stay.

49
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,140
Did I miss

50
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,290
an important plot?

51
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,100
I think I'm

52
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,860
in bad luck.

53
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,300
He stood me up twice.

54
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,980
It was a huge mistake in life.

55
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,840
Dad Chen wouldn't have done that.

56
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,660
That's right. It's such a good opportunity.

57
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,130
Why did he stand Yiran up?

58
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,899
I can only tell you that Dad Chen's secret

59
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,230
can be guessed by no one.

60
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,220
What secret does Dad Chen have?

61
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,980
I don't know.

62
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,440
You don't know.

63
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,790
Really?

64
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,180
Yes.

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,510
Anyway,

66
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,780
I'll definitely stand by my friend.

67
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,270
However,

68
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,830
Dad Chen who ran away

69
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,860
and heartless Yiran

70
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,659
seem to have matched each other.

71
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,860
Who should this Sleeping Beauty

72
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,620
be matched with?

73
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,630
Sleeping Beauty is a perfect match for the prince.

74
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,610
Prince?

75
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,020
You have other princes?

76
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,220
Whose name is Prince?

77
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,280
Your colleague? Whose name is Prince?

78
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,490
-Listen to me. -No.

79
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,500
You bad guy!

80
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,450
Listen to me first. I'm not afraid.

81
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,470
It's still early.

82
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,940
Why don't you sleep more?

83
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,860
It's dawn.

84
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,860
Aren't you afraid of being discovered?

85
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,520
They can't get up before noon.

86
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,790
Please don't organize

87
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,520
such publicly funded travel anymore.

88
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,850
My heart can't stand it.

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,140
This gives me an excuse

90
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,470
to ask you out next time.

91
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,360
What are you thinking?

92
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,240
What I think

93
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,740
is what you think.

94
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,840
What am I thinking?

95
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,850
I don't know.

96
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,940
I have to ask

97
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,080
what this princess is expecting.

98
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,900
What are you expecting?

99
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,500
I'm looking forward to your breakfast.

100
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,710
You think too much.

101
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,380
You think too much.

102
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,310
How could I make breakfast for you?

103
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,110
Xu Guangxi.

104
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,900
Come here!

105
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,980
Don't do anything stupid.

106
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,230
You're a magician.

107
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,300
Do you like it?

108
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,700
Is it good?

109
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,270
When did you make it?

110
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,460
Take a guess.

111
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,480
She agreed that

112
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,900
she would come home early for dinner.

113
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
What time is it now?

114
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,159
Why isn't she back yet?

115
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,659
Who did she go to team building with?

116
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,320
She got carried away playing.

117
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,100
The meal is not ready yet.

118
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,650
Maybe she'll be back soon.

119
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,550
She's about to get married.

120
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,670
But...

121
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,680
she often doesn't arrive home on time.

122
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,670
Well...

123
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,060
Enough.

124
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,530
Stop walking around in the kitchen.

125
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,540
It makes me dizzy.

126
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,680
Can you help me

127
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,610
with the dishes?

128
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,420
OK.

129
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,180
I'll call you when the meal is ready.

130
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,770
Take a good rest

131
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,720
in the living room.

132
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,520
Have some tea.

133
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,580
You're so worried.

134
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,000
All you do everyday

135
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,740
is playing.

136
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,660
I'm beating the Big Boss, dad.

137
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,300
What Big Boss?

138
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,020
Let me ask you.

139
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,620
What?

140
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,420
Did your sister and your brother-in-law-to-be

141
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
quarrel?

142
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,210
How would I know

143
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,380
things happened between them?

144
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,900
You don't know?

145
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,740
You know nothing.

146
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,000
All you know is eating.

147
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,060
What's wrong?

148
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,350
I'm asking you.

149
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,130
I always think something is wrong

150
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,020
with your sister and your brother-in-law-to-be.

151
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,100
What's wrong?

152
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,860
Where is my phone?

153
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,050
What are you doing?

154
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,180
Calling your brother-in-law-to-be.

155
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,460
Dad. Dad.

156
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,700
No.

157
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,900
I'm calling your brother-in-law-to-be.

158
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,900
Any problem?

159
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:56,940
I...

160
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,280
My sister is getting married soon.

161
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,420
Dad, you need to create

162
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,280
a warm family atmosphere for her.

163
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,140
Did your sister tell you she wants to get married?

164
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,540
It's only a matter of time.

165
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,250
Right?

166
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,420
And I think,

167
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,280
as a man,

168
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,700
if you push my sister and brother-in-law-to-be

169
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,450
too hard,

170
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,500
my brother-in-law-to-be will be under pressure.

171
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,020
Maybe he went back to Beijing

172
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,900
because you forced them

173
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,780
too hard.

174
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,820
What do you think?

175
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,140
Dad, have some tea.

176
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
That makes sense.

177
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,340
And then?

178
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,400
You have to care more about my sister.

179
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,000
How?

180
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,500
Dad,

181
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,090
I know you care about my sister.

182
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,610
But the deepest concern

183
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,860
is to pretend not to care.

184
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,140
It might be better.

185
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,140
This is a rule of thumb.

186
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,950
You know?

187
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,620
This...

188
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,020
What rule?

189
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,740
Have you ever been in a relationship?

190
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,650
Talking about rules.

191
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,340
I...

192
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,780
Tell me the truth.

193
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,910
Are you dating

194
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,070
secretly out there?

195
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,130
Dad, how is that possible?

196
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,340
I've been busy with the postgraduate entrance exam.

197
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,500
Look at you.

198
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,280
Look at your eyes.

199
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,060
My sister is afraid

200
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,590
so she hasn't come back yet.

201
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,040
I'm her dad. Why would she be afraid of me?

202
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,370
Why are you so fierce?

203
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,870
What time is it?

204
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,160
No, I have to go downstairs to pick her up.

205
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,820
What are you doing?

206
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,260
Sit down.

207
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,140
Dad, calm down.

208
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,940
I know you care about my sister.

209
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,690
How about this?

210
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,810
I'll wait for her downstairs.

211
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,860
I'll escort her to the table

212
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,380
safely.

213
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,060
Is that okay?

214
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,860
Go, go, go.

215
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,060
Go.

216
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,060
You...

217
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,780
help me finish this game.

218
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,780
Only the Big Boss needs to be killed.

219
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,660
Shut up!

220
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,410
Sit down.

221
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,640
What are you doing? Yibo is right.

222
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,190
Don't worry.

223
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,610
How can I not worry?

224
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,410
Ke is 32 years old.

225
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,140
What if she and Zelin

226
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,300
had a fight and something happened,

227
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,860
tell me

228
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,340
where I can find

229
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,660
such a good son-in-law-to-be.

230
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,310
Besides, she's 32 years old.

231
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,990
What if she can't get married?

232
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,830
So what?

233
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,060
Listen.

234
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,700
I've always wanted to have

235
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,110
a daughter.

236
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,610
Now I have such a good daughter

237
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,660
by my side.

238
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,000
I want her to stay for a few more years.

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,970
Listen.

240
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,230
Don't make trouble.

241
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,220
Why do you force her to get married?

242
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,180
Are you too idle?

243
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,140
If you are. Alright.

244
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,220
Here, trim

245
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,150
the vegetables.

246
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,530
I'm waiting to cook.

247
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,090
Hurry up.

248
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,550
Do you hear me?

249
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,540
I'll do it.

250
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,230
What a stubborn old man.

251
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,370
I've done too much

252
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,340
for my sister.

253
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,780
I hope she can

254
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,640
give me a big red packet this time.

255
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,860
I'm home.

256
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,620
Let's go out

257
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,780
next weekend.

258
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,190
I can't tell my dad

259
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,980
every weekend

260
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,220
the company is having a team building.

261
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,280
Make up some reasons and give it a try.

262
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,060
At this rate,

263
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,060
my dad will get more and more strict.

264
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,260
You're right.

265
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,260
Then I won't go upstairs

266
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,060
with you,

267
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,920
in case we can't make it clear.

268
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,270
I'll get going then.

269
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,220
Wait.

270
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,740
You can't accompany me

271
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,820
next weekend.

272
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,110
Why can't you spend more time with me now?

273
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,780
Alright.

274
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,100
A tall man.

275
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,810
Xu Guangxi.

276
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,110
How dare you?

277
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,860
How dare you flirt with my sister?

278
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,900
Yibo, calm down.

279
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,830
Calm down.

280
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,540
How can I calm down?

281
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,450
The night before we departed,

282
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,220
we were discussing

283
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,300
how to cover you up.

284
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,380
Don't make me the third wheel.

285
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,560
Then you can have fun.

286
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,460
So I helped him with...

287
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,020
Xu Guangxi.

288
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,690
What were you thinking?

289
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,950
Why didn't you tell me?

290
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,020
I told him not to.

291
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,500
You...

292
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,260
Are you crazy?

293
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,940
I know this kind of man.

294
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,020
What he wants is...

295
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,340
He was attracted by your beauty.

296
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,060
To be honest,

297
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,740
I can't deny

298
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,700
what you said just now.

299
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,500
Brat.

300
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,620
Guangxi.

301
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Can you go back first?

302
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,140
Are you listening to him?

303
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,940
Go back first.

304
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,020
But...

305
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,180
Go.

306
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,010
Yes, go away.

307
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,380
Don't let me see you again.

308
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,170
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

309
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,240
Yin Yibo.

310
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,540
Yibo.

311
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,580
Can you stop being so childish?

312
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,120
Did you cheat

313
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,180
behind my brother-in-law-to-be's back?

314
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,700
What?

315
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,970
Did you cheat

316
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,940
behind my brother-in-law-to-be's back?

317
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,580
I broke up with Li Zelin long ago.

318
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,460
Aunt Lan knows it too.

319
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,300
Aunt Lan knows?

320
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,140
I don't know.

321
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,420
Do you regard me as your brother?

322
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:36,820
Yibo.

323
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,220
I'm in my thirties.

324
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,260
I don't need to explain

325
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,820
every relationship with you.

326
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,110
You don't have to tell me.

327
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,940
Why didn't you tell Aunt Lan?

328
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,540
Does she know you're dating?

329
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,190
Aunt Lan doesn't know.

330
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,060
If they all know,

331
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,980
it'll be a big deal.

332
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,350
So you have to keep it a secret for me.

333
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,790
How can I keep it a secret for you?

334
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,180
Listen.

335
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,380
Xu Guangxi is a schemer.

336
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,260
I'm sure

337
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,380
when you and brother-in-law-to-be were together,

338
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,930
he planned

339
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,820
to poach you.

340
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,190
I broke up with Li Zelin.

341
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,660
Stop calling him brother-in-law-to-be.

342
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,300
There are reasons

343
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,500
for the break up.

344
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,620
But we've separated.

345
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,990
I won't speak ill of him.

346
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,940
Then even if you want immediately a new boyfriend,

347
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,700
it doesn't have to be Xu Guangxi.

348
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,220
Sister.

349
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,710
Why not?

350
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Although we are siblings,

351
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,180
but I'm not related to him

352
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,260
by blood.

353
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,340
When you graduated from high school,

354
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,070
he was still in primary school.

355
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,420
This is also

356
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,020
the issue between me and him.

357
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,950
I don't think that's a problem.

358
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,470
Because of Guangxi,

359
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,140
I realised that in this world,

360
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,540
there is someone who cherishes me

361
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,700
more than I cherish myself.

362
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,630
Then why didn't you make it public?

363
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,290
It's not that I don't want to.

364
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,540
I need to find a time

365
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,980
to tell Dad and Aunt Lan.

366
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,180
Trust me, okay?

367
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,970
How can I trust you?

368
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,640
You are my sister.

369
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,460
He is my brother.

370
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,370
It's ridiculous

371
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,630
for you to be together.

372
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,420
I hope you can

373
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,480
give me some space.

374
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,340
I can give you space.

375
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,020
Will Dad give you space?

376
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
Will Aunt Lan give you space?

377
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,220
Keep your voice down.

378
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,350
If you tell Dad

379
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,740
and Aunt Lan now,

380
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,040
you are not my brother anymore.

381
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,630
Okay.

382
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,400
Sister.

383
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,740
let me tell you seriously.

384
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,220
I've always listened to you

385
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,800
since childhood.

386
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,780
But not this time.

387
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,940
Xu Guangxi can't be my brother-in-law,

388
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,390
because he doesn't deserve it.

389
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,510
Think about it.

390
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,470
You agreed to come back early for dinner.

391
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,170
What time is it?

392
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,660
Aunt Lan has heated up the dishes twice.

393
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,400
Dad.

394
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,070
I was stuck in traffic.

395
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,740
At least

396
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,000
give us a call.

397
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,260
Don't you know that everyone is worried?

398
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,780
She's just in time.

399
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,940
Here you go. Yike.

400
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,670
This is your favorite pork trotter soup.

401
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,830
Thank you, Aunt Lan.

402
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,620
It's useless no matter how much you eat.

403
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,020
You're still an old lady.

404
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,300
How could you say that?

405
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,340
It's normal for your sister to want to be beautiful.

406
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,160
You too.

407
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,820
Here, have some.

408
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,220
You must

409
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,700
eat more today.

410
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,390
Guangxi said he'd come.

411
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,820
He suddenly called and said he wouldn't come.

412
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,020
Look, I made too much.

413
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,150
He must feel guilty.

414
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,580
What?

415
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,630
Nothing.

416
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,070
Yike.

417
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
You and Guang Xi work in the same building.

418
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,790
Help me see

419
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,550
if he's busy recently.

420
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,270
I heard that

421
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,760
his company has had

422
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,660
an important project recently.

423
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,500
That must be tiring.

424
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,310
How about this?

425
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,180
I'll cook some tonic for Guangxi tonight.

426
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,130
When you go to work tomorrow,

427
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,590
please take it to Guangxi.

428
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,180
Okay.

429
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,780
Is Xu Guangxi a three-year-old?

430
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,500
Why does he always

431
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,900
come for dinner for free?

432
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,050
Yin Yibo,

433
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,300
can you be polite?

434
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,860
What's wrong with Guangxi having a meal at home?

435
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,780
You're over 20 years old.

436
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,820
You're always eating at home.

437
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,710
Who blamed you?

438
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,460
We are no better than each other.

439
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,240
We both rely on my sister

440
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,500
to support our family.

441
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,910
What are you talking about?

442
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,750
I have retirement salary.

443
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,210
Who relies on your sister?

444
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,270
Yibo,

445
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
tell me,

446
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,380
is there any conflict

447
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,780
between you and Guangxi?

448
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,380
Aunt Lan.

449
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,110
Xu Guangxi is your son.

450
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,200
You should ask him.

451
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,280
Yin Yibo, what are you talking about?

452
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,670
Apologize to Aunt Lan.

453
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,420
No.

454
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,660
You are all siding with him.

455
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,920
I'm the only outsider.

456
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,220
So what?

457
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,460
He is more sensible

458
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,450
and more filial than you.

459
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,300
More filial than me?

460
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,860
Yes.

461
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,700
I think he's funny.

462
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,870
He is really filial enough.

463
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,510
I can't eat anymore.

464
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,310
You guys eat.

465
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,970
Don't ever eat it.

466
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,100
Alright.

467
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

468
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,710
Don't mind him.

469
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,600
Don't be angry.

470
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,940
It's okay.

471
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,830
Let's eat.

472
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,610
I can't eat anymore.

473
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,500
Dad.

474
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,310
You all help him.

475
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,520
Yibo.

476
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,220
Don't make things difficult for your sister.

477
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,890
I can find a chance

478
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,720
to explain to you.

479
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,520
Pretentious.

480
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,580
Let's break off!

481
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,730
Didn't you go to your mother's house

482
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,609
for meal?

483
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,349
Why are you back so soon?

484
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,290
Why are you so nosy?

485
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,070
Why are you pulling a long face?

486
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:29,970
What's wrong?

487
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,130
You broke up?

488
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,670
Seeing you took out your sister

489
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,150
on the weekend,

490
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,140
it's not possible that you're dating someone.

491
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,300
I'm really curious.

492
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,580
Is there anything else in your world

493
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,980
except for a girlfriend?

494
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,580
Brother,

495
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,560
I have the whole world.

496
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,980
I only need a girlfriend.

497
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,250
Did you order takeout?

498
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,940
No.

499
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,960
It's so late. Who is it?

500
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,380
I'll get the door.

501
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:56,980
Who is it?

502
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,250
Aunt Lan.

503
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,060
Why are you here so late to see Guangxi?

504
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,180
I brought you food.

505
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,980
Thank you, Aunt Lan.

506
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
Come in, Aunt Lan.

507
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,520
Mom.

508
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,910
Why are you here?

509
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,670
Mom wants to see you.

510
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,580
Mom, you...

511
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,380
Guangxi.

512
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,960
Did you have a conflict

513
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,090
with Yibo?

514
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,140
Why did he have such a problem

515
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,980
with you?

516
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,650
He...

517
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,410
What's wrong?

518
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,580
When I was eating today,

519
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,880
I mentioned you unintentionally.

520
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,520
He got angry

521
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,870
and criticized you for always coming for meals for free.

522
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,660
It's nothing.

523
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,430
It's true that I'm coming for meals for free.

524
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,020
Maybe I beat him too much

525
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,060
when playing basketball.

526
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,210
He got impatient.

527
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,580
Really?

528
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,510
You two

529
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,030
shocked me.

530
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,150
Shocked?

531
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,090
Mom.

532
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,310
Did Yibo say something

533
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,190
that upset you?

534
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,940
Not really.

535
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,040
You know.

536
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,350
He's just a kid.

537
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,420
How can a mother

538
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,810
be angry with her kid?

539
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,040
Aunt Lan went to see you.

540
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,240
Is she okay?

541
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,110
Yes.

542
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,740
She's fine.

543
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,860
It's all Yin Yibo's fault.

544
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,790
He talks nonsense whenever he talks about you.

545
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,670
It's my fault.

546
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,660
I lied to him in a hurry at that time.

547
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,640
Actually,

548
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,360
I've been looking for a chance

549
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,490
to explain to him.

550
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,790
Please don't.

551
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,070
I just sent him a red packet.

552
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,130
He hasn't taken it.

553
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,140
Don't go to him.

554
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,270
Don't make it worse.

555
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,420
Okay.

556
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,180
You don't look

557
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,730
so well.

558
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm fine.

559
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,300
I think we should

560
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,440
keep a low profile.

561
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,100
Hold Yin Yibo down first.

562
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,600
Hold down? Me?

563
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,160
Xu Guangxi, let me tell you.

564
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,460
Don't try to seduce my sister

565
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,340
with your good look.

566
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,550
If you want to pass me,

567
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,710
step over me first.

568
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,340
Give it to me.

569
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,560
Watch your mouth.

570
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,870
Why should I?

571
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,100
Keep your voice down.

572
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,860
Sister.

573
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,740
I didn't tell Dad

574
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,010
and Aunt Lan

575
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,700
because I'm afraid to drive them into the hospital.

576
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,820
This is not the reason

577
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,810
to push your luck.

578
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,420
Got it?

579
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,570
Stop!

580
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,900
Come back.

581
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,020
Am I your elder sister

582
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,030
or you are my elder brother?

583
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,230
Are you lecturing me?

584
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:33,940
Do you still want

585
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,070
next month's lunch?

586
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,830
Did you see the red packet?

587
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,490
Why are you yelling at me?

588
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,540
Received. It's useless.

589
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,490
Don't worry about me.

590
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,710
I'll wait in a safe distance

591
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,020
and never give up.

592
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,460
Does your stomach still hurt?

593
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,230
No.

594
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,010
Don't eat indiscriminately again.

595
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,810
Do you hear me?

596
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,030
Luckily I came here.

597
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,100
What would you do

598
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
if I weren't here?

599
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,320
Chen, the holiday is coming.

600
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,390
I don't want to take summer classes.

601
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,130
After the holiday,

602
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,010
I want to go to work with you.

603
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,530
Chen.

604
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,580
What do you want to say?

605
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,540
Can you take me with you

606
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,900
next time you go out to play?

607
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,140
I won't go out next time.

608
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,970
I'll stay at home with you this weekend.

609
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,710
Why don't we switch?

610
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,890
I can go to work with you.

611
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,620
I can tell your colleagues

612
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,780
stories.

613
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,750
I know a lot of stories.

614
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,020
Okay, Yu is the best.

615
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,680
It's settled then.

616
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,540
High five.

617
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,740
Bye.

618
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,990
Go to class. Listen to your teacher.

619
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,340
Wait, wait.

620
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,240
I sincerely apologize to you.

621
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,060
Well,

622
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,020
It was my fault.

623
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,140
I shouldn't have...

624
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,060
No, we were halfway there.

625
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,180
No, I mean...

626
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,750
I left halfway.

627
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,660
It's true that

628
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,190
I had no choice.

629
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,970
You...

630
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,150
Let me explain.

631
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,240
No need to explain.

632
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,420
Leave your words

633
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,210
to

634
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,360
other girls.

635
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,460
I don't...

636
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,630
have other girls.

637
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,000
Now I finally understand

638
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,400
why you can start a business successfully.

639
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,350
Because you have

640
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,420
a very important trait

641
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,770
to be the CEO.

642
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,940
What?

643
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,510
You know how to coax people.

644
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,860
You can treat everyone

645
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,190
as Party A.

646
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,420
But I'm sorry.

647
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,500
I won't buy it.

648
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,540
I really didn't coax you.

649
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,420
I have some domestic issues...

650
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,660
Shut up!

651
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,890
Listen, Chen Ye.

652
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,320
I, Qin Yiran,

653
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,020
will not get married or have children.

654
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,970
From now on,

655
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,100
we shall stay out of each other's business.

656
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,860
We don't owe each other anything.

657
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,220
Don't pester me anymore.

658
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,780
Bye.

659
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,970
The key to selling millions of goods is

660
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,310
first,

661
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,600
to find the highlight of the product

662
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,220
and to pass it to our consumers

663
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,850
under certain context.

664
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,060
Do you understand?

665
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,370
Yes.

666
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,360
Okay, I'll continue.

667
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,140
We need to find

668
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,140
the target consumers.

669
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,650
Be serious.

670
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,640
No one can help you if the data is bad.

671
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,780
It's not that serious.

672
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,060
If you just come to SC

673
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,240
to have fun,

674
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,910
you can leave now.

675
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,450
I... I'm not.

676
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,170
I'm serious.

677
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:13,810
Well,

678
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,510
It's...

679
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,710
Come on. Come on.

680
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,790
Cheer up.

681
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,690
Listen to me.

682
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,580
Apart from

683
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,900
regular live stream,

684
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,910
there will be a special live stream

685
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,520
fro Double Seventh Festival tomorrow night.

686
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,360
This is our last chance

687
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,310
for a good KPI.

688
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,510
Did you hear me?

689
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,060
Yes.

690
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,800
Got it.

691
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,760
Sir, let me see you off.

692
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,430
Thank you.

693
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,140
It's okay.

694
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,740
Good luck, everyone.

695
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,300
Bye.

696
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,160
Thank you. Bye.

697
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,530
One more?

698
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,560
This is killing me.

699
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,060
Do you know what's going on

700
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,860
with Yike?

701
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,940
She encouraged us with her smile last week.

702
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,700
If you don't help me,

703
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,950
I would die.

704
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,840
Take your time.

705
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,340
It's just been one weekend.

706
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,610
We already need to work under high pressure.

707
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,930
It seems that we will face high pressure

708
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,930
this whole month.

709
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,870
Yike is right.

710
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,450
Even if we add a live stream

711
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,590
every night,

712
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,920
our daily live stream sales

713
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,050
is still not enough.

714
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,400
In other words,

715
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,460
if the promotion

716
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,140
on the Double Seventh Festival fails,

717
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,490
we'll be in danger.

718
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,260
It's normal for Yike

719
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,100
to be anxious.

720
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,800
Please understand her, okay?

721
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,960
But

722
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,120
what did the trainer

723
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,810
just say?

724
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,380
It's so hard to understand.

725
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,470
You didn't notice

726
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,650
Yike's smell.

727
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,880
The Desert Thorn.

728
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,660
You may not know much about her

729
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,950
since you just got here.

730
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,740
No matter what big problems

731
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,900
she faced in the past,

732
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,150
she can handle it herself.

733
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,100
She focused on matters rather than people.

734
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,900
She may be in a bad mood recently.

735
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,660
I see.

736
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,360
She must have had quarrels

737
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,490
with her boyfriend.

738
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,620
Long distance relationship?

739
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,700
It's normal to break up.

740
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,740
I didn't hear it.

741
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,820
I know.

742
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,040
What's wrong?

743
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,650
Help me ask for a leave.

744
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,510
I'll go find the selling elixirs.

745
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
How are you today?

746
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,330
Not so good.

747
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,380
Well,

748
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,890
the power bank is on the rooftop.

749
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,520
What's wrong?

750
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,210
Your eyebrows are squeezed.

751
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,390
Are you still worried about Yibo?

752
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,870
Not exactly.

753
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,620
The Double Seventh Festival is coming.

754
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,040
It took me a lot of effort

755
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,260
to persuade the company

756
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,860
to make a special hot-sales.

757
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,910
I'm afraid if the data

758
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,220
is still not good,

759
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,900
it'll be hard to explain to the company.

760
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,180
Remember to come home early after work.

761
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,380
Don't tell me you have to work overtime.

762
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,500
Look.

763
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,780
The old one and the young one.

764
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,370
They often quarrel at home.

765
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,370
But it's obvious that they are biological father and son.

766
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,820
He can do more than him.

767
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,340
I'm sorry.

768
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,300
How can I help you now?

769
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,720
I don't want you

770
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,200
to be caught in the middle.

771
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,490
Then be

772
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,930
my power bank.

773
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,450
Is the power charged?

774
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,700
Let me feel it.

775
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,900
I can feel it.

776
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,460
In such a big Shanghai,

777
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,980
why would we end up

778
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,530
the same rooftop together?

779
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,780
We're very lucky.

780
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,180
In such a big Shanghai,

781
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,130
there is a place

782
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,190
belongs to us.

783
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,720
Anything

784
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,810
can become a good thing

785
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,810
according to you.

786
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,300
Then I'll stay with Yin Yike

787
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,720
to make good things continue to happen.

788
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,610
You're so smooth-tongued.

789
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,360
Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone.

790
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:48,960
This is

791
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,870
Dan from Xiafei Road.

792
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,730
Today, I'd like to recommend

793
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,110
a series of trendy things and clothes.

794
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,010
The first one

795
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,700
is

796
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,780
this one.

797
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,020
Why I first recommend this one?

798
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,560
Because

799
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,980
it integrates

800
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,940
space elements.

801
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,400
On this clothes,

802
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,350
as you can see,

803
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,060
there is a bear

804
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,980
on this piece.

805
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,020
I see Miss Miao Is the Thinnest.

806
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,180
Yin Yibo, come out.

807
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,020
If you dare to bet,

808
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,420
you have to admit defeat.

809
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,830
If you don't come out,

810
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,310
I'll scream downstairs.

811
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,140
Guys,

812
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,740
let's break for ten minutes.

813
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,700
Wait for me.

814
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,430
Guess where I am.

815
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,110
Dan from Xiafei Road.

816
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,880
Isn't this downstairs of my home?

817
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,630
Xia Xiaomian.

818
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,020
What are you doing here?

819
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,950
This is my house.

820
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,140
To fulfill the previous bet.

821
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,970
What bet?

822
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,420
I told you.

823
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:56,900
Yike

824
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,980
has a new boyfriend.

825
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,380
You didn't believe me?

826
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,490
Now,

827
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,340
she lied to you that her company was having a team building.

828
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,410
but actually she went to the team building

829
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,730
with Guangxi's company.

830
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,820
Although I only got

831
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,810
indirect evidence,

832
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,980
if I keep an eye on it for two more days,

833
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,750
I'll get

834
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,780
direct evidence.

835
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,570
Let me tell you.

836
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,650
Boys in their company are not good.

837
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,160
Only Guangxi is Okay.

838
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,300
No need to say.

839
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,940
It's Xu Guangxi.

840
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,330
Really?

841
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,320
That's perfect.

842
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,010
Perfect?

843
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,980
Not even close.

844
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,510
They are seven years apart.

845
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,470
So what?

846
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
He's handsome.

847
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,610
Isn't my sister pretty?

848
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,620
No.

849
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,690
How can we judge people in a relationship

850
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,660
by their looks?

851
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,950
Dating is dating.

852
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,060
What else can we see?

853
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,460
You can't just look the appearance when you're in a relationship.

854
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,420
It depends on how compatible you are.

855
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,040
Since you choose to

856
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,200
start a relationship,

857
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,220
you have to manage it

858
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,980
with all your heart.

859
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,100
Don't love someone like playing games.

860
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,340
Love someone with your whole life.

861
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,250
That's love.

862
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,100
Understand?

863
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,020
But every time I fell in love,

864
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,780
I'd been very serious.

865
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,760
Yibo.

866
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,620
You are not old.

867
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,540
Why do you look

868
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,600
so old-fashioned?

869
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,530
Have you never been in a relationship?

870
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,360
It's none of your business.

871
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,610
You look so cute

872
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,690
when you're shy.

873
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,100
I'm not shy.

874
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,250
You lost.

875
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,030
You promised

876
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,860
to be my assistant.

877
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,560
Why?

878
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,860
They won't be together for long.

879
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,540
Why?

880
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,090
They are only two floors apart.

881
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,550
They meet every day.

882
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,410
They are close.

883
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,920
Why do you curse them?

884
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Listen, Xia Xiaomian.

885
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,480
Because I, Yin Yibo

886
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,650
don't agree.

887
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,980
You...

888
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,150
Listen.

889
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,400
I don't care if you agree or not.

890
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,610
I'll always support them.

891
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm their couple fan.

892
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,340
Are you tired?

893
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,310
Just fine.

894
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,540
What do you want?

895
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,950
Have some sweet drinks.

896
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,280
Xu Guangxi.

897
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,650
I knew you're up to no good.

898
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,140
My eyes are

899
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,330
staring at you.

900
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,540
Yin Yibo, what are you doing here?

901
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,140
Sister.

902
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,380
I know you won't listen to me.

903
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,260
So I've decided.

904
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,310
From now on,

905
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,180
this fly swatter will do his old job again.

906
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,240
Disperse the flies

907
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,690
around you.

908
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,050
You're just like dad.

909
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,740
Aren't you and dad

910
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,820
the same?

911
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,980
If dad come here today,

912
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,140
the result would be worse.

913
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,070
Besides,

914
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,230
I'm not like someone

915
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,220
who claims to be a brother

916
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,820
but actually wants to be my brother-in-law.

917
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,750
That's too much.

918
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,790
Sister.

919
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,220
Go home with him.

920
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,420
I can rest assured if he pick you up.

921
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,750
You're smart. Let's go.

922
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,540
Your shoes are dirty.

923
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,890
Guangxi.

924
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,430
Why are you here?

925
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,710
What's wrong?

926
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,210
Why the long face?

927
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,770
Are you really separated

928
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,440
with Yike?

929
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,420
No. Who told you that?

930
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,500
Good.

931
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,470
You scared me.

932
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,900
Did Yibo tell you?

933
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,060
My love radar told me.

934
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,570
I don't need him to tell me.

935
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,070
What do you want from me?

936
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,770
Tell me, how can I help you?

937
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,370
Guangxi.

938
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,060
Can you help me

939
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,530
persuade Yibo

940
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,030
to come to my live stream room

941
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,820
on the Double Seventh Festival

942
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,050
to be my assistant?

943
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,430
Otherwise,

944
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,090
my sales won't be good,

945
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,920
so that Yike's KPI

946
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,680
will also fail.

947
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,790
I'll be miserable.

948
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,060
Wait a minute.

949
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,190
Why do you have to find Yibo?

950
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,260
Does he have anything to do

951
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,460
with sales increase?

952
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,180
Don't you know?

953
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,030
Yibo is

954
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,460
a top-notch

955
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,250
fashion brand appraisal blogger.

956
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,860
Dan from Xiafei Road is him.

957
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,320
He's a top trendy blogger?

958
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,860
Yes.

959
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,210
Dan from Xiafei Road.

960
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,500
It's indeed him.

961
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,570
But

962
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,320
I quarreled with Yibo.

963
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,380
He may not listen to

964
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,210
what I say now.

965
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,550
No wonder

966
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,220
he was so angry

967
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,280
when I went for him.

968
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,810
What should we do now?

969
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,980
If that's the case,

970
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,570
I really don't have

971
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,610
any other way.

972
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,030
Will I really be

973
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,960
the sinner of the live stream team?

974
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,139
I should've

975
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,080
worked harder.

976
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,170
I don't want Yike

977
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,280
feel sad.

978
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,370
I wanted to show her

979
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,460
my excellent side.

980
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,940
But it turned out like this again.

981
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,250
Can you show me the materials

982
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,380
in your hand?

983
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:27,989
Sure.

984
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,860
Don't worry.

985
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,380
I might be able to help this time.

986
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,060
Really?

987
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,540
Okay.

988
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,179
You've gone too far.

989
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:52,940
Really.

990
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,260
Why are you...

991
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,820
Are you trying to fool me?

992
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,500
If you do this again,

993
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,830
I'll teach you a lesson.

994
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,750
So what?

995
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,100
If you do this,

996
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,740
I'll let Aunt Lan know.

997
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,300
How dare you!

998
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,700
-Aunt Lan. -Do you still want money?

999
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,500
You're back.

1000
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,620
Hurry up.

1001
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,060
It's time for dinner.

1002
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,580
Here.

1003
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,580
Come here. Eat while it's hot.

1004
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,140
Come and eat.

1005
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,900
Eat while it's hot.

1006
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,060
Coming, Aunt Lan.

1007
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,350
Here, Ke.

1008
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,420
This is your soup.

1009
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,740
If you're a man,

1010
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,650
don't hinder your sister's happiness.

1011
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,730
Come to the court if you dare.

1012
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,260
Aunt Lan, I'm leaving.

1013
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,160
I'm going to attend

1014
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,870
a duel between men.

1015
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,740
You guys eat. Don't worry about me.

1016
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,100
You can go after eating.

1017
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,540
Aunt Lan, don't mind him.

1018
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,290
Let's eat.

1019
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,850
No, Aunt Lan.

1020
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,580
You guys eat.

1021
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,500
Xu Guangxi.

1022
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,180
Get your facts straight.

1023
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,830
You just fooled my sister for a few days.

1024
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,180
How dare you suppress me

1025
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,420
like you were my brother-in-law?

1026
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,940
You can't even beat me on the court.

1027
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,460
Why do you care about me and your sister?

1028
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
Look carefully.

1029
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,650
This is what happens to you.

1030
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,300
Is it against the law to have a crush on each other?

1031
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,460
I think you're asking for a defeat.

1032
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,190
Let's talk after you defeat me.

1033
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,110
I quit.

1034
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,880
I quit.

1035
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,300
I won't play such a childish game with you.

1036
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,420
Anyway, I have to intrude

1037
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,140
between you and my sister.

1038
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,740
Yin Yibo,

1039
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,860
are you childish

1040
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,650
or me?

1041
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,620
Do you have to mind

1042
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,660
me and your sister?

1043
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,760
Yes, I will.

1044
00:36:59,380 --> 00:36:59,900
Okay.

1045
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,940
Your sister is in trouble now.

1046
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,060
Is this your so-called mind?

1047
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,580
What do you mean?

1048
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,650
What do you mean?

1049
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,940
Your sister is transferred to the Live Stream Department

1050
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,580
to work.

1051
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,590
But the data is not good.

1052
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,850
She's always worried.

1053
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,610
Look at you.

1054
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,650
You have the mood to guide her private life,

1055
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,460
but you don't have time to help her?

1056
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,850
Dan from Xiafei Road.

1057
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,780
How did you know?

1058
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,350
It doesn't matter.

1059
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,320
All I know is that

1060
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,930
a brother who declared to care about his sister,

1061
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:27,420
at a time like this,

1062
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,420
can't help at all.

1063
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,180
Don't lie to me

1064
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,540
in the name of sympathy for my sister.

1065
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,700
I won't be fooled by you.

1066
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,150
Yes.

1067
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,070
I guess so.

1068
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,460
You are a coward.

1069
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,100
You dare only do something

1070
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,630
behind your family's back.

1071
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,450
You don't have the courage

1072
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,640
to face your life.

1073
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,540
It's not true.

1074
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,940
Your sister is quite pitiful

1075
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,620
to have a brother like you.

1076
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,730
You're always asking for money.

1077
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,100
When she needs someone to cheer her up,

1078
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,160
you won't be there.

1079
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,770
How about this?

1080
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,820
Leave your sister to me.

1081
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,140
At least I have a good education background

1082
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,930
and I'm good-looking.

1083
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,250
And I earn more than you do.

1084
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,060
I'm better than you in every aspect.

1085
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,360
Xu Guangxi.

1086
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,020
Xu Guangxi, let me tell you.

1087
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,620
Don't show off

1088
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,680
your superiority.

1089
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:00,660
In this world,

1090
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,130
no one cares about my sister more than I do.

1091
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,890
Also, I don't allow anyone

1092
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,320
to take my sister away

1093
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,750
from me.

1094
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,340
Okay.

1095
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,690
I'll wait and see.

1096
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,890
Go help her if you can.

1097
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,990
Let's make a bet.

1098
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,650
If I win,

1099
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,900
you will immediately

1100
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,500
break up with my sister

1101
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,900
and never covet her.

1102
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,490
Do you dare?

1103
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,620
Fine.

1104
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,320
For the sake of Yin Yike,

1105
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,010
I promise you.

1106
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,430
But if you screw up,

1107
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,990
I'll take her away from you.

1108
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,450
No way.

1109
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,540
I have millions of fans.

1110
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,750
You will lose.

1111
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,500
Wait.

1112
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,180
This is the information Xia Xiaomian sorted out.

1113
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,310
For your reference.

1114
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,080
Xu Guangxi, let me tell you.

1115
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,730
Before you become a cannon fodder,

1116
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,070
I'll keep an eye on you.

Make the lighting whiter.

1123
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,130
Hello, everyone.

1124
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,060
Welcome to my live stream room.

1125
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,560
Today,

1126
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,130
I'll send a link number five.

1127
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,850
One piece.

1128
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,550
Two pieces, three pieces, four pieces.

1129
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:33,980
Five pieces.

1130
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,750
How much is it?

1131
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,700
It's 88 yuan in total.

1132
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,450
88, plus a big gift package.

1133
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,340
Please go to link number five.

1134
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,550
-This is so cheap. -Five, four, three, two, one.

1135
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,400
Activate the link.

1136
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,040
This one.

1137
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,830
Let's buy this.

1138
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,850
Grab it! Grab it!

1139
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,980
9.9 yuan.

1140
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,010
You can buy it at 9.9 yuan.

1141
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,210
This sunscreen costs

1142
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,690
89 for one.

1143
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,500
89 for one.

1144
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,270
Buy it.

1145
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,750
Let's buy it first.

1146
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,650
I got it.

1147
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,990
This collagen

1148
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,980
is hard to get.

1149
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,850
I negotiated with the factory

1150
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,100
for a long time

1151
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,700
to get this collagen.

1152
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,350
This price is 188 yuan.

1153
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,500
188 yuan covers free delivery to your door.

1154
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,830
Look at this.

1155
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,620
This one is so girlish.

1156
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,400
Don't you think so?

1157
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,030
As long as you wear it,

1158
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,930
you'll definitely get a high rate of second glance.

1159
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,390
And as you can see...

1160
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,220
This one

1161
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,490
should also be accompanied by the goldfish.

1162
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,820
Oh my god. Buy it.

1163
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,460
3,890 yuan.

1164
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,180
What did I buy?

1165
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,590
What happened?

1166
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,460
I lost control again.

1167
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,170
3,890 yuan.
