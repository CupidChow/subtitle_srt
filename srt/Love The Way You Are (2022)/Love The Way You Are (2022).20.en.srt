How could you steal my stuff?

you were siblings,

51

72
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,220

73
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,390
and jealous.

74
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,350
Don't be angry.

75
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,270
Just kidding.

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,420

77
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420

It's nothing.

81

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,820
if I can help you gain some advantages

86
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,180
from another side?

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,500
So you want to save the beauty

88

89
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,500
Of course.

90
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,640
As your boyfriend,

91
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,990
how can I lose to him?

92
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,010
Didn't you say the battery died?

93
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,380
When you said I was your boyfriend,

94
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,580
it's fully charged..

95
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,020
Stop looking.

96
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,410

97
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,340

99
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,070
Morning.

100
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,630
Are you going to reimburse me

101
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,060
for the hotel last night?

102
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,590
When you find a girlfriend,

103
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,950
I'll give you a red packet including this.

104
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,580

105
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,670
You think too much.

106
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,100
Three times.

107
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:34,940
Come on.

108
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,870
Eat more.

109
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,700
I'll add more if it's not enough.

110
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,900
Yi... Yibo,

111
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,290
you ordered so much.

112
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,260
Do you need my help?

113
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,460
No way.

114
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,830
Am I that kind of person?

115
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,620
Be confident. You are that kind of person.

116
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,350
Am I?

117
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,700
Okay, I am.

118
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,710
I want to ask you something.

119
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,860
Yesterday, in your Wechat Moments,

120
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,740
the one who stood next to my sister

121
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,520
was Li Zelin.

122
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,530
Why would he appear

123
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,460
in your company?

124
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,820
Mr. Li?

125
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,850
You should know him.

126
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,480
He is the legal consultant

127
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,540
our company hired.

128
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,860
He just came back and

129
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,770
got a job in my sister's company right away.

130
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,060
What a coincidence.

131
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,360
Yibo,

132
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,260
do you think

133
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,580
Mr. Li is like

134
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,610
chocolate-flavored mein mein ice.

135
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,370
It's the classic flavor.

136
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,310
Sweet and smooth.

137
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,710
And there is

138
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,080
a little

139
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,000
elegance and nobleness in it.

140
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,830
What about your Guangxi?

141
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,260
Isn't he good enough?

142
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,560
Guangxi is different.

143
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,770
Guangxi is like the

144
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,240
matcha flavor.

145
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,850
It's fragrant and healing.

146
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,550
Slightly sweet and smooth.

147
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,770
It's quite green.

148
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,260
But,

149
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,580
Xia Xiaomian,

150
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,900
don't be too greedy.

151
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,420
You can only choose one between the two.

152
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,220
Why?

153
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,659
I want it when I want it.

154
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,700
I go shopping when I want to.

155
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,330
Besides,

156
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,540
you can't suppress

157
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,580
people's nature.

158
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,260
One is chocolate,

159
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,020
and the other is matcha.

160
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,390
One side is eternally classic.

161
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,130
While the other is fragrant and healing.

162
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,800
One side for Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

163
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,500
The other for Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

164
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,220
I can still rest on Sunday.

165
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,430
I won't get tired

166
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,760
since there is a gap.

167
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,890
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

168
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,059
Xia Xiaomian,

169
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:34,860
you need to know

170
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,260
outsiders and insiders.

171
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,299
You promised

172
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,600
Xu Guangxi that

173
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,140
you will definitely stand for his couple

174
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,890
and will never betray.

175
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,049
In the end,

176
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,490
you just betrayed them.

177
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,490
So, in my opinion,

178
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,420
you deserve to have no food.

179
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,500
I'm just bragging.

180
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,140
I just focus on the matter at hand.

181
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,260
I didn't say I'm really going to turn against them.

182
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,170
Besides,

183
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,240
they are

184
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,010
so handsome.

185
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,860
One chocolate, Mr. Li,

186
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,590
and matcha,

187
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,020
Guangxi.

188
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,570
Have you heard of Four Beauties of Tianya?

189
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,540
What Four Beauties of Tianya?

190
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,270
Give it to me.

191
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,540
Aren't they just

192
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,540
two simple pieces

193
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,550
of ice cream?

194
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,870
A chocolate flavor.

195
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,830
A matcha flavor.

196
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,950
I'll try it now

197
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,430
to see how different it is.

198
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,380
Matcha flavor.

199
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,420
Ordinary matcha flavor.

200
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,510
Chocolate?

201
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,970
Nothing special.

202
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,630
Are you jealous?

203
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,610
I'm eating ice cream.

204
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,660
Fine, fine.

205
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,180
But both Mr. Li

206
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,300
and Guangxi

207
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,800
have nothing to do with me.

208
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,760
Don't be angry.

209
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,450
I'm not upset.

210
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,690
Eat the mango flavor too.

211
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,010
I like the mango flavor.

212
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,010
You can see what's special about it.

213
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,700
I will never

214
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,020
eat matcha

215
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,110
and chocolate flavored ice cream anymore in my life.

216
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,940
Let you be green.

217
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,500
Chocolate.

218
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,470
This mango flavor

219
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,890
is really sour.

220
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,050
Yike,

221
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,020
big news.

222
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,180
Flower World has agreed to reconcile.

223
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,040
So soon?

224
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,320
Gosh, he's indeed a boss.

225
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,140
This is the plot

226
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,300
that only exists in the novel.

227
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,060
Really?

228
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,440
Yes.

229
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,200
I heard it from Ms. Zheng.

230
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,690
She also said that SC

231
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,700
owed Mr. Li

232
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,590
a big favor.

233
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,280
Such a big sacrifice.

234
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,950
I think

235
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,760
it must be because of your relationship.

236
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,560
I think so too.

237
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,340
What kind of great power does

238
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,780
Li Zelin have

239
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,660
to take Flower World

240
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,460
in such a short time?

241
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,670
I think he has changed

242
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,430
a bit after he is back this time.

243
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,580
It's just business.

244
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,100
He didn't make it hard for me.

245
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,230
Wake up.

246
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,270
There's no real business

247
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,560
between men and women.

248
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,900
You must have walked through

249
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,410
his VIP passageway.

250
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,260
A hero saved a beauty?

251
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,270
Are you moved?

252
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,450
You know me well.

253
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,620
Although I make slow decisions,

254
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,910
once I decide,

255
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,870
it won't change.

256
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,860
Of course I know.

257
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,300
I just feel sorry for

258
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,380
Guangxi.

259
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,460
He just spent a few nice days

260
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,880
and a strong enemy came

261
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,370
and is approaching the city.

262
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,180
What are you talking about?

263
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,620
I know very well

264
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,510
what I want.

265
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,220
Okay.

266
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,420
I know

267
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,420
you love him.

268
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,730
You won't give up on him.

269
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,580
I've had enough

270
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,240
of your display of affection.

271
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,860
Anyway,

272
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,180
he puts the work

273
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,080
on the surface.

274
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,460
Even if he has a hidden intent,

275
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,830
you can't say anything.

276
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,530
Have you heard

277
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,980
from the Flower World?

278
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,430
Do you have time to meet?

279
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,580
Why?

280
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,650
Meeting you alone?

281
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:19,690
Are you going?

282
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,380
He knew I heard the news

283
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,540
of reconciliation.

284
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,820
I have to go.

285
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,510
How about I go with you?

286
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,700
It's okay.

287
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,180
He can't eat me.

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,460
Okay, be careful.

289
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,430
Call me anytime.

290
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,250
Alright.

291
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,580
Zelin.

292
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,220
It's all thanks to you

293
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,250
to come in Beijing last time.

294
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,130
Well done!

295
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,910
It's my duty. It's nothing.

296
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,250
Director, here.

297
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,060
Hello.

298
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,460
When I go to Shanghai in the future,

299
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,860
you have to take care of me.

300
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,530
Sure.

301
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,350
Yike is here.

302
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,030
Yike, you're finally here.

303
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,170
This is...

304
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,830
A small company gathering.

305
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,420
Let me introduce.

306
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Give me some face.

307
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,100
This is the director of Shanghai.

308
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,960
He has always been supporting me.

309
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,740
Yin Yike.

310
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,770
These are all old colleagues

311
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,540
in Shanghai.

312
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,990
You know a lot of them.

313
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:28,940
Yes.

314
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,580
Zelin always talks about you.

315
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,550
This is called

316
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,310
a couple will be together.

317
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,660
Yes.

318
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,410
Mr. Li came back

319
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,980
to take the Flower World case

320
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,500
under pressure.

321
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,540
So,

322
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,710
it's a hero who can't get over a beauty.

323
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,790
We broke up long ago.

324
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,820
You don't have time

325
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,620
to talk about work.

326
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,480
I'll leave now.

327
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:53,910
Excuse me.

328
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,630
Excuse me.

329
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,690
Yike.

330
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,150
Sorry.

331
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,550
I didn't expect this occasion

332
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,240
to make you so uncomfortable.

333
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,870
Please forgive me

334
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,020
if I offended you.

335
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,660
It's okay. Go back to your work.

336
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,740
Let's talk another day.

337
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,350
Wait.

338
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,700
I asked you here

339
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,340
to talk with you

340
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,310
about a real business.

341
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,090
You should know

342
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,770
about Flower World

343
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,370
agreed to reconcile, right?

344
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,740
I asked you here

345
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,660
to make use of the opportunity

346
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,700
to sign the contract

347
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,830
as soon as possible.

348
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,940
They can sign

349
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,940
a reconciliation contract so soon?

350
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,550
Don't you know how I work?

351
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,220
I've prepared the contract.

352
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,860
In the car.

353
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,380
Read it on the way.

354
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:32,980
Let's go.

355
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,930
You can't get through, right?

356
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,140
There's no signal in the elevator.

357
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,470
How can it be connected?

358
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,850
Yiran,

359
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,700
has Yike gone home?

360
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,140
She hasn't answered the phone.

361
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,340
She's not picking up.

362
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,440
What took her so long of the talk?

363
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,150
What did she go for?

364
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,430
She went to see Li Zelin

365
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,820
for the business.

366
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,500
Where is it?

367
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,530
Wait, I'll send you the address

368
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:09,930
to you.

369
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,050
Drive my car.

370
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,260
Thank you, Dad Chen.

371
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,820
Young man.

372
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,240
Give me the contract.

373
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I will take a look.

374
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,450
Don't worry.

375
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,680
Do you want to know

376
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,810
how they agreed?

377
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,380
Because I promised

378
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,970
after the reconciliation,

379
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,290
I will be the legal consultant of Flower World

380
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,020
and cut the service fee by half.

381
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,100
Of course, don't have any

382
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
mental pressure.

383
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,000
First,

384
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,730
I can really help you.

385
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,050
Second,

386
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,930
I can have a new client.

387
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,500
Yike.

388
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,860
I plan to be transferred back to Shanghai branch.

389
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,370
I want to start over with you

390
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,230
and go back to the original track.

391
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,380
Mr. Li.

392
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,350
First,

393
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,460
thank you for your dedication to our company.

394
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,420
I will report everything you devoted to

395
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,860
to the higher-ups.

396
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,220
I'll apply for

397
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,940
bonuses and allowances for you.

398
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,340
But I don't want our private affairs

399
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,870
to be associated with work.

400
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,230
Second,

401
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,150
I broke up with you

402
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,020
not because you can't go back to Shanghai.

403
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,570
It's because

404
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,820
we are not suitable for each other.

405
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,770
Yike.

406
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,770
Listen to me.

407
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,420
Li Zelin.

408
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,520
Stop pestering me.

409
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,260
We've broken up.

410
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,740
Can we all look forward?

411
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,670
Yin Yike.

412
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,810
It's just the two of us now.

413
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,420
Can you

414
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,460
stop being childish?

415
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,580
I went back to Shanghai

416
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,790
after I pushed several important cases

417
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,790
under pressure.

418
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,800
For you,

419
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,050
I asked my friends to do me favors and played nice.

420
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,380
Is this how you treat me?

421
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,630
What should I do

422
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,710
to stop you from being stubborn?

423
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,580
I'm not.

424
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,810
We've broken up.

425
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,369
I already have a boyfriend.

426
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,410
Boyfriend?

427
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,859
The little brother, Xu Guangxi?

428
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,960
Let's talk about work.

429
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,569
Show me the contract.

430
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,090
[Household Registration Booklet]

431
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,220
What do you mean?

432
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,080
Go get the marriage certificate.

433
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,960
Your dad happily

434
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,020
gave me this household registration booklate.

435
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,780
If you tell him

436
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,440
we broke up,

437
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,740
and you are being together

438
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,210
with your little boyfriend,

439
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:45,970
what will happen to him?

440
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,360
Li Zelin, are you crazy?

441
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,310
You dare not tell him.

442
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,670
You know he won't agree.

443
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,590
As you know,

444
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,010
love without parents' blessings

445
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,870
won't end well.

446
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,590
You can't leave me at work now

447
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,110
and your families like me so much.

448
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,380
You know that very well,

449
00:17:59,380 --> 00:17:59,780
right?

450
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,610
I didn't tell my dad

451
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,280
because I don't want him to worry.

452
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,340
But since it has come

453
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,000
this far...

454
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,380
Stop the car now.

455
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,820
I'll tell him when I get back.

456
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,740
Yin Yike.

457
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,140
You disrupted

458
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,200
all my life tracks.

459
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,000
I've planned everything.

460
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,310
You just gave up.

461
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,080
Have you ever considered

462
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,810
my feelings?

463
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,800
Have you considered my feelings?

464
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,350
Do you know my plan?

465
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:19,980
All right.

466
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,020
I'll pretend nothing happened.

467
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,300
Let's go back to the original track,

468
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,820
OK?

469
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,430
You've been pretending for so many days.

470
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,140
You finally said what you really want.

471
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,640
You came to me to get back together with me

472
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,100
because of your competitive spirit,

473
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,900
your discontent,

474
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
and your dignity.

475
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,540
But I'm a human too.

476
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,690
I'm not a symbol

477
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,820
of your life.

478
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,720
As long as we go back

479
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,980
to the original track,

480
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,410
we will both be happy.

481
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,850
I'm not happy.

482
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,330
Stop the car.

483
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,630
If I park now,

484
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,350
then the Flower World case

485
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,100
will be completely ruined.

486
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,660
Mr. Li,

487
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,950
from now on,

488
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,910
you don't need to mind my business.

489
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,970
Stop the car.

490
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,900
Who are you looking for?

491
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,550
Where is Mr. Li?

492
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,980
He left.

493
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,100
Did Yin Yike come here?

494
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,180
Ms. Yin?

495
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:38,980
She was here.

496
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,580
But she went out with Mr. Li.

497
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,570
Hello?

498
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,560
Yike.

499
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,420
Give it back to me.

500
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,080
Sit well.

501
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,470
Give it back!

502
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,080
Let go!

503
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,340
Li Zelin, are you crazy?

504
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,050
Let go!

505
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,900
Even if I'm mad,

506
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,700
it is because of you.

507
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,300
-Yike. -Give it to me.

508
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,250
Tell me where you are, Yike.

509
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:06,660
Yike.

510
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:11,970
Sit well.

511
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,590
Li Zelin.

512
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,290
I only thought

513
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,360
we didn't match each other,

514
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,140
but I only know now that

515
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,800
we are not from the same world.

516
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,060
I cannot look down upon you more

517
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,230
than ever.

518
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,420
Don't touch me.

519
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:22,950
Sit well.

520
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,450
Let go!

521
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,710
I will call the police if you continue this.

522
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,510
The vacation

523
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,500
and all are all over.

524
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,420
I want everything to be

525
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,910
back to the original track.

526
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,500
Sit well.

527
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,340
Yike.

528
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,280
Yike.

529
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,690
Yike.

530
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,570
Can you hear me?

531
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:56,940
Yike.

532
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,610
What happened? What happened?

533
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,980
There is an accident.

534
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,190
110?

535
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,620
There's a car accident here.

536
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,550
Guangxi.

537
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,490
What?

538
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,180
Didn't I let Guangxi drive my car

539
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,350
to save the beauty?

540
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,260
Why don't you

541
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,750
give me a ride?

542
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,540
Why would I?

543
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,500
Besides,

544
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,900
we are not on the same way.

545
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,200
You can put me

546
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,480
at the subway station.

547
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,290
Look here.

548
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,430
Hello.

549
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,060
Yiran,

550
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,100
I think there is a car accident for Yike.

551
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,600
She's on her way to the hospital.

552
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,680
A car accident?

553
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,920
How is she now?

554
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,860
I'm not sure.

555
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,380
I'm on my way

556
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,310
to the hospital.

557
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,860
Okay.

558
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,060
Send me the hospital address.

559
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,120
I will go there now.

560
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,140
What are you doing up here?

561
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,100
We are on the same way now.

562
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,740
You care about your bestie.

563
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,260
I care about my brother.

564
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,790
Let's go.

565
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,590
Sit tight.

566
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,050
[Emergency Department]

567
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,030
Hello.

568
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,420
Where is the ER?

569
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,540
The ER is over there.

570
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,140
Thank you.

571
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,810
There's nothing wrong.

572
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,670
Take more rest.

573
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,640
Does it hurt?

574
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,310
No.

575
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,700
Are you hurt

576
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,070
anywhere else?

577
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,370
I'm fine.

578
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,010
I just had a scratch on my head.

579
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,920
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

580
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,980
Do you want to

581
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,690
lie down and rest?

582
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,550
Let me help you.

583
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,360
Guangxi.

584
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,210
The doctor said

585
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,080
I'm fine.

586
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,660
I can't even imagine

587
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,110
what would happen if I lose you.

588
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,600
I'm sorry, Guangxi.

589
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,250
I shouldn't have

590
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,580
gone for Li Zelin alone.

591
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,820
In the future...

592
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,220
There's no in the future.

593
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,980
I won't allow you to have

594
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,970
any more danger.

595
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,730
I promise you.

596
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,260
I promise you.

597
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,770
I will take good care of myself.

598
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,540
For you,

599
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,630
I will cherish myself.

600
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,850
Don't worry.

601
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,690
The police just called

602
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,780
and told me.

603
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,090
They are fine.

604
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,460
I just don't understand.

605
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,620
Why did a car accident occur

606
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,820
on the way to get a marriage certificate?

607
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,500
What did you say?

608
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,560
What certificate?

609
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,070
Zelin told me

610
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,230
he would marry Ke.

611
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,780
So I gave him the...

612
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,740
What marriage?

613
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,780
I...

614
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:27,860
Well...

615
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,780
Zelin said

616
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,860
he would marry Ke.

617
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,980
So I gave him

618
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,410
the household registration booklet.

619
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,290
Why didn't you tell me

620
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,460
such a big thing?

621
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,620
I couldn't find you.

622
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,780
You were dancing square dance

623
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,570
to grab the central position then.

624
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:37,980
Tell me.

625
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,940
No, this...

626
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:39,940
I know.

627
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,700
They had a fight.

628
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,290
But when people were young,

629
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,910
everybody will fight.

630
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,490
Right?

631
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,070
Besides,

632
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,020
Zelin was very sincere.

633
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,330
He almost knelt down to me.

634
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,210
He said he wanted to give Ke a surprise.

635
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:52,870
Do you think

636
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,580
I can refuse to give the household registration booklet

637
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,250
to him?

638
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,910
But...

639
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,540
Besides,

640
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,050
they've been dating for four years.

641
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,360
Ke is over 30 years old.

642
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,500
If she dosn't marry Zelin,

643
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,590
who will she marry?

644
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,330
You should ask Ke.

645
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,020
Ke will definitely agree.

646
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,460
I'm her father. I know her best.

647
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,980
Go now.

648
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,530
Yike.

649
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,280
I'm warning you.

650
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,080
You stay away from her.

651
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,190
I'm sorry.

652
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,910
I was too impulsive today.

653
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,050
Later,

654
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,290
when the police comes to ask,

655
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,090
I hope...

656
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,610
You know

657
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:35,980
my job

658
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,280
doesn't allow to have a criminal record.

659
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,760
Are you trying to change her statement?

660
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
What does it have to do with you?

661
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,280
You say what does it have to do with me?

662
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,750
-You hit me! -Stop!

663
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,150
Stop!

664
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,040
Guangxi, stop!

665
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,340
This is the hospital.

666
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,740
Pay attention to your emotions

667
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
and cooperate with our inquiry.

668
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,060
Show me your ID.

669
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,860
Who called the police?

670
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,790
I did.

671
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,050
Who drove?

672
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,080
Me.

673
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,490
What's your relationship with the car owner?

674
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,850
I have nothing to do with him.

675
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,420
What's your relationship with him?

676
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,510
He's my boyfriend.

677
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,080
What did you say?

678
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:25,810
Yin,

679
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,420
let's talk at home.

680
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,390
Well, Yike.

681
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,660
Did I hear it wrong?

682
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Who are you calling your boyfriend?

683
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,230
-Uncle. -Shut up.

684
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,320
I'm asking you.

685
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,410
Dad.

686
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,030
You heard it right.

687
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,910
Zelin.

688
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,980
What...

689
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,210
What happened?

690
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,060
Weren't you

691
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,210
getting the marriage certificate?

692
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,990
How did

693
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,270
a car accident happen?

694
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,890
Did you two fight?

695
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,190
Uncle.

696
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,780
It was just an accident.

697
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,230
No.

698
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,140
An accident.

699
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,450
Dad.

700
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,340
I broke up with Zelin for a long time.

701
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,270
I didn't ask you.

702
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,990
Alright.

703
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:09,910
Yin,

704
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,020
let's talk at home.

705
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,610
OK?

706
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,650
Calm down.

707
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,660
This is the hospital.

708
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,240
The car owner.

709
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,170
Come out with us for your statement.

710
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:16,760
Okay.

711
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,120
It's my fault

712
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,960
that I didn't tell you.

713
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,680
I'll accept whatever you say.

714
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,250
But as you heard,

715
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,110
I'll tell you the truth.

716
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,220
I'm with Guangxi.

717
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,500
But he's your younger brother.

718
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,740
It'll be embarrassing if this gets out.

719
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,620
Uncle,

720
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,590
we are not related by blood.

721
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,670
We are serious

722
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,420
to be together.

723
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,950
What are you serious about?

724
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,380
You just graduated.

725
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,830
You're still a kid.

726
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:57,930
Do you have money?

727
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,820
Do you have a car? Do you have a house?

728
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,890
You have nothing.

729
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,600
How can you marry my daughter?

730
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,140
What can you give my daughter

731
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,230
to live a good life?

732
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,810
Dad.

733
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,510
Okay, I've figured it out.

734
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,740
You want to marry my daughter with my house,

735
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,180
right?

736
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Just like your father,

737
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,020
you have so many tricky thoughts.

738
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,890
Yin,

739
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,660
what are you talking about?

740
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,180
Am I wrong?

741
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:19,900
Dad.

742
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,060
How can you say that to Guangxi?

743
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,140
What should I say about him?

744
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,540
What do you want me to say?

745
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,140
You know that I had many conflicts

746
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,940
with Li Zelin,

747
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,660
but you didn't listen at all.

748
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,780
You even gave him the household registration booklet.

749
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,980
I'm in my thirties.

750
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,620
Have you ever asked how I feel?

751
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
I just want you to be happy.

752
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,310
And live...

753
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,390
To make me happy.

754
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,180
Yes.

755
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,920
You did it for your sake.

756
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,560
You think Li Zelin is good.

757
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,970
You didn't ask me.

758
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,030
I just want to find someone

759
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,730
-who I love, dad. -No, you...

760
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,610
I love Yike.

761
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,130
I will never let her go.

762
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,560
She's your sister, you bastard!

763
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,370
What are you doing, Yin?

764
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,650
Are you satisfied now?

765
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,580
You didn't do anything wrong?

766
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,260
Who found Zelin back?

767
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,420
Who gave him the household registration booklet?

768
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,740
Don't embarrass yourself.

769
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,310
OK?

770
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,300
Let's talk at home.

771
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,100
Let me ask you.

772
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,180
-Let me ask you. -Let's talk at home, okay?

773
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,460
Let me ask you.

774
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:09,840
Do you know the thing

775
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,460
about your son?

776
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,520
Let's talk at home.

777
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,300
Are you okay?

778
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,140
I'm fine.

779
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,550
I'm sorry, Guangxi.

780
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,700
I thought my dad would be mad,

781
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,000
but I didn't expect him to be like this.

782
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,680
It doesn't matter.

783
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,260
These are not important.

784
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,370
I just want you to be okay.

785
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,250
Ms. Yin.

786
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,640
Let me confirm

787
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,420
if he lured you into the car.

788
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,080
Did he restrict your freedom?

789
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,940
No.

790
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,860
Take a look at this record.

791
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,860
If it's confirmed,

792
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,920
you can sign here.

793
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,890
Let's go.

794
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,700
Mr. Li,

795
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,210
take a look at this record.

796
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:29,940
If it's confirmed,

797
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,340
-sign here. -How are you?

798
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,560
Does your head hurt?

799
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,820
Are you all right?

800
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,580
Are you hurt?

801
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,110
I'm fine.

802
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:35,990
Yiran,

803
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,010
she's taken a CT scan.

804
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,010
Nothing serious.

805
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,790
That's good.

806
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,640
Li Zelin, I...

807
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,980
The police are here.

808
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,040
What are you doing?

809
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,110
Forget it.

810
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,770
I don't want to go deeper in it anymore.

811
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,650
It's meaningless.

812
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,060
No, Yin Yike.

813
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:52,940
Can you stop

814
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,170
being such a nice man?

815
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,230
Such a scumbag.

816
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,050
If you let him go today,

817
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,370
he will go mad with you tomorrow.

818
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:57,970
Forget it.

819
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,660
I just don't want to get involved with him

820
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,950
because of this.

821
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,610
All right.

822
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,580
It's right not to get involved.

823
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,810
There's no need to get involved with a scumbag like him.

824
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,570
No need.

825
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,460
Are you okay?

826
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,610
Okay. Then take her

827
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,230
to rest.

828
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,420
Drive my car. Hurry.

829
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,380
-We're leaving. -Go back and rest early.

830
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,660
OK. Rest early.

831
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,160
Take care.

832
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,090
Go back and rest.

833
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,250
Drive carefully.

834
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,460
Calm down.

835
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,640
Nothing.

836
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Stop right there!

837
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,980
Mr. Li,

838
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,340
I have a question.

839
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,830
Did she ask you to ask?

840
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,190
That's not important.

841
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,820
As a lawyer,

842
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,390
you took half of the lawsuit

843
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,700
to threaten your ex-girlfriend

844
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,830
out of your own wish,

845
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,960
do you have professional ethics?

846
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,420
You failed to get back together with your ex

847
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,460
and dragged her

848
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,430
to get in the car,

849
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,310
and even wanted

850
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,370
to die together with her.

851
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:46,770
You...

852
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,580
This is murder, you know?

853
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,100
Please don't talk nonsense.

854
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,230
Nonsense?

855
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,850
This is the truth.

856
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,270
Listen, Li Zelin.

857
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,150
Don't think

858
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,040
you are a lawyer

859
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,020
and you can just seek into

860
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,850
the law's loopholes.

861
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,980
If it happens again,

862
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,150
I won't let you off.

863
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,740
Ms. Qin,

864
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,140
please pay attention to

865
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,940
your words.

866
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,020
Or I can sue you for defamation.

867
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,250
You even sue me for defamation?

868
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:06,780
Defamation?

869
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,390
You scared me to death.

870
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,180
You're bullying us ordinary people.

871
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,140
Don't you know the law?

872
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,260
In the time of self-media, let me tell you.

873
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,800
Guys,

874
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,200
can you be quiet?

875
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,200
This is a public place.

876
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,860
Hospital.

877
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,650
By the way, Mr. Li,

878
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,790
please go to the traffic police station

879
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,720
and pay the fine.

880
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,860
I'll let you know

881
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,700
about the specific conditions.

882
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,380
Okay.

883
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:29,980
You ran fast this time.

884
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,640
Let me tell you.

885
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,910
I'm sorry.

886
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,260
Are you still angry?

887
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,390
Let's go.

888
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,320
I'm so mad.

889
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,650
How could Li Zelin

890
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,260
do that?

891
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,210
Exactly.

892
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,220
Why didn't I know

893
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,220
he was such a scumbag?

894
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,720
Scumbag.

895
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,480
Him?

896
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,540
He's still a lawyer?

897
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,260
Does he deserve it?

898
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,610
No.

899
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,750
All men are bad.

900
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,890
All men are bad.

901
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,080
Are you still angry?

902
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,230
It's not about whether I can calm down or not.

903
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,540
But the problem of Yike hasn't been solved yet.

904
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,300
It won't be solved

905
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,120
if you think about it here.

906
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,410
Let's go back first.

907
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:04,990
Wait.

908
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,020
Why are you sitting here again?

909
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,990
I lent my car

910
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,380
to my friend.

911
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:09,800
You...

912
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,730
What are you doing? Are you leaving me here?

913
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,170
Fine.

914
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,710
Let me send you home.

915
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,310
I will.

916
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,500
Stinky man.

917
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,510
Stinky man.

918
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,510
Thank you.

919
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,090
Does it hurt?

920
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Sorry, Guangxi.

921
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,090
Why are you suddenly apologizing?

922
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,990
I told you not to be impulsive.

923
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,520
But I acted on impulse myself.

924
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,750
Do you regret it?

925
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,020
No.

926
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,500
Then why are you sorry?

927
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,679
You looked cool

928
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,730
when you appeared to fear nothing just now.

929
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,199
No.

930
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,060
It was a mess.

931
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,820
Such a mess.

932
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,260
Maybe there are too many

933
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,800
unexpected situations.

934
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,449
We expected

935
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,469
many ways to confess to uncle.

936
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,370
Maybe the way tonight

937
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,469
is the best result.

938
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,060
What are you going to do later?

939
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,620
You go home first.

940
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,590
I want to go home and comfort my dad.

941
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,220
But he was so angry just now.

942
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,110
How about

943
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,100
you don't go back

944
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,900
tonight?

945
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,220
After Uncle calms down,

946
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,060
we'll explain to him.

947
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,530
You

948
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,860
stay away from

949
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Yin these days.

950
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,600
Okay.

951
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
Promise me.

952
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,370
No matter what he says,

953
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,700
don't talk back.

954
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,260
No more conflicts.

955
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,100
What about Aunt Lan?

956
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,970
I guess

957
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,820
my mom knew it long ago.

958
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,470
On the day of Uncle's birthday,

959
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,380
she suddenly came to my house

960
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,940
and asked me if

961
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,800
I like someone.

962
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:38,800
Guangxi.

963
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,710
Can you tell me?

964
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,330
You really have

965
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,730
someone you like, right?

966
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,530
Mom,

967
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,790
I do have someone I like.

968
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,450
But now

969
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,150
it's not a good time

970
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,290
to tell everyone.

971
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,140
I hope

972
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,700
you can get along

973
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,830
with this girl well.

974
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,860
Protect her.

975
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,140
Don't let her get hurt.

976
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,400
Don't be like your father.

977
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,990
Of course I didn't put it bluntly.

978
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,260
But she insisted on

979
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,420
treating her better

980
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,100
and said to be loyal.

981
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,020
I guess

982
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,150
she must have known it.

983
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,310
Just like when you broke up,

984
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,390
she wouldn't ask you

985
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,640
if you didn't tell her.

986
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,940
It's time for your medicine.

987
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,470
No.

988
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,710
Have some water.

989
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,780
No.

990
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,770
I've raised my daughter for over 30 years.

991
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,240
This...

992
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,430
She was tricked

993
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,020
by your kid.

994
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,480
Tell me.

995
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,100
I'll just get stuck.

996
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,510
I don't like that.

997
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,940
What's wrong with my son?

998
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,700
Is he not outstanding or not ambitious?

999
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,500
Is he ugly?

1000
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,540
Or have bad character?

1001
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,100
As for Li Zelin,

1002
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,570
you keep calling him a good son-in-law.

1003
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,280
Fine.

1004
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,980
He lied to you to get the household registration booklet

1005
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,510
and threatened Yike to get married.

1006
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,800
And he almost got herself killed.

1007
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,820
The household registration booklet?

1008
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,720
So Li Zelin

1009
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,700
hurried to go to the Civil Affairs Bureau

1010
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,560
with my sister,

1011
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,980
and he drove crazily, right?

1012
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,600
No.

1013
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,310
Well...

1014
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,460
Zelin is

1015
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,990
quite stable normally.

1016
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:52,810
Well,

1017
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,870
Li Zelin

1018
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,040
is in his thirties.

1019
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,420
Why is he always a kid

1020
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,300
in your mouth?

1021
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,560
Isn't he a kid?

1022
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,590
He is a kid.

1023
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,690
And he tricked you for the household registration booklet

1024
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,490
and took my sister for a car race.

1025
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,020
Dad, think about it.

1026
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,900
How many years has he been with my sister?

1027
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,600
He didn't know

1028
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,400
my sister is allergic to pollen.

1029
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,170
And

1030
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,580
the golf bag he gave you.

1031
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,550
Ask yourself.

1032
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,870
Do you have time to go?

1033
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,040
Do you have money

1034
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,370
to go golfing with our family background?

1035
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,250
I really don't know

1036
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,100
if he was in a relationship

1037
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,700
with his identity

1038
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,780
or my sister?

1039
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,740
Okay, okay.

1040
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,380
Well,

1041
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,050
Li Zelin has some problems.

1042
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,720
Then your kid

1043
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,540
is fine?

1044
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,000
What's wrong with Guangxi?

1045
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,420
What's wrong with Guangxi?

1046
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,070
Tell me.

1047
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:30,880
No.

1048
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,180
Is it possible

1049
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,380
that Ke

1050
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,930
wants to get rid of Li Zelin

1051
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,690
and take Guangxi as the disguise?

1052
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,080
They are acting.

1053
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,230
Dad, your imagination

1054
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,090
is really good.

1055
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,170
How could it be Guangxi?

1056
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,660
Tell me.

1057
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,950
He's just a kid.

1058
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,970
He knows nothing. What do you think?

1059
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,780
They are not suitable for each other.

1060
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,850
Why not?

1061
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,250
Tell me.

1062
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,010
Did you know

1063
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,820
about them?

1064
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,880
You hide it from me?

1065
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,460
No.

1066
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,240
Dad, you...

1067
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,040
To be honest,

1068
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,660
I don't know. You.

1069
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,130
Tell me the truth.

1070
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,550
No.

1071
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,060
Do you know

1072
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,370
you're ruining your sister in this way?

1073
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,190
Do you know?

1074
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,500
You are talking about my sister.

1075
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,160
Don't get me

1076
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,020
involved.

1077
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:21,700
If I don't get you involed

1078
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,720
who else is here?

1079
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,250
Dad.

1080
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,490
You still know that I'm your dad?

1081
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,840
Don't you feel ashamed?

1082
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,040
Dad.

1083
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,130
Good luck to you.

1084
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,940
Yike.

1085
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,020
How about I talk to him for you?

1086
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,010
Aunt Lan.

1087
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,710
I've made you worry about this.

1088
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,910
I'll talk to dad myself.

1089
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:28,920
Dad.

1090
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,050
Dad.

1091
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,020
Open the door.

1092
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,420
I have something to tell you.
