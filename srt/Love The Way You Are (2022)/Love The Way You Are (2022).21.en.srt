Dad.

00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,550
Dad!

18
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,490
Open the door.

19
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,890
I have something to tell you.

20
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,310
Dad.

21
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,060
I know the person I chose

22
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,950
may not be

23
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,440
the one you want me to have.

24
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,820
But I know

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,860
what I want.

26
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,900
I also have the ability

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,829
to be responsible for my decision.

Yike was frightened today.

Could you please

36
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,630
take care of her?

37
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,680
Thank you, mom.

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,070
We're a family.

39
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,860
Don't worry.

40
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,160
I'll take a look at her.

I want to live elsewhere for a few days.

I'd like to have some words with you.

48
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,540
Actually, I had been looking for a chance

49
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,250
to tell you.

50
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,500
I didn't expect that you had already known.

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,220
Nothing can be hidden

52
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,220
from you.

53
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,220
In the beginning,

54
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,340
I didn't know what to do either.

55
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,990
After all, to an outsider,

56
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,190
you two are siblings.

57
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,690
Besides, your age and work

58
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,860
are so different.

59
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,900
What if you two

60
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,370
gets together on impulse,

61
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,540
then quarrels and breaks up?

62
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,980
Which side should I pick?

63
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm sorry, Aunt Lan.

64
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,620
Yike.

65
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,120
I just want to ask you one question.

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,220
Have you thought it through with Guangxi?

67
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,930
Are you aiming for a long-term relationship?

68
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,390
When will you get married?

69
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,970
When will you have a baby?

70
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,180
Or is it just

71
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,470
a date for fun?

72
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,090
To be honest, Aunt Lan,

73
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,300
no one knows about the future.

74
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,470
But at this moment,

75
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,220
I'm determined.

76
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
I want to move forward with Guangxi.

77
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,790
Will you support us?

78
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,140
Ke.

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,660
I can't

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,850
answer this question.

81
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,890
Neither can your father.

82
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,870
Only your heart can answer you.

83
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,610
If you think you are suitable for each other,

84
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,770
you can go on.

85
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,330
All right.

86
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,930
You are

87
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,930
just like

88
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,130
when I was young.

89
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,260
When I met your dad,

90
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,820
I did everything I could

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,480
to move forward with your dad.

92
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,020
Why did you

93
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,300
choose dad back then?

94
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,620
Well, back then,

95
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,530
you know what?

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,260
There would be gossips

97
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,650
around remarriage.

98
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,460
But your dad was not afraid at all.

99
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,700
Whenever there was someone gossiping,

100
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,900
he just rushed over

101
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,460
and protected me.

102
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,790
He loved this family

103
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,650
very much.

104
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,080
Guangxi was still young at that time.

105
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,960
We had three children.

106
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,740
Your father said,

107
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,620
"Once you marry me,

108
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,380
we will be a family.

109
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,640
All three kids need to eat well."

110
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,900
You know what?

111
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,020
He drove for long hours everyday.

112
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,930
He traveled back and forth.

113
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,980
All because he wanted

114
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,310
to bring home the bacon.

115
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,740
Yeke.

116
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,270
I'll fight it

117
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,060
for this family

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,480
and you.

119
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,580
Regardless of all the gossips,

120
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,020
as long as you want to,

121
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,900
just do it bravely.

122
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,900
I'll always support you.

123
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,420
Aunt Lan.

124
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
All right.

125
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,990
I understand, Aunt Lan.

126
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,490
I just...

127
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,310
I just

128
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,270
worry about dad.

129
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,390
He has high blood pressure

130
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,050
and can't sleep well at night.

131
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,290
He's also worried about my stuff...

132
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,980
I...

133
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,750
Alright.

134
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,650
Look at you. You kid.

135
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,380
You just worry too much.

136
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,500
You've been worried about everyone in the family since young.

137
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,390
Don't worry.

138
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,020
Now I'm here.

139
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
I'll take care of this family.

140
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,800
You can move out

141
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,620
and relax for a few days.

142
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,020
Besides,

143
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,870
your dad can't turn the world upside down.

144
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,270
I'm really happy

145
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,120
to be with you for all these years.

146
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,550
You are turning old, yet still like a child.

147
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,100
I knew you were eavesdropping.

148
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,400
If you really want to hear it,

149
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
just open the door and get in.

150
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,320
If she dares to move out,

151
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,780
I won't take her as my daughter anymore.

152
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,460
That's weird.

153
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,780
Aren't you annoyed by Yike?

154
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,860
Now that she's moving out, you won't be bothered by her anymore.

155
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,440
You can go anywhere you want.

156
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,810
You can also travel.

157
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,090
What travel?

158
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,180
You asked her quite a lot.

159
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,630
When will you get married?

160
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,760
When will you have a baby?

161
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,970
Let me tell you.

162
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,580
I won't support

163
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,380
her relationship with your son.

164
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,299
Yin,

165
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,190
let me remind you again.

166
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,820
The children have grown up.

167
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,330
They have their own lives.

168
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,350
Can we

169
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,260
mind our own businesses?

170
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,020
Let it go.

171
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,510
If you talk less and support more,

172
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,770
when you get old,

173
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,820
maybe

174
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,540
they will come to care for you.

175
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,090
I don't need their care.

176
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,420
I'm doing fine.

177
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,630
Just don't get me angry.

178
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,070
Hello, Guangxi.

179
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,850
How's it going?

180
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,340
I'm fine.

181
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,510
I want to live elsewhere for a few days.

182
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,880
Did something happen?

183
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,540
Why did you

184
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,850
make such a decision suddenly?

185
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,910
Well, dad is still

186
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,000
quite angry now.

187
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,740
I just feel like,

188
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,610
given his temper,

189
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,470
if I stay at home,

190
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,630
it'll only goad him.

191
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,410
If I live somewhere else for a few days,

192
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,020
he could also have some space

193
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,980
to calm down.

194
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,130
Okay, I got it.

195
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,450
But where can you go

196
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,500
in such a hurry？

197
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,620
I'll stay at Yiran's place for a few days

198
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,940
and see how it goes.

199
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,010
Yike.

200
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,180
Come to my place.

201
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,820
Your place?

202
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,780
In this situation,

203
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,680
how can I not be with you?

204
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,180
I said before,

205
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,640
no matter what problem,

206
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,440
we have to face it together.

207
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,100
Besides, I need an opportunity

208
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,360
to let uncle know

209
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,880
that we can be happy

210
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,180
together.

211
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,740
Can you give me this chance?

212
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,980
What about Chen Musen?

213
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,870
You just stay here for a while.

214
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,620
We'll figure out

215
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,900
a way later on.

216
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,900
Don't think too much.

217
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,970
Have a good sleep.

218
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,420
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

219
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,610
You too.

220
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,930
Good night.

221
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,310
How's everything going?

222
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,440
Not too bad.

223
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,510
I used to think it was crowded at home,

224
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,530
and dad was strict,

225
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,110
so I've always wanted to move out and live on my own.

226
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,940
But time has gone so fast

227
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,020
for the days

228
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,420
when the whole family spent together.

229
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,750
I just didn't expect

230
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,630
I would move out in such a situation.

231
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,030
You don't have to be so strong.

232
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,570
Cry if you want.

233
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,220
Guangxi.

234
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,540
I just didn't expect

235
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,450
it's that hard

236
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,480
to be myself.

237
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,310
Don't be afraid.

238
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,210
I'll always be with you.

239
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,540
Indeed,

240
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,820
I have to work hard

241
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,930
for the life I want.

242
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,410
I'm glad you're here.

243
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,740
Thank you, Guangxi.

244
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,290
Your tears are ruining your makeup.

245
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,910
No, they're not.

246
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,900
Now,

247
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,270
we need to solve

248
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,490
the biggest problem.

249
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,100
What is it?

250
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,740
You mood.

251
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,930
Yibo,

252
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,740
I'll be living elsewhere for a while.

253
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,540
I've put the bills

254
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,270
for water, gas, electricity and property management fee

255
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,100
in the cabinet

256
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,810
by the door.

257
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,500
Tell me if you don't have enough money.

258
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,360
Be good.

259
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,050
Take care of Aunt Lan and dad.

260
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,410
Aunt Lan.

261
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,840
Good morning.

262
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,490
I knew it last night.

263
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,180
From now on,

264
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,090
you're the backbone of this family.

265
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,180
Do you want a towel?

266
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,140
Sure.

267
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,490
I'll get you a pink one.

268
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,660
One is enough, right?

269
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Try it.

270
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,010
Not too bad.

271
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,640
I'll get you a new one.

272
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,560
One for you and one for me.

273
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,080
We're almost done, right?

274
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,150
It occurred to me

275
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,260
that I need to change my slippers.

276
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,350
Can you get one for me?

277
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,620
It's over there.

278
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,780
Thank you.

279
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,420
A pink one

280
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,440
and a gray one.

281
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,660
They are couple shoes.

282
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,140
We can put them

283
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,080
in our new house.

284
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,780
Let's look at something else.

285
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,250
Okay.

286
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,790
I'm just moving in for a while.

287
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,350
Do you need to buy this much?

288
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,170
Yes.

289
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,070
Because it's you who will move in.

290
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,940
We haven't bought a toothbrush and toothpaste.

291
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,569
Watch the steps.

292
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,780
Are you still worried about uncle?

293
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,859
I wonder

294
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,650
how he is now.

295
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,460
Hello, Aunt Lan.

296
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,890
Hi, Ke.

297
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,600
Are you done moving in?

298
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,500
Almost.

299
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
How is dad?

300
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,140
Your dad's bark

301
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,070
is worse than his bite.

302
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,630
It should be fine. I'm here.

303
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,510
I think

304
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,180
we can't be

305
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,210
too easy on him.

306
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,300
We have to give him some hard time.

307
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,610
I have a way

308
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,930
to make him realize

309
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,210
you've grown up.

310
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,660
You're no longer that little girl

311
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,460
who listened to him all the time.

312
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,180
Thank you, Aunt Lan.

313
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,340
Don't mention it.

314
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,860
We're a family.

315
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,260
Most importantly,

316
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,110
your dad and I

317
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,740
really hope you can

318
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,420
get along with Guangxi.

319
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,540
Got it?

320
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,760
Got it.

321
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,200
Okay, I have to hang up.

322
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,340
Bye.

323
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:11,990
How is it?

324
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,080
What did my mom say?

325
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,890
Aunt Lan said

326
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,260
she's going to let dad know

327
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,140
I'm no longer a child

328
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,070
who listens to him for everything.

329
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,780
What do you think she will do?

330
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,220
If my mom

331
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,820
said so,

332
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,620
I think she's going to take some special measures.

333
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,680
Special measures?

334
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,650
Your daughter won't come back.

335
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,490
Stop looking.

336
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,370
Who cares.

337
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,400
I don't care.

338
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,850
What are we having for dinner?

339
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,050
I want to have a drink.

340
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,170
Listen, Yin.

341
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,790
Today is the last time

342
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,910
I buy food for you.

343
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,580
You can cook whatever you want.

344
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,890
You...

345
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,870
What do you mean?

346
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,020
You neither like your daughter

347
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,070
nor your son.

348
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,460
I suppose

349
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,060
you don't like me as their mom either.

350
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,940
I'm angry with our kids.

351
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,230
I'm not mad at you.

352
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,180
Why are you making a fuss?

353
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Yin,

354
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,900
I am

355
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,620
a narrow-minded person.

356
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,840
If you don't get along with our kids,

357
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,390
that means you're picking on me.

358
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,150
Tell me.

359
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,870
what else can you do

360
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,340
other than forcing our kids?

361
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,130
Do you know

362
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,780
which drawer in the kitchen

363
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,270
to put oil and flour in?

364
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,970
Which drawer

365
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,140
to put all the other condiments in?

366
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,260
Also,

367
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,070
when do we need to pay

368
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,780
for the water, electricity and gas bills?

369
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,940
When do you need to buy more

370
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,970
if we're running out of daily necessities?

371
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,390
This is your business.

372
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,380
Why are you asking me?

373
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,340
How would I know?

374
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,730
I'm telling you.

375
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,500
All these things

376
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,690
were taken care of by Yike.

377
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,480
Why are you surprised?

378
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,520
It's weird.

379
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,130
Don't you want to be the head of the family?

380
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,970
Since you want to be the head of the family,

381
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,990
I think

382
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,220
you need to take care of

383
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,100
everything in the family.

384
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,280
Take care of yourself.

385
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,320
I'm leaving.

386
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,810
Where are you going?

387
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,980
I...

388
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,300
My friends are waiting for me

389
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,220
to do public square dancing.

390
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,620
I have to be at the center.

391
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,760
What are we having for dinner?

392
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,550
It's your call.

393
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,240
Just dance.

394
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,440
Let me starve to death.

395
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,740
The dumplings are in the fridge.

396
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,900
Help yourself.

397
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,980
All of you

398
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,210
are troublesome.

399
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,730
Guangxi.

400
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,020
Do you think it's inconvenient for you

401
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,780
since I moved here all of a sudden?

402
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,220
No.

403
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,670
I'm worried about Chen Musen.

404
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,060
After all, you are renting

405
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,460
this apartment with him.

406
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm afraid he might feel uncomfortable.

407
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,020
Don't worry.

408
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,530
As long as we treat him to food,

409
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,620
he will owe us a favor

410
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,820
so that he'll agree.

411
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,050
We've been friends for years.

412
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,660
How come you're setting me up?

413
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,220
Just think about it.

414
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,880
I've been friends with Chen Musen for years.

415
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,020
He will agree.

416
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,460
Girls before bros.

417
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,540
Aren't you afraid he'll think

418
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,000
you put girls before bros?

419
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,420
Speaking of "girls before bros",

420
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,900
he did worse than me at that.

421
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,970
I don't even have a girlfriend.

422
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,700
How can I put girls before bros?

423
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,120
I'd better find a suitable place

424
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,250
somewhere nearby as soon as possible.

425
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,180
Where do you want to live?

426
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,140
Stop.

427
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,080
Yike.

428
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,660
Just stay here.

429
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,820
I have to prove

430
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,170
to my old pal

431
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,020
that I'm definitely not

432
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,230
someone who puts girls before bros.

433
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,010
I can do anything

434
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,210
for my brother.

435
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,550
Then can we skip

436
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,580
this meal as well?

437
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,580
No way.

438
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,990
We still have to go through the procedure.

439
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,820
Come and see what you want to eat.

440
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,620
Garlic.

441
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,660
Garlic?

442
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,960
I just feel

443
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,660
I'm dreaming these days.

444
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,120
Now I feel

445
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,340
I'm like

446
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,520
a rebellious child.

447
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,250
I'm doing crazy things.

448
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,650
Listen carefully.

449
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,310
I'll only say this once.

450
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,380
Don't be afraid.

451
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,350
Don't think too much.

452
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,440
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

453
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,200
If you are sad,

454
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,500
I'll get you out of there

455
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,630
as soon as possible.

456
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,770
I'm the elder sister.

457
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,990
Why have you been

458
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,320
teaching me these days?

459
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,220
Didn't we agree?

460
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,200
You are an adult outside,

461
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,830
but you are a child when you're with me.

462
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,140
You can be

463
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,990
unreasonably

464
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,140
troublesome,

465
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,020
so that I can prove

466
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,130
how special I am.

467
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,650
If I become

468
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,250
unreasonable troublesome,

469
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,770
will you tolerate me?

470
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,940
Why not?

471
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,060
Are you sure?

472
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,080
I mean,

473
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,590
from now on,

474
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,690
wherever you go,

475
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,080
report to me.

476
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,500
If you don't answer it

477
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,560
after three calls,

478
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,180
I'll show up in front of you.

479
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,690
There you go.

480
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,920
How about this?

481
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,600
You're quite sincere.

482
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,340
Then I'll be

483
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,670
closely watched by you.

484
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,260
You can rest assured.

485
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,940
Guangxi.

486
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,420
Do you think

487
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,690
we will get better and better?

488
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,800
This sentence

489
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,500
shouldn't be a question.

490
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,950
We will get better and better.

491
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,120
You're done showering?

492
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,460
Thank you for putting away my stuff

493
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,920
and making the bed for me.

494
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,550
I've changed the bed sheet for you.

495
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,300
If you can't fall asleep,

496
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,500
there's warm milk on the bedside table.

497
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,480
What about you?

498
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,870
I'm going to sleep on the floor.

499
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,660
Remember to call me

500
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,860
if you need anything.

501
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,460
Good night.

502
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,440
Good night.

503
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,660
You're making it quite cozy there.

504
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,230
Good night.

505
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,320
Good night.

506
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,290
How can I deal with my father-in-law?

507
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,210
Please help me.

508
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,450
Let's meet downstairs

509
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,860
after work tomorrow.

510
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,650
Sure.

511
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,000
I'll teach you some exclusive experience tomorrow.

512
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,640
OK. OK. Leave it to me.

513
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,340
I heard that Miss Yin

514
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,210
went to celebrate with the lawyer yesterday.

515
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,610
Why did it end up in a mess?

516
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,810
It's said they also went to hospital.

517
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,860
Unbelievable.

518
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,820
You tell me.

519
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm afraid Miss Yin

520
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,400
has overplayed her hand.

521
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,810
If she can't deal with Flower World,

522
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,780
the Live Stream Department will be dismissed.

523
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,180
On the other hand, it's a good thing.

524
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,580
The cake is just this big.

525
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,890
It'll better for our Marketing Department

526
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,950
if fewer people are going to share it.

527
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:57,900
Yeah.

528
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,660
Come in.

529
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,960
Miss Yin.

530
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,260
Can you explain

531
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
why Mr. Li quit for no reason?

532
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,160
Flower World refused to

533
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,580
move forward with the negotiation because of this.

534
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,100
May I ask

535
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,670
if you are playing house?

536
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:26,690
Frank,

537
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,140
I told you

538
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,700
solving problems through personal relationship

539
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,810
wouldn't work.

540
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,870
Let me make it clear.

541
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,860
Mr. Li and I

542
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,260
have no personal relationship.

543
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,340
We're trying to find a solution

544
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,430
on Flower World's case.

545
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,580
We'll solve it as soon as possible.

546
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,710
As soon as possible?

547
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,420
How soon?

548
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,370
Frank,

549
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,710
there have been many problems

550
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
ever since the Live Stream Department

551
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,740
was established.

552
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,810
Now,

553
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,680
Ms. Zheng took the blame and resigned.

554
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,460
I think we'd better

555
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,420
dismiss the Live Stream Department.

556
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,350
What did you say?

557
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,260
Ms. Zheng resigned?

558
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,180
Or what?

559
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,900
If she doesn't resign,

560
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,530
how can Frank

561
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,660
explain to the Board?

562
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,180
And you.

563
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,400
Why do you think

564
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,430
you can still

565
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,420
stand here?

566
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,090
Frank,

567
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,300
this has nothing to do with Ms. Zheng...

568
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,830
Zheng Ying was responsible

569
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,840
for the case of Flower World.

570
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,980
She took the blame and resigned.

571
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,680
Miss Yin,

572
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,580
no matter what you do,

573
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,180
this problem

574
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,210
needs to be solved as soon as possible.

575
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,860
Otherwise, the entire Live Stream Department

576
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,120
will be dismissed too.

577
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,220
Ms. Zheng,

578
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,500
there's still a chance

579
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,300
to turn things around.

580
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,360
Why did you resign?

581
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,380
I know you have a chance to turn the tide.

582
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,150
So,

583
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,840
I want to buy you a chance.

584
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,030
But Ms. Zheng...

585
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,590
Well...

586
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,860
Don't feel stressful.

587
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,460
It has nothing to do with you.

588
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,870
It was my fault.

589
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,220
This is all your hard work

590
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,680
at SC for all these years.

591
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,350
It's not important.

592
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,690
Once you make a mistake,

593
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,290
everything will be cleared.

594
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,940
Especially for us working mothers,

595
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,870
we need to work harder than others.

596
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,220
Kong Xianzhe

597
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,180
has been

598
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,330
eyeing my position.

599
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,100
All of a sudden,

600
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,840
I don't want to fight him anymore.

601
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,500
I might as well retire quickly

602
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,240
and save myself some dignity.

603
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,580
But Ms. Zheng,

604
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,340
I really don't want you to leave.

605
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,300
You've been my role model at career

606
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,680
all these years.

607
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,400
Once you leave,

608
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,180
I don't know

609
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,510
where I should work towards in the future.

610
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,420
Yike.

611
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,430
Don't feel sorry for me.

612
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,530
My child is still young.

613
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,350
It's good for me

614
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,700
to accompany him for a few years

615
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,980
when he needs me the most.

616
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,660
I can also

617
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,550
recharge myself

618
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,610
during this break.

619
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,310
When he grows up,

620
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,060
maybe I will

621
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,420
start a business again.

622
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,060
If it were in the past,

623
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,460
I would worry that you would think too much.

624
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,460
Now you know

625
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,620
how to throw a punch.

626
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,380
Good luck.

627
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,300
As a professional woman,

628
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,250
just follow

629
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,580
what you think is right.

630
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,290
Wish you success.

631
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,710
There's news on Weibo.

632
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,660
Look.

633
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,040
The top lawyer quit quickly.

634
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,140
I think

635
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,900
this case

636
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,220
is unfavorable to SC.

637
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,070
I always thought

638
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:57,840
there was something wrong

639
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,080
with Li Zelin.

640
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,580
But at this critical moment,

641
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,410
should we take a step back,

642
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,550
give in

643
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,890
and solve the compensation first?

644
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,580
But...

645
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,670
He's so phony.

646
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,990
If we give in to him,

647
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,480
isn't that indulging him?

648
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,370
We must have our dignity.

649
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,310
But we can't

650
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,400
only have dignity.

651
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,410
What's more, we must win the lawsuit.

652
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,460
Otherwise, we,

653
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,630
including Yike,

654
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,930
will lose our job.

655
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,280
I'm sorry

656
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,330
for making you worried.

657
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,060
Yike.

658
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,740
The storm is coming.

659
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,070
We'll fight it with you.

660
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,660
Yes.

661
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,460
Yike.

662
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,060
What should we do now?

663
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,580
We can only negotiate again.

664
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,890
Yurou,

665
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,540
help me raise this to the company

666
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,940
to see if there are any alternative lawyers.

667
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,410
OK.

668
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,980
Shen Xin.

669
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,380
Sort out all the documents

670
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,510
about Flower World.

671
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,740
Let's review the whole thing.

672
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,380
Okay.

673
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,700
Collect the public opinions online

674
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,690
and give me a report on that.

675
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,820
Okay, leave it to me.

676
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,410
Chacha.

677
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,420
Do you know

678
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,720
anyone from new media?

679
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,220
I might need some writers.

680
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,530
It's okay.

681
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,510
It's okay, Uncle Chen.

682
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:17,900
See you.

683
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,510
See you.

684
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,030
Okay.

685
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,500
What's wrong?

686
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,220
Yibo, I was wrong.

687
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,700
The chocolate flavored ice cream

688
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,030
is not delicious at all.

689
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,700
It contains anti-fatty acid

690
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,840
and is not nutritious at all.

691
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,100
Besides, it can cause cancer and weight gain.

692
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,560
What are you trying to say?

693
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,030
No wonder Yike

694
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,520
wants to break up with him.

695
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,160
It's Li Zelin.

696
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,120
You should teach him a lesson.

697
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,950
I will.

698
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,810
That scumbag.

699
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,660
If anyone

700
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,450
had notified me that day,

701
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,700
I would have torn his hand.

702
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,140
Yeah, so come over quickly.

703
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,780
I'm afraid Guangxi

704
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,100
can't handle him alone.

705
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,020
You're right.

706
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,260
I'm going to pick up my sister.

707
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,520
I'm gonna hang up. Bye.

708
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,300
I heard that Ms. Zheng also left.

709
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,780
Do you need any help

710
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,100
from Miss Qin?

711
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,080
Of course.

712
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,500
Our Live Stream Department

713
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,020
is like an isolated island in the ocean.

714
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,000
We need love and support.

715
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,699
Actually, after Ms. Zheng left,

716
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,030
I finally see it clearly

717
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,820
that instead of being timid,

718
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,280
it's better to fight back.

719
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,389
On the company level,

720
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,760
I've found a new lawyer.

721
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,380
The preparation is ready.

722
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,710
As for the rest,

723
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,070
we'll try our best and leave it to fate.

724
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,989
I find you are different

725
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,770
than before.

726
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,739
Why?

727
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,940
You've become stronger.

728
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,060
People will grow up.

729
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,380
We need to learn

730
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,989
how to

731
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,320
roll with the punches.

732
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,380
That's right.

733
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:51,780
Anyway,

734
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,540
let me know if you need any help.

735
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,949
Miss Qin is always here.

736
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,360
That's right, Yike.

737
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,140
Don't worry.

738
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,500
We're all by your side.

739
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,540
Good luck.

740
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,990
No problem can't be solved

741
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,790
by a barbecue.

742
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,740
That's right.

743
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,320
If it doesn't work, we'll have one more.

744
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,520
Guangxi.

745
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,700
I'm here to pick you up.

746
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,490
Is everything going well at work?

747
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,220
Don't worry. I'm working on it.

748
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,000
What are they doing here

749
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
like bodyguards?

750
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,660
Today,

751
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,350
we're special Black Knights.

752
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,450
Our company

753
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,240
doesn't have any business

754
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,130
but charity.

755
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,080
Since everyone is here.

756
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,430
I need your idea

757
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,260
on something.

758
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,900
I'll treat everyone to coffee.

759
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,420
Sister,

760
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,810
I'm here to take you home.

761
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,190
Yibo, you are here too.

762
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,910
We can discuss it together.

763
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:50,890
Let's go.

764
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,300
That's what happened.

765
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,070
So I invited everyone here today

766
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,510
to help us work a way out.

767
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,230
Well, I think

768
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,530
it's actually quite easy.

769
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,330
Just one word.

770
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,340
Elope.

771
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,660
After you elope,

772
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,580
your parents will be anxious.

773
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,660
Then it'll be settled.

774
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,500
Yes.

775
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,300
It can also show

776
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,730
your attitude and determination to be together.

777
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,060
Run away... It may be helpful.

778
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,580
But if you come back,

779
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,410
based on my understanding of my dad,

780
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,850
Xu Guangxi, you may

781
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,960
need to spend the rest of your life on a wheelchair.

782
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,080
How about having a shotgun wedding?

783
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,410
Xia Weimian,

784
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,070
can you give

785
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,170
some practical ideas?

786
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,640
They haven't had that relationship.

787
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,120
How can they have a shotgun wedding?

788
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,890
Well, I'm just saying...

789
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,840
Enough.

790
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,590
Shotgun wedding

791
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,370
doesn't work for us.

792
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,130
Look.

793
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,120
I have a small suggestion.

794
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,630
After all,

795
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,660
I'm the only one here

796
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,990
who has become a father.

797
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,100
Let me say something

798
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,140
as a parent.

799
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,550
When it comes to old people,

800
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,740
you'd better not deal with them in a hard way.

801
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,660
They'll get sad.

802
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,060
It'll backfire.

803
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,040
If you elope and come back,

804
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,620
then what are you going to do next?

805
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,020
Right?

806
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,930
First,

807
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,900
you must have a good attitude.

808
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,760
Only sincerity

809
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,880
can solve the problem.

810
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,720
You're really

811
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,970
talking nonsense.

812
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,380
How can they make up with him

813
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,780
without a good attitude?

814
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,240
At worst, when Guangxi sees her dad,

815
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,980
he should just accept whatever he does to him.

816
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,380
I think it might work.

817
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,200
Based on my understanding of my dad,

818
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,020
his bark is actually

819
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,150
worse than his bite.

820
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,210
I think

821
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,430
Chen Yegang was right.

822
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,220
Let's not focus on

823
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,850
aggressive ways

824
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,300
to exacerbate the conflict.

825
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,930
What if

826
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,980
he really gets angry?

827
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,380
Then what should they do?

828
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,430
Yeah.

829
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,570
Don't hurt

830
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,590
his feelings.

831
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,300
Right?

832
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,060
In my opinion,

833
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,170
you can use

834
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,620
some tricks

835
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,180
to let his dad accept you.

836
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,260
For example, you can

837
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,540
give him what he likes, right?

838
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
Like what?

839
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,310
My dad's hobby is

840
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,740
drinking, bragging,

841
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,180
playing indoor golf,

842
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,790
and scolding me.

843
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,460
In my opinion,

844
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,500
to give him what he likes

845
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,170
is to make Yike's dad

846
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,510
feel Guangxi's love

847
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,810
to Yike.

848
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,980
If he sees

849
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,100
they live a happy life

850
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,730
together,

851
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,510
then he should be happy too.

852
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,260
Yeah, exactly.

853
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,950
What's the most important thing for parents?

854
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,950
Parents just

855
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,210
want their kids

856
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,260
to live a happy life.

857
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:18,740
Right?

858
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,900
So as long as

859
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,590
you show enough sincerity,

860
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,580
gradually,

861
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,420
he'll feel

862
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,610
that you will make his daughter

863
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,610
live a happy life.

864
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,150
As long as he feels it,

865
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,090
he will accept you naturally.

866
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,820
I know that.

867
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,540
I'll try my best to let Uncle Yin know

868
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,370
I really want Yike to be happy.

869
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,330
Time will prove everything.

870
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,990
I think we can

871
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,140
really think more about

872
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,860
giving him what he likes.

873
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,420
I agree.

874
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,870
Do you have any ideas?

875
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,650
Think about the way

876
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,540
my dad live with Aunt Lan...

877
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,750
Your eyes are cramping?

878
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,040
♫Travels to the end♫

879
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,980
♫Of the whole universe♫

880
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,720
♫Together, we will♫

881
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:37,160
♫Guard the whole one world♫

882
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,670
When I was giving my opinion,

883
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,770
you didn't criticize

884
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,850
or dis me.

885
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,220
Does that mean

886
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,450
you agree with me?

887
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,740
Kind of.

888
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,920
Now I think

889
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,270
nothing is impossible.

890
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,810
This is a huge change.

891
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,630
Does that mean

892
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,960
-In other aspects, you're also... -Stop.

893
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,750
My values and bottom lines

894
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,820
will never change.

895
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,940
Actually, I didn't

896
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
drive here today.

897
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,580
Then why did you come to the parking lot?

898
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,140
Last time you gave me a ride on your motorcycle.

899
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,350
I felt very excited.

900
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,730
Since it's a good weather today.

901
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,660
It's also cool, right?

902
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,460
Why don't we go for another ride?

903
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,740
Sorry.

904
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,710
I didn't ride my motorcycle today.

905
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:35,610
Bye.

906
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,180
Well, can you drop...

907
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,150
