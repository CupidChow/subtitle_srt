Dad.

17
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,250
Since you're so curious about him,

18
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,710
I'll introduce him to you.

19
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,470
Okay.

20
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,620
What a cute kid.

21
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,550
He's so pretty.

00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,340
Is he your son?

Right?

24
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,100
You're still young,

You're hiding it from your family,

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
and lying outside there.

32

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
It was my fault last time.

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,900
could you do me another favor?

We agreed not to treat him unfairly.

50

Just this time only.

51
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,590
OK?

52
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,579
A lot of things

53
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,130
happened between Miss Yiran and me.

54
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,380
There were some misunderstandings.

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,829
Today is a festival.

56
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,260
I want to take this chance

57
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,260
to apologize to her,

58
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,120
and explain it.

59
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,080
It's also the first time

60
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,620
for Yike and me to celebrate a festival together.

61
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,380
How about this?

62
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,060
You celebrate the Children's Day first.

63
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,530
I'll celebrate the Valentine's Day first.

64
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,380
Let's switch back next time, okay?

65
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,620
I'm begging you.

66
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,560
Just this time only. I'll be quick.

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,740
As soon as it's finished,

68
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,070
I'll take Yu back, okay?

69
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,370
Although you're going to celebrate the Valentine's Day,

70
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,300
I still have to tell you something.

71
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,550
Be honest

72
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,780
to the woman you like.

73
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,620
Otherwise, the Valentine's Day

74
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,480
might turn into April Fool's Day.

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,360
Okay, I got it.

83
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,640
There should be someone who can go out to make a living.

84
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,820
But he stays at home every day.

85
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,500
He just needs a baby bottle.

86
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,590
We have a daughter,

87
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,720
but she's like a son.

88
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,250
We live in the same house,

89
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,890
yet we seldom see each other.

90
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,980
Dad, when you talk,

91
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,380
don't make oblique comments on me, okay?

92
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:16,780
Besides,

93
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,820
independent women in the new era

94
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,140
need to go out to make achievements,

95
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,480
especially someone like my sister.

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,280
Besides, it's a festival today.

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,980
Festival?

98
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,260
Why does she celebrate the festival alone?

99
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,440
I mean,

100
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,900
in terms of the nature of my sister's work,

101
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,820
won't she be

102
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,930
busier during

103
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,900
holidays and festivals?

104
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,640
That's it.

105
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,390
You all treat me like a fool, right?

106
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,659
You all lied for her.

107
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,670
I can't eat anymore.

108
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,980
You stubborn old man.

109
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,340
If you don't eat, fine.

110
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,000
Alright.

111
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,200
You just don't eat?

112
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,659
What a stubborn old man.

113
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,320
Come on, Yibo.

114
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,280
Just eat.

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,450
Thank you, Aunt Lan.

116
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,520
There's an event tonight.

117
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,160
Keep an eye on Dad.

118
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,540
Fortunately,

119
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,940
Guangxi will come later.

120
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,500
Otherwise, these dishes will be wasted.

121
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,140
That's right.

122
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,140
Fortunately, Guagnxi will be back.

123
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,159
I have a date with Yike tonight.

124
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,370
I'm not going back for dinner.

125
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,220
Cover for me.

126
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,370
Aunt Lan.

127
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,290
Guangxi texted me on WeChat and said

128
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,450
that he needs to work overtime.

129
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,260
He can't come back.

130
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,980
Really?

131
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,650
Yes.

132
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,260
I haven't

133
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,860
seen him for days.

134
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,060
Be careful.

135
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,620
Yibo,

136
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,730
tell me the truth.

137
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,710
Is Guangxi in love

138
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,830
so he asked you to cover for him?

139
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,490
Aunt Lan, I'm devoted to study.

140
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,560
I know nothing.

141
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,130
Really?

142
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,100
Yes.

143
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,700
Then why did you

144
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,000
hold your phone and click on red packets?

145
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,170
Because today is a festival,

146
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,510
and young people like to

147
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,170
send some red packets to celebrate it.

148
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,020
By the way, Aunt Lan,

149
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,540
have you devised

150
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,820
a square dance recently?

151
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,440
Are you in the lead position?

152
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,690
How do you know?

153
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,250
Because I saw

154
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,090
Ms. Zhang and Mrs. Wang

155
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,740
both compete for the lead position.

156
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,380
Really?

157
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:32,990
Yes.

158
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,260
Ms. Zhang has been thinking

159
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,460
about my lead position these few days.

160
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,090
No, no.

161
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,390
I need to dress up.

162
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,380
Enjoy your meal.

163
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:38,950
Okay.

164
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,700
How can this be?

165
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,510
How can I

166
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,860
let them take away my lead position?

167
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,460
No way.

168
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,590
Then I...

169
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll clean off the table.

170
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,420
You'd better restrain yourselves.

171
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,220
My free cover volume is limited.

172
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,180
What kind of festival is it?

173
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,970
People spend it in pairs.

174
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,390
Seriously.

175
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,300
Yibo,

176
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,020
I haven't thanked you for the live stream.

177
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,220
How about I treat you to dinner tonight?

178
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,350
I don't have time. I'm not going.

179
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,000
Godfather,

180
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,860
I really hope Chen

181
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,580
can pursue his love successfully soon.

182
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,870
Then I'll be extra,

183
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,450
and I can come here more often to play.

184
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,150
How can you be extra?

185
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,929
You are my darling.

186
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,140
Wait.

187
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,130
When did I agree

188
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,330
to be your godfather?

189
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,860
Why has my luck

190
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,350
been so bad lately?

191
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,260
I've been rejected both for having a mother and a godfather.

192
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,660
You have to defeat me first, and we'll talk.

193
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,730
I won.

194
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,260
Play another round by yourself.

195
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,590
Okay.

196
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,850
Where are you?

197
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,380
I'm almost there.

198
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
I'll wait for you.

199
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,740
Guangxi.

200
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,140
Are you sure you have

201
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,200
nothing to tell me?

202
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,990
The plot today

203
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,180
is too exciting.

204
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,430
I'll give it to you

205
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,460
with the Valentine's Day gift.

206
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,200
A gift?

207
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,500
Drive slowly. Be careful.

208
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,740
[Li Zelin]

209
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,660
Hello, who is that?

210
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,260
Zelin.

211
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,220
This is your Uncle Yin.

212
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,420
Uncle Yin.

213
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,160
What's the matter?

214
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,820
Nothing.

215
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,460
I just want to ask you whether you've been

216
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,140
very busy with your work recently.

217
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,940
Just as usual.

218
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,250
Now that I've been promoted to partner,

219
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,420
I have to do some of the work personally.

220
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,480
Congratulations.

221
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,660
It's good for young people to be ambitious.

222
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,030
But you can't ignore

223
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,120
your family

224
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,920
just because of work.

225
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,490
Look. Both you and Ke

226
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,100
are not very young now.

227
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,130
When are you going to

228
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,690
get it done?

229
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,990
Uncle,

230
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,400
don't you know it?

231
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,940
What do I know?

232
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,640
Did you two fight?

233
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,490
Sort of.

234
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,840
Zelin,

235
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,520
I have to blame you.

236
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,620
You're a man.

237
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,830
Why are you angry

238
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,890
with a little girl?

239
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,690
That's right.

240
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,030
Ke

241
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,770
is spoiled by me.

242
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,370
She is bad-tempered sometimes.

243
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,460
You're a man.

244
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,130
Just give in to her.

245
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,000
Ke gives you

246
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,440
enough dignity outside.

247
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,260
Right?

248
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,140
Besides,

249
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,670
if she really pisses you off,

250
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,000
just tell me.

251
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll scold her.

252
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,460
You're right.

253
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,020
Zelin,

254
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,660
I just want to ask you something.

255
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,820
Do you love

256
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,020
Ke sincerely?

257
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,030
Don't worry.

258
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,790
I'm serious about her.

259
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,670
I'm not worried.

260
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,170
Those are the words I want to hear from you.

261
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,720
Goodbye.

262
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,510
Lan.

263
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,260
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,900
My waist is not feeling well today.

265
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,930
I won't dance today.

266
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,590
You dance.

267
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:39,950
Okay.

268
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:40,980
I'll go check on my son.

269
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,580
Okay.

270
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:41,940
Bye.

271
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,300
Take care.

272
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,180
Bye. Go ahead.

273
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
See you next time.

274
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:44,940
Okay.

275
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,520
Hello.

276
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,220
Yike.

277
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,900
I still want to persuade you.

278
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,600
This is something between Guangxi and me.

279
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,530
I know what to do.

280
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,850
What else can I do?

281
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,570
I can only accept it.

282
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,240
Yike.

283
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,220
All right.

284
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,380
I'm hanging up. Bye.

285
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,170
Besides,

286
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,280
independent women in the new era

287
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,420
need to go out to make achievements,

288
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,780
especially someone like my sister.

289
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,500
Besides,

290
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,790
it's a festival today.

291
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,930
Why does she celebrate the festival alone?

292
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,080
I mean,

293
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,620
in terms of the nature of my sister's work,

294
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,430
won't she be

295
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,550
busier during

296
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,710
holidays and festivals?

297
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,450
That's it.

298
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,580
Aunt Lan.

299
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,930
Guangxi texted me on WeChat

300
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,560
and said

301
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,270
that he was working overtime. He can't come back.

302
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,320
Dad.

303
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,950
Dad.

304
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,660
Your mouth...

305
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,060
Dad.

306
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,910
Dad.

307
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,320
Xu Guangxi.

308
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,830
You're here.

309
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,580
This is...

310
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,380
This is the boy between me and...

311
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,590
Yu.

312
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,740
Call her mom.

313
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,540
Mom.

314
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,150
No. Wait.

315
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,480
Godfather.

316
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,650
This pretty lady must be my godmother.

317
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,500
While one is sitting at home,

318
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,280
a child shows up unexpectedly.

319
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,340
Watch your head.

320
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,990
Okay.

321
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,630
Where are we going?

322
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,380
I'll decide.

323
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,200
You decide.

324
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,650
I'll listen to you today.

325
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,400
It's a festival today.

326
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,570
People have to queue up outside.

327
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,410
How about

328
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,590
going to your home?

329
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,280
My home?

330
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,700
It's not good.

331
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:37,720
My home

332
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,310
is too messy.

333
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,190
If you come,

334
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,770
I need to tidy up a lot of things.

335
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,890
If we're in a bad mood, it'll affect the atmosphere.

336
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,620
How about...

337
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,420
How about we go to

338
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,020
the bar which you often go to?

339
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,680
Good. You're really hiding something.

340
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,790
But the bar...

341
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,150
is too noisy.

342
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,520
If we celebrate the festival together,

343
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,120
it'll be more cozy and romantic to celebrate it

344
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,910
at home.

345
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,660
Something's wrong with you.

346
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,540
You're a Club Queen

347
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,780
and Dancing Princess.

348
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,460
You suddenly want to enjoy the warmth at home.

349
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:04,980
You...

350
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,810
It's the opposite of your image.

351
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,940
Isn't it nice if I treat you specially?

352
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,180
Stop talking. Let's go to your place.

353
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,620
It's really not good.

354
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,990
Let's discuss it again.

355
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,780
No, it's not like that.

356
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,460
You don't welcome me?

357
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,220
No, absolutely not.

358
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,150
Absolutely not.

359
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,720
It's getting late.

360
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,320
If we go home,

361
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,050
after buying ingredients, cooking,

362
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,140
and cleaning up,

363
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,740
it might be nine o'clock when we can finally eat.

364
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,220
There will be no festival atmosphere.

365
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,680
Well...

366
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,740
Next time. Okay?

367
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,500
Next time, I'll definitely invite you

368
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,700
to my home for a visit.

369
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,830
Today,

370
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,090
let's find a place to eat.

371
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,010
I have something to tell you.

372
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,620
Okay.

373
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,280
Yu's hairstyle

374
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,560
looks like Chen Musen's.

375
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,170
Are you sure

376
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,230
he's Chen Ye's son?

377
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,460
Didn't someone suspect

378
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,660
he was my son just now?

379
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,150
Who suspected he was yours?

380
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,020
I'm sorry.

381
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,380
The surprise has become a scare.

382
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,610
Not really.

383
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,750
Yu is so cute.

384
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,520
At most,

385
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,660
an unexpected gain, right?

386
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,060
You like kids so much?

387
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,300
Then we...

388
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,860
What are you thinking?

389
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,840
Come on.

390
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,290
Have a blueberry to shut your mouth.

391
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,460
Godfather, godmother.

392
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,020
If you keep

393
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,020
flirting with each other like this,

394
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,210
I'll starve to death soon.

395
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,820
Have some crispy pork first.

396
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,350
The cake will be ready soon.

397
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,300
Come on.

398
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,520
It smells good.

399
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,400
Godmother, help me play the game.

400
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,590
I help you play it?

401
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,190
Okay. You are...

402
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,330
You are this boy.

403
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,830
Awesome, right?

404
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,710
Yes.

405
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,090
How is the kid?

406
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,540
Well,

407
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,740
Xu Guangxi's son

408
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,950
is really smart.

409
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,260
I was curious

410
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,300
who his father is.

411
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,110
It looks like

412
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,480
that's the answer.

413
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,340
No wonder

414
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,560
Xu Guangxi has got mature so early

415
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,990
and he's so considerate.

416
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,830
Right?

417
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,280
How are you

418
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,910
getting along with that kid?

419
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,460
Does it matter how I'm getting

420
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,320
along with him?

421
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,520
The point is how Yike

422
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,010
is getting along with him.

423
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
That makes sense.

424
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,960
Why did you ask?

425
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,590
I'm a boss.

426
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,630
I care about

427
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,990
the employees' life.

428
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,220
I actually want to tell you something.

429
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,110
What is it?

430
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,220
I want to tell you

431
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,450
Yu...

432
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,870
Do you have

433
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,100
mobile phone syndrome?

434
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,460
You want to run away again?

435
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,190
No, no, no.

436
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,280
Absolutely not.

437
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:29,980
It's off.

438
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,130
It's off now.

439
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,750
It's off.

440
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,440
That's more like it.

441
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,520
Let's drink.

442
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,900
I stood you up twice.

443
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,220
I was wrong.

444
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,990
I'll make it up to you today.

445
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,670
I won't go anywhere.

446
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,360
I'll accompany you to the end.

447
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,010
You hypocrite.

448
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,760
Let's see how long you can hide it from me.

449
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,280
Really?

450
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,950
But I am someone

451
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,980
who cares about the sense of ritual.

452
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,340
It's the Double Seventh Festival.

453
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,720
Let's play something big.

454
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,350
No problem.

455
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,310
You...

456
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,780
No matter what you want to do today,

457
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,840
I'll do it with you till the end , okay?

458
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,700
Even if you want a star,

459
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,100
I'll take it down for you.

460
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,720
So manly.

461
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,300
That's what I like.

462
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,220
Today, I will tear off

463
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,980
your hypercritical mask.

464
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,960
Well, are we really going to do this?

465
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,620
There are so many people here.

466
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,850
That's right.

467
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,310
It's getting late.

468
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,800
You should go home, right?

469
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,070
Got it.

470
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,330
I understand.

471
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,380
It's just a fling.

472
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,290
It's okay. If you don't want to do it,

473
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,150
then forget it.

474
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,830
Qin Yiran, I like you!

475
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,130
I've liked you

476
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,350
since I first saw you.

477
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,620
You're so beautiful.

478
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,660
You're both pretty and cool.

479
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,540
You're the type of girl whom all boys

480
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,810
would like.

481
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,900
But I...

482
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,870
I know I'm unreliable.

483
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,540
I always stood you up.

484
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,300
But I really have a reason for it.

485
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,590
I'm not confident.

486
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,500
I feel a lot of pressure.

487
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,990
Actually, I've always wanted to tell you.

488
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,480
But

489
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,420
I couldn't say it.

490
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,370
But now I've figured it out.

491
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,480
If I want to pursue you decently,

492
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,470
I have to show you

493
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,420
who I really am.

494
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,460
So, Qin Yiran,

495
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,720
I'm telling you today.

496
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,640
So silly.

497
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,600
It's so funny.

498
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,540
Not bad.

499
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,040
Young man.

500
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,640
Not bad.

501
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,420
Young man.

502
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,800
You're brave. Come on!

503
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,010
Come on!

504
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,980
The more touching your words were,

505
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,940
I think the more you look

506
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,120
like a hypocrite.

507
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,310
What do you think?

508
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,540
I just want to give you a piece of advice.

509
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,340
If you want to abandon your wife and children,

510
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,700
pretend to be single and be a playboy,

511
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,230
you're not qualified.

512
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,120
I just wanted to tell you about it.

513
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,020
When are you going to tell me?

514
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,100
You'll say it when I become

515
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,840
a mistress?

516
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,580
No, I...

517
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,570
I'm not married now.

518
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,120
I've got divorced.

519
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,970
Lying. Just keep lying.

520
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,910
I'm not lying.

521
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,180
I wanted to tell you about it.

522
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,870
Look at me.

523
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,290
I've just got divorced and have to raise a child.

524
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:53,820
You said

525
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,140
you didn't want to get married or have children.

526
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,060
How could I tell you?

527
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,390
Stop quibbling.

528
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,330
Yibo, do you have time?

529
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,760
I'll treat you to dinner.

530
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,380
Two pieces of clothes.

531
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,280
What? Xia Xiaomian, I'm handling the purchased goods.

532
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,810
I…

533
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,420
What’s wrong?

534
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,140
Yibo, I'm scared.

535
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,300
It seems a pervert knocked on my door.

536
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,530
Wait. I'll be right there.

537
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,790
Call the police first.

538
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,920
Wait for me.

539
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,520
Xia Xiaomian, I'm here to save you!

540
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,820
Xiaomian!

541
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,630
Xiaomian!

542
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,280
Yibo, you're here.

543
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,050
Are you okay? Are you okay?

544
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,780
Are you okay?

545
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,490
Per-...

546
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,940
Pervert! Pervert! Pervert!

547
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,270
No pervert! No pervert!

548
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,920
I lied to you.

549
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,840
Miss, you're messing with me again.

550
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,100
I wanted to give you a surprise.

551
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,990
What surprise? This is a scare.

552
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,260
I came here without finishing

553
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,390
handling the goods.

554
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,010
But you still came.

555
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,460
Alright, don't be angry.

556
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,260
Sit down.

557
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,130
Take a break.

558
00:25:59,150 --> 00:25:59,670
I've prepared

559
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,830
so much food for you.

560
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,140
Come on. Have a seat.

561
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,260
There are crayfish.

562
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,270
There are more.

563
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,300
I'll start eating first.

564
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,830
Why is there a cake?

565
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,970
Because I want to celebrate

566
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,640
something happy with you.

567
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,520
Thank you.

568
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,380
Yibo.

569
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,600
Since I came back from abroad,

570
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,700
except for Guangxi, you've been the one

571
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,060
who treats me the best.

572
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,900
When I was attacked by the netizens last time,

573
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,320
you saved me.

574
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,510
And you helped me

575
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,140
while I was looking for a job.

576
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,940
Thank you, Yibo.

577
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,630
It's good that you know it.

578
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,520
Don't make such a

579
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,120
mistake again in the future.

580
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,100
I won't make this mistake again.

581
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,830
Pinky swear.

582
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:55,980
Come on.

583
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,980
Blow out the candles.

584
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,010
Make a wish. Birthday.

585
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,810
What candle?

586
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,270
Why is there no candle?

587
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,950
What?

588
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,440
Take this as a substitute.

589
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,120
A candle for making a wish.

590
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,860
Why should I make a wish?

591
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,900
This cake...

592
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,830
Isn't it your birthday today?

593
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,570
Today

594
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,930
is the Double Seventh Festival, the Valentine's Day.

595
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,720
It's okay, anyway.

596
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,440
It's a festival after all.

597
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,630
Let's eat.

598
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,280
You still know to come back?

599
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,730
You scared me.

600
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,340
Why are you still up?

601
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,920
I didn't mean to scare you.

602
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,100
Couldn't you see me, such a big living man?

603
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
I don't know where

604
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,040
the two kids are.

605
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,020
You always come back late

606
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,650
if you go square dancing.

607
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,480
Do you still remember

608
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,080
there's a living man at home?

609
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,490
Today,

610
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,060
who pissed you off?

611
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,900
You didn't get the lead position

612
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,090
for the square dance today?

613
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,370
It can't be yours every day.

614
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,870
Right.

615
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,900
I also went to

616
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,150
see Guagnxi.

617
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,280
Did Guangxi make you angry?

618
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,570
Nowadays, no kids are easy to deal with.

619
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,780
Guangxi is kind of a considerate child.

620
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,460
No, you...

621
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,790
What's wrong?

622
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,530
If he has gone too far,

623
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,470
I'll go find him.

624
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,850
What happened?

625
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,300
What's wrong with that?

626
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,760
This...

627
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,140
Why is there so much wine on the table?

628
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,940
What's wrong?

629
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,960
What a poor memory.

630
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,790
What's the date in two days?

631
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,820
It's your birthday. I know.

632
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,580
There's no need

633
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,360
to buy so much wine.

634
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,220
So you remember it.

635
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,980
I want to

636
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,110
invite my buddies

637
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,940
to have a drink

638
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,460
and have a chat together.

639
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,340
This is not your style.

640
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
Don't you always say

641
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,590
your old buddies

642
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,980
either like to show off

643
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,090
or gossip about others,

644
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,340
and that you don't want to

645
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,490
be with them?

646
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,470
Why do you think of treating them to a drink?

647
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,430
I want to have a party this year.

648
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Don't worry. Don't worry.

649
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,140
I'll prepare for it.

650
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,540
After my birthday,

651
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,830
if my son passes the postgraduate entrance exam,

652
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,160
and my daughter gets married with Zelin,

653
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,640
I'll be waiting to have grandchildren.

654
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,260
What a happy ending.

655
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,330
I'm tired.

656
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,540
I'm going to bed first.

657
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,500
If they

658
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,000
have a daughter,

659
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,680
and she's as pretty as my own daughter,

660
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,810
how nice it would be.

661
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,320
Maybe they'll have fraternal twins.

662
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,930
Date?

663
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,970
Stop asking.

664
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,500
Just look at me.

665
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,380
Don't you know?

666
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,880
It's over.

667
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,080
Besides, Qin Yiran

668
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,170
knows that the child is mine.

669
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
So Yiran knows it.

670
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,920
I think she knew it long ago.

671
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,740
How could she not know it?

672
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,320
What happened to you?

673
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,130
I'm fine. When a sprinkling truck

674
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,180
passed by,

675
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,310
I failed to dodge it.

676
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,520
After the bad luck, good luck will come.

677
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,600
Dad Chen, you...

678
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,330
I didn't expect you

679
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,630
to have

680
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,580
such a big child.

681
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,810
Let alone you,

682
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,380
I didn't expect it, either.

683
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,620
when he first came out,

684
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,560
he was so small,

685
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,780
like a little mouse.

686
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,320
In a blink of an eye,

687
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,700
he has grown so much. He's five years old now.

688
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,900
A five-year-old kid is most sensitive.

689
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,830
What did I do tonight?

690
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,320
I was really out of my mind.

691
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,860
Chen Ye.

692
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,260
Well...

693
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,320
Nothing.

694
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,390
You want to ask about his mother, right?

695
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,610
It's okay.

696
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,940
It's okay to ask that.

697
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,240
His mother...

698
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,610
I mean...

699
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,420
Not long after Yu was born,

700
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,660
she found someone more suitable.

701
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,820
So Yu doesn't have much

702
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,080
concept about mother.

703
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,020
I didn't want to force her, either.

704
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,130
So later,

705
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,830
after we parted peacefully,

706
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,340
I was the one to raise the child.

707
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,540
But I think it's good.

708
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,050
Right?

709
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,410
Thanks to Yu,

710
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,770
who has tortured me and given me

711
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,540
harsh training constantly these two years,

712
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,420
now I'm able to control

713
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,140
you kids, right?

714
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,710
It's okay.

715
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,500
In the future,

716
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,220
if you are too busy,

717
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,060
send the kid here.

718
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,770
We'll take care of him for you.

719
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,420
No, no, no.

720
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,520
I can't bother you.

721
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,340
I'll take him back home.

722
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,820
Good night.

723
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,420
I'll go check.

724
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,580
Dad Chen.

725
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,760
Today, Yu said

726
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,620
if you could marry

727
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,380
the pretty lady and make her become his mother,

728
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,580
he would forgive you.

729
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,900
I have to go. Good night.

730
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,070
Mom.

731
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,420
I know

732
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,790
she'll be a good mother.

733
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,190
But I have no choice.

734
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,770
Your father

735
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,100
doesn't deserve her.

736
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
Sorry, Yu.

737
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,270
I lost your mother again.

738
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,850
Stop wiping the table.

739
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:10,659
Take a rest.

740
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,480
The Double Seventh Festival feast

741
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,300
became a happy meal for children.

742
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,159
It's good.

743
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,790
Yu is so cute.

744
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,050
I quite like him.

745
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,270
It's not easy

746
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,120
for Chen Ye

747
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,500
to bring him up alone.

748
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,469
I think

749
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,159
he's quite a responsible man.

750
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,460
I should go now.

751
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,130
Chen Musen

752
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,139
will be back soon.

753
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,040
Don't you want to see the surprise

754
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,590
I've prepared for you in the room?

755
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,190
It contains the destiny

756
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,650
that has tied us together.

757
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,750
Open it.

758
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,570
This was our first time to meet each other

759
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,170
when I came back from abroad.

760
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,770
I found your lipstick.

761
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,020
What about this?

762
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,140
The entrance of the convenience store.

763
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,800
Someone borrowed my phone.

764
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,120
What about this?

765
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,620
The swing.

766
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,140
Do you really think

767
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,200
I didn't record it?

768
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,120
I didn't like rain,

769
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,450
but because of you,

770
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,810
I think a rainy day is beautiful, too.

771
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,740
This was my first time

772
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,200
to use a red umbrella.

773
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,750
That day,

774
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,780
I felt awkward.

775
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,740
In the salty sea breeze,

776
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,460
we had the first

777
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,030
kiss that tasted like cola.

778
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,760
Thank you, Guangxi.

779
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,970
Owned by Yin Yike exclusively.

780
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,100
How are you

781
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,620
going to repay me?

782
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,550
Are you tired?

783
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,990
No.

784
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,280

Hello.

815
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,260
I'd like a strawberry milkshake.
