Yike

26
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,820
had worked in the Marketing Department for many years.

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,729
She has been transferred

to a new department, Live Stream Department.

You're welcome.

Thank you.

00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,470
Mr. Kong.

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,900
I think your subordinates

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,420
are really awesome.

38
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,850
Miss Yin is very straightforward.

She drank a glass of baijiu without hesitation.

40

Miss Yin.

41
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,610
You're beautiful.

42
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,380
You have a good face shape,

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,020
and your eyes are prettier.

44
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,540
I think she can

45
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,500
be a live streamer.

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,230

48
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,810

Mr. Xu.

51
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,820
Stop joking.

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,740
I won't take over

53
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,940
my colleagues' jobs.

54
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,579
But my department signed

55
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,170
some talented live streamers.

56
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,780
If you can help them

57
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,840
hit the headlines,

58
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,220
we will double our KPI.

59
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,070
Is she bargaining with me?

60
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,740
Miss Yin.

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,660

Besides,

63
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,980
Mr. Xu is sophisticated.

64
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,900
If he says you can do it,

65
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,100
maybe you're really suitable for it.

66
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,090
She's definitely suitable for that job.

67
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,690
We can talk about work later,

68
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,579
right?

69
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,180
Mr. Xu, cheers.

70
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,140

-Nice to meet you. -So beautiful.

Miss Yin.

74
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,570
I think you shouldn't refuse immediately.

75
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,500
To be honest,

76
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,050
from your face,

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,770
I can see you'll be famous.

78
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,740
I know how to read palms too.

79
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,620
Can I have a try?

80
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,260
Here.

81
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,960
Let me read your palms.

82
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,760
This hand is really soft.

83
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,250
This hand...

84
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,920
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,610
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,340
Don't you know how to be a waiter?

87
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
My new suit.

88
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,090
Are you okay?

89
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,450
It was splashed.

90
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,579
Have you ever been trained?

91
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,500
Leave here.

92
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,579
You didn't even wipe the chair for me.

93
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,700
Forget it.

94
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,630
I won't sit here.

95
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,810
Don't be upset.

96
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,650
Here.

97
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,890
I'm sorry for my treat.

98
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,710
I'm sorry for my treat.

99
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,450
I'm sorry for my treat.

100
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,060

101
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,620

102
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,380
Good.

103
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,760
-I'm sorry for my treat. -Miss Yin.

104
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,090
I haven't finished yet.

105
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,020
Let me tell you.

106
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,150
Here's what I think.

107
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,580
I heard Miss Yin

108
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,940
is in charge of a new department alone.

109
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,820
So,

110
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,700
she must have a new atmosphere.

111
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,020
I suggest...

112
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,110
Don't... Relax.

113
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,340
Don't put it down.

114
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,730
I suggest...

115
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,710
This one.

116
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,500
We brothers

117
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,579
finish our drinks if we love each other.

118
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,980
If Miss Yin

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,660
drink this,

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,760
I'll accept

121
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,180
all the conditions of her new department.

122
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,620
Here.

123
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,140
What do you think, brothers?

124
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,150
Great.

125
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,830
No problem.

126
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,500
Here.

127
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Here.

128
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,659
I'll drink with you.

129
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,540
OK, Mr. Xu.

130
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,010
This pot.

131
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Cheers.

132
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,220
Cheers.

133
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,370
Yike, what are you doing?

134
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,070
Yin Yike.

135
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,020
Yin Yike, stop!

136
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,070
Are you crazy?

137
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,680
Do you know why you can still

138
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,490
stay in the Marketing Department?

139
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,560
You're also known as a person

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,690
who never offends anyone.

141
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,940
You nearly hit him.

142
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,860
Mr. Kong.

143
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,210
Didn't you see

144
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,390
what Mr. Xu did?

145
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,020
Where did he put his hand?

146
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,940
Why did he let me

147
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,940
drink the wine in that pot?

148
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,500
You know his intention, right?

149
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,830
Just because of a drink?

150
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,740
Didn't Mr. Xu say that

151
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,380
with your appearance,

152
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,100
you could be a live streamer?

153
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,780
Right?

154
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,960
Because of a drink,

155
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,660
you want to give up the

156
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,580
platform resources?

157
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,560
Does the company achieve KPI

158
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,510
by sacrificing

159
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,800
its female employees?

160
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,190
-Let me tell you. -Mr. Kong.

161
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,850
I don't need you to educate me.

162
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,280
I'll handle it myself.

163
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,470
Who are you looking for?

164
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,990
I'm looking for you.

165
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,800
What? Were you cosplaying?

166
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,750
No. He is my younger brother.

167
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,010
Your younger brother?

168
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,690
Introduce your younger brother to me.

169
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,620
Mr. Xu can't satisfy you?

170
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,020
You even want my brother.

171
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,300
Your brother is quite manly.

172
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,020
He got me out of trouble.

173
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,570
So what was the ending?

174
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,460
I didn't see it.

175
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,710
It was exciting.

176
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,990
Unfortunately, there's no replay for you to watch.

177
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,020
I know you can handle it.

178
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,070
But I'm still

179
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
a little worried.

180
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,820
Because you gave me

181
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,220
a little bit of courage.

182
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,020
Now you're the Yin Yike

183
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,990
who knows how to

184
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
protect herself.

185
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,940
Why did you come here?

186
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,500
Did the proposal end early?

187
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
I...

188
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,780
I also scolded my client.

189
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,130
Between standing and kneeling,

190
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,460
I still choose to stand.

191
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,220
Are you crazy?

192
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,810
Yes, I am.

193
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,640
I'm crazy because of someone.

194
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,890
So,

195
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,610
I went crazy and lost a big resource

196
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,020
because of you too.

197
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,580
Staying true to yourself

198
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,190
is a happy thing,

199
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,140
isn't it?

200
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,200
In this case,

201
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,570
let's do something big.

202
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,790
Something big?

203
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,370
You brought me here to ride a bike?

204
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,770
It's healthy and environmentally friendly.

205
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,420
It can also keep you entertained.

206
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
Aren't you happy?

207
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,810
I'm happy.

208
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,820
I always thought

209
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,990
you couldn't ride a bike.

210
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,410
When you were abroad,

211
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,990
I learned a lot.

212
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,659
Slow down.

213
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,500
There's a downward slope ahead.

214
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,500
With you behind me,

215
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,490
I'll charge forward fearlessly.

216
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,540
OK.

217
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,170
I'll always be behind you.

218
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,700
What's wrong?

219
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,630
Why can you peel shrimp so fast?

220
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,760
You're faster than my speed of eating.

221
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,470
Did you major in

222
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,030
peeling shrimp in college?

223
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,470
How do you know?

224
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,340
When I was abroad,

225
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,940
I was a credit to our country.

226
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,000
I always ranked first in shrimp peeling competitions.

227
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,000
You're like a defeated cock.

228
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,480
Won't you educate me today?

229
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,260
I don't have to listen to reason?

230
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,610
Your project failed?

231
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,220
You offended Party A?

232
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,620
I knew it.

233
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,540
People who like to educate others

234
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,500
will certainly be given a slap in the face.

235
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,120
People have to pay the price if they overestimate themselves.

236
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,380
Qin Yiran.

237
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,260
Let me tell you.

238
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,490
In this world, there are people

239
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,310
who go back

240
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,010
after they hit a wall and bleed.

241
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,260
But there are some people

242
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,340
who wouldn't turn back even if they bled.

243
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,260
I'm that kind of person.

244
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,540
What's wrong with you?

245
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,580
Why were you talking nonsense?

246
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,810
Give me your hand.

247
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,040
This

248
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,740
is my pay for this trip.

249
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,370
What is it?

250
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,460
Little Guangxi and Little Yike.

251
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,260
Look.

252
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,760
What about your pay?

253
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,040
I also have pay?

254
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,910
I'll pay you.

255
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,460
What is it?

256
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,260
The last can of iced cola in the store.

257
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,990
Here you are.

258
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,120
Drinking iced cola

259
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,950
is comfortable on this hot day.

260
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,600
These days,

261
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,740
I feel like I'm dreaming.

262
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,540
Then don't wake up.

263
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,030
The dream is beautiful,

264
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,100
but how

265
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,030
can I not wake up?

266
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,220
If you turn your dream into reality,

267
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,730
you don't need to wake up.

268
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,780
What if it's hard?

269
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,660
Then learn to give up.

270
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,780
Give up?

271
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,170
I'm just kidding.

272
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,630
I regretted it.

273
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,470
What did you regret?

274
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,840
I regretted that I didn't

275
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,570
confess my love to you earlier.

276
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,280
I should be the one

277
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,740
who held your hands first.

278
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,760
How can you be so small?

279
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,310
You're right in my arms.

280
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,620
Maybe it's because

281
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,520
I'm like

282
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,890
those two small shells.

283
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,210
I want to take a sip too.

284
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,280
♫One more time♫

285
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,680
♫Still with me one more time♫

286
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,720
♫The darkest night♫

287
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,240
♫Has sparked in your eyes♫

288
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,860
♫Oh baby♫

289
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,660
♫If I can turn back the time♫

290
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,220
♫When bad dreams and sadness♫

291
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,450
♫Hang in the sky♫

292
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,030
♫Then we'll never♫

293
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,970
♫Say goodbye♫

294
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,600
Mr. Xu sent

295
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,680
a cancellation letter this morning.

296
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,660
Do you have

297
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,860
any explanations?

298
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,600
To be honest,

299
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,480
Frank,

300
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,530
I think

301
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,240
my team

302
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,650
is hard to control.

303
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,440
I really can't control it.

304
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,630
Originally,

305
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,800
I wanted

306
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
to help Miss Yin with negotiations.

307
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,940
But she

308
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,580
didn't appreciate it

309
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,940
and made me rile both sides.

310
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,180
It seems

311
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,860
that Miss Yin

312
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,580
only listens to Ms. Zheng.

313
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,440
She doesn't take me as her leader.

314
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,890
Mr. Kong.

315
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,260
This matter has nothing to do

316
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,310
with Ms. Zheng.

317
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,140
Really?

318
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,180
I just think

319
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,070
this partner

320
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,280
might have problems in the future.

321
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,940
What problems can Mr. Xu have?

322
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,550
Mr. Xu

323
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,340
is a prestigious person.

324
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,050
What problems can he have?

325
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:51,890
Frank,

326
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,380
I think the climate

327
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,560
in our company

328
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,550
is really bad.

329
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,230
Mr. Xu just wanted

330
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,940
to have a drink with you.

331
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,700
Why are you making such a fuss?

332
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,310
You should know

333
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,070
what kind of person Mr. Xu is.

334
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,100
How many obscene deals has he got involved in?

335
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,430
His company is also investigating it.

336
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,580
I really think our company

337
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,260
doesn't have to work

338
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,970
with him.

339
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,130
In business,

340
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,080
it's inevitable to have a grey area.

341
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Business

342
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,240
is not like charity.

343
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,050
Right?

344
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,030
Miss Yin.

345
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,790
I suggest you

346
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,830
figure it out first.

347
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,530
How could you care about others

348
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,930
without figuring it out?

349
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,500
Frank,

350
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,710
I've found a substitute for the plan.

351
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,500
I've contacted

352
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,420
the boss of Waku.

353
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,150
He can help us

354
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,900
with promotion on the Internet.

355
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,940
I don't think we need

356
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,000
to take the risk of public sentiment.

357
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,070
I didn't expect Manager Yin

358
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,100
to have another plan.

359
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,960
No wonder you're so indifferent.

360
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,830
Miss Yin, do you think

361
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,020
their resources

362
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,500
are comparable

363
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,800
to Mr. Xu's resources?

364
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,180
I don't care about processes.

365
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,640
I only care about results.

366
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,770
I understand.

367
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,460
Oh no.

368
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,760
Everyone, listen to me.

369
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,640
Don't panic.

370
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,590
Our promotion on the homepage

371
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,020
has been canceled.

372
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,580
Then we can only rely on ourselves.

373
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,780
I told you.

374
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,420
It was cool to educate Mr. Kong,

375
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,670
but it also costed a lot.

376
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,160
Look.

377
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,390
Everyone in the Marketing Department

378
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,850
are waiting to laugh at us.

379
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,270
Stop complaining.

380
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,240
It's not a complaint.

381
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
It's the truth.

382
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,090
I can only expect

383
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,830
luck can suddenly come.

384
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,010
Do you think

385
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,360
it's late to pray for good luck now?

386
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,990
Try it.

387
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,740
It's not late.

388
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,860
The little fairy

389
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,740
you're looking forward to

390
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,270
comes.

391
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,050
I'm here to help you attract more followers.

392
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,810
One million fans.

393
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,340
I will complete the mission.

394
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:39,940
Applause!

395
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,000
Applause!

396
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,870
-OK. -Come on.

397
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,600
Hello, everyone.

398
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,390
I'm here to register.

399
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,130
Welcome.

400
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,620
Well.

401
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,820
Welcome to the Live Stream Department.

402
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,350
Welcome.

403
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,180
Welcome.

404
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,120
Let's cut to the chase.

405
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,430
Let's get ready.

406
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,900
Give this to Mr. Chen for me.

407
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,160
-Okay, Yiran. -Thank you.

408
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,090
You're welcome.

409
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,930
Guangxi.

410
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,840
Guangxi.

411
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
You have time to come to our company?

412
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,310
I'm here

413
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,790
to give something to my sister.

414
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,850
Where is my sister?

415
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,040
She should be on the rooftop

416
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,200
to relax.

417
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,130
Did her boss give her a hard time

418
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,390
because of the client?

419
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,860
You're well-informed.

420
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,130
My company is just two floors above.

421
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,340
Right.

422
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,510
Why don't you

423
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,000
send the warmth yourself?

424
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,620
I have something to deal with.

425
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,820
Please help me

426
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,730
give it to her.

427
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,180
No problem.

428
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,850
I'm leaving.

429
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,089
Can you withstand the storm

430
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,050
in your company?

431
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,940
I'm fine.

432
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,619
The thunder is loud, but it's a light rain.

433
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,480
I can handle it.

434
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,750
Let's go home together after work.

435
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,380
You're the strongest person in SC indeed.

436
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,940
Come on.

437
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,690
But Miss Yin,

438
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,200
since you're so confident,

439
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,380
show me your results.

440
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,640
The live stream data of the first month.

441
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,060
Everyone in the Marketing Department

442
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,340
will be watching you.

443
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,530
You scared me.

444
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,210
You've heard many unpleasant words.

445
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,810
I'm helping you forget them.

446
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,580
You deal with your boss

447
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,500
like this?

448
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,220
Of course.

449
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,460
I won't spoil them.

450
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,740
I find

451
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,900
you've changed recently.

452
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,850
Why am I different?

453
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,870
I still work a 996 schedule.

454
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,940
You weren't so tough before.

455
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,780
Why are you so tough today?

456
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,760
That day,

457
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,490
I didn't know where my courage

458
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,430
came from.

459
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,420
But after that,

460
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,640
I had to pay the price.

461
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,490
In the future, the difficulty of my work

462
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,620
has been increased.

463
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,820
Got it.

464
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,550
Don't worry.

465
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,500
I'm here when bad things happen.

466
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,940
Just go ahead boldly.

467
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,670
Don't have any worries.

468
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,380
By the way,

469
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,730
this...

470
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,380
Little Guangxi brought it.

471
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,040
He said Aunt Lan gave it to you.

472
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,120
He came to work?

473
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:33,940
Yes.

474
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,940
I met him at the door of the company.

475
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,500
I don't know if he was shy

476
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,370
or had other reasons.

477
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,570
He ran away in a panic.

478
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,120
So I have to give it

479
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,620
to you personally.

480
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,980
Every child will be shy

481
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,260
when they see Miss Qin.

482
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,080
Enough.

483
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,820
The food

484
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,290
your aunt cooked

485
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,720
is quite interesting.

486
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,700
What's wrong? You want to eat it?

487
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,910
I can divide it in half.

488
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,590
It's not appropriate.

489
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,700
Eat.

490
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,680
Go on with your rest.

491
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,820
I'll leave you alone.

492
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,460
See you later.

493
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,260
See you later.

494
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,570
I made it

495
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,670
with my pay.

496
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,180
I hope you

497
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,070
can be in vacation mode every day.

498
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,390
Fuses are not blown.

499
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,520
Is there a power outage?

500
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,730
I must finish and save it before my computer

501
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,540
is powered off.

502
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Don't disturb me.

503
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,750
Has our company

504
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,540
reduced to this situation?

505
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,860
There's no water left.

506
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,550
We can't stay in the company anymore.

507
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,520
We should take the initiative.

508
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,820
-We should take the initiative. -It's not that serious.

509
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,220
The failure is because of

510
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
the consciousness of Party B.

511
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,370
Besides, we also

512
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,470
got the chance

513
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,100
to scold Party A like his grandfathers.

514
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,040
That's the highlight of our career.

515
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,340
We have a highlight,

516
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,900
but we have no salary.

517
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,420
Haven't we got paid?

518
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,760
I'd better

519
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,380
write a resignation letter.

520
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,090
Did Baba run away with our money?

521
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,790
But we don't have money.

522
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,300
Would he run away without money?

523
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,900
-You're right. -How should we live this month?

524
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,210
Mr. Xie is not here.

525
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,620
Miss, look.

526
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,000
You are

527
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,830
beautiful and kind, right?

528
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,740
Please make a call

529
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,600
and ask it for me.

530
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,820
Just one question, okay?

531
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,760
Please.

532
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,530
I've already

533
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,470
told you.

534
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,680
Mr. Xie is really not here.

535
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,740
Even if you come here,

536
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,640
you can't see him.

537
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,270
I know.

538
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,230
Just make a call.

539
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,360
Just one call, okay?

540
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,380
It's not difficult.

541
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,780
It won't waste your time.

542
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,780
No.

543
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,980
Don't refuse immediately.

544
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,490
Look.

545
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,490
Please don't make this hard for me.

546
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,870
I told you again and again.

547
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,780
Mr. Xie is not here.

548
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,030
Even if you come here,

549
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,050
you can't see him.

550
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,660
I know.

551
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,930
Just a call.

552
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,020
Buy something.

553
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,880
Hello, Mr. Xie.

554
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,540
Mr. Xie.

555
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,280
Hello. Hello.

556
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,640
You're not busy today?

557
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,000
You sent warmth to our receptionist?

558
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:27,870
No.

559
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,580
I want to see you.

560
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,410
You are busy.

561
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,640
So I have to find a way.

562
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,560
OK. Go on with your work.

563
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,680
No. Mr. Xie.

564
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,830
Yesterday, I really…

565
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,470
Well...

566
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,430
I lost my mind.

567
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,020
My attitude was very bad.

568
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,920
I apologize to you.

569
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,880
Eagles don't catch flies.

570
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,000
Please forgive me.

571
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,610
You checked your account

572
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,170
and found you couldn't support your company?

573
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,350
I'm waiting for you

574
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,660
to help me.

575
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,880
You spoiled

576
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,360
those kids.

577
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,470
I can't serve them.

578
00:21:59,470 --> 00:21:59,940
No.

579
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,420
They're good kids.

580
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,840
Well...

581
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,110
But artists are actually

582
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,190
willful.

583
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,750
They have ability, dreams,

584
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,330
and enthusiasm.

585
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,030
This is very rare.

586
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,620
Enthusiasm is No.1 productive force.

587
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,580
Am I right?

588
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Here's the thing.

589
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,280
As long as you promise

590
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,680
our team can take charge,

591
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,050
I won't care about the profit sharing.

592
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,130
It doesn't matter how much money I can earn.

593
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,660
I just want to realize their dreams.

594
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,210
Dreams.

595
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,990
Mr. Xie.

596
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,460
I'm begging you.

597
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,660
Please take a look.

598
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,250
Take a look.

599
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,040
No wonder they call you Dad Chen.

600
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,730
You deserve this title.

601
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,460
Tell me.

602
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,870
Is it worth begging me like this

603
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,100
for your stupid team?

604
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,300
Yes, it is.

605
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,230
As long as you like it,

606
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,460
I can do anything.

607
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,340
I'm good at it.

608
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:45,980
Here.

609
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,250
Take a look.

610
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,750
Mr. Chen.

611
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,630
You're not sincere.

612
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,400
You're not bowing in a standard way.

613
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,470
You're right.

614
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,980
There's room for improvement.

615
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,020
Here, take it.

616
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,860
Lower.

617
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,900
Okay.

618
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:12,970
Wait a minute.

619
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,130
Mr. Xie.

620
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,110
Please give me one more week.

621
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,420
I'll perfect all the characters

622
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,020
and worldviews

623
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,300
in Fengqi Shendu.

624
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,890
I'll submit my proposal to you then.

625
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,900
You can also

626
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,780
take this opportunity to see

627
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,820
whether we are capable or not.

628
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,220
I know you.

629
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,360
You're the returnee.

630
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,680
You were enlightened?

631
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,340
After all, we put much effort into this project.

632
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,450
Well, Mr. Xie.

633
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,500
You can decide

634
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,970
whether we can cooperate again

635
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,480
after you see our proposal

636
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,530
and know our strength.

637
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,200
OK.

638
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,540
I can agree.

639
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,060
But

640
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,820
if you fail,

641
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,390
I won't pay.

642
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,460
It's a deal.

643
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,570
That's it.

644
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,080
Take care.

645
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,060
What a rainy season!

646
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,450
It rains frequently.

647
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,780
Not long ago,

648
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,280
there was a small problem

649
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,480
in the company.

650
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,380
I was afraid you would run away.

651
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,340
So I told

652
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,190
a white lie.

653
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,180
I knew it.

654
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,220
Guangxi.

655
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,100
But the modeling,

656
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,080
the design of characters,

657
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,620
the worldviews,

658
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,400
the scripts,

659
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,610
the preliminaries

660
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,450
and including the 3D models.

661
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,190
If we add these things

662
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,990
together,

663
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,180
the cost is...

664
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,460
I can give up my share.

665
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,010
Really?

666
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,140
But you have to pay them.

667
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,720
Don't worry.

668
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,100
I'm capable of

669
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,190
collecting money.

670
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,910
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

671
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,830
Just go ahead.

672
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,510
You have me behind you.

673
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,160
Of course.

674
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,430
Leave the creation

675
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,470
to me.

676
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,940
I rest assured.

677
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,230
You're my baby.

678
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,660
-Yu, I'm back. -Chen, you're finally back.

679
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,980
I can't breathe.

680
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,340
Oh my god, what did you do?

681
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:56,780
Dad.

682
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,700
I feel like I'm in a dustbin

683
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,100
because of the limited edition perfume you brought back.

684
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Oh my god.

685
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,260
Why did you touch my stuff?

686
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,010
Where is the perfume?

687
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,950
I don't know where I put it.

688
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,290
Don't touch my stuff.

689
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:13,890
Oh my god.

690
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,530
It stinks.

691
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,130
Don't touch it.

692
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,340
Chen,

693
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,540
why do you care so much

694
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,070
about this stinky perfume?

695
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,020
Maybe it's because

696
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,730
I haven't received gifts for a long time.

697
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,390
Didn't I just give you a present on Father's Day?

698
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,300
Your gift is different.

699
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,950
Did the miss on the 20th floor

700
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,710
become angry

701
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,510
because I called you that night?

702
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,260
No.

703
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,480
You're the most important.

704
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,840
No matter when you call me,

705
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,810
I'll come back as soon as possible.

706
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,990
How did you know?

707
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,940
Did you eavesdrop on my phone conversations again?

708
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,740
Last time,

709
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,940
you fell asleep

710
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,640
on the sofa with your phone.

711
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,060
Are you going to have a girlfriend?

712
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,300
No.

713
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,660
I already have you.

714
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,390
Why should I have a girlfriend?

715
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,300
Yu,

716
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,020
I have a favor to ask.

717
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,100
Go ahead.

718
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,880
The lucky money

719
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,440
you received every year.

720
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,580
Can you

721
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,360
lend it to me?

722
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,230
Chen, are you going to treat

723
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,940
the brothers in your company to dinner?

724
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,340
Yes.

725
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,570
They don't have money to eat.

726
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,310
I have to buy them food.

727
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
But I promise you,

728
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,900
as long as my project succeeds,

729
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,100
I'll pay you back and double the amount.

730
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,440
I also want a drumstick.

731
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,000
No problem. It's a deal.

732
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,110
It's a deal.

733
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,540
One more thing.

734
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,060
I want to ride a horse.

735
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,220
It's nothing.

736
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,510
Here, a windmill.

737
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,900
Go.

738
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,810
Fly.

739
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,260
Now I know

740
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,630
That's a big

741
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,950
animation movie company

742
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,410
with big signs and dreams.

743
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,420
But it has a small wallet.

744
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,860
You have to work with money

745
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,760
instead of working with love now?

746
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,630
I promised Dad Chen

747
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,530
a free demo.

748
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,720
I can't get the salary this month.

749
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,710
We plan to send a proposal

750
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,650
to Mars Animation after a week.

751
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,630
I might be poor

752
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,820
for a while.

753
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,660
That's great.

754
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,300
I'll treat you to meals.

755
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:38,980
Okay.

756
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,090
Guangxi.

757
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,990
You are the kindest artist

758
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,820
I've ever seen.

759
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,960
How should I put it?

760
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,340
When I saw Dad Chen

761
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,630
bow to others today,

762
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,270
I suddenly thought of you.

763
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,870
Why?

764
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,280
Both of you

765
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,740
looked vulnerable,

766
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,460
but you tried your best to protect others.

767
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,870
So you

768
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,420
stepped out?

769
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,340
It seems that I influenced you a little

770
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,100
in your life.

771
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,360
It's not just a little.

772
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,570
It's very effective.

773
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,080
Just like now.

774
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,380
I really need to recharge.

775
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,440
This one,

776
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,060
at most 20%.

777
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,800
In this case,

778
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,260
50%.

779
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,120
How about this?

780
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,540
Let me feel it.

781
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,880
It's almost

782
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,920
74%.

783
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,870
74%?

784
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,210
You ask too much.

785
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,990
How can it be

786
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,820
100%?

787
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,300
In this way,

788
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,790
♫I like you♫

789
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,750
I can be fully charged.

790
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,980
♫Your cold expression♫

791
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,080
♫Pretending not to care♫

792
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,240
♫Melting in my hands♫

793
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,220
♫I like♫

794
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,550
♫The differences between you and me♫

795
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,080
♫Collide to create a wonderful melody♫

796
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,940
♫I like♫

797
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,050
♫Sofa hug movies♫

798

♫Coke and ice cream♫

799

♫I just can't wait to be close to you♫

804
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,700
The water is off.

805
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,700
And the salary hasn't been paid.

806
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,980
We can't be paid.

807
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,620
Should we still work here?

808
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,910
How can I live

809
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,670
without the salary this month?

810
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,900
Run away.

811
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,360
The company is going to close down.

812
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,200
Why do we need a salary?

813
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
You are really...

814
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,530
What are you doing?

815
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:09,890
Jogging.

816
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,860
What time is it? Jogging?

817
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,540
What time is it? Jogging?

818
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,140
Jogging?

819
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,770
You traitors.

820
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,080
I haven't paid you

821
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,570
salaries for just one day.

822
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,900
How could you treat me like this?

823
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,140
I raised you for nothing.

824
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,500
You ungrateful people!

825
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,500
Baba.

826
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,230
You don't have to pretend to be strong.

827
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,860
It's just an electricity bill.

828
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,050
We can chip in.

829
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,020
Come on.

830
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:35,780
Come on.

831
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,870
Give your money.

832
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,730
This is mine.

833
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,310
I'll pay the electricity bill.

834
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,980
Water bill.

835
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,340
Little money is still money.

836
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,220
Baba.

837
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,950
This is all we can give.

838
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,540
You used to take care of us.

839
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,340
Now the company is in danger.

840
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,350
Let us do our best

841
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,260
to help you.

842
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,580
Take it.

843
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,660
Baba.

844
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,670
Take it.

845
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,410
Take it, Baba.

846
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,320
Take it, Baba.

847
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,380
Take it.

848
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,410
You're welcome.

849
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,880
The power came back on.

850
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,560
The water came back on.

851
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,860
Is it because of love?

852
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,900
Nonsense!

853
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,130
I just paid the money.

854
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,670
Didn't the company run out of money?

855
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,260
How many times do I have to tell you?

856
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,460
I've saved much money.

857
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,490
Will I be defeated

858
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,460
by such a small problem?

859
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,980
The problem of finance is solved,

860
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,570
but money can't be earned if we do nothing.

861
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,180
Of course.

862
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,650
Previously,

863
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,380
we were trapped in a question.

864
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,260
Which one came first,

865
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,460
chicken or eggs?

866
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,800
When the investors didn't invest,

867
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,820
we didn't push ahead.

868
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,560
When we didn't push ahead,

869
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,200
the investors didn't want to invest.

870
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,030
So now,

871
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,380
we only have one last way

872
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,030
to go.

873
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,180
In a week,

874
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,900
we adjust all the original characters

875
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,580
and the worldviews.

876
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,140
Submit our proposal to Mars Animation again.

877
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,620
Xu Guangxi, you were enlightened?

878
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,890
Let's work hard together.

879
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,580
It's time

880
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,620
to prove yourself.

881
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,020
Here.

882
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,900
For Shendu!

883
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,880
For Shendu!

884
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,560
For Shendu!

885
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,300
For Shendu!

886
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,110
For Shendu!

887
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,820
For Shendu!

888
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,620
Let's get to work.

889
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,940
This...

890
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,860
Save some for me.

891
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,110
You've collected it.

892
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,110
Get to work.

893
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,060
It's good to have dreams.

894
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,540
What a pity.

895
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,040
What time is it?

896
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,110
Why haven't they

897
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,110
come back?

898
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,270
Ke is working overtime today.

899
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,140
She won't come back to eat.

900
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,530
Yibo said he went to his friend's home

901
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,720
to study.

902
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,470
So tonight,

903
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,760
just two of us eat here.

904
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,470
Why did they only tell you

905
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,900
they wouldn't go home?

906
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,180
Do they still know

907
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,540
I'm their father?

908
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,250
Look at you.

909
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,430
Your face is always solemn.

910
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,020
Who dares to talk to you?

911
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,530
Enough.

912
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,640
You spoiled him.

913
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,929
I'm not blaming you, stubborn old man.

914
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,409
You like to control everything.

915
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,199
Your daughter has grown up.

916
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,840
She will get married one day.

917
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,080
Your son will also grow up

918
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,400
and leave home.

919
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,170
Who will accompany you in the end?

920
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,050
Me.

921
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,820
In the end,

922
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,860
only we will stay here

923
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,730
and eat together.

924
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,370
This situation will last long.

925
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,739
So, they are adults.

926
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,159
Stop rambling.

927
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,940
You don't like to listen?

928
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,400
Let me get you some soup.

929
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,199
Well...

930
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,580
Fine.

931
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,199
I'm bored.

932
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,530
I'm going out for a walk.

933
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,340
You finished eating?

934
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:43,980
Yes.

935
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,310
Stubborn old man.

936
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,610
Don't forget

937
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,980
to take a coat with you. Don't catch a cold.

938
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,810
Mr. Chen.

939
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,730
Your company went bankrupt

940
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,370
and you became a delivery guy?

941
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,500
I won't argue with you today.

942
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,450
I'll lose my luck if I argue with women.

943
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,580
I'm a big boss.

944
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,380
I can attack and defend.

945
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,180
I'm flexible.

946
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,270
Are you out of your mind?

947
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,280
Forget it. I don't want to argue with you.

948
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,370
I don't want to argue with you.

949
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,060
Let me tell you.

950
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,940
A miracle will come tomorrow.

951
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,420
Wait and see. Bye.

952
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,700
Madman.

953
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,820
If you want him to carry two swords,

954
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,540
you should pay attention

955
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,980
to the curvature of his elbows.

956
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,370
It must be over 45 degrees.

957
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,170
Look.

958
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,840
Look.

959
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,960
Right?

960
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,270
I've added colors

961
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,910
to the first character.

962
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,510
Let me see.

963
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,100
I like the colors.

964
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,120
Guys.

965
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,760
I've finished my paperwork on the worldviews.

966
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,600
Good.

967
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,900
I've revised the graphics

968
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,830
in our proposal.

969
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:50,690
But

970
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,720
the printer...

971
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,380
Dad Chen has repaired it this morning.

972
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:53,980
Use it now.

973
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,860
Okay.

974
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,240
Baba really tried his best

975
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,170
for the deposit.

976
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,400
Babes.

977
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,300
Here.

978
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,630
I prepared supper for you.

979
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,780
Hurry up and eat.

980
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,140
Thank you, Baba.

981
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,060
Hurry up. Baba.

982
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,200
Chicken wings.

983
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,240
Baba.

984
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,270
You don't have to meet clients tonight?

985
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,270
The clients are asleep at this time.

986
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,950
Hurry up and eat.

987
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,010
Get back to work

988
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:16,810
after eating.

989
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,750
It's delicious.

990
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,930
I'm waiting for you at the parking garage.

991
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,050
I've booked a nice restaurant.

992
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,780
I'm waiting

993
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,440
to take in a poor guy who works overtime for free.

994
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,260
I'm sorry.

995
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,230
I just finished the proposal

996
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,380
we're going to submit to Mr. Xie.

997
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,460
You're starving?

998
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,900
Since you worked so hard,

999
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,040
I forgive you.

1000
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,170
Let's eat something delicious.

1001
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,470
Hello, dad.

1002
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,970
Where are you?

1003
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,960
I told Aunt Lan this afternoon

1004
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,880
I had to work overtime.

1005
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,980
I won't go back for dinner.

1006
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,110
Why is there no one in your company?

1007
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,280

00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,530
I give up.

1012
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,090
I feel dizzy.

1013
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,200
You feel dizzy?

1014
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,400
Let's take a break.

1015
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,340
You

1016
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,420
lost

1017
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,840
a big platform this time.

1018
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,250
Does it affect you?

1019
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,250
I've done a lot of work.

1020
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,700
I even have images

1021
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,900
of my target clients.

1022
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,100
My two live streamers

1023
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,610
have different styles.

1024
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,080
Yurou

1025
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,430
used to be a saleswoman.

1026
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,330
She's good at introducing the functions of products

1027
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,860
and their attractive points.

1028
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,470
Xiaomian

1029
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,460
already

1030
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,160
has many fans.

1031
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,420
This is her advantage.

1032
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,200
I believe you can succeed.

1033
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,020
Let me help you recharge now.

1034
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,210
I'm fully charged.

1035
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,010
Really?

1036
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,850
Yes.

1037
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,950
Let me try whether it will

1038
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,410
help you recharge faster.

♫I fear I cannot see you in the next second♫

1049
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,770
♫My heart is protesting♫

1050
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,560
♫I just feel it too♫

1051
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:40,310
♫It's like the coffee with full caramel milk foam♫

1052
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:45,510
♫The air has the fragrance of missing you♫

1053
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,940
♫Baby, from now on, come to me♫

1054
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,230
♫Come to me♫

1055
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,280
♫I want to be an umbrella for you♫

1056
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,740
♫To shield you from rain and wind♫

1057
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,880
♫You are my luck♫

1058
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,220
♫I'm like an ice-cream beneath the sun♫

1059
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,640
♫Melt my heart into love♫

1060
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,420
♫Baby, from now on, come to me♫

1061
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,870
♫Come to me♫

1062
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,810
♫I want to be an umbrella for you♫

1063
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,360
♫To shield you from rain and wind♫

1064
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,600
♫You are my luck♫

1065
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,630
