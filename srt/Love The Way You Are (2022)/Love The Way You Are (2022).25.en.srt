There are many illustrators in Flower World,

144

the rest

148
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,140
is just some trivial work.

149
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,460
To put it bluntly,

150
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,620
your company is just a small studio.

151
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,700
As long as you are willing,

152
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,500
I can promise you

153
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,830
a clear promotion plan.

154
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,530
Of course,

155
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,680
the salary won't let you down.

156
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,010
We can sign the contract right away.

157
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,890
You should know

158
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,710
if I say yes now,

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,300
I'll be betraying the trust

160
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,100
of my boss and my team.

161
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,690
One day,

162
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,900
I might do the same to you, Ms. Xu.

163
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,460
We haven't even started working together.

164
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,980
How can you be sure

165
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,510
the result will be the same?

166
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,460
You wouldn't even give me a chance?

167
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,210
Ms. Xu.

168
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,460
Of course I can't be sure.

169
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,170
The act of chivalry may happen again.

170
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,140
If there's a chance like this in the future,

171
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,800
I'll be willing to cooperate.

172
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,140
I look forward to it.

173
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,830
The female boss

174
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
seems to have some ulterior motive.

175
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,940
I think they're just talking about work.

176
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,500
You're so open-minded.

177
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,580
Then why do you

178
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,460
keep looking

179
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,350
over there?

180
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,160
Yiran.

181
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,430
Let's talk about something happy.

182
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,410
All right.

183
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:13,530
Here.

184
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,090
Take a sip.

185
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,560
Take another sip.

186
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,290
[Yike is the best.]

187
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,730
Are you happy about this?

188
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,460
Alright, don't worry.

189
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,200
Go hang out

190
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,100
with your boyfriend.

191
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,900
I won't disturb you.

192
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,790
I'm leaving. Bye.

193
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,260
Bye.

194
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,860
Why did you stop here?

195
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,960
You'll know later.

196
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,090
Hello.

197
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,950
Two ice creams.

198
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,310
Okay.

199
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,400
Chocolate flavor.

200
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,060
Here, take it.

201
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,660
Thank you.

202
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,170
Miss Yin.

203
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,020
Let's celebrate

204
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,630
the success of co-brand Valuation Adjustment Mechanism.

205
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,590
So ceremonious?

206
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,570
Just now, Ms. Xu...

207
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,450
Ms. Xu wanted to poach you, right?

208
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,650
She admires you.

209
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,590
Do you want me to be poached?

210
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,780
No.

211
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,170
You have your own career

212
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,430
and your own choice.

213
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,430
You can choose by yourself.

214
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,990
Are you jealous?

215
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,950
No.

216
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,510
I don't like being jealous.

217
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,910
It's sour. It's not good.

218
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,240
Are you really not jealous?

219
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,020
If I really get jealous,

220
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,820
I'm very good at it.

221
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,550
How?

222
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,680
I won't say it.

223
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,110
I'm afraid you'll run away if I say it.

224
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,920
Tell me.

225
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,310
I've caught you.

226
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,540
You can't escape now.

227
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,030
I have to think of a way

228
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,300
to punish you.

229
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,870
You'll take care of

230
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,530
all the housework tonight.

231
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,390
It's a deal.

232
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,220
There is no chance to appeal.

233
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,610
Yin Yike,

234
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,330
did you plan to trick me into this

235
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,460
from the beginning?

236
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,790
I'm not going back then.

237
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,930
Let's go.

238
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,990
Drive, Mr. Xu.

239
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,630
Let's go.

240
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,650
I haven't finished yet.

241
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,020
This toast

242
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,930
is to

243
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,280
Xia Xiaomian.

244
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,780
I want to thank her for letting me,

245
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,340
a rebellious child who lost his way,

246
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,220
come back at the last minute.

247
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,390
I'd like to

248
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,980
propose to Yibo, then.

249
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,790
Thank you, Yibo, for the boost.

250
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,350
Now I'm roughly

251
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,260
the top female streamer

252
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,020
in our live stream room.

253
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,480
Cheers.

254
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,200
Cheers.

255
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,650
Clear.

256
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,400
Oh my god.

257
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,210
Yibo,

258
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,430
do you think spicy hotpot

259
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,800
is actually like love?

260
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,730
It's hot and passionate,

261
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,870
and you can't resist it.

262
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,860
Are you okay?

263
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,140
I'm talking. I'm saying that

264
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,780
you can't resist love.

265
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,450
If you want to talk about love, do it decently.

266
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,980
Don't talk in four-character idioms.

267
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,620
Every time you say a four-character idiom,

268
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,220
I think you will make a scene.

269
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,930
What do you think love is?

270
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,650
Hormones?

271
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,170
What's wrong with you today?

272
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,370
You're talking about love all the time.

273
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,060
Well, I'm a girl.

274
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,700
A pretty girl

275
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,140
surely should

276
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,220
talk about love.

277
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,260
You can love all you want,

278
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,300
but don't lean to me, okay?

279
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,700
Xia Xiaomian!

280
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,370
Goal! Goal!

281
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,380
Finally!

282
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:43,930
Goal!

283
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,460
Goal. Goal. Goal.

284
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,090
You too...

285
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,810
You like this team too?

286
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,210
Right?

287
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,420
I've been watching them for a long time.

288
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,500
I've been following them since last year.

289
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,260
They will definitely qualify for the next round.

290
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,620
You know?

291
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,420
They will definitely win today.

292
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,380
One more.

293
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,010
One more.

294
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,100
There will be more goals. Listen.

295
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,700
Slow down.

296
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm happy.

297
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,530
Come on.

298
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,060
When can I

299
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,340
have a kiss

300
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,980
in the summer night breeze?

301
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,590
I drank this.

302
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,700
I drank this already.

303
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,130
It's okay.

304
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,310
Then we'd be kissing indirectly.

305
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,790
Is this your first kiss?

306
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,760
Are you diffident?

307
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,520
This is really your first kiss?

308
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,890
Yibo,

309
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,350
not only did you have your first kiss,

310
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,730
but you've been single since you were born.

311
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,930
You are a modern living fossil.

312
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,830
I bet

313
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,450
not only did still you have your first kiss,

314
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,650
but you don't even know

315
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,320
how to kiss.

316
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,780
Goal!

317
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,490
Dude, cheers!

318
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,300
Come on.

319
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,200
Not bad.

320
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,000
Not bad, bro.

321
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,920
Are you satisfied, Xia Xiaomian?

322
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,270
This is my first kiss.

323
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,670
You have to be responsible for me.

324
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,000
Good weekend.

325
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,050
Morning.

326
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,760
It's been a long time since I slept in.

327
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,990
Miss Yin.

328
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,980
The pit of co-brand

329
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,250
has finally been filled.

330
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,190
Should we also

331
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,080
make a good plan

332
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,790
for the brand new weekend?

333
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
What do you want to do?

334
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,430
Chen Musen

335
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,540
went back to his hometown to visit his mother.

336
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,510
So?

337
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,890
I slept on the floor for many days.

338
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,970
My back hurts.

339
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,180
Should we make good use

340
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,360
of the bed at home?

341
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,140
What do you want?

342
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,900
I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

343
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,860
I want to foul.

344
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,160
Come here.

345
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,320
No, I need to get up.

346
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,570
♫Oh love should be♫

347
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,920
I have a deer horn.

348
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,410
♫Like songbirds soaring to the sun♫

349
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,720
That's not a horn. Why are you pushing me?

350
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,060
♫My dear♫

351
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,920
♫When you walk with me♫

352
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,300
You have to do your hair, right?

353
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,060
♫The clovers they dance at my feet♫

354
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,240
Yike.

355
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,340
♫Oh love should be♫

356
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,460
♫Like children playing crayons in the summer field♫

357
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,590
I'm making dumplings.

358
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,580
Are you making dumplings to reward me?

359
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,350
♫In the summer field♫

360
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,790
Do you want to have them?

361
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,650
I want to eat everything you cook.

362
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,850
♫When I give in to you♫

363
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,500
♫I feel the troubles in me

364
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,080
♫Fade away♫

365
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,580
Yike.

366
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,320
♫And if I want you, you want me♫

367
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,740
I was wondering

368
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,370
why it looks so much like you.

369
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,940
I did it on purpose.

370
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,890
♫Who cares what others may think?♫

371
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,650
Let me take a picture for you.

372
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,680
♫I hear church bells ring♫

373
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Drink some water.

374
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,990
♫I have you, you have me♫

375
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,120
♫Roses will bloom in our dreams♫

376
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,870
Raise your feet.

377
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,770
♫I'd kiss you now♫

378
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,540
Isn't my brushstroke great?

379
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,140
You're a genius.

380
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,260
It can help

381
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,820
if you add two strokes here.

382
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,950
No.

383
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,520
This

384
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,109
suits your skin color.

385
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,980
I hope

386
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,560
there's someone like you,

387
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,310
who is as bright and refreshing

388
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,140
as the morning in the mountains.

389
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,540
Someone like the sun

390
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,300
on the road to the ancient city,

391
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,610
warm but not burning hot,

392
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,780
that covers all my skin

393
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,420
from starting point to night,

394
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,650
from the mountain to the study.

395
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,830
All the questions and answers

396
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,750
are simple.

397
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,360
I hope there's

398
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,480
someone like you

399
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,400
in my future.

400
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,480
And we can go through countless billboards along the path of life.

401
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,600
So romantic.

402
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,880
Right?

403
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,310
Why are you

404
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,140
taking photos of me all the time?

405
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,620
That's because I realized that

406
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,700
I don't have many beautiful photos of yours

407
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,620
in my phone.

408
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,520
Do you have them now?

409
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,650
Yes,

410
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,560
but something is missing.

411
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,470
What is it?

412
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,340
Two-shot of ours.

413
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:32,870
Right.

414
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,060
I don't think we took a two-shot before.

415
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,830
Let's take it now.

416
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,210
Here.

417
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,100
Coming.

418
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,390
Who is it?

419
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,800
Surprise, Yibo.

420
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,860
I know you must be uncomfortable

421
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,900
from the hangover last night.

422
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,380
I brought you porridge and hangover medicine.

423
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,180
Are you happy?

424
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,140
Porridge.

425
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,220
Spoon, spoon.

426
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,500
Right.

427
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,060
Yibo,

428
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,420
eat the porridge

429
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,530
and get changed.

430
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,420
I'll take you out.

431
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,380
I've planned a lot of things for you.

432
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,270
Out? Where to?

433
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,980
For what?

434
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,660
Haven't you noticed

435
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,860
I'm different today?

436
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,030
I changed my hairstyle.

437
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,260
What else?

438
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,580
You didn't wear

439
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,380
your colorful protective gear.

440
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,210
No.

441
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,180
You didn't even look carefully.

442
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,080
Nice new bag.

443
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,370
I changed my lip color.

444
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:49,870
So?

445
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,150
The first day of being in a relationship,

446
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,080
of course I have to be ceremonious.

447
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,900
What relationship?

448
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,960
Who are you dating?

449
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,560
You.

450
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,600
Me?

451
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,150
Yesterday.

452
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,970
The street stall.

453
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,220
Match.

454
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,540
Little Bo and Little Xiaomian.

455
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,300
Do you remember this?

456
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,790
Xia Xiaomian.

457
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,820
This…

458
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,510
We are in my house.

459
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
And it's daytime.

460
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,860
What are you doing?

461
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,030
Girls should be more reserved.

462
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,140
Why should I?

463
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,230
Anyway,

464
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,070
we are a couple now.

465
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,920
What?

466
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,500
Who is your boyfriend?

467
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,820
My head hurts.

468
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,980
What do you mean?

469
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,880
You...

470
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,400
forget everything?

471
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,740
I just remember we went to

472
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,100
have barbecue,

473
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,510
and we had some drinks.

474
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,230
Then I...

475
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,270
I forgot everything.

476
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,060
Well,

477
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,940
so you don't remember anything

478
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,010
you said and

479
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,580
did?

480
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,220
I...

481
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,700
What did I say or do?

482
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,540
Yibo,

483
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,670
if you don't like me,

484
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,060
just tell me.

485
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,080
Don't pretend you don't know.

486
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,000
It

487
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,710
hurts.

488
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,540
Xia Xiaomian,

489
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,340
I really don't know.

490
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,940
I really forgot everything.

491
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,200
Yin Yibo,

492
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,190
you've gone too far.

493
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,790
No, I...

494
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,900
What happened?

495
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,750
What happened yesterday?

496
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,010

Who is your boyfriend?

523
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,090
Yin Yibo,

524
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,700
you are a bad guy.

525
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,370
I don't want to like you anymore.

526
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,620
The thing is

527
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,860
I know

528
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,490
that you worked very hard revising the script.

529
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,040
Actually, I don't want you

530
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,310
to work that hard.

531
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,580
But Mars Animation

532
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,460
had us revise it again and again.

533
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,780
So before we meet them up,

534
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,180
we'll have an internal meeting

535
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,590
and discuss

536
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,670
if there's any way

537
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,020
to make this revision

538
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,350
the last one.

539
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,400
Come on, share your opinions.

540
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,040
I have an idea.

541
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,380
Is there anyone else who have...

542
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,420
A honey-trap.

543
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,830
How?

544
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,870
We can disguise ourselves as women,

545
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,850
put on JK suits,

546
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,000
and show our beautiful legs.

547
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,870
Let them fall

548
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,300
for our charm and beauty.

549
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,540
You'd better remove your leg hair first.

550
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,740
I don't have much hair.

551
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,620
I have an idea.

552
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,720
Infernal Affairs.

553
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,140
Be an undercover agent.

554
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,180
-How? -How?

555
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,660
Chen Sir.

556
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,990
Police number 27149.

557
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,630
Heading to Mars Animation.

558
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,270
I'll be an undercover agent for three to five years.

559
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,730
I'll complete the mission.

560
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,060
Please give your instructions, Chen Sir.

561
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,660
I'm not afraid that

562
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,780
you won't come back.

563
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,300
I'm afraid you can't hold on

564
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,750
with your weak body.

565
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,480
Sir,

566
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,900
please give me another chance.

567
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,340
Stop it.

568
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,200
Hurry, next.

569
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,150
Baba.

570
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,580
I have an idea.

571
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,640
We can tie Mr. Xie up.

572
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,900
How?

573
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,010
We can go there

574
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,420
in a dark night,

575
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,060
and tie Mr. Xie up

576
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:13,740
secretly.

577
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,680
Then we whip him,

578
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,230
burn him with fire,

579
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,950
and hit him with a rock.

580
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,600
Then...

581
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,380
Wait.

582
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,980
Before you joined our company,

583
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,910
what kind of scripts did you write?

584
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,030
I used to make props.

585
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,700
Baba,

586
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,460
I have an idea that definitely works.

587
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,950
Let's play hard to get.

588
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,410
Pretend to be the big tail wolf.

589
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,250
How do we play hard to get?

590
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,580
We won't submit the proposal

591
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,700
or go the meeting.

592
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,350
Then we

593
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,490
turn off our phones

594
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,200
so that they can't find us.

595
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,700
This is good.

596
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,230
Right?

597
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,600
Yes.

598
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,900
Good.

599
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,600
Good idea.

600
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,350
But what if

601
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,990
he never contacts you again?

602
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,530
You're right.

603
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,400
Sounds reasonable.

604
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
I'd better turn it on.

605
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,170
You're all I have.

606
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,150
We've revised

607
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,640
the plan for countless times.

608
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,020
But Mr. Xie

609
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,250
is still proposing revision opinions.

610
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,490
What do you think he wants to change?

611
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,370
What do you think he wants?

612
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,630
Change what?

613
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,780
I think he just wants to

614
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,170
change for the sake of change.

615
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:35,990
So,

616
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,830
if we bring

617
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,320
our best version

618
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,530
to him again,

619
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,890
do you think he'll find out?

620
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,100
Cunning.

621
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,800
Mr. Xie.

622
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,830
This is

623
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,280
our

624
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,170
final version.

625
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,180
On behalf of our team,

626
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,980
I'd like to brag about it with no humbleness.

627
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,300
The main line is a blast,

628
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,960
and the twists are fantastic.

629
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,500
The characters are also incomparable.

630
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,060
The detail of every strand of hair

631
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,190
can be seen clearly.

632
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,580
How do you feel about it,

633
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,290
Mr. Xie?

634
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,250
Why are you frowning?

635
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,990
Will Mr. Xie find out

636
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,730
that we are using an old version?

637
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,530
Let's run away if he finds it out.

638
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,510
Don't.

639
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
We must sign the contract successfully.

640
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,020
You must get the second payment.

641
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
Calm down.

642
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,400
Don't panic.

643
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,600
Calm down.

644
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,230
We can win.

645
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,790
This thing

646
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,640
is good.

647
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,150
This thing

648
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,220
is really good.

649
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,910
Looks like there's hope.

650
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,980
We can

651
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,070
get away with it.

652
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,020
It's really

653
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,240
a great relief.

654
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,900
Guangxi is so smart.

655
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,420
We revised it to the point that we don't remember.

656
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,220
How would he be able to remember?

657
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,710
But

658
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,190
I still think

659
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,480
something is missing.

660
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,200
What do you mean, Mr. Xie?

661
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,220
What is missing?

662
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,420
How about this?

663
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,880
Let's get straight to the point.

664
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,010
Yes.

665
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,540
The character design

666
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,230
is detailed to the hair.

667
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,000
But the plot...

668
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,110
The main line

669
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,030
sounds like a blast to me.

670
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,020
But we are all

671
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,050
working on a project.

672
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,110
What I want to say is

673
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,710
the fancy concept

674
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:06,930
is not solid.

675
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,280
The real thing.

676
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,470
I want to see the real thing.

677
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,960
Mr. Xie wants to say that

678
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,990
the same outline

679
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
may lead to

680
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,860
two totally different scripts.

681
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,730
So, Mr. Xie,

682
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,290
you mean

683
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,120
you need to see more details?

684
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:24,870
Actually,

685
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,330
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

686
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,610
But I need to check out

687
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,200
the climax of this script.

688
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,250
We're back to the beginning.

689
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,920
It's beyond reason but expected.

690
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,660
If we insist on the last draft,

691
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,070
we can still get it.

692
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,060
Don't worry.

693
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,380
Director Xu.

694
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,190
Do you understand

695
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:54,890
what I mean?

696
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,650
Yes.

697
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,260
To be honest,

698
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,870
the more detailed plan

699
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,070
is under production.

700
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,620
But based on the fact that

701
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,150
we only received a deposit,

702
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,550
please proceed with

703
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,370
the formal signing of contract and payment first.

704
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,180
Otherwise, I can't

705
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,890
turn it out.

706
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:12,780
You...

707
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,140
We respect your creation.

708
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,820
But after all,

709
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,460
we are delivering real money.

710
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,460
Things are open

711
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,120
for negotiation, right?

712
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,900
Sure.

713
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,660
Make a payment and sign the contract first.

714
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,120
We'll talk about it later.

715
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,140
Our director

716
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,980
is always this

717
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,140
straightforward and tough.

718
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,090
He's always cruel to himself,

719
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,220
and cruel to others.

720
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
He doesn't talk much.

721
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,670
But in general,

722
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,540
he has explained

723
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,430
everything.

724
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,980
Anyway, it means

725
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,330
about your company's request,

726
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,790
we'll do as much as we can.

727
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,730
But

728
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,780
we should also settle on

729
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,660
the date to sign the contract

730
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,230
as soon as possible.

731
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,900
For example,

732
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,090
the date of the second payment,

733
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:57,620
right?

734
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,450
Our bank account

735
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,510
has never changed.

736
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,200
Mr. Chen,

737
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,390
how about this?

738
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,910
Let's have a time-out.

739
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,560
I'll think about it

740
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
and discuss it

741
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,640
with my team.

742
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,170
Okay.

743
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,870
Why did he leave?

744
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,830
I don't know.

745
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,660
Baba.

746
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,090
Is the playing the devil thing

747
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,210
part of our plan?

748
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,340
He improvised it.

749
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,520
The more detailed plan

750
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,710
is our trump card.

751
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,270
How can we show it so easily?

752
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,380
Besides,

753
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,810
if we want to compromise,

754
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,930
Dad Chen is here.

755
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,510
Why should we compromise?

756
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,300
There's no turning back.

757
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,900
I won't cater to them anymore.

758
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,940
Our stuff is so solid

759
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,350
and so good, right?

760
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,020
We can find good clients

761
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,700
everywhere.

762
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,420
Why do we have to put all our eggs in one basket?

763
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,620
Baba.

764
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,820
Why are you so tough

765
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,860
all of a sudden?

766
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,860
That's not like you.

767
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,500
Yes.

768
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Guangxi

769
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,900
knows when to advance and retreat.

770
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,930
He is able to adaptable to the situation.

771
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,250
This is the growth of a character.

772
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:02,810
Understand?

773
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,100
Look at yourselves.

774
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,230
How old are you?

775
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,310
Have you grown up?

776
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,290
Mr. Xie looked

777
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,330
not well just now.

778
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,630
I'm worried

779
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,420
if we've gone too far.

780
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,280
What if Mr. Xie…

781
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,270
Sorry.

782
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,560
I need to answer a call.

783
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,270
Who is it?

784
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,080
Who?

785
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,640
What's going on?

786
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,370
Hello?

787
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,260
When are you going to pay me back?

788
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,710
No.

789
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,580
I borrowed several thousand from you.

790
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,940
But you asked me to pay back tens of thousands.

791
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,810
You are a loan shark.

792
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,150
You're blackmailing me, you know?

793
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,340
You signed the contract.

794
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,500
It's in black and white.

795
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,690
Do you want to deny it now?

796
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,190
Now I have your family

797
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,210
and friends' numbers.

798
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,210
If you don't pay me back,

799
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,780
I'll call your colleagues today,

800
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,750
and your boss tomorrow.

801
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,980
I'll call your mom next week.

802
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,180
Okay, I'll pay you back.

803
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,440
Give me a few more days.

804
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,390
A few more days.

805
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,660
It's normal

806
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,690
for young people

807
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,560
to make a wrong step.

808
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,090
Just pretend I didn't hear it.

809
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,580
Maybe

810
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,190
I heard everything.

811
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,020
Well,

812
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,660
maybe

813
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,020
I can help you.

814
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,280
What do you think?

815
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,410
How about letting me

816
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,470
read the

817
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,960
climax part of the script?

818
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,540
As I said,

819
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,420
pay first, read later.

820
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,650
Chen,

821
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,740
if you keep doing this,

822
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,610
you'll lose everything including pots and pans.

823
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,220
It's okay.

824
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,179
I liked cooking a few years ago,

825
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,969
so I bought quit a lot of

826
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,090
pots and pans.

827
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,060
It can hold on for a while.

828
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,260
Mr. Xie, you see,

829
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,560
the quality of our work

830
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,620
is right here.

831
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,360
Our talents

832
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,300
are all

833
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,199
in front of you.

834
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:23,770
You

835
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,630
can see it yourself.

836
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:34,670
Fine.

837
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,239
I cherish talent too much.

838
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,270
Please

839
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,510
hurry up

840
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,800
and complete the plot.

841
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,699
Next time,

842
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:49,010
we'll sign the official contract and make the payment.

843
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:49,480
Okay.

844
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,070
We must focus on

845
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,130
the offline part.

846
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,100
Got it?

847
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,210
Frank.

848
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,090
Miss Yin.

849
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,590
The sales data this time is good.

850
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,350
Good work.

851
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,560
Thank you.

852
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,860
The valuation adjustment this time

853
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,290
is done very well.

854
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,360
It's not easy.

855
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,520
Well,

856
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,440
congratulations, Miss Yin.

857
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,150
Well,

858
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,310
Miss Yin,

859
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,890
in the future, if you need any help,

860
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,090
let me know immediately.

861
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,160
I will definitely support

862
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,260
you, Miss Yin.

863
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,420
By the way,

864
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,250
from now on,

865
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,030
you'll be on the same level.

866
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,530
Vice Director Yin.

867
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,580
Ms. Zheng has left.

868
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,420
[Letter of Appointment]

869
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,610
I'm afraid that Vice President Kong

870
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,960
is weak alone.

871
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,870
Miss Yin

872
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,700
came back with great performance.

873
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,570
You should

874
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,920
have a higher title.

875
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
Thank you, Frank.

876
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,130
I'll work hard.

877
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,000
If anything happens,

878
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,280
just report to me.

879
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,970
Come on.

880
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,760
Congratulations again.

881
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,020
Vice Director Yin.

882
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,600
Director Zheng

883
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,790
is a lesson to learn from.

884
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,650
Actually, the position of director

885
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,380
is not easy to be competent for.

886
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,880
You must know how to retreat.

887
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,240
Yes, Mr. Kong.

888
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,990
Frank also said

889
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,380
we'll talk with our performance.

890
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,380
The best will win.

891
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,630
Let's wait and see.

892
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,680
Someone will show off now.

893
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,980
The CEO is awesome.

894
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,010
Congratulations, Yike.

895
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,730
-Thank you. -Congratulations.

896
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,360
Thank you.

897
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,830
We should be congratulating

898
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,550
the vice president of the Marketing Department.

899
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,350
You know what?

900
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,630
We should play the background music now.

901
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,800
Keep a low profile.

902
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,820
Yike.

903
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,250
We've thought about

904
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,660
the people who will be jealous.

905
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,370
No matter how low-profile we are,

906
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,780
they will still be jealous.

907
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,830
So this time,

908
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,180
let's make it high-profile

909
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,040
and be willful.

910
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,620
That's right.

911
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,140
I need to go to the Administrative Department

912
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,550
to make a name tag

913
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,540
for Vice President Yin.

914
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,240
We can't lose our pride.

915
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,520
Hurry up.

916
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,340
Make it big.

917
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:27,700
Okay.

918
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,620
Leave the high profile thing after work.

919
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,510
We still need to

920
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,320
work hard.

921
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,570
As you heard,

922
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,850
the performance assessment of this quarter

923
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,860
is very important.

924
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,580
If we complete it,

925
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,900
I'll give you a big red packet.

926
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,940
A big red packet.

927
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,670
Come on.

928
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,430
Come on. Let's get back to work.

929
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,640
Yike.

930
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:53,930
What's wrong?

931
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,100
Nothing.

932
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,580
I just changed my style.

933
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,660
I think it can make the fans feel fresh.

934
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,580
By the way, Yike,

935
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,150
I want to apply for

936
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,830
additional live streaming tonight and this weekend.

937
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,070
For the performance.

938
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,940
Didn't you always say

939
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,700
love comes first and work comes second?

940
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,760
Why did you change?

941
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,980
I just think

942
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,280
women in the new era

943
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,940
should put career as the top priority.

944
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,540
I have to work hard as well.

945
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,590
As your leader,

946
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,950
of course I support you.

947
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,610
But

948
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,500
are you really okay?

949
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,280
Yike, stop asking.

950
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:29,950
Fine.

951
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,560
Here.

952
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,470
Baba.

953
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,020
We haven't got the money yet,

954
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,060
but why do I feel like

955
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,260
I'm already knocked out?

956
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,390
I can buy a new

957
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,270
laptop.

958
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,010
-Buy it. -Buy.

959
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,030
I'll order

960
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,590
a 50-yuan takeout tonight.

961
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,920
Behave yourself.

962
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,950
50 yuan.

963
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,520
Let's go.

964
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,100
I'll treat you

965
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,080
to something worth 100 yuan.

966
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,750
Really?

967
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,190
Baba,

968
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,980
I've been waiting for you to say that.

969
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,190
Sichuan, Shandong, Guangdong, or Hunan.

970
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,140
Spanish, French, Japanese, or Korean.

971
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,820
All of them.

972
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,470
Pick one.

973
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,780
OK. Anything is fine.

974
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,700
Anyway, 100 yuan.

975
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,500
Just 100 yuan.

976
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,890
Let's go to the food stall then.

977
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,290
I have plans. I have to go.

978
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,490
Where are you going?

979
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,340
Damai.

980
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,010
This is good.

981
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,810
What's wrong?

982
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,530
Nothing.

983
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,070
Let's go eat.

984
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:09,900
100. 100.

985
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,220
Let's go.

986
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:10,590
100.

987
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:10,930
Go.

988
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,130
It's 110 already.

989
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,090
The average is only 100.

990
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:13,860
This is not 110, Dad Chen.

991
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,190
We've earned the money.

992
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,720
Hello?

993
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,630
Hello? Why are you running?

994
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,350
Where are you?

995
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,700
Why don't I see you?

996
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,700
Look to your left.

997
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,940
I want to be the first

998
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,870
to cheer for you.

999
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,490
The first person

1000
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,690
to congratulate you.

1001
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,540
Hello, auntie.

1002
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,570
Yike.

1003
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,020
Please save Zelin.

1004
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,600
Zelin?

1005
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,220

00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,370
What's wrong?

1011
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,750
Why are you sweating so much?

1012
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,390
I'm fine.

1013
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,700
I'm not feeling well.

1014
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,190
I need to use the bathroom.

1015
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,550
What's wrong?

1016
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,200
Maybe it's my period.

1017
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,440
It's okay.

1018
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,700
Period?

1019
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,810
Are you okay?

1020
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,100
I'm fine.

1021
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,440
I'm fine.

1022
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,730
Why did you

1023
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,820
tear Smiley apart?

1024
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,380
Cover yourself first. Don't catch a cold.

1025
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,640
Here's the hot pack.

1026
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,830
Rub it.

1027
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,990
Put it on your belly.

1028
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,360
This is hot brown sugar water.

1029
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,550
Be careful, it's hot.

1030
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,680
If it hurts badly,

1031
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,490
there are painkillers here.

1032
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,630
Why are you so well equipped?

1033
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,030
I just searched online.

1034
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,100
Don't worry.

1035
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:47,940
What are you noting?

1036
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,070
I'm noting

1037
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,300
when you can't eat cold food next month.

1038
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,570
You even care about this?

♫I fear I cannot see you in the next second♫

1049
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,600
♫My heart is protesting♫

1050
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,360
♫I just feel it too♫

1051
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:55,050
♫It's like the coffee with full caramel milk foam♫

1052
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:00,310
♫The air has the fragrance of missing you♫

1053
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,740
♫Baby, from now on, come to me♫

1054
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,030
♫Come to me♫

1055
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,080
♫I want to be an umbrella for you♫

1056
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,540
♫To shield you from rain and wind♫

1057
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,630
♫You are my luck♫

1058
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,020
♫I'm like an ice-cream beneath the sun♫

1059
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,440
♫Melt my heart into love♫

1060
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,220
♫Baby, from now on, come to me♫

1061
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,670
♫Come to me♫

♫I want to be an umbrella for you♫

1063
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,160
♫To shield you from rain and wind♫
