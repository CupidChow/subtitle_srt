Did you book a cab?

17
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,900
Hello, where are you going?

18
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,579
Sir, to

Li Zelin is quite open now.

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,510
Don't mention him.

25
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,060
He didn't come back that day.

26
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,900
Good for you. You've come around.

27

is about my friend.

Got it.

38
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,500
Everyone

39
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,750
has a friend

40
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,880
who cheats.

41
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,660
Given her situation,

42
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,660
is she...

43
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,860
Is she cheating?

44
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,149
Cheating?

45
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,110
Everyone

46
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,860
has a different definition

47
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
of cheating.

48
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,140
Some think

49
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,620
physical cheating is real cheating.

50
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,940
After all, as hormones fade away

51
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,090
and passions are gone,

52
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,380
it's understandable

53
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,580
that you would appreciate someone else.

54
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,300
This is the situation

55
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,340
where you have the motivation for a crime,

56
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,620
but you don't actually commit any crimes,

57
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,480
so you won't be sentenced with it.

58
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,180
What about the other situation?

59
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,850
The others think

60
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,540
that mental cheating is real cheating.

61
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,140
Why is it here?

62
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,020
There's one more situation

63
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,460
where they find love is a prison,

64
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,290
thus they cheat both physically and mentally.

65
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,070
When they're confirmed

66
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,780
that someone more suitable for them

67
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
shows up,

68
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,070
then they officially get out of the original relationship.

69
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,360
So, which situation

70
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
is your friend in?

71
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,250
I'll ask her on behalf you later.

72
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,260
It's getting late.

73
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,650
I'll be late for work.

74
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,420
Let's go to work.

75
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,500

Shen Xin.

85
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:17,820
Yes.

86
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,100
Tell everyone in the Marketing Department,

87
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,210
we're gonna have a meeting in five minutes.

88
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,870
No problem.

89
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,620
Yike.

90
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,060
Get ready

91
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,940
with the sales data of the products

92
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,050
endorsed by the spokesperson.

93
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:25,420
OK.

94
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,340
Let me explain

95
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,300
why we choose Li Li

96
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,500
as our spokesperson.

97
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,650
Lian Yu is a typical product

98
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,540
of our brand after our transformation.

99
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,840
Its target customers

100
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,600
are well-educated

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,880
professionals.

102
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,659
I know there are

103
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,760
many cosmetics and perfume brands

104
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,960
cooperating with idol groups.

105
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
But in my opinion,

106
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,990
they are just making quick money.

107
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,940
It doesn't

108
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,420
match up with their brands.

109
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,020
Speaking of risk assessment,

110
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,260
actually in recent years,

111
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
it's not uncommon to see idol groups blow their reputation.

112
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,270
Based on what I've mentioned,

113
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,530
I chose Li Li in the end.

114
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,320
Please come in.

115
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,340
Good morning, Frank. Good morning, Mr. Zheng.

116
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,970
Mr. Kong.

117
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,290
The sales number you asked for

118
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,220
is ready.

119
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,310
Shen Xin.

120
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,540
I've sent it to the company's mailbox.

121
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,740
Please open it for me.

122
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,060
Since you think

123
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,270
the risk is similar,

124
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,530
let's look at the data.

125
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,320
This is the sales data

126
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,860
of those products from other brands

127
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,600
endorsed by popular idol Chen Zicheng.

128
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,750
Take a look.

129
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,340
It's not shameful to compete with sales data.

130
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,800
But you'll get broke if you keep yourself aloof from the trend.

131
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,550
Another point

132
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,340
I'd like to mention is

133
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,570
international brands

134
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,470
also choose male idols nowadays.

135
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,340
This is not

136
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,260
making quick money.

137
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,580
This is adding

138
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,140
more youthful color

139
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,300
to the local brands.

140
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,230
Besides,

141
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,940
who says

142
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,330
the life cycle of male idols is short?

143
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,090
We've investigated

144
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:51,970
Chen Zicheng's background.

145
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,430
There is no negative news.

146
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,310
If the current trend

147
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,020
continues,

148
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,740
he's very likely

149
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,000
to be the next top star.

150
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,520
The sales data of the goods

151
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,470
endorsed by Chen Zicheng is pretty good.

152
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,380
Let him do the perfume series.

153
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,980
The scented series

154
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,020
should stick with Li Li.

155
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,020
Jiang Man.

156
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,270
If I remember correctly,

157
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,460
Chen Zicheng's agent

158
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,660
contacted us for the endorsement last year, right?

159
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,770
Get in touch with him.

160
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,570
Okay, I have his agent's number.

161
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,310
Wait.

162
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,500
Mr. Zheng.

163
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,020
It'd be better if you contact him on your own.

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,810
-Frank.
-Since you don't have any objections.

165
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,940
Go back to your work.

166
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,660
Okay.

167
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,060
I really don't understand.

168
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,740
Why would someone

169
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,900
make themselves look like this

170
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,140
every time they break up.

171
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,000
Look like what?

172
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,420
Like this miserable look.

173
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,440
Isn't that what breakups do to broken hearts?

174
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,030
It's okay

175
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,880
for normal people.

176
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,930
But given your frequency of doing that,

177
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,260
it'll be harmful to your health.

178
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,740
Do you want to

179
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,160
go to the healing party with me tonight?

180
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,540
Did I say it's for you?

181
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,140
I have something to do tonight.

182
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,020
Good luck.

183
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,060
Something's wrong with you.

184
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,220
You didn't even change your clothes

185
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,620
and stayed out all night.

186
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,220
Didn't you and that girl...

187
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,020
Did you two...

188
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,830
This chick is on fire.

189
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,290
This...

190
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,630
Good for her.

191
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,220
We really had

192
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,740
a grand dinner.

193
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,260
Am I right, buddies?

194
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,800
The more you drink,

195
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,510
the more energetic you are.

196
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,900
I drank too much today.

197
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,030
Let me take you home.

198
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,220
Look at you.

199
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,910
You're leaving as soon as it's juiced up.

200
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,660
Boy,

201
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,030
your boss means,

202
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,080
no matter what happens,

203
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,380
no one can leave here today.

204
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:20,860
Right?

205
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,790
You can't leave.

206
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,630
Do you hear me?

207
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,650
We're family.

208
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,640
Let me tell you.

209
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,250
This is called professional pick-up artist.

210
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,500
They say you're family.

211
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,200
In other words,

212
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,670
you have to accept it

213
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,780
no matter what work your boss asks you to do.

214
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,180
If they call you a friend,

215
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,790
you'll never get paid for working overtime.

216
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,340
Right?

217
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,460
Yeah.

218
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,710
You're nodding?

219
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,980
No, no, no.

220
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,140
Why did you take a break?

221
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,700
Come on, get up.

222
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,010
My friend,

223
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,990
don't you want to drink with me?

224
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,420
Why did you stop?

225
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,420
What are you shooting? You look so happy.

226
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,050
Boss.

227
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,180
We are all family.

228
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,100
Shall we delete it after watching?

229
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
How can I delete it?

230
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,050
She told me something about

231
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,610
professional pick-up artist yesterday.

232
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,540
Look, she's having another drink.

233
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,860
Do you know her?

234
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,940
Kind of.

235
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,020
Then...

236
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,040
What are you doing?

237
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,300
Don't you have to work?

238
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,920
This lady looks familiar.

239
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,700
A bonus.

240
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,020
Have a seat.

241
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,930
Let's talk.

242
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,060
So here's the deal.

243
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,500
You know this lady.

244
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,380
You want me to delete this video about her.

245
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,020
Right?

246
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:27,730
Yes.

247
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,370
It's not difficult.

248
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,900
It's easy to delete a video.

249
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,170
It's just that your boss, I,

250
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,640
have some problems recently.

251
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,290
What problems do you have, boss?

252
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,050
Here's the thing.

253
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,940
I got a case

254
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,820
from a client.

255
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,930
The case is also very simple.

256
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,000
Think out of the box.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,390
Create with love.

258
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,860
Do you understand?

259
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,300
I know

260
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,580
it goes against

261
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,910
your creative concept.

262
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,780
But maybe I shouldn't

263
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,980
tell you about this.

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,680
You know me.

265
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,120
I understand you, right?

266
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,300
And I'm not

267
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,750
that kind of boss

268
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,520
who would force others

269
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,050
to listen to me.

270
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,440
But

271
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,580
if this video is uploaded online,

272
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,300
it'll be...

273
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,000
Boss.

274
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,660
Just this once.

275
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,310
Don't do it again.

276
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,710
Okay.

277
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,600
Good.

278
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,020
The most important thing for a man

279
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,550
is to keep one's words.

280
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,820
We need to recall all the news articles

281
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,540
that have been sent out.

282
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,630
Change the advertisements on the ground,

283
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,180
plus those advertisements

284
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,520
in the promotional gifts.

285
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,940
Anything you want to add?

286
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,220
Have some water.

287
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,100
It was an emergency this weekend.

288
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,430
I'm glad you were there.

289
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,650
Besides, Kong Xianzhe

290
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,370
is getting arrogant lately.

291
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,640
Frank probably wants to

292
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,300
teach him a lesson through me.

293
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,300
Yes.

294
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,820
If I took maternity leave

295
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,700
for a few more months,

296
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,120
I'm afraid I would become nobody in the company

297
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,440
and lose my job.

298
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,110
OK.

299
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,210
I'll go get Mr. Kong’s signature.

300
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,920
Hello, Aunt Lan.

301
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,010
Ke.

302
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,340
If you get off work early,

303
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,870
can you go shopping with me?

304
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,040
Sure, I'll call you

305
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,700
after work.

306
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,360
Bye.

307
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,320
Come in.

308
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,000
Mr. Kong.

309
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,580
These are some contracts about changing the spokesperson

310
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,050
for you to sign.

311
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,660
Yike.

312
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,140
You look a bit different

313
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,980
today.

314
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,310
You look prettier.

315
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,850
This dress suits you well.

316
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,660
It looks perfect on you.

317
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,400
The Marketing Department

318
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,360
represents the image of our company.

319
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,220
Dress like this

320
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,160
going forward.

321
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,660
Thank you, Mr. Kong.

322
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,060
There's an urgent file

323
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,840
in these documents.

324
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,770
I put it on the top

325
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,400
and stuck a yellow label to it.

326
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,530
I'll leave you to it.

327
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,180
Aunt Lan.

328
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,540
Ke.

329
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,340
You're here.

330
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:41,670
Yeah.

331
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,080
Help me get these things.

332
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
Take a bag of lamb.

333
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,590
Lamb?

334
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,350
Lamb.

335
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,740
Okay.

336
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,260
And tripe.

337
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,540
Look. Here.

338
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,060
Who's coming over tonight?

339
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,270
Lele. Lele is back.

340
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,660
Lele is back!

341
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,190
Today is his first day

342
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,060
coming back home for dinner.

343
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,430
I want to

344
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,550
make hot pot.

345
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,640
Hello, your shoes.

346
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,290
Thank you.

347
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,220
You're welcome.

348
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,970
Remember to come early tonight.

349
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,540
I've prepared a lot of food.

350
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,930
Okay, I got it, mom.

351
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,470
Hello, sir.

352
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,840
Are you looking for a gift?

353
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,970
Let me give you some recommendations.

354
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,510
Look how busy you are.

355
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,590
Lele must be

356
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,380
as tall as 190 centimeters now.

357
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,510
He's that tall?

358
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,880
He must be tall.

359
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,250
You haven't seen him for a long time,

360
00:15:59,250 --> 00:15:59,690
right?

361
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,710
Exactly.

362
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,320
We only video chat.

363
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:04,690
Look.

364
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,700
There are five cups.

365
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,940
This is like a family.

366
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,790
You're right.

367
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,050
Are you looking at photos?

368
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:13,610
Yes.

369
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,700
Look, Yike.

370
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,780
At that time, Ke was the tallest.

371
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,280
Now, she's the shortest.

372
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,180
Look at Yibo.

373
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,850
He was cute when he was young, right?

374
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,010
Coming.

375
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,960
Go.

376
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,090
Mom.

377
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,260
Lele.

378
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,250
Come on in.

379
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,640
Change your shoes.

380
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,460
I'll get it for you.

381
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,280
Yin.

382
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,520
Lele is here.

383
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,270
Bro.

384
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,890
I haven't seen you for a while.

385
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,500
You're welcome.

386
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:47,820
Let me help you.

387
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,460
Okay, thank you.

388
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,900
Look.

389
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,220
Hello, uncle.

390
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,820
You're so tall.

391
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,100
Come on in, have a seat.

392
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,020
You must be tired coming all the way here.

393
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,300
Uncle, I haven't seen you for a while.

394
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,980
Yeah, it's been a long time.

395
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,820
You must be tired coming all the way here.

396
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,810
Look how tall you are.

397
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,040
Which one of you is taller?

398
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,920
How tall are you?

399
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,500
I'm 183 centimeters.

400
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,190
I'm 185 centimeters.

401
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,020
It must be me who's taller.

402
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,980
Yibo is taller.

403
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,190
He's only tall,

404
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,680
but not as successful as Lele.

405
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,300
I'm flattered.

406
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,569
Here, have some water. Thank you, mom.

407
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,970
What were you looking at?

408
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,640
We...

409
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,650
We were looking at

410
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,980
your childhood photos.

411
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,869
Look.

412
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,589
You were painting in this picture.

413
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,180
Here.

414
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,520
You and Yike. Look.

415
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,829
Isn't it interesting?

416
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,859
You two were playing on the lawn.

417
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,810
Right, where's Yike?

418
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,770
She's drying her hair.

419
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,609
I'll go get her.

420
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,410
Wait a moment.

421
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,670
Look at her.

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,540
Sister.

423
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,630
Lele is here.

424
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,450
Hurry up.

425
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,310
I know.

426
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,050
Where are my contact lenses?

427
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,220
Yin Yibo.

428
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,120
Where did you put my contact lens?

429
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,590
Check the cabinet.

430
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,610
I told you not to touch it.

431
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,440
Why did you put it on the cabinet?

432
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,290
It's not here.

433
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,590
Dining table.

434
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,670
I'll get it for you.

435
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,140
I'll go.

436
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,250
Okay.

437
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,780
Dining table.

438
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,460
Yours.

439
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Yike, I haven't seen you for a while.

440
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,940
You are...

441
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,890
He is Lele.

442
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,500
Can't you recognize him?

443
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,580
Guangxi.

444
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,650
Xu Guangxi.

445
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,650
I'll put on my contact lenses first.

446
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,170
Oh no.

447
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,890
He's Lele.

448
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,740
Boy,

449
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,120
your boss means,

450
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,530
no matter what happens,

451
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,850
no one

452
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,540
can leave here today.

453
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,600
What?

454
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,520
Uncle,

455
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,500
this is a neck massager

456
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,520
for you.

457
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,440
You always drive outside.

458
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,140
It'll be good for your body.

459
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,020
Thank you.

460
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,670
Mom,

461
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,170
this is your favorite donkey-hide gelatin.

462
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,020
It's good to have you here. You don't have to buy gifts.

463
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,900
There's a whole box of it.

464
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,900
I know you like it.

465
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,610
You're so sweet.

466
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,300
Yibo.

467
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,610
Li Ning's new release.

468
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,540
New release?

469
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,180
Wudao.

470
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,020
There's a surprise inside.

471
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,950
Check the heels.

472
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,210
My name's initials.

473
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,880
Thank you, bro.

474
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,730
You are my family from now on.

475
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,510
Sister.

476
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,310
What's taking you so long?

477
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,040
Gift time!

478
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,940
Coming.

479
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,140
Yike, this is for you. Liquor...

480
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:55,900
What liquor?

481
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,860
No one drinks in our family

482
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,710
except my dad.

483
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,500
No, thanks.

484
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,700
I mean no one else drinks

485
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,340
in our family except you.

486
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,350
Sister.

487
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,620
This is

488
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,620
liquor-filled chocolate.

489
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:11,740
If you don't explain,

490
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,470
no one will think you're a mute.

491
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,880
All right.

492
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,580
We're all here.

493
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,630
Let's dig in.

494
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,540
Help yourself.

495
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,180
Ke and I

496
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:21,920
went to the supermarket

497
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,900
and bought the beef

498
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
for you.

499
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,460
Try it.

500
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,170
Really?

501
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,490
Let me try.

502
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,630
Ke asked me

503
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,710
to buy more,

504
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,340
all different types of food.

505
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:32,980
Guangxi.

506
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,180
I heard from your mom

507
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,760
that you work for a film company?

508
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,280
Yes.

509
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,260
I'm an animation director.

510
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,750
A director?

511
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,850
Awesome!

512
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,420
Are you a member

513
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,740
of the national system?

514
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,920
Dad, time changes.

515
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,060
We don't care about that now.

516
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,940
Young people doing animations now

517
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,750
are ambitious

518
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,090
and have their dreams.

519
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,730
It's good to have dreams.

520
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,620
Guangxi.

521
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,740
How are you getting along with your colleagues

522
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,550
now that you're back?

523
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Are you used to it?

524
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,780
Mom.

525
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,190
I'm quite used to it.

526
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,900
Also I didn't expect

527
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,100
that our company

528
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,260
is just above Yike's company.

529
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,060
Really?

530
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,770
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

531
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,030
I will take care of you.

532
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,870
There you go, help yourself.

533
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,610
Yike.

534
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,920
It's fate that brought you and Guangxi together.

535
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,580
Please take care of Guangxi

536
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,900
on behalf of Aunt Lan.

537
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,660
Of course.

538
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,520
Yesterday, we...

539
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,380
What happened yesterday?

540
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,400
We didn't meet yesterday.

541
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,100
Yes, we did.

542
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,450
You met your sister yesterday?

543
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,690
Then why didn't you call me

544
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,150
when you saw me yesterday?

545
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,180
Seriously.

546
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,900
Your looks have changed so much

547
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,980
that I couldn't recognize you.

548
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,240
Why didn't you call me?

549
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,220
Remember to take care of your brother

550
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,540
going forward.

551
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,440
No problem, dad.

552
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,570
Here, have some more.

553
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,500
Help yourself.

554
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,490
It's full.

555
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:38,820
Have some more.

556
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,860
Have some meat.

557
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,070
Yike is so kind.

558
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,880
I'll take care of you.

559
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,600
Have more.

560
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,550
It's full.

561
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,900
Have more and talk less.

562
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,580
The shoes you gave me

563
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,020
is what I had been longing for.

564
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,540
Do you really like it?

565
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,140
Of course.

566
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,860
-We can go shopping together someday.
- Guangxi.

567
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,030
I prepared some delicious snacks for you.

568
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,190
Let me send you off.

569
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,450
Mom, it's okay.

570
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,350
I can go back by myself.

571
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,560
You've been busy all day.

572
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,260
Take a rest.

573
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,330
Right, Aunt Lan.

574
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,420
We are both shoe fans.

575
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,140
Let us talk.

576
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,180
Wait. Let me send him off.

577
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,700
Go back and rest.

578
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,600
Let's go.

579
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,450
Yike, thank you.

580
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,990
You're welcome, Aunt Lan.

581
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,420
When did my sister

582
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,420
become so active?

583
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,340
Xu Guangxi.

584
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,670
Sit down.

585
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,720
Confess and I'll be lenient with you.

586
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,970
What do you mean?

587
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,850
How about

588
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,130
we talk somewhere else?

589
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,700
Follow me.

590
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,110
Actually, at that convenience store, I...

591
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,810
You recognized me

592
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,270
at the convenience store?

593
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,660
I thought you looked familiar.

594
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,710
But I wasn't sure

595
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,360
until I saw you

596
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,140
give your business card

597
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,660
to Chen Musen.

598
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,210
I wanted to find the right time

599
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,890
to tell you.

600
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,140
The right time?

601
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,020
Wasn't it appropriate yesterday?

602
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,530
Why didn't you tell me

603
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,700
last night?

604
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,500
Is your head okay?

605
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,760
Do you want to buy some medicines?

606
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,220
Don't change the subject.

607
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,630
Answer my question.

608
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,780
I...

609
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,860
I told you yesterday.

610
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,230
Don't you remember?

611
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,310
You told me?

612
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,880
You really don't remember anything?

613
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,300
This is for you.

614
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,810
How did you know I wanted to eat this?

615
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,200
This is not for you to eat.

616
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,550
It's for your headache.

617
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,600
It's not for you...

618
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,780
To eat...

619
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,300
Good.

620
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,330
Promise me.

621
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,170
We'll go home after eating this.

622
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,460
No, no, no.

623
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,570
I want to drink more.

624
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,560
You can still drink?

625
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,220
You said you wanted to drink that day.

626
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,060
After you drank, you said

627
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,300
you couldn't go home.

628
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,250
You didn't want to make trouble.

629
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,050
You didn't want your dad to know.

630
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,070
So we

631
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,340
went to the hotel？

632
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:38,850
Yes.

633
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,570
And then?

634
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,650
And then...

635
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,640
Are you sure you want to listen?

636
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,620
Go ahead.

637
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,780
After that,

638
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,410
it is a little embarrassing.

639
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,190
A little more.

640
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:58,940
Just a little.

641
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,060
Okay.

642
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,980
Wait a minute.

643
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,580
Watch your back.

644
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,490
I can...

645
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,940
I want to drink more.

646
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,430
I can't drink anymore.

647
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,160
I can drink more.

648
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,670
I'm the God of War with strong willpower.

649
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,780
What is it

650
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,250
in your bag?

651
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,930
Why is it so heavy?

652
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:19,710
No.

653
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,060
Why is it so hot here?

654
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,210
Is the air conditioner on?

655
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,220
Air conditioner.

656
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,700
Turn on the air conditioner.

657
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,760
The air conditioner is turned on.

658
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,840
No way.

659
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,330
Why is it so hot?

660
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,540
What are you doing?

661
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,050
It's hot. I'm gonna take off my clothes.

662
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,730
You've gone too far.

663
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,290
No, it's too hot.

664
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,390
If you're fine,

665
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,710
I'm gonna go now.

666
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,390
Don't move.

667
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,260
Where are you going?

668
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,860
I haven't finished my story.

669
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
I suggest

670
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,460
it's best for you

671
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,900
to forget everything.

672
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,660
Then you just took your clothes off.

673
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,480
After that...

674
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,970
Be gentle.

675
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,460
Take off your hands.

676
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,020
Can you keep your voice down?

677
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,020
No.

678
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:11,890
Let me...

679
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,690
Then things become...

680
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,470
You have to be responsible for me.

681
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,540
No.

682
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,070
We...

683
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,660
No.

684
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,980
I have something important

685
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,100
to tell you.

686
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,720
I want to throw up.

687
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,450
Are you okay?

688
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,120
Do I look terrible now?

689
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:16,650
Of course not.

690
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,980
You are the prettiest woman

691
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,140
I've ever seen.

692
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,450
You can never

693
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,640
trust a man's words.

694
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,820
It's true.

695
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,700
I'm telling the truth.

696
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,940
Then why did you stand me up?

697
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,860
I didn't stand you up.

698
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,110
Why did you

699
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,550
stand me up

700
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,820
on my birthday?

701
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,710
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

702
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,960
Even one hour earlier.

703
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:50,900
No.

704
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,350
Half an hour earlier is enough.

705
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,500
Then I wouldn't have

706
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,130
wasted so much money.

707
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,240
Do you still want to throw up?

708
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,490
Go away.

709
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:28,920
That's it?

710
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,120
What else do you want?

711
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,380
What are you looking forward to?

712
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,040
Now you've grown up

713
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,710
and you're making fun of me?

714
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,580
Put your hands down.

715
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,100
I haven't finished

716
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,360
what I want to tell you.

717
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Do you know you snore when you sleep?

718
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,940
I snore?

719
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,960
You don't know?

720
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,430
It's a crispy and pleasant sound.

721
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,740
Not really a pleasant sound.

722
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,940
It's very loud.

723
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,970
It wakes me up.

724
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,000
You haven't heard of it before, right?

725
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,930
Let me find it for you.

726
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,650
Listen to it.

727
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,190
Listen to it.

728
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,760
Give it to me.

729
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,340
What are you doing?

730
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,880
Give it to me.

731
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,340
What are you doing?

732
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,100
Give it to me.

733
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,730
Look there.

734
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,290
Give it to me.

735
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,370
I didn't record it.

736
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,980
Do you really think I'm that bored?

737
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,620
Xu Guangxi.

738
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,580
Good for you.

739
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:18,730
Fine.

740
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,810
I can forgive you.

741
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:21,930
But you must

742
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,220
forget this.

743
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,390
Don't tell anyone.

744
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,280
Forget it?

745
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,420
Sure.

746
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,350
Let me tell you

747
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,240
one last thing.

748
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,020
Can you finish it

749
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,100
in one sitting?

750
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,050
The more you drink, the more energetic you are.

751
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,560
It's not about alcohol.

752
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,840
It's coffee.

753
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,540
Kid.

754
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
You talk too much.

755
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,040
Go on with your swing.

756
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,620
Do you want me

757
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,610
to talk much or less?

758
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,400
Talk when you should.

759
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,100
Shut up when you shouldn't.

760
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,110
It's hard.

761
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,620
But...

762
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,260
Yes, madam.

763
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,260
We're working

764
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,460
in the same building.

765
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,690
Yes.

766
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,220
I only found out that day.

767
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,790
It seems to be upstairs and downstairs, right?

768
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,270
Yes.

769
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,500
Please take care of me in the future.

770
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,300
You have to suck up to me.

771
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,730
You're as careless as

772
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,240
when you were a kid.

773
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,010
I'm not careless.

774
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,090
Then where is

775
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,580
your lipstick?

776
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,620
You found my lipstick.

777
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,850
I was wondering

778
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,170
where it is.

779
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,260
Where did I lose it?

780
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,620
I'm not telling you.

781
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,210
Are you holding a grudge?

782
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,380
How dare I?

783
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,630
You saved my life.

784
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,190
You always stood up for me

785
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,850
when I got bullied when I was young.

786
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,340
You still remember?

787
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,920
You've grown up in a blink of an eye.

788
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,590
I even can't recognize you.

789
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,980
But you're still beautiful.

790
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,430
You're glib-tongued,

791
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,790
although you're telling the truth.

792
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,490
Actually,

793
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,940
I have one last question

794
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,700
to ask you.

795
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,410
Your "actually"

796
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,850
freaked me out.

797
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,340
What's the question?

798
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,540
Who made you

799
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,860
waste that much money?

800
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,740
The last question.

801
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,510
As I said,

802
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,750
it's over.

803
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,110
Let's not talk about it.

804
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,830
Answer me.

805
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,350
Didn't we agree

806
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,410
I'll send you back?

807
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,140
Why did you walk back with me again?

808
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,610
It's okay.

809
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,820
I can go back by myself.

810
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,950
It's not far anyway.

811
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:28,980
Fine.

812
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,460
Be careful

813
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,570
when you ride.

814
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,330
Yike.

815
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,140
Yike.

816
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,690
Why didn't you take your phone with you?

817
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,150
How can you be so careless?

818
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,310
Why are you back?

819
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,550
For you, of course.

820
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,100
Hello.

821
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,620
I'm Yike's boyfriend,

822
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,180
Li Zelin.

823
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,090
You are...

824
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,390
He's son of Aunt Lan,

825
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,030
Guangxi.

826
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,040
So you're her brother.

827
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,070
I won't disturb you then.

828
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,460
I'm going home.

829
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,740
Take care.

830
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,660
Let's have dinner together another day.

831
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,310
Yike.

832
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,460
I didn't come back last time

833
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,580
to celebrate your birthday.

834
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,180
I'm sorry.

835
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,150
It's okay.

836
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,350
All right, don't be angry.

837
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,260
I have a gift for you.

838
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,060
Come with me.

839
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,370
What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?

840
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:04,890
No.

841
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,290
I told you

842
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,920
not to give me roses anymore.

843
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,440
My secretary told me

844
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,760
girls like roses.

845
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,610
I asked her

846
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,830
to prepare it for you.

847
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:17,920
How about

848
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,940
I go upstairs

849
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,469
and visit uncle and auntie?

850
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,940
It's too late.

851
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,070
They must be asleep.

852
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,179
Well,

853
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,489
how about having some food with me?

854
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,889
I haven't had dinner yet.

855
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:28,500
Let's go.

856
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,010
You're back.

857
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,860
A child is lucky to have a mother.

858
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,860
What are you eating?

859
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,850
Auntie is here.

860
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,940
She's been here for a while.

861
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,200
She's in your room now.

862
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,230
Mom.

863
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,880
Look at you.

864
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,110
You came back home for dinner.

865
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,240
Why did you give me money？

866
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,700
Take it.

867
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,940
Mom.

868
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,830
It's not much money.

869
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,580
I earned it from abroad.

870
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:23,700
Besides,

871
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,310
I have to

872
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,120
go back to Uncle Yin's house for dinner often.

873
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,600
It's okay to pay for food.

874
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,790
It's okay to have meals at home.

875
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,330
Why do you pay?

876
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,450
Besides, even if you pay for it,

877
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,260
your uncle won't accept it.

878
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,060
Fine.

879
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,030
Mom, I know I was wrong.

880
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,990
I won't give money to you next time.

881
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,790
How about this, mom?

882
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,190
You've been busy all day.

883
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,170
Let's sit down

884
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,030
and have a rest.

885
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,030
I'll get you some water.

886
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,900
By the way,

887
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,300
didn't you come back

888
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,960
with Ke after dinner?

889
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,320
Why are you so late?

890
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,770
We met her boyfriend on the way.

891
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,840
Zelin is back?

892
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,190
That's great.

893
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,220
Have they been together for a long time?

894
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,630
They've been together for four years.

895
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,300
They are getting married this year.

896
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,950
They had a fight recently.

897
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,180
I was worried.

898
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,220
It seems that Zelin

899
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,640
is quite understanding.

900
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,940
By the way,

901
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,170
next time at home,

902
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,190
you can't call her Yike.

903
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,390
You should call her sister, got it?

904
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,170
Got it.

905
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,220
Okay, I'll put it away for you.

906
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:58,710
Mom.

907
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,420
I'll take care of the rest.

908
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,170
Look.

909
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,090
Shall we put it back?

910
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,580
There you go.

911
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,270
You kid.

912
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,020
Auntie, you're leaving?

913
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,380
Thank you for your food.

914
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,590
It's okay. Enjoy it.

915
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,450
Goodbye, auntie.

916
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,250
I'll bring more to you next time.

917
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,220
Auntie, you're so nice.

918
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,610
Sister.

919
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,350
♫Travels to the end♫

920
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,300
♫Of the whole universe♫

921
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,040
♫Together, we will♫

922
00:37:53,060 --> 00:38:00,470
♫Get the whole one world♫

923
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,350
To punish you for lying to me,

924
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,410
buy me an ice cream.

925
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,020
Okay.

926
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,510
Sir, one ice cream.

927
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:12,900
Okay.

928
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,730
Here you go.

929
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,420
Thank you.

930
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,640
Only one?

931
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,640
Don't you want to have one?

932
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,240
I...

933
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,220
I have

934
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,940
something else.

935
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,060
This one.

936
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,300
If you like cola so much,

937
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,430
why don't you change your name to Cola?

938
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,890
You said the same thing when you were young.

939
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,610
Did I?

940
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:40,900
Yes.

941
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,300
When I was little, I drank too much Cola.

942
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,340
My teeth were almost decayed,

943
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,470
but I still drank it.

944
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,410
Then you said,

945
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,200
"You might as well change your name to Cola."

946
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,830
It's been a long time.

947
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,090
I don't even remember.

948
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,970
Then why did you

949
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,370
change your name to Lele?

950
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,760
Because you are Coco.

951
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,140
Coco and Lele.

952
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,390
You are so sweet.

953
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,120
How can Coco not have Lele?

954
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,610
♫Look at me♫
