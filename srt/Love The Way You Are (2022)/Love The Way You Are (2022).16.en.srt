00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,680
elegant and gentle.

Do you understand?

157
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,440
Are you sure you want to hold my hand?

158
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,620
Don't you know

159

Of course.

Xia Xiaomian, actually,

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,670
it's not hard for you

170
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,020
to think from another perspective.

171
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,540
You're indeed Dan from Xiafei Road.

172

After listening to you,

173
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,910
I want to place an order.

174
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,890
Shut up, Xu Guangxi.

175
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,430
This is a female fragrance.

176

Okay.

178
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,260
But let me make it clear.

179
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,250
You must keep

180
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,530
to my sister about tonight.

181
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,140
But according to her tension,

182
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
she'll be watching the first live stream.

183
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,510
Do your best.

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,800
If you have any questions,

185
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,210
send a message in the group chat.

186
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,050
I'll find another way

187
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,980
to distract her.

188
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,950
No.

189
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,970
Why not?

190
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,850
The bet is not valid yet.

191
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,510
I'm your sister's boyfriend.

192
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,630
What bet?

193
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,750
Can I bet?

194
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,230
-Go away.
-Go away.

195
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,430
Xu Guangxi.

196
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,710
Just this time.

197
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,690
If you seduce my sister

198
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,940
while I'm not around,

199
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,700
well, I...

200
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,900
There must be a sequence.

201
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,200
Can we talk about it after the live stream?

202
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,140
Go on with your teaching.

203
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,480
So, Xia Xiaomian,

204
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,420
do you understand?

205
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,950
The things of empathy I just told you.

206
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,880
I've checked them all.

207
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
You did a good job.

208
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,250
Don't worry, Yike.

209
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,660
Tonight, according to this order,

210
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
there will be no problem.

211
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,140
Okay.

212
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,390
After today,

213
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,620
the mid-term data will come out.

214
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,090
Tonight is very important.

215
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,220
So we must work hard.

216
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,590
OK.

217
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,280
OK. Come on.

218
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,830
Yike.

219
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,880
We'll get ready.

220
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,180
Come on.

221
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,110
Let's get ready.

222
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:28,490
OK.

223
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,740
Where is Xia Xiaomian?

224
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,110
Where is she?

225
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm late.

226
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,190
Sorry.

227
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,070
I'm here.

228
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,090
Where have you been?

229
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,440
Have you finished memorizing the script?

230
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,100
Yes.

231
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,210
Yike.

232
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,150
Just leave it to us.

233
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,500
Tomorrow, I'll show you

234
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,330
what a sales miracle is.

235
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,610
Rest assured.

236
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,300
What are you talking about?

237
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,030
Today is so important.

238
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,170
How can I not be here?

239
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,660
You're not leaving?

240
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
That's not right.

241
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,330
Yike, think about it.

242
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,510
You are the leader.

243
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,740
It's such an important occasion.

244
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,500
If you're here,

245
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,810
the employees will be nervous, right?

246
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,580
Just go back to nurture your health,

247
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,550
apply a mask,

248
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,980
and wait for our good news.

249
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,480
Right?

250
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,540
You're so afraid that Yike will be here.

251
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,070
Are you trying to slack off?

252
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:08,690
I...

253
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,430
I know.

254
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,300
Are you afraid if you fail

255
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,780
you will be hammered by Yike?

256
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,690
Am I right?

257
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,210
I'll hammer you.

258
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,780
You...

259
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,040
Enough.

260
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,490
Stop messing around.

261
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,440
The live stream

262
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,560
is in an hour.

263
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,090
Yike,

264
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,350
let's check

265
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,910
the list of our live stream today.

266
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,440
Let's go.

267
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:24,730
Go.

268
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,210
Hurry up and get ready.

269
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,810
Come to us when you are ready.

270
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,770
Your sister is still here.

271
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,650
Don't come up.

272
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,440
But I'm going to start.

273
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,350
What should I do?

274
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,650
If my sister finds out,

275
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,340
Dan from Xiafei Road will be beaten

276
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,400
to be Hornet's Nest from Xiafei Road.

277
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,100
In the middle,

278
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,460
we can't let the popularity fall.

279
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:55,820
Otherwise,

280
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,350
-the data will be bad
-Yike.

281
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,870
It's coffee time.

282
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,700
Just to show my concern.

283
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,370
For us?

284
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Thank you, Guangxi.

285
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,200
Everyone,

286
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,750
Guangxi brought us coffee.

287
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,420
Thank you.

288
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,940
Thank you, Guangxi.

289
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,780
Thank you, Guangxi.

290
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,900
Good luck on the live stream.

291
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,230
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

292
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,050
Why do you want to show your concern?

293
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,600
That's true.

294
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,890
But I still need you to

295
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,660
do me a favor.

296
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,430
It's urgent.

297
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,050
It's about to start.

298
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,850
What's wrong?

299
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,140
Let's talk on the way.

300
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,140
Just ten minutes.

301
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,310
You...

302
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,400
What are you doing?

303
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,730
Xia Xiaomian.

304
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,820
What are you doing? Have some coffee.

305
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,260
Coming.

306
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,320
Are you done? What are you looking at?

307
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,100
Thank you.

308
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,140
Why do I feel Guangxi is

309
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,470
more and more handsome?

310
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,740
What do you want me to do?

311
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,060
I have a very important mission.

312
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,570
What is it?

313
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm stuck in a plot.

314
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,610
I need your advice.

315
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,660
Okay.

316
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,130
I'll give you ten minutes at most.

317
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,690
About my live stream today,

318
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,180
you know,

319
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,090
it's really important.

320
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,350
Yike.

321
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,050
What shampoo did you use today?

322
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,140
Why does it smell so good?

323
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,080
What are you doing, Xu Guangxi?

324
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,660
Yibo, you're finally here.

325
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,430
Xiaomian, it's about to start.

326
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,610
Coming.

327
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,840
This is...

328
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,460
Special assistant.

329
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,500
My sales elixir.

330
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,220
Let's go to the live room.

331
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,390
Give me the live stream schedule.

332
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,700
These are all prepared today.

333
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,140
These are the special gifts for Double Seventh Festival.

334
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,070
This is the product introduction.

335
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,810
Xu Guangxi.

336
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,940
You're a little weird today.

337
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,800
Are you hiding something from me?

338
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,700
I

339
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,580
learned a new

340
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,940
technique of latte art.

341
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,950
I was going to surprise you.

342
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,670
So being stuck in the plot

343
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,530
is just a cover.

344
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,290
Okay, I promise you.

345
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,590
I'll come to you

346
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,880
after the live stream.

347
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,780
See you later.

348
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,340
100 pieces for the main product.

349
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,370
Your sister is back again.

350
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,550
Wait.

351
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,060
Xiaomian, your special guest

352
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,370
leaves suddenly?

353
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,820
He has something to do.

354
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,420
Brother, what should we do?

355
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,580
It's about to start.

356
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,770
Xia xiaomian, don't panic.

357
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,100
I'll command you live stream in distance.

358
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,060
Xiaomian.

359
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,310
Are you ready?

360
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll be your assistant today.

361
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,230
I am ready.

362
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,450
Brother, I'm a little nervous.

363
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,090
Brother?

364
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,320
Let me try the sound.

365
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,060
Brother.

366
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,060
Xia Xiaomian,

367
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,420
ask the assistant to send

368
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,620
the account and password of

369
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,250
the link monitoring backstage data.

370
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,450
And then send it to me.

371
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,140
Shen Xin.

372
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,300
Send me

373
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,890
password of

374
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,470
the backstage data monitoring account.

375
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,910
Just send it to me.

376
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,100
Okay, I got it.

377
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,560
I've sent you

378
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,380
all the product introduction.

379
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,940
Just do as I said.

380
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,510
Say them out naturally,

381
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,370
casually and happily.

382
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:57,800
OK?

383
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,540
-How is it?
-It's about to start.

384
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,330
Ready for live streaming.

385
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,130
Three, two, one.

386
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,340
Start.

387
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,180
Hello, everyone.

388
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,430
Welcome to the live room.

389
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,350
I'm your

390
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,700

391
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,690

393
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,320
When doing product introduction,

394
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,540
the first thing is the characteristics of the product.

395
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,740
The standard fragrance to attract men.

396
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,110
Next is

397
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,190
our first perfume.

398
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,300
The standard fragrance to attract men.

399
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,310
Next, let's smell

400
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,200

401
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,790
Describe the smell.

402
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,910
Just tell

403
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,550
a romantic love story

404
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,980
on a street with sycamore trees in summer

405
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,230

406
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,960
Let's describe this perfume

407
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,050
with sycamore trees in summer.

408
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,850
Just like riding bike romantically

409
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,980
on the boulevard with sycamore trees

410
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,500

Our special orange fragrance.

429
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,820
Xiaomian's pace is good today.

430
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,250
She's different today.

431
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,330
She's totally different from usual.

432
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,440
The data is good too.

433
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,240
Why are they all male fans?

434
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:31,900
Xia Xiaomian,

435
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,080
let's change

436
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,720
the order of live streaming.

437
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,790
Draw the prize first.

438
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,770
And then put forward the link for Double Seventh Festival.

439
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,570
Let's increase the popularity.

440
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,070
OK.

441
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,390
Next, please

442
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,450
take the link of No. 17 first.

443
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,860
Let's move on to

444
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,420
the happy lucky draw.

445
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,780
Let's invite our assistant.

446
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,580
Why didn't she follow the order?

447
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
She seems to have her own procedure.

448
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,910
She don't need my remind at all.

449
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,980
A mysterious assistant just came.

450
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,100
But he left

451
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,130
soon.

452
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,540
Did Xiaomian ask

453
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,500
from a master?

454
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,450
Well,

455
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,790
Shen Xin, help me.

456
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,570
Coming.

457
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,500
Well,

458
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,360
adjust this height for me.

459
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,380
Xiaomian,

460
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,780
extend the drawing part

461
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,080
for three minutes.

462
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,570
When the popularity

463
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,340
increase a little in the live room,

464
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,600
let's continue, okay?

465
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,470
Because the backstage shows

466
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,530
there are still more male fans

467
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,260
than female fans.

468
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,970
Because this perfume

469
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,220
is mainly designed for women.

470
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,380
If you want

471
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,340
female fans to buy it,

472
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,130
you should...

473
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,820
Yibo.

474
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,340
Put on a few female products.

475
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,020
For example...

476
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,940
A mysterious assistant just came.

477
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,950
But he left

478
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,940
soon.

479
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,570
Product No. 22

480
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,470
and

481
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,940
Product No.6.

482
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,540
How about this?

483
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,270
Tell them

484
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,500
a romantic love story

485
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,660
about women.

486
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,560
You are good at making up stories.

487
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,720
You are brave enough to make it up.

488
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,020
Xiaomian.

489
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,310
Say something!

490
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,609
Hello, Xia Xiaomian.

491
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,050
Listen to me.

492
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,910
Can you hear me?

493
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,890
Where is Yike?

494
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,200
Well...

495
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,420
Hello?

496
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,760
Next,

497
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,940
we...

498
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:24,900
Well...

499
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,380
Well,

500
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,569
this product...

501
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,460
Xia Xiaomian, what are you doing?

502
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,420
Yike.

503
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,300
Why are you here?

504
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,860
Did you see Yin Yibo today?

505
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,250
Why did you mention him suddenly?

506
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,700
I heard

507
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,630
Yibo's voice

508
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,300
from Xia Xiaomian's headphone.

509
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,730
No.

510
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,700
How is that possible?

511
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,600
Xiaomian, say something!

512
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,240
Xiaomian.

513
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,310
The live stream

514
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
has half an hour to go.

515
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,940
We still have a long way to go.

516
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,230
Work harder.

517
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,520
OK? Xiaomian, come on!

518
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,340
OK.

519
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,530
Next,

520
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,890
we...

521
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,640
Well...

522
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,050
Well...

523
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,120
Well,

524
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,080
this perfume is our...

525
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,170
What are you doing?

526
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,230
Well...

527
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,820
Calm down. Don't be nervous.

528
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,750
We...

529
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,010
Yibo.

530
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,190
Don't panic.

531
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,140
Get ready for the next product introduction.

532
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,780
I'll use my account

533
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,880
to call you

534
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,760
and help you get more popularity.

535
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:39,990
Hurry up.

536
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,740
Hello, everyone.

537
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,620
This is Dan from Xiafei Road.

538
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,460
Today,

539
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,620
we will have an extra show temporarily

540
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,640
because of

541
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,720
our close friends,

542
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,690
the live streamer of SC Fragrance.

543
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,930
Xia Xiaomian.

544
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,590
Let's

545
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,820
connect with her, OK?

546
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,620
Hello, Xiaomian.

547
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:57,980
Hello, Xiaomian.

548
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,500
Long time no see.

549
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,250
Hello.

550
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,270
Hello.

551
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,900
Here's the thing.

552
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,000
Xiaomian is a friend

553
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,160
I've known for years.

554
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,740
She's always passionate about

555
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,740
her own research of

556
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,140
fragrance and smell.

557
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,020
In some working occasions

558
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,700
or social occasions,

559
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,980
if I have to pick a perfume,

560
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,100
I'll ask her in advance.

561
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,540
Xiaomian, I want to know

562
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,100
what will you choose for

563
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,180
a normal journey?

564
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,140
What kind of perfume

565
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,070
will you choose?

566
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,820
Dan from Xiafei Road?

567
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,580
Search him online

568
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,010
and you'll know how good your brother is.

569
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,630
This is why

570
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,080
you sent me away today.

571
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,380
It's not right

572
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,620
to be a live streamer without telling you,

573
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,360
but he must have

574
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,320
his reason.

575
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,700
I suggest

576
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,390
to see his performance first.

577
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,130
He put a lot of effort into it.

578
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:42,990
OK.

579
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,380
Xiaomian just gave

580
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,220
an introduction to this product.

581
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,500
It reminds me of a story.

582
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,460
When you were young, have you ever

583
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,720
had a kind of ice cream?

584
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,030
-It only costs 50 cents per stick.
-Ice cream?

585
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,310
Yes, you've had it before, right?

586
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,820
There are many flavors,

587
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,550
like Sprite and orange flavor.

588
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,380
There are various flavors.

589
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,560
When you

590
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,300
put it in your mouth,

591
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,160
at that moment,

592
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,340
it was really cold.

593
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,000
At this time,

594
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,250
if the girl you like

595
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,980
or the boy you like.

596
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,650
First love?

597
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,810
You may say that.

598
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,460
He or she suddenly appeared next to the basketball court.

599
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
At that moment...

600
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,940
All the handsome and beauties in the live room,

601
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,340
please place orders now.

602
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,980
Link No. 1.

603
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,880
There are 98 groups left.

604
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,110
90 groups.

605
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,190
80.

606
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,660
The last 39 groups.

607
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,940
Guys, place your order.

608
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,350
Yike.

609
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,260
The trading volume

610
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,000
reached

611
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,590
8.53 million yuan.

612
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,370
Yike.

613
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,120
Haven't you heard of him?

614
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,350
He's Dan from Xiafei Road.

615
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,260
He's a famous trendy influencer

616
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,660
and has millions of fans.

617
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,570
I bought a lot of things

618
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,830
in his live stream.

619
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,150
He's using

620
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,380
his popularity

621
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,750
to help Xiaomian's live stream.

622
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,780
We don't have to worry about

623
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,740
today's KPI.

624
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,420
He is my brother.

625
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,310
Ten million, Yike.

626
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,140
Ten million.

627
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,780
Not only did we reach

628
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,590
the KPI,

629
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,260
we also

630
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,980
exceed it.

631
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,900
Our Live Stream Department is safe.

632
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,060
I'll leave you alone.

633
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,060
See you next time.

634
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,150
Okay, thank you.

635
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:37,780
Bye.

636
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,300
Bye.

637
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,980
Yibo.

638
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,690
It's really good to have you.

639
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,380
Thank you for helping the live stream.

640
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,090
Wait.

641
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,090
Sister.

642
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,320
Sister.

643
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,140
Dan from Xiafei Road, right?

644
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,800
How come I don't know it?

645
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,930
You are really good.

646
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,840
Yike.

647
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,930
Yibo

648
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,420
works very hard.

649
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,180
He's really good at live streaming.

650
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,560
He taught me all my work.

651
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,750
He helped us

652
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,710
such a big favor.

653
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,620
Please don't blame him.

654
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,940
Sister, I'm doing live stream.

655
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,030
Are you angry?

656
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,940
Do you care if I'm angry or not?

657
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,910
Of course I do.

658
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,780
Then why did you come to help me

659
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,980
without telling me earlier?

660
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,670
We got

661
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,340
such a good result today.

662
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,400
I should thank you.

663
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,520
Thank me?

664
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,210
Well.

665
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,240
Sister, will you

666
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,230
allow me to do live stream?

667
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,660
This is a different matter.

668
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,580
About your live stream,

669
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,770
talk to dad when you are home.

670
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,210
Tell dad, I...

671
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,600
He's very capable.

672
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,530
He even made a bet with me

673
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,580
because of the live stream today.

674
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,800
It makes me

675
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,470
in a dilemma.

676
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,360
A bet?

677
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,340
What bet?

678
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,510
Yeah.

679
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,760
What bet?

680
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
Why didn't I know?

681
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,960
When did it happen?

682
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,100
Yike.

683
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,040
We've reached our target.

684
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,530
Congratulations.

685
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,530
The live stream today

686
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,850
is a success.

687
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,850
Hurry up and pack up.

688
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,940
Let's go home earlier.

689
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,470
I'll send red packets in the group chat later.

690
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,540
Red packets!

691
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,820
Thank you, everyone.

692
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,340
Sister, just tell me.

693
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,170
Do you support me to do live stream?

694
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,500
I need to think about it.

695
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,020
After all, you hid it from me.

696
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,330
I'm a little sad.

697
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,510
Didn't you hide

698
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,830
your own things?

699
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,860
We are talking about you now.

700
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,120
Don't get me involved.

701
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,170
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

702
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,230
Sister,

703
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,580
I think the live stream...

704
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,140
I think...

705
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,060
What do you want?

706
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,170
When you helped Xiaomian,

707
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,570
you were a fluent talker.

708
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,190
Why are you

709
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,150
so hesitant now?

710
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,240
I really want to take live stream

711
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,470
as a career.

712
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,300
I won't give up

713
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,260
casually.

714
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,910
So I hope you can...

715
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,090
You can support me.

716
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,300
I didn't expect

717
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,710
besides asking for living expenses

718
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,960
you would also

719
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,600
say words like "support me".

720
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,650
Don't interrupt me.

721
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,860
Just tell me.

722
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,740
Will you help me or not?

723
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,340
Anyway,

724
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,420
I helped you so much.

725
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,080
You can't cheat your brother.

726
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:35,950
Don't worry.

727
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,530
I know you really like it.

728
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,110
I am on your side.

729
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,270
Really?

730
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,500
You agreed so easily?

731
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,410
Even if I say no,

732
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,780
you won't give up.

733
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,820
But...

734
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:48,980
But?

735
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,220
But you have to keep the secret for me

736
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,420
about Guangxi and me.

737
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,370
Are you really going to

738
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,500
have a relationship with him?

739
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,300
Let me ask you.

740
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,470
Did Guangxi

741
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,430
ask you for help?

742
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,150
Yes.

743
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,570
He kept begging me,

744
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,540
so I came to help.

745
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,500
Look.

746
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,330
He's like this.

747
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,870
He never says anything,

748
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,560
but he does a lot for me.

749
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,250
Sister, I think

750
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,180
you've changed.

751
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,540
What? I look prettier?

752
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,500
I think

753
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,650
a little rebellious.

754
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,380
Rebellious?

755
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,490
I think

756
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,070
I've become more good at cherishing myself.

757
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,370
In the past,

758
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,530
I always thought I am

759
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,100
the daughter of Yin Chenggong,

760
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,160
Yin Yibo's sister,

761
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,010
Yike from the bomb disposal team,

762
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,310
and Li Zelin's girlfriend.

763
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,070
Yin Yike.

764
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,120
If you walk out of this room,

765
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,770
it's impossible for us.

766
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,220
Whatever I do,

767
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,180
I always consider your feelings first.

768
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,950
Sometimes, I even think

769
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,870
your feelings are what matter.

770
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm not important.

771
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,970
Over time,

772
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,830
I forgot

773
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,060
what my happiness is.

774
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,980
But ever since I met Guangxi,

775
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,880
I realized that

776
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,380
I am worth to be cherished.

777
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,640
The reason for this relationship is that

778
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,970
Guangxi makes me feel I am good.

779
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,750
I want to cherish myself better.

780
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,910
This is what love

781
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,910
should be.

782
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,550
But

783
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,170
if dad finds out,

784
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,300
he'll go to hospital because of anger.

785
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,840
Do you acknowledge me?

786
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,330
I...

787
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,460
Good boy.

788
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,220
After all the rounds,

789
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,450
you still want me to acknowledge you.

790
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,560
Are you really going to date

791
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,830
with Xu Guangxi?

792
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,140
In the past,

793
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,260
I thought I live my life

794
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,860
following others'choices.

795
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,340
But this time,

796
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,160
I want to be myself.

797
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,920
I want to make my own choice

798
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,340
and live my own life.

799
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,250
Xu Guangxi

800
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,720
will become my brother-in-law.

801
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,450
How can I defend him

802
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,910
when playing basketball?

803
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,140
How should I call him?

804
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,140
He'll be my elder.

805
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:32,940
Shouldn't he give me red packets

806
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,060
on New Year?

807
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,650
Then I...

808
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,680
What are you thinking

809
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,640
in your mind?

810
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,540
That's it.

811
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,260
I believe in your choice.

812
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,550
You believe in mine.

813
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,350
Deal?

814
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,510
It's a deal.

815
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,260
But let me make it clear.

816
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,020
I still need to

817
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,780
inspect Xu Guangxi.

818
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,210
And it will be a long time.

819
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:50,950
Fine.

820
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,100
You are my family.

821
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,410
Take your time.

822
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,020
So...

823
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,070
Sister, you

824
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,430
support me to do live stream?

825
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,460
There's something

826
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,330
I have to tell you.

827
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,080
I think

828
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,090
you did a great job

829
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,690
in the live stream industry.

830
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,390
I am a greenhand.

831
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,300
I still need to learn from you in this industry.

832
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,500
Of course, Dan from Xiafei Road

833
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,940
is not for nothing.

834
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,350
Yin Yibo said

835
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,540
he has to carefully inspect

836
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,510
Xu Guangxi.

837
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,260
And there will be no due date.

838
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,970
Thank you, Yin Yike.

839
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,950
Double Seventh Festival is coming.

840
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,880
Get ready to receive the surprise.

841
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,140
This is the mid-term data of this month.

842
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,500
These special events

843
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,880
were a success.

844
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,280
Although they met

845
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,540
Frank's expectation,

846
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,530
the transformation rate

847
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,060
still needs to be improved.

848
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,580
We didn't get the client

849
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,540
of the huge live stream platform.

850
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
It's all my fault.

851
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,390
I didn't expect

852
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,330
Kong Xianzhe would play dirty tricks

853
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,730
right in front of people.

854
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,690
He came for me.

855
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,860
It was my mistake to let you go.

856
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,800
Luckily, you're fine.

857
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,750
Ms. Zheng, don't say that.

858
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,860
There are too many things

859
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,700
that are not friendly to women in the workplace.

860
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,100
No one could expect that.

861
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,420
Even you work with me,

862
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,020
you've still suffered a lot.

863
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,860
When you saved me

864
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,450
and asked me to join the Live Stream Department,

865
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,280
I decided

866
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,140
to make some achievements

867
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,780
in the Live Stream Department.

868
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,100
These are just small difficulties

869
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,300
that can be overcome.

870
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,950
Actually, I've been thinking

871
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,990
we can't just do promotion.

872
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,090
We need to have our

873
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,690
most competitive products.

874
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,590
Yes.

875
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,600
When the new product is launched,

876
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,920
Mr. Kong will definitely

877
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,740
compete with us.

878
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,500
Actually, I've finished

879
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,760
the promotion scheme.

880
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,390
But to be different

881
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,610
from them,

882
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,190
so that we can launch first online,

883
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,300
we need a gimmick.

884
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,830
A gimmick?

885
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,390
Wait,

886
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,690
there's a mobile game company

887
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,020
called Flower World.

888
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,120
They seem to be famous

889
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,130
in the game circle.

890
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,420
But they have too many categories

891
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,780
and the competition is too fierce.

892
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,510
So,

893
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,650
they want to find a new promotion method

894
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,060
and want to cooperate with us.

895
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,260
I know the Flower World.

896
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,150
It's amazing.

897
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,820
Are they working with us?

898
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,420
If we can work out a collaboration with them

899
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,620
and launch it online,

900
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,550
it will be great.

901
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,740
Cool.

902
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,420
Well,

903
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,720
I want you to follow up.

904
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,500
Look, many of our current competitors

905
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,280
are doing promotions.

906
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,350
We must surpass them

907
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,220
on the data.

908
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,300
I'll discuss the plan

909
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,180
with the team.

910
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,680
Thank you, Ms. Zheng.

911
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,640
Mr. Ma.

912
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,340
This is our cooperation plan.

913
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,400
Please take a look.

914
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,340
Although our live stream

915
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,670
started not long ago,

916
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,720
the data growth

917
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,570
has been very stable

918
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,770
and very optimistic.

919
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:03,780
I believe

920
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,910
the fragrance collaboration series

921
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,650
will definitely succeed

922
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,880
in the market.

923
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,390
This is Wu Yurou.

924
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,960
Our new live streamer.

925
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,020
She has been on the trending news list

926
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,780
several times.

927
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,910
She's very popular.

928
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:13,960
Mr. Ma.

929
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,380
As we know,

930
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,890
the newly launched mobile game

931
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,960
is very popular.

932
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,020
We can share our product design

933
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,450
on this basis.

934
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,430
On one hand, turn our perfume

935
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,450
into a flat image and

936
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,630
insert it into the game

937
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,140
to increase gaming income.

938
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,140
On the other hand,

939
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,280
in our live room,

940
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,020
we could promote actual derivative products.

941
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,820
Working both online and offline

942
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,190
will be a win-win situation for both of us.

943
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,440
I didn't expect

944
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,740
your live streamer

945
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,840
knows so much about

946
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,710
our products.

947
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,190
It's not an easy thing.

948
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,580
After all, we sincerely want to cooperate with you.

949
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,310
We should do our homework well.

950
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,330
I think your ideas are great.

951
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,140
This is better than directly selling products

952
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,470
in the live stream.

953
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,490
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

954
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,970
Well,

955
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,100
can we sign the contract today?

956
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,290
Today?

957
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,240
Don't get me wrong.

958
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,040
Our Flower World

959
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,490
takes efficiency as the first prioriy.

960
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,500
Because summer vacation is coming,

961
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,460
it happens to be the peak season

962
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,520
of our mobile game.

963
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,510
I don't know

964
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,020
how long does it takes on your side.

965
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,960
But I'm sure

966
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,550
it takes time from design to sample

967
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,640
for new packaging.

968
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,200
I mentioned it to Ms. Zheng last time.

969
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,660
That's why I'm here today.

970
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,650
Mr. Xu

971
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,580
particularly asked me

972
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,110
to bring the official seal.

973
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:26,990
Miss Yin.

974
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,120
Mr. Ma.

975
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,660
Do we have to

976
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,620
sign it in a rush today?

977
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,750
Is there a problem?

978
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,010
Actually, several companies

979
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,440
are inviting us to work on a collaboration.

980
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:43,730
Ask Shen Xin

981
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,130
to prepare the contract.

982
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,400
I'll ask Ms. Zheng

983
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,090
to approve it,

984
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,660
and ask the Legal Department to hurry up, okay?

985
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,100
Please wait here.

986
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,830
I'll be right back.

987
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,700
Be careful. Gosh.

988
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,350
Be careful, kid.

989
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,370
Don't broke this.

990
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,710
This is expensive.

991
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,320
Stop it.

992
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,590
What's going on?

993
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,340
This kid from nowhere

994
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,750
insists on covering

995
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,620
all the perfume facilities.

996
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,850
He covered them them once I took the covers away,

997
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,180
and kept calling for mom.

998
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,440
I don't know what to do.

999
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,390
Young man, what are you doing?

1000
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,900
Mom.

1001
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,480
Don't call me that.

1002
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,910
Who are you?

1003
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,090
I'm Yu.

1004
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,570
If you're not my mom,

1005
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,380
why did you call me man?

1006
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,820
Let me tell you.

1007
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,810
I'm 28 years old.

1008
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,300
I don't want to be a mother.

1009
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,420
Where are your parents?

1010
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,500
Didn't anyone tell you

1011
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,060
not to touch other people's things?

1012
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,460
I used this at home. It stinks.

1013
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,500
So I helped you

1014
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,200
cover them all.

1015
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,350
Don't talk about this.

1016
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,150
Let me ask you.

1017
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,010
Which floor is your family on?

1018
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,690
I don't remember

1019
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,130
which floor he is on.

1020
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,910
Well, I have no choice.

1021
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,750
I see.

1022
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,700
No matter how old girls are,

1023
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,550
they want to be called sister.

1024
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,110
As a little kid,

1025
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,910
you know a lot.

1026
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,140
Do you remember which company

1027
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,020
your family is in?

1028
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,100
I'll send you to him.

1029
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,540
My dad is a big boss.

1030
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,950
He's in this building.

1031
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,780
But I don't remember

1032
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,180
which floor he is on.

1033
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,990
I'll wait at the door.

1034
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:06,680
Okay.

1035
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,290
Just wait here.

1036
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,550
Be good.

1037
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,920
Don't touch anything.

1038
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,130
Mr. Xie was very satisfied

1039
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,770
after watching our demo.

1040
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,159
The second installment is ready.

1041
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,550
With the money,

1042
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,380
our company will be successful.

1043
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,330
After that,

1044
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,030
I'm going to

1045
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,040
make it big and popular and make it a listed company.

1046
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,699
Wait.

1047
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,620
Why do I feel the tone

1048
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,590
is the same

1049
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,590
when you are

1050
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,820
making pie in the sky?

1051
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,580
It's not pie in the sky to be listed.

1052
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,659
It's a kind of...

1053
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,960
Dad.

1054
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,300
Since you're so curious about him.

1055
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,460
-You have to save me.
-Let me introduce for you.

1056
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,350
Dad.

1057
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,060
What a cute kid.

1058
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,150
He's so pretty.

1059
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,260
Is he your son?

1060
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:52,409
You're still young.

1061
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,460
But you already have a kid at such an age.

1062
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,260
You're amazing.

1063
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,760
Look at this. So cute.

1064
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,500
He looks exactly

1065
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,130
the same

1066
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:57,620
as you.

1067
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,140
He's really pretty.

1068
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,830
Xu Guangxi.

1069
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,940
This is...

1070
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,500
This is your son?

1071
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,940
Yiran.

1072
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,570
This is...

1073
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,050
This...

1074
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,270
Here's the thing.

1075
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,910
Well,

1076
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,780
your son is here to see you.

1077
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,020
I'll give you a half day off.

1078
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
Take your son to have fun,

1079
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,380
OK?

1080
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,200
Have fun with your dad.

1081
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,540
Come on. Come on.

1082
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,150
Thank you, boss.

1083
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,210
You're welcome.

1084
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:34,860
Well,

1085
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,190
I'll take my son to have ice cream.

1086
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,680
Hurry up.

1087
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,480
Young people have babies so early nowadays.

1088
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,020
I have a meeting.

1089
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,390
I went the wrong way.

1090
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,190
In a few days,

1091
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,180
the summer events

1092
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,060
in our game will start.

1093
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,900
You'd better send your eGift Cards

1094
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
to us earlier

1095
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,980
so that the technical department

1096
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,300
can launch them in the game as soon as possible.

1097
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,160
Okay, I'll arrange it right away.

1098
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,810
Mr. Ma.

1099
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,460
This is our fragrance set.

1100
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,800
Please keep it as a souvenir.

1101
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,540
Wish us a pleasant cooperation.

1102
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,450
Thank you.

1103
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,890
Happy cooperation.

1104
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,770
Happy cooperation, Mr. Ma.

1105
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,500
I look forward to your product.

1106
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,380
That's all for today.

1107
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,020
I'm leaving.

1108
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,350
Okay.

1109
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,100
See you next time.

1110
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,900
Okay, see you.

1111
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,630
Take care.

1112
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,270
This is the first time I've achieved a cooperation

1113
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,400
in such a short time.

1114
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,260
I can see your efforts.

1115
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,850
In such a short time,

1116
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,110
you have learned a lot.

1117
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,540
This is good. I'll remember it.

1118
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,740
I was right about you.

1119
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,860
Hello, Xiaomian.

1120
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,610
Yike.

1121
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,780
I need to talk to you. Come to the rooftop.

1122
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,640
What is it?

1123
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,570
Stop asking. Come up now.

1124
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:47,930
Okay.

1125
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,030
Tell me.

1126
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,070
What's wrong?

1127
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,090
What makes you must let me

1128
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,020
come up and talk?

1129
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,230
Hold on.

1130
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,310
I have to think about how to say it.

1131
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:04,860
Later,

1132
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,820
I have with Ms. Zheng.

1133
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,460
If you don't tell me,

1134
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,520
I'll go down first.

1135
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,770
Guangxi has a child.

1136
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,340
What?

1137
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,560
It's true.

1138
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,740
I saw it with my own eyes.

1139
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,050
He has a child.

1140
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,130
What child?

1141
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Just now,

1142
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,070
in the lobby,

1143
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,310
I saw the baby.

1144
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,310
He called Guangxi dad.

1145
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,860
Thank you, dad.

1146
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,020
Actually, Dad Chen...

1147
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,580
He

1148
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,380
has his reasons.

1149
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,600
I know. I'm five years old.

1150
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,640
I'm not a kid anymore.

1151
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,970
It's not what you think.

1152
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,070
Your dad takes care of you alone.

1153
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,360
It's hard and lonely.

1154
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,140
So he...

1155
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,070
So he's asking

1156
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,190
that fierce aunt

1157
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,310
to be my mom.

1158
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,940
No, she's not fierce.

1159
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,480
She just looks

1160
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,580
a bit rude.

1161
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,140
I know.

1162
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,580
That anut is good.

1163
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,420
You know that aunt

1164
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,220
quite well.

1165
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,200
I'm Chen's son.

1166
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,620
We like

1167
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,850
the same kind of aunt.

1168
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,850
Didn't you just call her sister

1169
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,150
in the lobby just now?

1170
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,140
You really don't know

1171
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,090
girls' secret.

1172
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,630
Chen is really

1173
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,060
worrying.

1174
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,670
So every time Dad Chen ran away

1175
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,190
to take you home?

1176
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,580
And do laundry, cook,

1177
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,940
teach me how to do homework, and

1178
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,740
find my socks and underwear.

1179
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,820
I don't want to know

1180
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,880
about the details.

1181
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,740
Eat more.

1182
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,270
Uncle,

1183
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,430
if Chen

1184
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,900
goes on a date with aunt,

1185
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,740
you'll be my godfather and take care me.

1186
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,910
I don't deserve it.

1187
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
But I'm capable

1188
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,190
to keep you full.

1189
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,270
Then it's a deal.

1190
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,020
OK.

1191
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,630
Deal.

1192
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,950
Just now,

1193
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,790
in the lobby,

1194
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,940
I saw the baby.

1195
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,850
He called Guangxi dad.

1196
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,100
He's already this tall.

1197
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
He's six years old.

1198
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,790
Guangxi responded

1199
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,220
and bought him ice cream.

1200
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,510
Thank you, Yin Yike.

1201
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,490
Double Seventh Festival is coming.

1202
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,420
Get ready to receive the surprise.

1203
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,220
Surprise?

1204
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,150
Will it be a scare?

1205
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,030

00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:51,360
♫It's like the coffee with full caramel milk foam♫

1222
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,550
♫The air has the fragrance of missing you♫

♫Come to me♫

1225
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,330
♫I want to be an umbrella for you♫

1226
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,780
♫To shield you from rain and wind♫

1227
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,930
♫You are my luck♫

1228
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,260
♫I'm like an ice-cream beneath the sun♫

1229
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,680
♫Melt my heart into love♫

1230
