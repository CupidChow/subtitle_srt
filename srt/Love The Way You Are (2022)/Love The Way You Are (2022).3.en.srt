Pork bone set, chicken meatballs.

They both look delicious.

Sir, two seafood set.

24
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:55,729

I have good news

29
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,700
to tell you.

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,090
I've been promoted to partner.

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,020
I just passed the probation period.

32
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,700
Good.

33
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,490
Isn't this what

34
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,750
you've always wanted?

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,690
Why? Aren't you happy for me?

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,980
No.

37
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,460
All right, don't be angry.

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,860
I didn't mean it.

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,660
Last night,

40
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,860
I stayed up all night.

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,540
The court is adjourned today.

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,940
So I went directly

43
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,010
to the airport.

44
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,590

affect your work?

Aren't you just promoted

48
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,750

49
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,410
So I can't

50
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,760
come back for no reason.

51
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,140
I asked for a case

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,260
from my colleagues in Shanghai

53
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,260
so that I can stay longer

54
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,090
in Shanghai

55
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,660
and keep you company.

56
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,260
Coming.

62
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,450

63
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,070
what would you do?

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,900
By the way,

65
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,290

66
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,470

67
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,300
will hold an opening for his new store

68
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,450

00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,950
tomorrow night.

72
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,130
Remember to dress up.

73
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,390
Don't dress like this.

74
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,980
I will introduce you officially

75
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,860
to everyone.

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,630
Got it.

77
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,140
Have you watched the new movie?

78
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,400
Yes, I think it's good.

79
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,050
There's a new one. Let's take a look.

Hello, what would you like?

82
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,850
A sandwich

83
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,260
and a cup of latte.

84
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,660
Can you make it two?

85
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,390
Don't you stay at work at 10?

86
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,710
It's flexible.

87
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,130
I can come anytime I want.

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,220
I've never seen

89
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,950
an artist who wakes up so early.

90
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,350
Are you praising me?

91
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,220
Whatever.

92
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,760
Hello, your meal is ready.

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,180
Let me pay.

94
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,490
Wait.

95
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,810
How can you treat me as a junior?

96
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,560
I'll treat you next time. Thanks.

97
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,050
Okay, let's go.

98
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,100
Did you have fun yesterday?

99
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,750
What?

100
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,610
Your boyfriend is back.

101
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,140
You should have been happy.

102
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,270
Did he say

103
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,230
that he is sorry?

104
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,310
You little brat.

105
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,000
Can you stop probing into

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,279
my private life?

107
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,020
Hello?

108
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,700
Miss Yin?

109
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,220
This is a gift from Mr. Li Zelin.

110
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,590
Please sign it.

111
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,180
Be careful.

112
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,620
Let's go.

113
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,710
Are you allergic?

114
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,950
A little. My nose is not feeling well.

115
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,860
Then give me the flowers.

116
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,370
Thank you.

117
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,270
You go upstairs.

118
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,300
Thank you.

119
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,070
Guangxi.

120
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,340
Why did you throw away

121
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,180
such fresh flowers?

122
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,120
What a pity.

123
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:44,960
You like it?

124
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,960
It's yours now.

125
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,680
I'll just throw it away.

126
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,480
Hey, Xudong.

127
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,300
Miss Yin.

128
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,640
Are you kidding me?

129
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,140
Why the gifts

130
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,940
are still printed with Li Li

131
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,820
on them?

132
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,860
That's impossible.

133
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,060
We've changed it all.

134
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,640
Are you mistaken?

135
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,920
Am I?

136
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,920
I am holding it.

137
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,860
Luckily, I checked

138
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,520
in advance.

139
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,400
Otherwise, I'd have been fired.

140
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,540
How many gifts?

141
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,940
Five, five hundred.

142
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,500
Okay, I'll take care of it.

143
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,530
Shen Xin.

144
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,409
Did you forget to send the modified leaflet

145
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,810
to the printing factory?

146
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,020
Impossible.

147
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,900
This is it. Look.

148
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,210
They're signed.

149
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,220
This one is not.

150
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,110
No wonder it's not changed.

151
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,040
Oh my god.

152
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,500
I've checked that the first few pages were signed.

153
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,020
I didn't

154
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,240
check them one by one.

155
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,040
This is not the time

156
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,200
to decide who to blame.

157
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,260
Go to the warehouse

158
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,820
and get some new gifts.

159
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,150
Okay.

160
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,940
Yike.

161
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,950
If you have something urgent

162
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,680
to be signed,

163
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
you should give it to me personally.

164
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,820
I have to sign so many signatures every day.

165
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,750
How do I know

166
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,430
which one should be signed first?

167
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,550
I told you last time

168
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,400
the urgent ones

169
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,820
have yellow labels on them.

170
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,500
And I specially put it

171
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,460
on the top.

172
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,220
Where are the labels?

173
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,420
I didn't see them.

174
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,100
What if the labels fall?

175
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,380
I'm not blaming you, but Yike.

176
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,910
You were taught by

177
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,340
Director Zheng herself.

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,700
Why are you

179
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,820
so careless?

180
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,930
You didn't see them.

181
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,990
It must be my fault.

182
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,540
Sorry, Mr. Kong.

183
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,909
Can you

184
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,060
please re-sign it?

185
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,420
Re-sign?

186
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,180
What do you mean?

187
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,770
Is this your responsibility

188
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,020
or mine?

189
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,140
Are you kidding?

190
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,980
You should solve

191
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,320
what you did wrong.

192
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,250
I can't help you.

193
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,750
I have something to do.

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,930
500 gifts.

195
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,020
You'll suffer.

196
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,650
Hey, Xudong.

197
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,490
Send the wrong gifts back to the headquarter.

198
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,180
Tomorrow morning,

199
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,510
I will send you new ones.

200
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,500
Yeah, don't worry about other things.

201
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,060
Bye.

202
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,740
Hello.

203
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:32,980
Mr. Zhang,

204
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,950
please help us with speeding up the production.

205
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,909
I'll pay first.

206
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,380
Just

207
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,740
give me a receipt later.

208
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,940
Yes, right now

209
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,570
we need to solve the problem.

210
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:41,690
Thank you.

211
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,610
Sure. Bye.

212
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,300
Yike, I'm sorry.

213
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,890
The problem has been solved.

214
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,060
Consider it a money-loss.

215
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,010
Be careful next time.

216
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,130
I will.

217
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,700
How about I stay here tonight?

218
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,860
Let's do it together.

219
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,580
Isn't today your mother's birthday?

220
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,180
It's okay.

221
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,670
You should accompany your mother.

222
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,670
I can do it myself.

223
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,700
Go ahead. It's okay.

224
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,020
Zelin.

225
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,060
Why can't I

226
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,460
get through all the time?

227
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,490
Are you busy?

228
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,840
I was dealing with something.

229
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,420
I've sent you the address.

230
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,210
7 p.m.

231
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,770
The boss of our Shanghai office

232
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,840
is coming tonight.

233
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,020
Set off early.

234
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,420
Don't get stuck in the traffic jam.

235
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,220
Otherwise you'll be late, okay?

236
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,860
Zelin, I...

237
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,340
What's wrong?

238
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,940
Something happened at my front store.

239
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,470
I have to finish it today.

240
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,570
I might not be able to make it tonight.

241
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,240
Yike.

242
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,260
What are you busy with

243
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,300
all day?

244
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,270
You don't make much money.

245
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,850
You don't have much time.

246
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,820
No, Zelin.

247
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,460
Forget it. How about this?

248
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,780
Go on with your work.

249
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,370
Come over when you're done.

250
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:03,830
Okay?

251
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,530
Got it.

252
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,620
Look at the background.

253
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,520
Babies,

254
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,150
I have to go.

255
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,410
You can go home

256
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,820
after you modify based on the customer's demands.

257
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,380
Okay? Bye.

258
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,450
Baba.

259
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,000
After you get off work,

260
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,330
will we get paid

261
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,730
for working overtime?

262
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,340
What are you talking about?

263
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,130
Do you think I'm going to have fun after work?

264
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,580
I'm going to meet a client.

265
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm going to meet the client

266
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,840
for your livelihood.

267
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,140
Keep it up! Keep it up!

268
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,060
Yes, baba!

269
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,850
Fight!

270
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,830
Mr. Zhang.

271
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,230
Me again.

272
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,860
Yes, so annoying.

273
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm sorry.

274
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,660
Please help me.

275
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,740
I know.

276
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,220
It must be hard for the cultural industry

277
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,450
to get approval this year.

278
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,250
But it's still

279
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,140
the KPI.

280
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,820
Right?

281
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,760
My goodness.

282
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,210
My goodness.

283
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,620
My goodness.

284
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,060
You...

285
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,700
Why are you driving so fast?

286
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,150
There's a speed limit in the basement garage.

287
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,270
Who will pay if it's damaged?

288
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,700
Really, the insurance fee will be...

289
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,980
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

290
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,530
Just go.

291
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,570
Thank you.

292
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,730
Look at this.

293
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,960
I was seamlessly connected again.

294
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,550
It's not suitable for you.

295
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,580
It's okay to break up.

296
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,220
To commemorate my dead love,

297
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,310
let's get drunk tonight.

298
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,980
Again?

299
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,250
You scared me.

300
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,860
Aren't you the lady

301
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,580
who hit my car that day?

302
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,530
What lady? She is my...

303
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,060
I'm his sister.

304
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,010
Guangxi.

305
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,580
Is she the unrelated sister

306
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,250
you've always told me about?

307
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,170
Yes.

308
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,500
Although we're not related by blood,

309
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,070
I am, as it were, his sister.

310
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,010
Hello, sister.

311
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,670
About your car...

312
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,940
It's not a big problem.

313
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,030
We're already friends.

314
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,580
I can solve

315
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,420
by myself.

316
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,620
Sister,

317
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,100
today is the second round

318
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,140
of our company's team building.

319
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,470
The newly opened Space.

320
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,560
Are you interested?

321
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,490
I can't play anymore.

322
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,220
You go ahead.

323
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,090
Are you having an appointment with your boyfriend?

324
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,850
What?

325
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:31,850
Something came up at work.

326
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,180
I have to work overtime.

327
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,960
I even stood up my boyfriend.

328
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,540
Sister, let's meet next time.

329
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,470
Okay, next time.

330
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,110
Okay.

331
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,940
By the way,

332
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,280
don't drink too much.

333
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,480
Or I'll tell Aunt Lan.

334
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,240
Watch him.

335
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:44,860
Goodbye, sister.

336
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,690
Bye. Bye.

337
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,230
Let us go.

338
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,500
Let's go.

339
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,060
Good.

340
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,380
You hid it so well.

341
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,520
Guangxi, let's go.

342
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,060
Everyone is here. Let's go.

343
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,560
Let's go.

344
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,190
I'm not going.

345
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,510
I've broken up.

346
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,300
If you don't accompany me,

347
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,450
you're not my friend.

348
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,260
It's not the first time you've broken up.

349
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,210
I'll make it up next time.

350
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,970
Bye.

351
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,700
Boring.

352
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,800

I'm not drunk. I'm very sober.

525
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,270
Didn't I tell you?

526
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,760
I told you to come after you finish your work.

527
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,560
Everyone was waiting for you.

528
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,370
I asked you to come here.

529
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,320
Originally,

530
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,300
I wanted to officially introduce you

531
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,580
to everyone.

532
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,080
But you?

533
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,300
You stood me up, you know?

534
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,270
Everyone was laughing at me.

535
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,690
I was so embarrassed.

536
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,330
Yike.

537
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,430
Everyone is saying that

538
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,700
Shanghai women have high standards.

539
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,070
They're hard to pursue.

540
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,300
But I've tried my best.

541
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,060
What else do you want me to do?

542
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,880
With my current strength,

543
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,300
I can raise you.

544
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,740
With my current status,

545
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,020
am I not good enough for you?

546
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,350
Am I not good enough for you?

547
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,180
Li Zelin,

548
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,920
don't say that.

549
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,940
Every time you said you want to raise me,

550
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,660
I feel like

551
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,780
a little animal.

552
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,450
You can come and go

553
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,600
as you wish.

554
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,630
Can we

555
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,020
talk about this?

556
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,180
Today, I...

557
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,360
Hello?

558
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,260
Zelin.

559
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,020
Guangxi.

560
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,480
Modify the painting again.

561
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,260
It's must be done because

562
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,000
it's due tomorrow.

563
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:28,730
Okay.

564
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,750
Western food? Sure. No problem.

565
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,180
As long as you like it.

566
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,690
Mr. Kong.

567
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,510
I'll call you later.

568
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,220
Director Zheng.

569
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,620
Why the gift billing

570
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,940
at Wang Xuddong's shop

571
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,900
hasn't been signed?

572
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
The gift billing?

573
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,820
I think

574
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,410
you should

575
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,300
ask

576
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,490
Miss Yin abou this.

577
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,270
I'm afraid it's her problem.

578
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,540
Mr. Kong, the whole Marketing Department

579
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,860
is busy with the advertisement

580
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,260
of the new spokesperson.

581
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,130
What's the point of doing this?

582
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,600
No, Director Zheng.

583
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,320
What do you mean?

584
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,050
While you were away,

585
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,900
any problem occurred

586
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,910
in the Marketing Department

587
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,400
was taken care of by me.

588
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,940
Now you're back.

589
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,820
Isn't it hurtful

590
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,180
to say that?

591
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,890
It's heartbreaking.

592
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,250
Fine.

593
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,900
I hope

594
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,420
some things could be turned over.

595
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,060
But

596
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,530
you should sign

597
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
the reimbursement form

598
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,470
for the additional printed leaflets by Miss Yin.

599
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,520
But this is

600
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,290
Miss Yin's responsibility.

601
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,870
I don't know

602
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,660
how you'll explain to Frank

603
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,320
the problems on bookkeeping.

604
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,730
Okay.

605
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,340
Since Director Zheng

606
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,560
came in person,

607
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,900
I can't say much.

608
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,440
[Fee List]

609
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,300
After all,

610
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,150
Miss Yin handled the thing well

611
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,340
in the end.

612
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,890
Alright.

613
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,370
Thank you.

614
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
How rude.

615
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,450
Ms. Zheng, this is...

616
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,940
Don't say anything.

617
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:25,980
No matter what, it shouldn't be

618
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,260
you who pay for it.

619
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,480
Ms. Zheng, I didn't want to

620
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,630
trouble you.

621
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,430
If you have any questions,

622
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,340
feel free to tell me.

623
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,740
Don't carry it yourself.

624
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,300
Thank you, Ms. Zheng.

625
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,510
By the way,

626
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,390
have you done

627
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,250
Chen Zicheng's marketing plan?

628
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,060
Yes.

629
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:42,930
I'll report to you later.

630
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,790
Okay, go ahead.

631
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,550
Okay.

632
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,900
It's done. I've finished my task.

633
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,740
Look carefully

634
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,290
what painting skill is.

635
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,660
Look at it.

636
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,740
Look carefully.

637
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,120
What is proportion?

638
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,540
Look carefully.

639
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,390
And you, look carefully.

640
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,500
What does it mean by fat but not greasy?

641
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,220
Xu Guangxi,

642
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,400
if you were kidnapped,

643
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,320
just blink.

644
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,980
I said I'll only help you this time.

645
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,540
So...

646
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,020
there will be no next time!

647
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,890
Work together next time?

648
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,580
OK. Come on.

649
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,640
Look carefully.

650
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,900
It should be like this.

651
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,330
Did you wait long?

652
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,610
No, I just came down.

653
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,210
What would you like to eat?

654
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,380
It doesn't matter

655
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,010
as long as it's from Yin Yike.

656
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,460
Kid, let's go.

657
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,450
Starbucks?

658
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,370
Again?

659
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,840
Then Yi Jia?

660
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,540
Yike.

661
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,670
Why are you here?

662
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,190
I came to pick you up.

663
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,250
I have good news for you.

664
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,050
I won the case.

665
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:07,910
Congratulations.

666
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,770
Let me tell you.

667
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,360
I did a great job

668
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,400
in this case.

669
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,780
So

670
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,940
I specially booked

671
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,170
your favorite restaurant

672
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:14,970
to celebrate.

673
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,790
But today,

674
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,100
I promised Guangxi to treat him a meal.

675
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,580
Why don't we go together? Is it convenient?

676
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,210
Sure, we're family.

677
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,900
It's not inconvenient.

678
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,030
Let's go.

679
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,390
Let's go.

680
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,700
Hello.

681
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,060
Who would like to order?

682
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,860
I'll do it.

683
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,430
Can I take a look at the menu?

684
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,980
This restaurant is really luxurious.

685
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,900
Order whatever you want.

686
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,610
Really?

687
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,310
What do you like to eat?

688
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:59,790
You pick first.

689
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,460
Then I'll

690
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,800
pick what I like.

691
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,990
Sea Urchin and Sweet Shrimp Hand Rolls.

692
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,940
And one Secret Matsusaka Pork.

693
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,110
Deep Sea Australian Prawn Sashimi

694
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,620
is good.

695
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,540
This one, too.

696
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,340
And one

697
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,370
Salmon Sashimi.

698
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,010
Snowflake Wagyu, please.

699
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,770
Can you eat that much?

700
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm growing.

701
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,790
Did I order too much?

702
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,010
It's okay. Help yourself.

703
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,820
Two portions of abalone, please.

704
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,350
Okay, please wait a moment.

705
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,870
I remember when you were young,

706
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,840
you liked Sour Soup Beef the most.

707
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,680
You wanted it,

708
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,170
but you use me as an excuse.

709
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,760
Yike. Tomorrow is weekend.

710
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,170
The client invited me to play golf.

711
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,230
Let's go together.

712
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,910
I've been really busy lately.

713
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,620
I don't have time

714
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,570
to relax.

715
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,190
But tomorrow is the Hundredth Day Banquet

716
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:50,940
for Lin Mengtian's baby.

717
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
I promised to go with my colleagues.

718
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,840
Is she your assistant

719
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,570
who married into a rich family?

720
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,980
That's good. You can take a look

721
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,760
and learn.

722
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,210
Sometimes,

723
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,640
choices are more important than hard work.

724
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,460
By the way,

725
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,280
did you have something to say to me

726
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,230
last night?

727
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,770
Nothing.

728
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,340
I was just about to ask if you were home.

729
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,990
I drank too much last night.

730
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,960
I've forgotten

731
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,620
what I said.

732
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,140
When I woke up this morning,

733
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,750
I've spoken to you on the phone

734
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,680
for half an hour.

735
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,260
I didn't say any extra things, did I?

736
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,290
It was my fault yesterday.

737
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,200
I promised you

738
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,330
but I didn't make it.

739
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,220
Yes, you should go.

740
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,700
Well,

741
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,380
is your hand better?

742
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,480
What happened to your hand?

743
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,070
Nothing.

744
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,410
I was scratched by a paper cutter.

745
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,140
It's okay.

746
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,600
She packed 500 gifts

747
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,920
with bare hands.

748
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,380
Fortunately, I saw and went to help out.

749
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,440
Otherwise, she had to work till dawn.

750
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,260
Guangxi.

751
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,560
Could you please

752
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,550
tell the waiter

753
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,929
to turn up the air conditioner

754
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:19,760
a little?

755
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,840
It's a little cold.

756
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:23,840
Eat.

757
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,639
Eat.

758
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,699
By the way,

759
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,570
get me a cup of

760
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,330
fresh orange juice. Thank you.

761
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,330
Actually,

762
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,400
I know what you want to say.

763
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,370
But these are not important.

764
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,530
What matters is

765
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,070
we're together now.

766
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,030
And we're very close.

767
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,929
Right?

768
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,350
Zelin, I...

769
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,610
Don't go back to work.

770
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,550
I mean

771
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,460
quit your job.

772
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,370
Go to Beijing with me.

773
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,770
Here's your juice.

774
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,500
Thank you.

775
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,320
Think about it.

776
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,110
Take your time.

777
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,110
Eat something.

778
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,490
I'm driving. Do you want a ride?

779
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,090
It's okay.

780
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,720
I'm just walking around

781
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,340
to digest.

782
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,600
Okay, let's go.

783
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,160
Be careful.

784
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,910
Not bad. It's so big.

785
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,470
Awesome.

786
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,340
How much is your gift money?

787
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,240
Yike said hers is 1,000 yuan.

788
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,960
800?

789
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,900
We can't compare with Yike.

790
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,860
That much?

791
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,980
Do you want to live?

792
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,170
How about 600 each?

793
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,580
Make it flat. Here.

794
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,020
I'll take the rest 200.

795
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,280
Wait.

796
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,700
Why did you cut my 200 yuan?

797
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,440
Alright, stop it.

798
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,300
Let's go. We're late.

799
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,860
It's hard for them to register.

800
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,220
Stop it. Let's go.

801
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,390
This is too exaggerated.

802
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,540
It's a Hundredth Day Banquet.

803
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,520
It can be lively.

804
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:32,540
Let's go.

805
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,110
Let's take a look.

806
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,890
Mengtian, we're here.

807
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,500
Mengtian, congratulations.

808
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,220
You're finally here.

809
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,880
I was worried about the traffic.

810
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,610
No.

811
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,900
Look at this big treasure.

812
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,500
This baby is so cute.

813
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,180
I envy you.

814
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,710
He look like his mom.

815
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,470
How about this?

816
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,620
We're colleagues anyway.

817
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,550
Help me

818
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,500
take care of them.

819
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:50,930
I'll take care of them for you.

820
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:51,640
Help yourself.

821
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,510
Later,

822
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,210
I will come chat with you.

823
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,770
Okay, you go ahead.

824
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,970
Thank you, Mengtian.

825
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,860
Yike, you're finally here.

826
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,460
Mengtian.

827
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,550
Congratulations.

828
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,720
Congratulations.

829
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,740
What happened to your hand?

830
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,940
Nothing. It was bumped.

831
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,080
Did you see the baby?

832
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,900
Yes.

833
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,980
I just saw the photo. So cute.

834
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,110
He's naughty.

835
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,330
He's chubby.

836
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,870
He's cute.

837
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,380
When will you

838
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,380
come back to work?

839
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,840
Ms. Zheng has asked about you several times.

840
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,610
She said that one member is missing

841
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,070
in our bomb disposal team.

842
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,030
The baby is small.

843
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,480
I can't leave him now.

844
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,010
You've been on maternity leave

845
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,170
for half a year.

846
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,670
Besides,

847
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,870
don't you have a nanny

848
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
and your husband?

849
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,710
Her father

850
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,810
needs to make money to support the family.

851
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,600
I have to take care of

852
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,610
the whole family.

853
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,380
Now the baby needs me desperately.

854
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,340
If he takes the baby from me,

855
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,340
I won't let him.

856
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,870
I understand.

857
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,940
My husband has always wanted me

858
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,410
to be a full-time housewife.

859
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,160
It makes sense.

860
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,400
My earnings

861
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,350
is nothing in our family.

862
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,880
I understand.

863
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,060
Yes, the baby is so cute.

864
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,090
Mom, let me introduce.

865
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,360
They are my colleagues.

866
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,850
-Hello. -Hello. Aunty.

867
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,930
Welcome to

868
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,150
my grandson's party.

869
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,200
Help yourselves.

870
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,970
Have fun.

871
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:57,670
Okay.

872
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,630
Tiantian, I'll check over there.

873
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,960
Take care of the guests.

874
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,420
I'll go first.

875
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,230
Go ahead.

876
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,780
Okay.

877
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,060
It's okay.

878
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,540
I'll find you later.

879
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:07,980
Okay.

880
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,090
She's so happy.

881
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,300
Look at the photo

882
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,040
of the three of them.

883
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,570
Yes.

884
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,220
And I've never seen

885
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,440
such a good kid.

886
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,340
So that is Mengtian's husband.

887
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,050
He's quite handsome.

888
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,080
What does her husband do?

889
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,050
What's wrong with you?

890
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,080
You're so clumsy.

891
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,180
You can't even feed her well.

892
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,640
Stop it.

893
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,210
Your hands slipped?

894
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,090
What if you fall my grandson

895
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,660
to the floor?

896
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,120
That's right.

897
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,100
I won't, Mom.

898
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,210
Are you kidding me?

899
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:28,980
All right.

900
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,840
Do not stand here.

901
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,410
You're causing trouble.

902
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,540
Go serve the guests.

903
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,940
Mengtian used to be so pretty.

904
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,330
So many people pursued her.

905
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,550
But look at her now.

906
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,940
She seems to have aged a lot.

907
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,270
And she has no light in her eyes.

908
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:48,940
Mengtian,

909
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,600
please help me check the wine.

910
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,700
I envy Mengtian.

911
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,420
It's useless to envy, you two.

912
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,190
Then you should hurry, Chacha.

913
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,760
Yike, we're leaving.

914
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,000
Bye, Yike. See you on Monday.

915
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,020
Bye bye.

916
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,540
See you on Monday. Bye.

917
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,160
I have an appointment.

918
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,340
I won't accompany you.

919
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,470
Who are you meeting?

920
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,950
You know.

921
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,140
I'm leaving.

922
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,570
Bye.

923
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,250
Bye.

924
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,270
Rourou, listen to me.

925
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,690
Rourou.

926
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,690
My baby.

927
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,650
Don't be angry.

928
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,420
Good girl.

929
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,030
She's so happy.

930
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,840
Look at the photo of the three of them.

931
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,480
Yes.

932
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,140
I promise you.

933
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,620
Next time.

934
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,410
Okay?

935
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,120
The car is here. Be good.

936
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,190
Call me when you arrive.

937
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,780
Okay?

938
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,520
Be careful.

939
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,780
Hello.

940
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,620
Yike, how is it?

941
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,280
Is it over?

942
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:47,980
Zelin.

943
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,630
I'm in front of Mengtian's house.

944
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,220
I saw her husband

945
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,860
hugging another woman.

946
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,340
Do you think

947
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,580
should I

948
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,480
tell Mengtian?

949
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:58,890
Yike.

950
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,930
Mind your own business.

951
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,500
But this is so irritating.

952
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,850
Men are all like this.

953
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,160
I mean,

954
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,580
this may be their family matter.

955
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,730
Maybe

956
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,640
there's an unspoken understanding between them.

957
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,150
Enough.

958
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,340
Don't worry about it.

959
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,690
OK?

960
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,220
It won't do you any good.

961
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,250
Where are you now?

962
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,180
I'll pick you up.

963
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,550
No, I'll go back myself.

I need to use the bathroom.

00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,180
Me too.

970
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,000
Your hands must be wet.

971
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,220
Thank you.

972
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,600
It's childish.
