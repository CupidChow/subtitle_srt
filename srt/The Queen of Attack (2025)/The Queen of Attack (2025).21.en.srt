1
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:10,400
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,324
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,000
I suddenly realize

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,840
that if you were pregnant
with Xiao Xian's child

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,120
and claimed it's Prince Rui's...

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,040
Your Highness,

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:20,896
you...

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,440
You're insane.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,840
Then why not just make
Xiao Xian the heir?

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,440
No!

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,480
On what grounds?

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,240
If he inherits the title,

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,920
his lowborn father

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,280
would move into the mansion.

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,880
He'd strut around looking down on me.

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,680
He doesn't deserve that.

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,280
Xiao Xian

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,040
will never inherit the throne.

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,120
As for you,

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,600
I have my own plans.

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,560
Perhaps you aren't fully aware

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
of the true identity of the monster

23
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,600
who bit you in the death cell.

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,120
To captivate a man,

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,720
you should use the left one.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,200
Master,

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,960
why are you here?

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,800
You're my disciple.

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,520
I didn't teach you properly

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,080
about these incenses.

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,080
Aphrodisiac incenses.

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,960
I never thought we'd use them.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,800
But since you need it,

34
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,560
learn thoroughly.

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,120
There's no need.

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,000
This one suits you best.

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,120
It truly kindles desire

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,760
by awakening buried feelings.

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,200
If you feel nothing,

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,760
it remains powerless.

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,400
But if feelings exist,

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,800
you'll lose self-control.

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,400
Master,

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,920
why are you lighting it?

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,040
We've always been open with each other.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,160
Why afraid?

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
What are you afraid of?

48
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,240
You.

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,400
Master.

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,200
Linlang.

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,120
Do you truly know yourself?

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Let's use this incense
to reveal your true heart.

53
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,520
He's here.

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,400
Who is there?

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
I'm sleeping.

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,280
Why are you here?

57
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,040
Your Highness.

58
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,320
From now on,

59
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,560
I'll be your Mother Consort.

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,840
Mother Consort?

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,720
Why did you come suddenly?

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,760
I heard the County Princess
gave you trouble today.

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,480
She lured you here?

64
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,720
Why would she do that?

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,400
She wants...

66
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,360
Wants what?

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,800
Never mind.

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,200
You should leave.

69
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
I know exactly
what the County Princess intends.

70
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,040
She's hated my father since young.

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,560
Their feud has lasted a lifetime.

72
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,680
Even with the vilest methods,

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,760
she'll never let me inherit the title.

74
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
She even wants us to...

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,320
Shut your mouth.

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,040
The incense.

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,880
Don't move.

78
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,360
I won't do anything to you.

79
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,480
Remember.

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,240
Whatever threats she makes,

81
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,320
don't yield.

82
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,880
Don't act recklessly.

83
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,480
I've already owed you too much.

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,000
From now on,

85
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,320
leave it to me.

86
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,480
Absolutely not.

87
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,640
You said it yourself.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,680
She ordered me to come tonight,

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,000
so there must be guard outside.

90
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
If I stay here overnight,

91
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,960
you can report success.

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,440
If she threatens you again,

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,840
you'll have a proper excuse.

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,040
Watch out!

95
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,760
What are you...

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,720
I can't stay awake all night,

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,760
right?

98
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,040
Move.

99
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,240
S-So you're not worried about me?

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
I have bigger concerns.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,680
What's wrong?

102
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,640
Go extinguish the candles.

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,440
Okay.

104
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,080
What's wrong?

105
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,080
Last night, you lit incense.

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,880
But you showed no feelings toward him.

107
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,040
Do you understand

108
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,280
your heart now?

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,160
And what about your heart,

110
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,760
Master?

111
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,120
You've always stayed by my side,
protecting me.

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,480
Master.

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,240
Master.

114
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,040
Do you want me?

115
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,920
What's wrong?

116
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,840
You know what I desire most.

117
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,320
All my enemies have received
their due punishments.

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,480
But what about me?

119
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Why can't I just be Lin Hong'er?

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,360
Why must I never be Lin Hong'er again?

121
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Because you refuse to testify for me.

122
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,640
Because of your secrets from the past,

123
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,240
you can't let anyone know
you can cure Gu poison.

124
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,280
Because

125
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,920
you were the first one poisoned.

126
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,640
Your face changed.

127
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,280
You can't let anyone discover

128
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,840
that the old version of you still lives.

129
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,720
You investigated me?

130
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,320
Master,

131
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,360
I'm someone who returned from death.

132
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,760
I've long abandoned hope
for love or affection.

133
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,080
Gratitude and loyalty must stay buried
in my heart for now.

134
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
Because I have
greater unfinished business.

135
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,840
You taught me so much.

136
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,520
I've schemed and strategized
every step of the way.

137
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,040
How could I let
the County Princess threaten me?

138
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,920
I can agree to your terms,

139
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,520
but I have my own conditions.

140
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,160
Conditions?

141
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,280
Your Highness,

142
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,880
you weren't surprised at all
by my changed appearance.

143
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,280
Nor were you shocked
by the existence of that monster.

144
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,440
Because you already knew.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,920
You knew his grotesque form
was due to Gu poison,

146
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,000
rotting his flesh
into that monstrous shape.

147
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,720
And you also knew

148
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,280
that curing this poison

149
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,440
would permanently
alter one's appearance.

150
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,840
So, Your Highness,

151
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,240
you can verify

152
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,640
and confirm my identity.

153
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,040
I do know about Gu poison,

154
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,160
and I can help prove

155
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,520
that this poison
drastically alters one's looks.

156
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
I can even restore

157
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,320
your original face.

158
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,400
But first, I must meet the one
who cured you.

159
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,240
I swapped the incense.

160
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,640
It drains internal energy.

161
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,440
Master, you refuse to testify for me.

162
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
Yet in this world,

163
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,560
you're the only one
who can prove my innocence.

164
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,400
This matters to me more than anything.

165
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
The injustice Lin Hong'er suffered...

166
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,760
I'll clear it myself as Lin Hong'er.

167
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,040
Master,

168
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,520
as you said,

169
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,160
this game

170
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,800
will only grow more thrilling.

171
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Can you truly change my face back?

172
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Rest assured.

173
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,720
Shentu Yu suppressed the poison for you,

174
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,920
but he can't cure it.

175
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,200
Only I possess the antidote,

176
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,160
because this poison

177
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,400
was brewed by me.

178
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,880
This needle will block his Qi and blood,

179
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,240
slow his reflexes,

180
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,640
and cloud his mind.

181
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,400
That way,

182
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,880
extracting answers from him
will be easier.

183
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,560
Truly, a master's excellence
shapes the disciple.

184
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
The problem with him

185
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,920
is that he's too clever.

186
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,640
If he were a bit duller,

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,600
things would go much smoother.

188
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,720
Now,

189
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,000
it's time to restore my face.

190
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,880
Are you sure?

191
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,760
The process

192
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,840
is excruciating.

193
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,560
You're back.

194
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,720
Father?

195
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,880
Mother?

196
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Linlang?

197
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,240
Master,

198
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,320
the County Princess restored my face.

199
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,080
Lin Hong'er?

200
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,680
Do you still recognize me?

201
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,560
Master.

202
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,400
Master.

203
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,640
Master.

204
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,320
- Master.
- Hong'er.

205
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,480
Hong'er.

206
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,080
Hong'er.

207
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
Master.

208
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,200
It's okay.

209
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,040
It's okay.

210
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,360
Who are you?

211
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:11,600
I...

212
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,600
I am Shentu Yu.

213
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,000
Don't lie to me.

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,280
I know your heart.

215
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
You love me.

216
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,520
You've always loved me.

217
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,080
Just tell me the truth,

218
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,200
and we can be together.

219
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,320
I...

220
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,800
I am the former Crown Prince.

222
00:14:01,203 --> 00:14:06,864
