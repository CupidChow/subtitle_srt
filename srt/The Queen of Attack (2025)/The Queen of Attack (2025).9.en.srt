00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,432
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:13,332
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,680
Your Highness.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
Come up.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,400
Lady Hong,

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,920
Concubine Dou just said

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,200
this menstrual cloth belongs to you.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,920
This is ridiculous!

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,280
You are pregnant.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,360
How could you possibly
have your monthly courses?

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,480
Unless...

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,520
You were never pregnant at all?

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,360
Have you been deliberately deceiving us?

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,000
How can you press charges against me

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,800
based solely on your own testimony?

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,280
Move! Now!

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,200
Who's the culprit?

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,200
The maid from Lady Hong's chamber.

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,880
Your Highness,

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,760
Lady Hong told me

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
to dispose of the menstrual cloth.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,080
She instructed me
to seek Concubine Dou's help.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
I know nothing.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
She made me do it.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,560
Your Highness.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,080
Arrest her.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,656
- Yes.
- Yes.

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:33,984
You...

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
Your Highness.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,360
Your Highness.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,720
Your Highness.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,760
Their target isn't me.

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,200
Lady Xu, you seem surprised.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
This menstrual cloth

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,920
does belong to me.

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,680
However, it's part
of my hometown custom.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,800
When a woman becomes pregnant,

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,200
putting the menstrual cloth in the bed

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,120
ensures the baby's safety.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,040
When I discovered it missing,

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
I feared those unaware of our tradition

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,920
might jump to wrong conclusions.

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
So I informed the County Princess.

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
Her Highness wisely

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,000
advised me to keep silent.

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,360
If conspirators exist
within these walls,

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
they'd exploit this situation.

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,280
One betraying her master,

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,440
and another consumed by greed.

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,240
Ziyi.

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,520
Your Highness.

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,040
Logically speaking,

53
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,720
you'd benefit most
from framing Hong Linlang.

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,560
I didn't want to suspect you,

55
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,080
but your aggression tonight

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
forces me to reconsider.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,400
Your Highness,

58
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,480
I...

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,560
I never intended harm.

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
It was all those villains.

61
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
Their lies deceived me.

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,368
I...

63
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
I just...

64
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,360
I just acted hastily out of concern.

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,600
A mere maid

66
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,600
framed her master without cause?

67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,800
It doesn't make sense.

68
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,080
She must be interrogated properly.

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Your Highness, they targeted me.

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
Can I conduct the interrogation?

71
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,480
Your Highness, rest assured.

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,520
I'll condemn no innocents,

73
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,960
nor let the true mastermind

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,680
escape justice.

75
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,440
Agreed.

76
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,960
Look.

77
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,600
What's this?

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,680
Who's inside?

79
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,000
He was a girl's elder brother.

80
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,880
His parents died.
He and his sister relied on each other.

81
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,280
Qi!

82
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,960
You lied.

83
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,440
You killed him!

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,680
I didn't lie.

85
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,360
He indeed had a sister.

86
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,680
She's only eight years old.

87
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,480
Your brother murdered him!

88
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,040
Countless others met similar fates.

89
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,160
Your brother was evil incarnate.

90
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
He deserved death!

91
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,600
But you've done nothing wrong.

92
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,200
He's unworthy of your vengeance.

93
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,640
Don't risk your life

94
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,960
for his sake!

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,520
Those who asked you to hurt me

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,200
will blame everything on you.

97
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
You'll take sole responsibility.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
No one values your life

99
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,320
except yourself.

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,520
I know you're here.

101
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,640
Haven't you always been?

102
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,560
You show no gratitude for being saved.

103
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,480
How dare I not appreciate your kindness?

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm just following
Master's instructions.

105
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,600
Does this look like
following Master's orders?

106
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,040
Do you remember what I told you

107
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,160
before you left the mountain?

108
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,720
(Linlang,)

109
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,640
value your own life.

110
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,920
Just now, you made no attempt
to dodge the blade.

111
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,520
Rest assured, Master.

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,000
I won't die before my enemies do.

113
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,000
Getting her to identify Xu Ziyi

114
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,240
might prove difficult.

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,520
This approach

116
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,200
is mainly to make those
who trust Xu Ziyi

117
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,440
question her credibility.

118
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,240
Now that the County Princess doubts her,

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,480
the next step

120
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,320
is to make Xiao Xian
see her true nature.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,960
Your expression shouldn't be like this
when mentioning him.

122
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
It's strange.

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
We've been here this long,

124
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,800
yet haven't seen any patrolling guards
from the mansion.

125
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,760
I know their patrol routes

126
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,360
better than anyone.

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,240
How come you're so familiar
with the mansion?

128
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,400
It's been so very long

129
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,560
since I last felt this relaxed.

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,680
You always think one step ahead.

131
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,480
Your presence here tonight

132
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
is for this, isn't it?

133
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,320
I'm helping you.

134
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,280
He's your only weakness.

135
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,280
Give up any false hopes about him.

136
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
Your Highness.

137
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,080
Don't worry.

138
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,160
I won't speak of what I saw earlier.

139
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,360
- As long as you...
- That's not why I'm here.

140
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,600
As long as I carry Prince Rui's child,

141
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,480
no one in this household

142
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,240
will care about

143
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,640
my background or moral character.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,960
What are you saying?

145
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,840
You serve in the imperial court.

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,160
There's a matter
only you can assist me with.

147
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,240
Say it.

148
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,520
My maid Yueya framed me
for unknown reasons.

149
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,920
I discovered her brother
went missing recently.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,640
She claims enemies harmed him,

151
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,880
and wants to report it.

152
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,840
I suspect something's amiss.

153
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080
But I lack connections with officials.

154
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,440
Could you inquire about this?

155
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,960
Enemies?

156
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
What caused the feud?

157
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,240
Yueya said her brother
was the Registrar of Lai County.

158
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,560
He offended many people.

159
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Perhaps related to past cases.

160
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,880
Lai County?

161
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Yueya mentioned her brother
handled a major case

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,040
several months ago.

163
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,160
A farming couple in Lai County

164
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
were murdered by their own daughter.

165
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,600
This bizarre case

166
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,160
even reached my ears.

167
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,680
A delicate woman

168
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,800
killing her own parents overnight?

169
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
Truly horrifying.

170
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
Let me out!

171
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,360
I'm innocent!

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
I'm... I'm...

173
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,120
- I'm innocent!
- I'm here to deliver food.

174
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,520
What should I do?

175
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Feicui?

176
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,440
Feicui,

177
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,520
- you're finally here!
- Madam.

178
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,240
They mean to lock me up forever.

179
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,488
What should l do?

180
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,800
What should I do?

181
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,920
Don't panic yet.

182
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,400
I found a secret

183
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,360
that might save you.

184
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,280
I just saw...

185
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,680
Really?

186
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,560
Though not clearly,

187
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,160
men and women should stay proper.

188
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
At this late hour...

189
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,040
Men and women together

190
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,480
bring easy suspicion.

191
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,320
Especially between young people.

192
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,440
Prince Xian is practically

194
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,920
is his woman.

I need to find a way

197
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,400
to bring them closer.
