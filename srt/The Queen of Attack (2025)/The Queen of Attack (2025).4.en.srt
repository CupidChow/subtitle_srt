00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:10,385
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,309
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,520
(Look familiar?)

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,160
Who are you?

5
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,720
(Don't you remember?)

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,680
(I'm Lin Hong'er, the one you killed.)

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,480
Impossible.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,600
Lin Hong'er is already dead.

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,040
Stop these supernatural tricks!

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,360
(Is that so?)

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,920
It wasn't me.

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,840
It really wasn't me.

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,200
The altering incense
can cloud one's judgment,

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,720
inducing constant hallucinations.

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,440
Qi.

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,200
Lin Hong'er!

17
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,160
You killed me!

18
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:46,840
I didn't.

19
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,640
Why did you harm me?

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,400
I didn't harm you.

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,240
I didn't harm you.

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,560
I'm here to claim your life.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,240
I didn't.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,440
It wasn't me.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Qi.

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Qi.

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,760
Why?

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,720
Didn't you love me?

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,080
Didn't you love me?

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,080
Why did you harm me?

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,520
I didn't harm you.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,880
I truly didn't harm you.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,080
I truly didn't harm you.

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
I truly didn't harm you.

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,040
It wasn't me.

36
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
It really wasn't me.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,200
I didn't harm you.

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,960
Linlang, where are you?

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,720
We're here to help capture your enemy.

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,680
Qi,

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
they're coming for you.

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,720
Quick, run!

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,840
Who are you?

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,360
I'm the Magistrate.

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,440
Look.

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,720
It's the dead Lin Hong'er.

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,640
She brings demons to capture you.

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,640
What should I do?

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,560
What should I do?

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,320
I'll lure them away.

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,240
You sneak out and cover her mouth.

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,320
Take her away.

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,680
Hurry!

54
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,000
Lady Hong.

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,000
Lady Hong?

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,840
Lady Hong,

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,000
I brought people to help you.

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,920
Search.

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,680
Search over there.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,480
Understood.

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,240
Let me go!

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,120
Let me go!

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
Let me go!

65
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,960
What are you doing?

66
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,880
Lin Hong'er?

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,080
You're Lin Hong'er?

68
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,360
Sun Qi?

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,480
Why are you here?

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,840
Call me Qi.

71
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,920
You fool!

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,520
Think you're the Princess Consort?

73
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,400
Let me go!

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
Snap out of it!

75
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm Xu Ziyi.

76
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
You're Lin Hong'er.

77
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,200
The dead Lin Hong'er, right?

78
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
You are the dead Lin Hong'er.

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,720
You're the deceased Lin Hong'er!

80
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,600
- You're...
- Lin Hong'er is already dead!

81
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm Xu Ziyi.

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,080
You jinx.

83
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:06,560
Princess Consort?

84
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,320
I understand now.

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,880
I'm just a disposable pawn to you.

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,680
Since you want me dead,

87
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,800
why drag Lin Hong'er into this?

88
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,120
Oh, really?

89
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,040
Just your slander
against the Princess Consort

90
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
is enough for your execution.

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,720
What are you doing?

92
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,920
That look again.

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
That same disgusted look!

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,600
Beg me.

95
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,520
Beg me now.

96
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,080
Beg me.

97
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,720
Hurry!

98
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,400
Beg me.

99
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Beg me.

100
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,160
I beg...

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,880
I beg...

102
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,480
Right.

103
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,280
I beg...

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,800
Beg me.

105
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,240
Beg me now! Beg me!

106
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,120
I beg you.

107
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,040
I beg...

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,520
Qi...

109
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,800
Yes, yes.

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,760
- Please, Qi.
- Yes!

111
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,160
Please, Qi.

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,320
Say it.

113
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,400
Say it.

114
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,520
You're Xu Ziyi, the wealthy lady.

115
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,080
You're Xu Ziyi, the wealthy lady,

116
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,320
who's nobler than Lin Hong'er.

117
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,280
Say it.

118
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,080
Say it.

119
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,920
You say it.

120
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,560
You say it.

121
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,760
I am Xu Ziyi.

122
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm Xu Ziyi,

123
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,160
Right.

124
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,760
- the wealthy lady,
- Right.

125
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,600
who's nobler than Lin Hong'er.

126
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,440
Qi.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,800
Go on threatening me.

128
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,120
Qi.

129
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,760
Qi.

130
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,720
My lady.

131
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,800
My lady.

132
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,040
My lady.

133
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,160
Useless idiots!

134
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,960
Do you realize I almost died just now?

135
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,160
My lady, didn't you
order us to search...

136
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,720
Speak.

137
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,920
What did you find?

138
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,440
My lady, we found someone.

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,680
He wants to see you.

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
What?

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,560
Your Highness,

142
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
she's over here.

143
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,240
Over there.

144
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,720
Let's go.

145
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,000
Your Highness.

146
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,120
Hurry up, all of you!

147
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,800
Stop it.

148
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,480
Lady Xu,

149
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,600
what a coincidence.

150
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,840
Your Highness?

151
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,480
Concubine Dou?

152
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
Such a coincidence.

153
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,160
I was returning to the mansion.

154
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,800
Who's in the carriage?

155
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Get in and drag that adulterer down.

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,200
Nobody move!

157
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
What's happening here?

158
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,080
Stay calm, Lady Xu.

159
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
You ride in a carriage
with a man at night.

160
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,200
We're worried about your safety.

161
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,456
- Step down!
- I'll walk myself.

162
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,600
Who's in the carriage?

163
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
(It's him.)

164
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,480
Secretly meeting a man at night.

165
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,920
Lady Xu,

166
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,600
how can you be so careless

167
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,080
about your reputation?

168
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,360
Concubine Dou,

169
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
I believe you've misunderstood.

170
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,040
Your Highness,

171
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,760
this is my uncle.

172
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,800
Your Highness,

173
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,080
Ziyi's been in the capital for days,

174
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
causing you much trouble.

175
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,880
You are welcome.

176
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Lady Xu is Xiao Xian's guest,

177
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,560
thus an honored guest of the mansion.

178
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,600
My lord.

179
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,800
Uncle?

180
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,960
Qing.

181
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,160
Aunt.

182
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,200
Uncle.

183
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,000
I-I'm innocent!

184
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,720
Save me! Save me!

185
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,000
My lord.

186
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,600
Uncle.

187
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,120
I've finished my testimony.

188
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,640
I...

189
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
I will take my leave now.

190
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Uncle.

191
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,640
Uncle.

192
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
Then Lady Xu,

193
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,920
once you've finished
catching up with your uncle,

194
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,280
please return home early.

195
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,560
Yes.

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,640
Thank you for your concern.

197
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,880
(Why is my uncle here?)

198
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
Long time no see,

199
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,480
Uncle Luo.

200
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,720
Won't you explain

201
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,800
why you are here?

202
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,440
I thought after that incident,

203
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,680
we'd cut ties

204
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,600
- and leave each other alone.
- Leave each other alone?

205
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,000
If you knew this,

206
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,400
why follow me here

207
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,880
in the dead of night?

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,720
No, no!

209
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,000
I wasn't following you.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,480
I was...

211
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,400
What's that?

212
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,680
Actually,

213
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,680
I trailed Sun Qi, the Registrar, here.

214
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,640
I don't see you around much anyway.

215
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,760
I heard he came to the capital for you.

216
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,720
I didn't get it.

217
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,920
Why could he approach Your Highness?

218
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,880
Must be scheming for benefits.

219
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,360
So I thought

220
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,440
since I was already involved in...

221
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,680
Sun's dead...

222
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,760
You witnessed it...

223
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Past events

224
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,160
should stay buried.

225
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,160
Yes, of course.

226
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,880
He stumbled into his own demise.

227
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,920
But you're different.

228
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,920
We're family.

229
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,120
Serve me faithfully,

230
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,800
and the mansion's wealth

231
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,560
will flow to your household somehow.

232
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,160
Yes, yes! We're family.

233
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,800
Family.

234
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,400
I'll serve you wholeheartedly.

235
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Uncle,

236
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,560
Sun Qi's corpse lies right here.

237
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:59,057
♪Fate begins and ends, I sip the past♪

238
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:04,718
♪Love and hatred flow endlessly♪

239
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:13,265
♪When spring comes, I see the truth♪

240
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:19,364
♪We've changed through the years♪

241
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:26,033
♪Cold lamps reflect pear blossom dew♪

242
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:33,713
♪Worlds change as streams run west♪

243
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:40,739
♪Rains veil hills, gathering sorrows♪

244
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:46,897
♪In deep courtyards, hands drift apart♪
