00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:10,406
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:13,330
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,040
I'm from the Luo family.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,280
I risk death to present this petition

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,120
and seek justice.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,080
Please uphold righteousness for me.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,600
The tyrannical magnate Xu Zhili,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
wields influences

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,240
and commits atrocities.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,760
He has colluded
with the Magistrate He Laijin,

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,200
and the Registrar Sun Qi,

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
in their vile schemes.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,760
They bribed murderers

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,880
to kill the parents
of the innocent Lin Hong'er.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,960
Their methods were appallingly cruel,

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,320
beyond all human decency.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,240
These villains then grew bolder,

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,280
framing Lin Hong'er

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
to brand her as her parents' killer.

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Worse still,

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,440
they swapped her identity,

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,280
replaced Lin Hong'er,

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
and forced her to marry into the mansion

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,720
to conceal their crimes

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,920
and deceive everyone.

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,480
Such wicked deeds

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,960
are unforgivable by the heavens.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,720
Their sins are countless.

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,240
I beg the authorities
to punish these evildoers,

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
clear Lin Hong'er's name,

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,320
and restore justice to the people.

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,000
Clear Lin Hong'er's name!

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
A toast with tea.

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,120
Thank you for your wise counsel.

35
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:28,840
My lord,

36
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,952
are you okay?

37
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,600
Stop!

38
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,840
Without Magistrate's order,
no one moves.

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,800
You,

40
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,760
continue.

41
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,000
The tyrant Xu Zhili

42
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,080
colluded with Magistrate He Laijin

43
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,000
and Registrar Sun Qi,

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,840
hired killers,

45
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,560
and framed Lin Hong'er.

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,840
Their sins towering to the heavens!

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,120
My lord, please overturn

48
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,440
Lin Hong'er's conviction!

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,520
Lin Hong'er is innocent!

50
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,560
She's innocent!

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,000
Her parents died wronged!

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,440
Yes!

53
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,880
Lin Hong'er is innocent!

54
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,880
Seek justice for the Lin family!

55
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,184
Expose the corrupt!

56
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:02,280
Clear Lin Hong'er's name!

57
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
- Expose the corrupt official!
- Silence!

58
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,240
Expose the corrupt!

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,880
Silence!

60
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,640
This lunatic slanders the Magistrate.

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,480
Drag her away.

62
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,280
Silence!

63
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,000
As the Registrar, I exercise oversight.

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,280
Magistrate He Laijin
is implicated in murder.

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,840
Guards!

66
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,720
Arrest him.

67
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,440
Understood.

68
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,760
How dare you?

69
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,080
Assist me in apprehending
the prime suspect Xu Zhili.

70
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,360
Understood!

71
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,280
Well done!

72
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,360
- That's right!
- Well done!

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,960
Well done.

74
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,360
The Registrar is honorable.

75
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,120
Indeed!

76
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,320
Hong Linlang,

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,560
you orchestrated everything
in Lai County.

78
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,800
What about Lin Hong'er?

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,040
Aren't you Lin Hong'er?

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I am Lin Hong'er?

81
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,400
I am not.

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,080
What are you trying to do?

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
You are Lin Hong'er.

84
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,120
The world believes it to be so.

85
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,040
Thus, you shall remain.

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,080
You stole everything from Lin Hong'er.

87
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,120
Now,

88
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,240
you'll reclaim it all in her name.

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm not Lin Hong'er.

90
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,400
What exactly do you want?

91
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I want you

92
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,240
to clear her name

93
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,320
as Lin Hong'er.

94
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,320
Might...

95
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,880
Power...

96
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,560
Xu Zhili,

97
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
do you confess?

98
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,160
Vile slanders from spiteful worms.

99
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,640
Why should I confess?

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
For six months, I've received

101
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,720
petitions accusing you
of colluding with He Laijin

102
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
to bully the villagers.

103
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,880
Particularly the case of Lin Hong'er.

104
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,520
With both witnesses and evidence,

105
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,720
confess immediately!

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,200
Guards!

107
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,480
Bring her in.

108
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,280
Kneel.

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,920
Let me ask you.

110
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,760
Do you recognize her?

111
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,520
Ziyi?

112
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,360
Good.

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,840
So you confirm

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,720
she's your daughter Xu Ziyi

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,920
but not Lin Hong'er,

116
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,480
right?

117
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,760
W-What nonsense are you spouting?

118
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,480
He Laijin's crimes have been verified.

119
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,680
When Xiao Xian
used this portrait to search,

120
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,640
He Laijin knew immediately

121
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,920
that she's Lin Hong'er,
daughter of local farmers.

122
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,800
Since your daughter Xu Ziyi

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,280
closely resembled her in appearance,

124
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,520
you conceived evil intentions.

125
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,280
You hired assassins,

126
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,080
colluded with He Laijin,

127
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,880
made him frame Lin Hong'er
for patricide,

128
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,680
and deceived Xiao Xian

129
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,200
into believing the portrait
depicted Xu Ziyi.

130
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,800
He has...

131
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,840
Given these facts,

132
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,880
you two,

133
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,840
confess your crimes at once!

134
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,800
Wait!

135
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,080
You were captured because villagers

136
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,600
mistook you for Lin Hong'er,

137
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,360
right?

138
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Thus,

139
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,040
only those closest to you

140
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
could tell you apart.

141
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,440
Lin Hong'er's parents are dead.

142
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,640
Your family will also die very soon.

143
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,200
Be a proper Princess Consort.

144
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,160
She's an impostor!

145
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
She's not my daughter!

146
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,200
She's Lin Hong'er!

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,080
Lin Hong'er,

148
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,480
stop lying to me!

149
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,160
Xu Zhili!

150
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,480
You and your daughter
won't escape harsh punishment!

151
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,840
She is Lin Hong'er!

152
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,880
She's Lin Hong'er!

153
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,840
I'll kill you!

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,360
Lin Hong'er...

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,760
Remember this. You are

156
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
Lin Hong'er...

157
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,480
Regarding the charge

158
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,080
against Xu Ziyi for hiring assassins,

159
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,480
as a lack of evidence,

160
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
release her now.

161
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:19,070
(Xu Residence)

162
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,920
What's happening?

163
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,920
I'll go check.

164
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
Your Highness, official seals.

165
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,800
My father is gone.

166
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,280
My father is gone.

167
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,840
My father is gone.

168
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,080
My father...

169
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,960
What happened, Ziyi?

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,080
Ziyi?

171
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,400
I'm not Ziyi.

172
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm not Ziyi.

173
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm not Ziyi.

174
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,960
I'm not Xu Ziyi!

175
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,840
I am Lin Hong'er.

176
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,680
I am

177
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,280
Lin Hong'er.

178
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,640
Ziyi,

179
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,680
what happened to you?

180
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm getting married.

181
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,160
I am the Princess Consort now!

182
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
I am the Princess Consort now.

183
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,480
I am the Princess Consort now.

184
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,600
How dare you seal it!

185
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,120
How dare you seal it!

186
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,040
Ziyi, you're sick.

187
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,600
Let's go back.

188
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,960
Father.

189
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,600
Mother.

190
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,240
Good.

191
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,160
We've waited for this day for so long.

192
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,200
You're finally home.

193
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,240
Your Highnesses,

194
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
please.

195
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,480
I am Lin Hong'er.

196
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
I am Lin Hong'er.

197
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,480
I am Lin Hong'er.

198
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,400
I am the Princess Consort.

199
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,320
I am Lin Hong'er.

200
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,400
What's the matter?

201
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,152
Someone's blocking the carriage.

202
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,760
I am not Lin Hong'er.

203
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,080
I am not Lin Hong'er.

204
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,080
What is it?

205
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,640
Your Highness, you and Lady Xu
are getting married.

206
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,800
I'm here to deliver wedding gifts.

207
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,560
Wedding gifts?

208
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm accepting a gift.

209
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,560
Today is truly a joyous occasion.

210
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,840
The wrongfully dead spirits

211
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,320
have finally witnessed justice.

212
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,440
The murderous villains

213
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,680
have proven the innocents' purity
with their blood.

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Heaven's justice prevails.

215
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,720
Don't come closer.

216
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,760
Stay back!

217
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,040
May the guilty be punished.

218
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,080
May the departed

219
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,400
rest in peace.

220
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,640
It's over.

221
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,120
Let's go home.

222
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,000
Go home.

223
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,080
Go home.

224
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,720
Come.

225
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,000
Xu Ziyi,

226
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,040
our scores aren't settled yet.

227
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,920
Your Highness,

228
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,680
this concludes the case details.

229
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
Further investigation is needed.

230
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,200
The only remaining doubt

231
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,880
is this woman's true identity.

232
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,680
Is she Xu Ziyi or Lin Hong'er?

233
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,120
May I?

234
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,120
Okay.

235
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,760
Though I have doubts,

236
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,040
she was publicly identified
as Lin Hong'er

237
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,000
by the local people.

238
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,400
Your Highness,

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
you're close to her.

240
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,920
Will you testify

241
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,080
to confirm her identity?

242
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,280
Testify about what?

243
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,280
If you confirm she's Xu Ziyi,

244
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
I can arrest her immediately

245
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,440
and secure her crime.

246
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,440
Your Highness?

247
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,840
She isn't Xu Ziyi.

248
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,840
She's Lin Hong'er.

249
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,320
Fine.

250
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,920
In that case,

251
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,480
I'll take my leave.

252
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,680
I'll leave.

253
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,760
How is it?

254
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,160
Prince Xian refuses to testify.

255
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,960
But I think

256
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,040
if we find the real Lin Hong'er,

257
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,080
it will be resolved.

258
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,000
But...

259
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,800
Swear.

260
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,360
Never let anyone
know your true identity.

261
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,040
And never let anyone discover

262
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,760
the face-swapping art
exists in this world.

263
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
But if I behave in this way,

264
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,840
how can I get revenge?

265
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,080
How can I clear my name?

266
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,120
You may seek vengeance,

267
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
but Lin Hong'er's identity

268
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,560
is lost forever.

269
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,760
What if Lin Hong'er ceases to exist?

270
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,320
If that's the case,

271
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,840
there's no way to prove

272
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
the woman inside isn't Lin Hong'er.

273
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,760
So be it.

274
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
Her mind is shattered.

275
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,920
That's punishment enough.

276
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,000
Is that so?

277
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,640
Indeed.

278
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,720
If she weren't mad,

279
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,960
Prince Xian wouldn't
perjure himself for her.

280
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
She couldn't clear her name.

281
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,400
You mean

282
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,960
she's faking madness?

283
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,240
We'll know soon enough.

284
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,424
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

285
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
Seems there is no everlasting love.

286
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,080
Just fleeting whims

287
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,960
that caused public uproar,

288
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
leaving them trapped in their lies.

289
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,840
A noble's casual encounter

290
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,560
becomes officials' ladder for flattery

291
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,560
and a merchant's chance
to reach the skies.

292
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,480
But my father...

293
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,840
My mother...

294
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,760
My powerless family...

295
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,560
Our lives

296
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,560
mean nothing.

297
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,600
What princes and consorts?

298
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,280
All villains.

299
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,520
What grand mansions?

300
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,840
They breed nothing but evil.

301
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,320
Let's go back.

302
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,680
Back to the mountains.

303
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,800
The mountains are better.

305
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:24,067
