00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,324
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,600
(The Gu poison has caused
complete skin ulceration.)

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,200
(Her face destroyed.)

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,400
(May this face-changing art succeed.)

6
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,200
He Laijin.

7
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,880
Sun Qi.

8
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,680
Who are these people?

9
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,000
The ones who deserve to die.

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
The ones who deserve to die!

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
What are you looking at?

12
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,760
Liuyun.

13
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,680
(Divine Physician, Shentu Yu)

14
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,360
Master.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,880
She's rediscovering herself.

16
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:03,680
(Apprentice, Liuyun)

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,480
How did I end up

18
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,120
with this face?

19
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
I made it happen.

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
If you're unsatisfied,

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
we can replace it.

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
You did this?

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,400
What about Lin Hong'er?

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,680
Lin Hong'er

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,120
is your original self.

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,960
My original self...

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,120
Lin Hong'er...

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
(One month earlier)

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Ahead is Lin Hong'er's home.

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,800
Hurry. Let's go.

31
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,920
Follow from behind.

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,200
Lin Hong'er.

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,840
Mother,

34
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,280
they seem to be targeting us.

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,680
Don't look like bandits,

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
but soldiers.

37
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,160
Father,

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,600
(Commoner, Lin Hong'er)
what's the matter?

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,480
If soldiers come knocking,
we must have offended someone.

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,760
They are reasonable, right?

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,120
We commoners can't defy soldiers.

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,560
The official's will is absolute.

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,880
Power is no license to bully.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,200
Is there no law?

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,120
What should we do now?

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,320
How can ordinary folk resist soldiers?

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,600
Hong'er.

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,760
Hong'er.

49
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:24,853
(Magistrate, He Laijin)

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,840
Hong'er,

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,800
don't be afraid.

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,680
Though I've never faced
such situations in my life,

53
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,480
with me here, no one will harm you.

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
What are you doing?

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,960
I, He Laijin, Magistrate of Lai County,

56
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,600
pay my respects to the Princess Consort.

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,440
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

58
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
You said the Prin...

59
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,760
Princess Consort?

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,320
Yes, the Princess Consort.

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,720
Lady Hong'er bears auspicious features.

62
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,040
In three days,

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,600
I'll personally escort Her Highness
to the mansion.

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,160
Three days.

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,920
Three days.

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,480
Well...

67
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,200
Xiao Xian, the Prince Heir,

68
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,320
travelled incognito.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,360
After half a day together,

70
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,640
he became infatuated with that girl.

71
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
He even had a portrait drawn to find her
upon returning to the capital.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,680
(Registrar, Sun Qi)
With such a windfall,

73
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,480
everyone wants in.

74
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,800
But who could've known

75
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,440
there's someone identical to her.

76
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,640
The crown of the Princess Consort

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,880
won't rest on Lin Hong'er's head.

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,880
And with your intervention,

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
the one inside

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,120
is likely to take her place.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,480
My lady,

82
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,840
our men are ready.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,960
When do we take action?

84
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Tonight.

85
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,120
Why is it snowing?

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,800
Who's there?

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,520
My dear!

88
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,840
- Hong'er!
- Father!

89
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,880
Run!

90
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,560
Father!

91
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,160
Hong'er, go!

92
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,840
- Father!
- Run!

93
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,280
Quick! Report to the authorities!

94
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,120
Father!

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,000
Go, now!

96
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,720
Father!

97
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,560
(County Office)
Open the door!

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,400
Open the door!

99
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,901
(Court of Justice)

100
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,520
Are you Lin Sanjiang's daughter?

101
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,000
My lord,

102
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,040
don't you recognize me?

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,240
I'm here to seek help.

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,240
Kneel!

105
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,640
Might...

106
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,000
Power...

107
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,280
Lin Hong'er,

108
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,800
do you confess?

109
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,600
Me?

110
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,040
Confess?

111
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,240
You murdered your parents.

112
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,720
A heinous crime!

113
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,080
You're lying!

114
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
You're lying!

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,600
Drag her out. Apply the torture.

116
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

117
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,760
Move.

118
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,800
I didn't kill anyone.

119
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,400
Mr. Sun, save me.

120
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm innocent.

121
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,360
Mr. Sun.

122
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,120
Mr. Sun.

123
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,560
Just call me Qi.

124
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,080
Qi.

125
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,760
Qi.

126
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,960
I'm innocent.

127
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,520
I know.

128
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,040
I'm innocent.

129
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,600
I know.

130
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,240
I know.

131
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,160
I know.

132
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,040
Qi,

133
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,840
where are my parents?

134
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,240
They...

135
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,640
Come on.

136
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,040
Father...

137
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,680
Mother...

138
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,720
Hong'er,

139
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,640
our priority now is to find clues

140
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,240
and uncover who killed your parents.

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
Think carefully.

142
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,000
In recent days,

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,080
have you encountered any strangers?

144
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,960
Tell me every detail,

145
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
so I can get you out.

146
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,800
Strangers?

147
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,440
Young lady!

148
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
Young lady!

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
Don't drink that water!

150
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,360
Don't drink that water!

151
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,480
Young lady.

152
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:58,688
(Prince Rui's Nephew, Xiao Xian)

153
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,120
Young lady.

154
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,800
Help!

155
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,960
Help!

156
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,240
Help!

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,400
Help!

158
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,120
Help!

159
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,880
Help!

160
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,000
Help!

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,960
It's shallow, won't drown you.

162
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,360
But we only met once.

163
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
Never saw each other again.

164
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,400
The cursed weather.

165
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,760
Snow three days ago,

166
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,000
now the sun scorches.

167
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,080
Truly uncanny.

168
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,360
Indeed.

169
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,800
Could we be haunted?

170
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,000
Nonsense.

171
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,400
What haunted?

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,480
Receiving the Princess Consort
is our paramount duty.

173
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,640
We must escort the Princess Consort

174
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,520
to the capital without mishap.

175
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,560
No mistakes allowed.

176
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,880
Your Highness.

177
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,520
Your Highness.

178
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
The three-day deadline has arrived.

179
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,720
I'm here to receive you.

180
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,240
Your Highness?

181
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Your Highness?

182
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,840
