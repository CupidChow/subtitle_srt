1
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:10,449
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,373
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,800
Give me your right hand.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,040
Why did it take so long?

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,320
Did she use some trick

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,800
to bribe the physician?

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
You've talked too much.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,448
Physician Jia has a sterling reputation.

9
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:29,880
He would never do such a thing.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,880
Your master entrusted this task to me.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
I'll do my utmost.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,480
It seems

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,440
my master has briefed you thoroughly.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,040
Yes.

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,000
Lady Hong, isn't this plan
too dangerous?

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,120
They accused me
of impropriety with Prince Rui

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,840
and tried to destroy me.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,880
I can only play along.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,640
This might also be
the swiftest path to vengeance.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,680
I see.

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,640
Burning all bridges.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,920
Success is assured.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,080
How is she?

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,440
Congratulations.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,720
She is pregnant.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
Based on my decades of experience,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,000
it's likely a son.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,320
I know what you mean.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,320
I'll leave now.

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,040
Reward him.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,840
Understood.

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,560
Though Hong Linlang is of low birth,

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
this is His Highness' only bloodline.

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,600
Then the title

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,400
won't go to Xiao Xian.

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,560
What exactly happened?

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,880
Tell me!

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,640
In short,

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,280
Hong Linlang deceived you.

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,480
Ziyi,

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,320
you're a kind soul.

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,080
Such...

43
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,840
Such malicious schemes

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,840
are best left unknown to you.

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,960
I think...

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,520
Could there be some misunderstanding?

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,840
No.

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Your Highness.

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,280
Concubine Dou.

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,120
Lady Xu.

51
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,680
Lady Xu,

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,320
I'm kind-hearted.

53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,040
Knowing you and Lady Hong
are like sisters,

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,880
I came to inform you.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,200
Lady Hong

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,360
is pregnant.

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,520
Ziyi.

58
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Your Highness.

59
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,080
Let's go.

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,840
Ziyi,

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
why are you here?

62
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Linlang,

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,200
are you alright?

64
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm fine.

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,480
Good that you're fine.

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,640
By the way,

67
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
why did the County Princess

68
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,480
summon you?

69
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,360
My lady,

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,400
time for your medicine.

71
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,280
Medicine?

72
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,720
How come you suddenly got ill?

73
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,800
I...

74
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,480
What illness does she have?

75
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,880
She isn't ill.

76
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,000
This is prenatal tonic.

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,760
Prenatal tonic?

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
Whose child is it?

79
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,600
Whose else could it be?

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,400
It's Prince Rui's.

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,400
Liuyun.

82
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,440
What?

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,280
You carry Prince Rui's heir?

84
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,760
A legitimate firstborn,

85
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
the rightful heir.

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,320
Liuyun,

87
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
help me over there.

88
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,800
Ziyi.

89
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,560
Well, well.

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,760
You set me up!

91
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,680
Ziyi,

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,160
how could I set you up?

93
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,160
If I wanted to set you up,

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,120
why would I perjure myself

95
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,120
to help you become the Princess Consort?

96
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,360
Why would I

97
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,680
remain silent when the County Princess

98
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,800
threatened torture?

99
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,680
All this was for your sake!

100
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,520
I tried to hide it.

101
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,880
But

102
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,200
I failed.

103
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,880
You...

104
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,120
I won't compete with you.

105
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,960
If you're concerned about this child,

106
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
I can get rid of it.

107
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,640
No!

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
This requires careful deliberation.

109
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,320
Deliberate thoroughly...

110
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,520
(The fetus must go,)

111
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,040
(but without tying it to me.)

112
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,480
Come take your medicine first.

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,280
Do you trust me?

114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,760
I...

115
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,040
I trust you.

116
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,384
(County Office)

117
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
(Prefect, Liu Quan)
I've found the person you want.

118
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,840
She came this morning,
saying her brother went missing.

119
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,520
Qi,

120
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,320
let's go.

121
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,640
We're at the mansion.

122
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,000
That letter must be a trap.

123
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,800
You may leave.

124
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,920
Don't be afraid.

125
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,120
Your brother was targeted by enemies.

126
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,120
Do you know how he made these enemies?

127
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
He never shared his affairs with me.

128
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,160
But he did have a few enemies.

129
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,440
But I do know

130
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,760
one of them caused
your brother's disappearance.

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,320
Come on.

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,280
Stand and speak.

133
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,720
For your brother's sake,

134
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,720
will you obey me?

135
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,440
I thought you hated serving others.

136
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,000
There's nothing to do here.

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,280
Go attend your duties.

138
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,160
My lady,

139
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,400
time for medicine.

140
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,960
Where's Liuyun?

141
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,800
She is resting.

142
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,200
Your condition now
requires more servants.

143
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm the maid assigned to serve you,

144
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,040
Yueya.

145
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,120
Put it down.

146
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,600
Your accent sounds familiar.

147
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,320
May I ask your origin?

148
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,440
Lai County.

149
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,040
Lai County?

150
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,520
I've heard of that place.

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,360
I heard

152
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,680
there occurred

153
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,360
a shocking crime.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
You mean

155
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
the peasant girl
who murdered her parents?

156
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,160
You know that family?

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,640
No.

158
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,960
I only heard stories.

159
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,520
But I heard those parents were kind,

160
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,400
good to the daughter.

161
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Who'd expect the girl

162
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,000
to commit such atrocity.

163
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,320
Utterly inhuman.

164
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Sheer madness.

165
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,520
Is that so?

166
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,160
That's all.

167
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
You may leave.

168
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,080
By the way,

169
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,280
my personal belongings

170
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,640
need not be tended.

171
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,320
I don't let strangers handle them.

172
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,200
Understood.

173
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,600
My lady.

174
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,720
It's confirmed.

175
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,240
She's Sun Qi's sister.

176
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,440
Her presence here isn't innocent.

177
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
Her brother disappeared,

178
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,240
yet she became a maid
as if nothing happened?

179
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Keep close watch.

180
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,240
Don't worry.

181
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
Whatever tricks she or her backers try,

182
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,200
we'll just

183
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,760
counter them all.

184
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,000
You saw it clearly?

185
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,560
Good.

186
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Excellent.

187
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,960
I'll report to the County Princess now.

188
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,760
Not yet.

189
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,120
This can eliminate two problems at once.

190
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,920
There's still a fool in the mansion

191
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,400
causing constant trouble.

192
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,640
You mean

193
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,200
Concubine Dou?

194
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:23,153
♪Fate begins and ends, I sip the past♪

195
00:10:23,153 --> 00:10:28,814
♪Love and hatred flow endlessly♪
