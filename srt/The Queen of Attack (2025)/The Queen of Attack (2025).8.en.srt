1
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:10,417
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:13,341
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,000
My family's short on money again.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,240
Didn't you just send
a batch of jewelry last month?

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,120
It's only been a few months.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,880
You've given them
all your monthly savings.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,160
Why do they keep asking?

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,080
My brother loses money in everything.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,880
My father drinks too much.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,640
If I don't give them money or goods,

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,480
they'll come to my place
and make a scene.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,080
Your family really brings you no honor.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,160
Shut up!

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
Lady Xu,

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,320
where are you heading?

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,544
To pay respects to the County Princess.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,960
And also...

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,360
You're not thinking

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,560
the same thing as me, are you?

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,080
What do you mean?

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,800
Maybe I'm overthinking.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,560
But if you're not,

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,760
all the better.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,800
Wait.

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,240
What exactly is this about?

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,400
Well, it's nothing too sensitive.

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,840
Lady Hong

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,440
has been frail since childhood.

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
The County Princess worries
the maids can't care for her properly.

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,440
So I want to request

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,640
to take charge of Lady Hong's care.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,720
So that's the matter?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,400
If you want to earn this favor,

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
just go ahead.

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,200
I was born to enjoy comforts,

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,760
not to serve others.

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
Then I'll take my leave now.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,040
How peculiar.

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,240
Why would she fight to do

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,160
such a thankless task?

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,600
No.

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,600
I need to check.

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,320
Let's go.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,720
Why are you here, Concubine Dou?

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,600
Just to see you.

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,400
This chamber has many new additions.

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,280
Yes.

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,520
But I understand

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,640
it's because Her Highness

50
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,600
values my child.

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,880
Exactly.

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
(So that's it.)

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,680
(Caring for Lady Hong is like
tending a gold mountain.)

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,720
Feicui,

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,080
get Lady Hong water.

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
How are you maids serving?

57
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,480
There's not even any fruit.

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,560
Linlang,

59
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,800
come here.

60
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,800
Sit.

61
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,720
Regarding the incident that day,

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,240
I acted rashly.

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
After much thought,

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,120
we're both in similar situations.

65
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,560
I understand

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,080
your feelings.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,240
Now that you're carrying
Prince Rui's child,

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
this is of utmost importance.

69
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,560
From now on,

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,160
let me take care of you and the child.

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,080
There's no need for you
to trouble yourself with my affairs.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,880
You don't understand.

73
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,320
Someone in the mansion
wants to harm you.

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,440
What?

75
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
My lady,

76
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,760
I know nothing

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,160
about the affairs of this mansion.

78
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,000
I must protect this child at all costs.

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
If you truly care,

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,120
you must help me.

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,920
I will.

82
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,640
I absolutely will.

83
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,400
Try these grapes. They're quite sweet.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

85
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,560
Your Highness.

86
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,600
What is it?

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,880
You look troubled.

88
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,120
I just visited Lady Hong's chamber.

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
You know what?

90
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,200
She looked unwell.

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,880
The best tonics and herbs here

92
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,960
were all sent to her.

93
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,360
She lacks for nothing.

94
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
Yes, yes.

95
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,720
Your Highness provide excellent care.

96
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,000
The items sent are all top-quality.

97
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,760
It's just that

98
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,640
Lady Hong grew up in poverty.

99
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,040
She doesn't know
how to use them properly.

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,960
Take for example,

101
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,560
to nourish vital energy,

102
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,520
we should mix pearl powder
with honey water and drink it warm.

103
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,640
Last year,

104
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,640
Eastern Defense sent
a large box of pearls.

105
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,160
Grind them into powder...

106
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,520
Grinding requires special care.

107
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,600
If you grind too finely,

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
you fling it all

109
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,816
- and the wind...
- Enough.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,320
You're making me dizzy.

111
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,520
Sit down.

112
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Yes.

113
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,320
Serve the tea.

114
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,760
Speaking of knowledgeable people
in the mansion,

115
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
you're probably the only one.

116
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,760
Indeed.

117
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,160
Then I'll entrust
Lady Hong's care to you.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Request anything you need.

119
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,080
Understood.

120
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,800
I'll take good care of her.

121
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,080
Regarding Lady Hong's care,

122
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,360
my lady,

123
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,120
it's not a grand task,

124
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,120
but nor is it trivial,

125
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,760
as it concerns His Highness' only heir.

126
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,280
Should any mishap occur,

127
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm afraid you...

128
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,880
Lady Xu, don't exaggerate.

129
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
I understand the heir's importance.

130
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,120
Your Highness, rest assured.

131
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,320
I'll make sure
the child will remain safe.

132
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,400
You may leave.

133
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,920
I'll go select items from the treasury.

134
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

135
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,600
Hurry!

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,480
These treasures

137
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,080
are rarely seen.

138
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,160
Let alone used.

139
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,400
This ginseng here

140
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,760
was chosen by His Majesty
from national reserves

141
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
to prolong Prince Rui's life, right?

142
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,920
Now all these goods are sent here.

143
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,280
Prince Rui?

144
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,240
He is already dead.

145
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,880
Everything in this mansion is lifeless.

146
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,760
To preserve this mansion's glory,

147
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,560
we must rely
on that musician's unborn child.

148
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
This truth

149
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,840
is best known to the County Princess.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,240
How beautiful.

151
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,400
Are all these for your family?

152
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,360
Just an unborn child.

153
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,720
No one knows its gender

154
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
or fortune.

155
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,120
But Prince Xian's a youthful talent.

156
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,320
Why doesn't the County Princess
favor him?

157
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,960
Youthful talent?

158
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,200
You think the County Princess
shares your naive views?

159
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,840
He doesn't carry Prince Rui's blood.

160
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,120
Even if he had an unparalleled talent,

161
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,320
he'd still be an outsider.

162
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,880
Would you let this vast estate

163
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,360
fall into an outsider's hands?

164
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,040
I just need to control
that fool Hong Linlang.

165
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,280
The County Princess
will leave eventually.

166
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
When that day comes,

167
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,640
the mansion will be my domain.

168
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,680
I saw her taking many things.

169
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,680
I'll take my leave.

170
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,440
Why does this maid look so unfamiliar?

171
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,800
You're back.

172
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,000
She's Lady Hong's maid, isn't she?

173
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,720
Impossible.

174
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
You must be mistaken.

175
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Your Highness?

176
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
Help me up.

177
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,400
What's happening?

178
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,920
Don't worry, Lady Hong.

179
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
Someone sent an anonymous letter,

180
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,400
claiming there are thieves
in your chamber.

181
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,920
Her Highness and I worried about you.
So we came

182
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,520
and check

183
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,560
if anything is missing.

184
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,760
Are you alright, Lady Hong?

185
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm fine.

186
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,920
Let's sit here.

187
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,360
Your Highness,

188
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
items in the chamber remain intact,

189
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,800
but Concubine Dou
requested many supplies

190
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
from the treasury in Lady Hong's name,

191
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
which are not here.

192
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,560
I knew she'd exploit this duty

193
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,640
to embezzle,

194
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,360
but not to this extent.

195
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,040
I'll interrogate her tomorrow.

196
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,600
No.

197
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm afraid she'll dispose
of evidence tonight.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,160
By tomorrow,

199
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,160
it'll be too late.

200
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
Summon several servants

201
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,600
to get her tonight.

202
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,760
Understood.

203
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,800
Hurry!

204
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,120
Too slow! Hurry up!

205
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,080
Quick!

206
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,840
Hurry up!

207
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,480
Let's go.

208
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Concubine Dou, where are you heading?

209
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,680
I'm in a hurry. Move aside.

210
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,360
You've taken so many things
from Lady Hong.

211
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
Now that she is in trouble,

212
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,160
you must save her.

213
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,440
What nonsense are you spouting?

214
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,520
Menstrual cloth?

215
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,520
This belongs to Lady Hong.

216
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,560
She...

217
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,320
She's having her monthly courses?

218
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,520
So that means

219
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,680
her pregnancy is fake?

220
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,920
My lady, you must save Lady Hong.

221
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,920
If you help her,

222
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,800
these will be considered
her gifts to you.

223
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
Even if others find out,

224
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,760
they can't fault you.

225
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,760
I...

226
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,280
I don't want them.

227
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,424
There she is!

228
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,720
Over there!

229
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,040
Stop!

230
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,880
Stop!

231
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,520
Stop right there!

232
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,360
Stealing valuables?

233
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,760
How dare you!

234
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Your Highness,

235
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,080
I didn't steal anything.

236
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,240
These were all rewards
you gave Lady Hong.

237
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,560
She willingly gave them to me.

238
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,600
Lies!

239
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,000
For no reason,

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,840
why would she give you these valuables?

241
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,720
What's this?

242
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,520
It's...

243
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,720
It's a menstrual cloth.

244
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,240
You fled with stolen goods.

245
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,760
Why carry this filth?

246
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm having my monthly courses.

247
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,200
Is that so?

248
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,920
My lady,

249
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,120
don't panic.

250
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,280
Is there something you're hiding?

251
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,560
If there's nothing,

252
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,320
why would you be so bold

253
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,720
to take so many items
from Lady Hong's chamber,

254
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,280
yet she never noticed?

255
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,320
I told you just now.

256
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,040
She gave these to me.

257
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
- Said if I helped her, these...
- Help her?
