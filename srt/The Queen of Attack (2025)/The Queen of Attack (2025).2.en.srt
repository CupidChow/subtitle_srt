00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:10,353
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:13,277
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,466
(Magnate's Daughter, Xu Ziyi)

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,240
Your Highness.

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,720
Do I look like Lin Hong'er?

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,240
Yes.

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,720
You look the same.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,440
- Extremely the same.
- In my opinion,

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,520
it's best if I'm the only one

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,320
who resembles the woman
from the portrait.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,440
Don't you agree?

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,640
Yes.

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,840
Yes.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Your Highness,

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,320
please.

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,440
My lady,

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,560
the nanny from the mansion has arrived.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,520
I recall you once said

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,760
that my voice differs greatly from hers.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,800
Is that so?

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,400
This is indeed problematic.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,040
My lady.

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Well...

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,240
My lord,

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,240
I sustained injuries recently.

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,960
My throat suffered some damage.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,960
Your throat suffered damage?

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,160
Similar.

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,800
Truly identical.

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,480
What do you mean?

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,600
This is the original person herself.

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
Sure it resembles.

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,240
- Have some tea.
- Look at you.

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,960
No wonder my master

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,600
developed certain intentions

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,120
upon seeing you at the market.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,320
Do you remember that day?

38
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,720
My master mentioned
several amusing incidents occurred.

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,800
My lady,

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,120
your handkerchief fell.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,960
See here.

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,280
Thank you.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,360
You jest.

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,760
We didn't meet at the market.

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,560
We actually met

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,080
at a wild mountain stream.

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,240
I mocked him for being a pampered noble.

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,320
Parched with thirst,

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,760
yet he refused to drink mountain water.

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,360
Take your time chatting.

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,720
My lord.

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,720
This hurdle should be cleared.

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,160
The matron from the mansion

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,440
has better interrogation methods
than mine.

55
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,800
Thanks to you

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,400
for getting Lin Hong'er's confession.

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,200
My lord,

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,240
how should we handle Lin Hong'er?

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
After she finishes
detailing their interactions,

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
we'll silence her.

61
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,280
Understood.

62
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,600
Stop!

63
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,160
I said no torture.

64
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,680
Who authorized this?

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,960
Hong'er,

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,960
it's okay.

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,880
It's okay.

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,560
Get out!

69
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,360
Go!

70
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,960
Leave!

71
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,720
Out!

72
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,240
Enough pretense.

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,920
I've seen through it these days.

74
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,960
(Commoner, Lin Hong'er)
You're colluding with those officials.

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,760
How many times must I say?

76
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,600
Call me Qi!

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,760
Must you disgust me so?

78
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,440
What do you think you are?

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
You shameless woman.

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,880
You love him
just because he's the Prince Heir?

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,200
Climbing social ladders?

82
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
Don't play innocent here!

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
What did you say?

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,520
The Prince Heir?

85
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,440
Let me make this clear.

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,760
I can keep you alive,

87
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,320
or show you what the abyss is like.

88
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,320
Your methods lack finesse.

89
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,400
Just bark like a rabid dog.

90
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,000
In fact,

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,200
you're weak inside despite bluster.

92
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,480
Want to see what the abyss is like?

93
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,120
Fine.

94
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,800
Old devil,

95
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,040
here's your meal.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
Bite me.

97
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,120
My family's already destroyed.

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,200
Death reunites me with parents.

99
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,800
Crush me then.

100
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,080
My lord.

101
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,440
The Gu poison acted up. Already dead.

102
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,320
Hurry!

103
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,680
Throw her out.

104
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,600
Yes.

105
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,440
Let's go.

106
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
Why did you save me?

107
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,800
Because we're the same,

108
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,560
wronged and unvindicated.

109
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,880
Lin Hong'er is already dead.

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,360
Master, please give me a new name.

111
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
Then you shall be Hong Linlang.

112
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,240
(Commoner, Lin Hong'er)

113
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,169
(Musician, Hong Linlang)

114
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,960
After such a long ride,

115
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,160
you must be exhausted.

116
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,160
We'll arrive soon.

117
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,280
Madam,

118
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,640
I'd like to stop here.

119
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,160
What is it?

120
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,360
I want to burn some paper offerings.

121
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,320
The night before we met,

122
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,160
a brutal murder occurred in the county.

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,680
A farmer died horribly.

124
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
It weighs on my conscience.

125
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,400
This is your habit.

126
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,840
This is your preference.

127
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,240
This is your story.

128
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,560
Don't worry.

129
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,120
I've remembered everything.

130
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,280
From now on,

131
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,720
I'll carry on your life

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
for you.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
All things manifest divine melodies.

134
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,160
Jeweled notes reach ears and hearts.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,720
Master.

136
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,200
Prince Rui's been ill,
but his hearing's sharp.

137
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,000
It must reach not just ears but hearts.

138
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,040
Your skills are still rough.

139
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
Keep practicing.

140
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,200
Understood.

141
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,920
Aren't you going to ask me

142
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,680
why I send you to the mansion

143
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,000
to be a musician?

144
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,240
Your wisdom is unfathomable.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,320
Your actions always have
deeper meanings.

146
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,080
Since you say I'm unfathomable,

147
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,640
aren't you afraid
I'm using you in some scheme?

148
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,720
When schemes are woven,

149
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,760
pawns must be sacrificed.

150
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,080
Someone who's died once

151
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
fears no exploitation.

152
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:27,648
(Here rest Lin Sanjiang and his wife)

153
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,400
Linlang.

154
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
Cherish your life.

155
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,160
I

156
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,040
take my leave of you, Master.

157
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,160
(Three months later)
Here.

158
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:50,320
(Memorial)

159
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,880
(Prince Rui's Mansion)
Alright, give it to me.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
After Prince Rui passed,

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,160
there's much left to handle.

162
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,640
Prince Rui had no sons.

163
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,600
So his nephew Xiao Xian
will inherit the title.

164
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,880
The Prince Rui's Mansion is murky.

165
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,160
- As for the title,
- Let's go.

166
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,776
we don't even know who'll get it yet.

167
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,520
