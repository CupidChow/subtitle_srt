1
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:10,449
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,373
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,680
These are all His Highness' belongings.

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,640
Please take a look.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,120
Which items should be sealed?

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
And which

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,360
should be buried?

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,880
This was what His Highness wore
during his final days.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
When I look at it,

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,360
it's as if I see His Highness
from those days.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,560
A bellyband?

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,080
This is absurd!

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,080
Something's wrong.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,840
All these years, apart from me,

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,480
His Highness had no other women.

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,000
But this...

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,880
But...

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,040
But this doesn't belong to me.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,800
Stop.

20
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:26,120
(Linlang)

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,040
Linlang?

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
I see.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,840
His Highness only ever
listened to my songs.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
Why suddenly

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,560
would he want some young musician?

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,880
Wait.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,520
The physician said

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,480
His Highness' condition had improved.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,200
But then it suddenly
took a turn for the worse.

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,200
Now that I think about it,

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,600
could he have done something

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
beyond his capacity

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,440
that harmed his health?

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,200
Bring her in.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,160
Yes.

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,760
Do you think it looks nice?

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,560
Yes.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,640
Ziyi?

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,200
You're back.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,360
Exquisite.

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,640
Attending palace events

42
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,240
is truly tiresome.

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,880
I really don't want to
attend these social obligations.

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,720
Young lady!

45
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,520
Don't drink that water!

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,640
I know.

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,440
But these things can't be avoided.

48
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,080
Though it's not publicly announced,

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,280
you're Prince Rui's only nephew

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,040
and the sole male heir of his line.

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,040
Now that he is gone,

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,680
these people will surely flock
to befriend you.

53
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
There's no escaping this.

54
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,480
Why do you keep staring at me?

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,760
You spring-drinking country girl

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
have truly changed.

57
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,800
You're mastering these
tedious protocols too well.

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,960
You're speaking like that again.

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,960
Alright.

60
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,040
It's all my fault.

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,000
You only became like this because of me.

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
You've suffered hardship.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,280
I feel for you.

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,520
I know you care about me.

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,440
Lady Hong is still here.

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Lady Hong.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,360
I'll take my leave.

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,320
Lady Hong,

69
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,360
why leave as soon as he arrives?

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,080
Seems I've become unwelcome.

71
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,520
My lady,

72
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,080
the Princess sent for you.

73
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,160
Oh, yes.

74
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,080
I should go pay respects to my aunt.

75
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,720
No.

76
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,920
Her Highness requested Lady Hong.

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,720
What?

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
At this hour,

79
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,360
what could it be about?

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
Go with her to keep watch.

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,000
No need.

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,400
Lady Hong.

83
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,200
Go.

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,840
Lady Hong,

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,320
why do you dislike me so?

86
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
Your Highness, you jest.

87
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,880
Look up.

88
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,920
Look at me.

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,800
Okay.

90
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's go.

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,520
No need to accompany me.

92
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,360
I don't want to,

93
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,520
but you're Ziyi's friend.

94
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,840
I must ensure your safety.

95
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,560
Your relationship with her

96
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
is truly remarkable.

97
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,800
Have you ever felt
instant affection for someone?

98
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,040
Let's go.

99
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,400
Prince Xian, why are you here?

100
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,280
I'm here to pay respects to my aunt.

101
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,560
Your Highness.

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,680
This doesn't concern you.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,880
Leave us now.

104
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,600
Lady Hong is Ziyi's guest.

105
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,920
So she's my guest too.

106
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm afraid she doesn't know
the rules here.

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
It's better for me to stay here.

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,240
We need to discuss
women's private matters.

109
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
It concerns Lady Hong's reputation.

110
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,400
Would you like to listen?

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,080
These two normally patrol
the front courtyard, right?

112
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,000
Why are they serving
the County Princess today?

113
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,200
With these two present,

114
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,240
why aren't you concerned
about Lady Hong's reputation?

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,520
Did you select the toughest enforcers
among the guards

116
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,080
to bully a defenseless woman?

117
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,440
How dare you!

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Aunt,

119
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,560
I've been bold since childhood.

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
You know me well.

121
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,360
Either humor me,

122
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,480
or

123
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
I'll take my people and leave.

124
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,200
Forget it.

125
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
Listen if you must.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Bring the item.

127
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,320
Yes.

128
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,800
Speak.

129
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,520
Is this yours?

130
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,600
These harem tricks again?

131
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,120
Speak!

132
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:37,440
What are you doing?

133
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,600
Confess honestly.

134
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,520
Confess what?

135
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,080
These are just your despicable

136
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,240
underhanded schemes.

137
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,680
Let's go!

138
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,096
(Linlang)

139
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
It's mine.

140
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,440
With me protecting you,

141
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,720
no need to admit it.

142
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,880
This was a love token
between Prince Rui and me.

143
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,320
Shameless!

144
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,360
Drag her out and beat her to death.

145
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,120
Who dares?

146
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,400
You're right.

147
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,600
I do despise you.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
After finally securing
Prince Rui's favor,

149
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,920
I thought I'd rise to greatness.

150
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
Who'd know he'd die?

151
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,160
Now the title falls to you.

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
I really

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
hate you utterly!

154
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,480
Your Highness.

155
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,920
What are you waiting for?

156
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,480
Take her away.

157
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,920
You shameless woman!

158
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,720
What act are you putting on now?

159
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
Your Highness,

160
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,280
don't let them torture me.

161
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,720
You'll regret this.

162
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,120
What do you mean?

163
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,720
I...

164
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,680
I'm carrying

165
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,280
Prince Rui's child.
