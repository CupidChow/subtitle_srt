2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,324
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:17,392
(Two hours ago)

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,360
You... You lied to me.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,600
There was never any antidote.

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
You'll never get your face back.

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm the former Crown Prince.

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
This identity of mine

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,840
dragged me
into a life-or-death predicament.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,520
At a royal banquet,

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,600
someone poisoned me with Gu poison.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,400
By the time I realized it,

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,080
every inch of my skin
began tearing apart

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,800
and festering.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,840
I learned medicine

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,040
under renowned physicians.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,080
With my last shred of willpower,

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,040
I ordered my most trusted subordinate

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,040
to take me to my master's hermitage.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,960
Through studying ancient texts,

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,400
I discovered a vicious
self-preservation method.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,600
Fighting poison with poison.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,440
By biting others,

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,120
to transfer the poison out,

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,160
thereby reducing my own poison.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,000
Who was that monster then?

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,720
He was that subordinate,

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,920
Shentu Yu.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,640
He sacrificed himself to save me.

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,840
After part of my poison
transferred to him,

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,080
his appearance and physique
changed completely.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,640
The captors

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,240
mistook him for the Gu-poisoned me

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,840
and imprisoned him.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,960
As for me,

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,000
I lived in seclusion as Shentu Yu.

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,240
So that's what happened.

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,880
Who would've thought

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,000
the former Crown Prince

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,280
has been living safe and sound
all these years.

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
What an incredible story.

42
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,720
It was you.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,840
You're the one who poisoned me

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,360
at that royal banquet, aren't you?

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,520
Correct.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,400
Eliminating you ensured
His Majesty's smooth ascension.

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,880
Yet he only granted me
a County Princess title.

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,320
While those men without merit

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,080
or capabilities inherit noble titles.

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,880
This isn't how the royal family
should operate!

51
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,680
Where's Hong Linlang now?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,920
Finally,

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
it's all coming to an end.

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,360
Yes,

55
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,520
everything is about to end.

56
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,000
You...

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
This needle is useless.

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,840
You...

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
You dare scheme against me?

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,080
Your Highness.

61
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,320
Stop deluding yourself.

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,160
This is the mansion.

63
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,120
You can't escape.

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,120
True,

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,600
this is the mansion.

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,040
But I

67
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,120
am the Consort.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,200
You're just a titular Consort.

69
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,200
Who would listen to you?

70
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,960
Indeed.

71
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,080
My Consort title is nominal.

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,120
Then

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,600
what about Prince Rui?

74
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,520
I haven't requested yet.

75
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,600
How could His Majesty
grant him the title?

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,920
You helped eliminate
the former Crown Prince,

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,880
and grew arrogant with achievements.

78
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,240
Even as the County Princess,
you remain dissatisfied.

79
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Do you think His Majesty
wants to protect you?

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,880
He's eager to find any excuse

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,240
to make you disappear forever.

82
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,080
Seize them!

83
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Let me go!

84
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,960
- Move!
- Let go of me!

85
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,040
I know you're in there.

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,680
What a pity.

87
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
You should've seen

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,400
those wounds,

89
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,160
and the flesh torn open by whips

90
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,200
and seared with red-hot irons,

91
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,840
making sizzling sound...

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,760
I can't even feel pain anymore.

93
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,760
Only this face...

94
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,240
What a waste.

95
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
This face!

96
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,880
Father,

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,320
Mother,

98
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,240
I've avenged

99
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,440
all your grievances for you.

100
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,000
Now,

101
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,520
you may rest in peace.

102
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,320
Let's go.

103
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
Was I wrong?

104
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,080
I wasn't wrong.

105
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:01,698
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

106
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:04,698
(Prince Xiao Xian submitted a petition.)

107
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:09,368
(Lin Hong'er's murder case reopened.)

108
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:14,048
(Truth revealed, perpetrators punished.)

109
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:16,320
(Ruoya Residence)

110
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
I haven't seen such clear sky for long.

111
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,800
I want to gaze properly.

112
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
You and His Majesty

113
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,080
must have made quite a few deals.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,840
In times of chaos,

115
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,968
imperial power is unstable.

116
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
He'll always need

117
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,760
supportive allies by his side.

118
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
Master Shentu told me

119
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,520
to stand by His Majesty

120
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,184
and protect the nation and its people.

121
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,320
From now on,

122
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,520
you shall be Prince Rui.

123
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes,

124
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,760
my Consort.

125
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,840
Have you forgotten?

126
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,040
You petitioned His Majesty

127
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
to clear my name.

128
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm no longer Hong Linlang,

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
nor the Consort.

130
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,560
I'm just Lin Hong'er.

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,280
So...

132
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,720
Are you leaving?

133
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,480
With him?

134
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,320
He and I

135
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,240
are like two wandering clouds
in the martial world,

136
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,480
