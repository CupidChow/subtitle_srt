1
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,179
There's a student, Lee Kang-jin
in Geumwha High School

2
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,182
You don't know
Lee Kang-jin?

3
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,350
He gives private loan
to other students

4
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,687
- A high school student lending money?
- Yes!

5
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,397
It's the truth!

6
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,999
Pay back the money!

7
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,752
Yoo Seon-ho

8
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,378
Kang Mi-na

9
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,130
Yoo In-soo

10
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,799
Lee Il-joon

11
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,509
Shin Soo-hyun

12
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,219
Lee Chan-hyung

13
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,929
Seo Hye-won

14
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,639
Yoon Byung-hee

15
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:45,355
Usury Academy

16
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,251
Hey, who is it?

17
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,002
Get lost

18
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,296
Who is it?

19
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,382
None of
your business

20
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,302
- Is it a girl?
- Let go!

21
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,054
Hey Ki-young,
he...

22
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,473
Damn

23
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,684
Damn it!

24
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,144
Do you know
how much this is?

25
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,979
Clean it!

26
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,274
- Sorry
- It's fine

27
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,818
- Clean it
- It's okay

28
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:39,742
Kang-jin?

29
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:44,539
Yeah

30
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:46,708
Aren't you hungry?

31
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:48,710
I'm fine

32
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,379
Are you doing
your job?

33
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,883
Are you careless
because it's not yours?

34
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:57,510
No

35
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:00,722
Also...

36
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,354
Clean the room

37
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,940
You'll get sick

38
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,708
The deadline
is next week

39
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:32,712
I'm going

40
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:38,927
Take care!

41
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,422
Oh my...

42
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,134
Clean the place

43
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,262
I'm a customer,
you know

44
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,015
The place is a mess

45
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,060
I can't reach
your parents

46
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,563
It's just one day

47
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,359
What?

48
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,779
It's cut off

49
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,741
Because of interests,
he couldn't pay the bills

50
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,291
Come here

51
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,924
I don't feel
comfortable doing this

52
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,635
It's difficult
to make a living

53
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,930
by lending some money
to the neighborhood

54
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,974
I have to
give salaries

55
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,227
I have nothing
in my pocket

56
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,980
But if the customers
don't pay up

57
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,649
You're putting me
in a difficult position

58
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,778
It's tough,
right?

59
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,574
How did you
select this job?

60
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,413
- I have nothing else to do
- Damn

61
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,002
I just wanted to help

62
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,464
Sorry

63
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,097
Tell your parents
to pay up

64
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,685
I need a drink

65
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,086
Damn

66
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,247
What?

67
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,417
Did you buy
a key ring?

68
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:41,794
Yeah

69
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,342
I wanted to
buy this, too

70
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,848
(Ki-young)
"Hey, Ko Shin-ji"

71
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,308
That's enough

72
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,976
You're embarrassing me, too

73
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,064
Hey!

74
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,526
I'm talking to you!

75
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,615
(Hee-won)
"Sorry"

76
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,160
- Let's go
- Let me go

77
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,620
(Min-seo)
"Shin-ji"

78
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,937
Are you close
with Shin-ji?

79
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,563
What?

80
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,107
Do you think she thinks
of you as a friend?

81
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,113
Mind your
own business

82
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,248
Oh Nam-young is
a Gold Club member

83
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,375
Popular club in
the neighborhood

84
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,293
Ask him if you
can join the club

85
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,506
Do you really think
they'll let me in?

86
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,009
- Who knows?
- Nobody knows

87
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,305
Yeah,
I could join the club

88
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,848
Look!

89
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,311
Nam-young,
don't be a jerk

90
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,566
Hey Ki-young,
get lost

91
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,733
Are you crazy?

92
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,030
I have to
wash the mop

93
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,630
Seat down

94
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,507
Okay

95
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,806
Kang-jin?

96
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,726
When you're in
second grade

97
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,894
don't you know your
position in the school?

98
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,689
I don't think
Man-soo knows

99
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,151
You have to tell
him his position

100
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,238
Man-soo's cute

101
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,324
Also...

102
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:21,412
You did a good job
on the homework

103
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,707
Why didn't you do it
like that last time?

104
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,504
Friends should
help each other

105
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,174
We're friends

106
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,805
Good job

107
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,101
Since you did
a good job

108
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,605
you deserve
a reward

109
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,842
Wow!

110
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,221
- This stamp works well
- Nice work

111
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,306
Stamp looks good

112
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,142
I'll put a stamp
on you, too

113
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,438
- Is there a stamp for really good job?
- Give it to me

114
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,148
It's a compliment!

115
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,609
Come here

116
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,035
You look lonely

117
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,540
What is that stamp?

118
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,834
Good job?

119
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,754
Oh my...

120
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,925
Why did you come
to the school?

121
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,428
I came in because
you didn't come out

122
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,055
Nobody stopped me

123
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,307
I said hello to
the security guard

124
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,108
Did you see an
envelope at your house?

125
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,819
An envelope?

126
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,406
An envelope
like this

127
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,201
No, I didn't

128
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,299
Look at my eyes

129
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,343
Did you really not see it?

130
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,768
Damn,
where is it!

131
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,439
I never had this
kind of experience!

132
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,109
Look for the
envelope at home

133
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,408
Find it and
call me

134
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,745
Answer me

135
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:09,705
Yes

136
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,020
If you're in second grade,
you should know your position

137
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,107
You did a good job
on the homework

138
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,111
Friends should
help each other

139
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,906
You deserve a reward

140
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,581
Did you see an envelope
like this at home?

141
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,624
I must have forgotten
after putting it in my pocket

142
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,293
Oh, you forgot?

143
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,505
I'll buy it,
how much is it?

144
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,008
It's 200,000 Korean Won

145
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,844
Did you choose
what you wanted?

146
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,431
Is this all you need?

147
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,726
Yes

148
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,234
You could have told me
that your friend will pay for it

149
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,124
Excuse me

150
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,502
About the store...

151
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:04,880
What?

152
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,714
Did you buy cosmetics?

153
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,675
It was a gift

154
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,760
From Nam-young?

155
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,139
Yeah

156
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,402
How about a
game of baseball?

157
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,864
Let's play

158
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,041
It's a practice

159
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,625
Wait a minute

160
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,180
Isn't this our
school uniform?

161
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,811
It's just
regular clothes

162
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,314
No, it's definitely
our school uniform

163
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,946
How can you tell from
the poor video quality?

164
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,910
With the skirt wrinkles and angle,
it's definitely our school uniform

165
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,038
The guy looks
older than us

166
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,375
Is she meeting
this guy for money?

167
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,294
No way

168
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,213
What are you guys
talking about?

169
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,266
She looks pretty

170
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,185
Is it new?

171
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,145
It was a gift from you

172
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,746
Is there a boyfriend

173
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,790
other than me?

174
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,875
What are you talking about?

175
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,546
Who gave this to you?

176
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,424
You're really annoying

177
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,600
What did you say?

178
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,813
Kang-jin bought
it as a gift

179
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,190
Who?

180
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:12,943
Lee Kang-jin?

181
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,530
Kang-jin?

182
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,616
Damn it,
Kang-jin?

183
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,709
Hey

184
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,507
Kang-jin

185
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,969
He's really nice to you

186
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,389
I have to go

187
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,656
How can that
poor guy buy it?

188
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,452
He's parents working
in an other city

189
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,786
He must have
stole it

190
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,418
Did you see an
envelope in the house?

191
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,352
Last one!

192
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,784
What's wrong?

193
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,827
Didn't you leave the
jacket in the classroom?

194
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,543
What are you doing?

195
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,547
Are you doing this
because you think you'll lose?

196
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,098
(Man-soo)
"Hey, what are you doing? Are you crazy?"

197
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,020
Give it back

198
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,147
What?

199
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,817
It's not my money

200
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,944
Oh, that money

201
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,196
I know

202
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:22,948
What?

203
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,660
That scary-looking man
who came to our school

204
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,205
He's a loan shark, right?

205
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,333
Oh, Kang-jin

206
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,169
You surprised me

207
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,671
You're really brave

208
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,339
How did you hide it?

209
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,257
Give it back

210
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,383
You said it's
not your money

211
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,636
I was going
to report it

212
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,975
Then I should tell
that loan shark

213
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:57,733
That Kang-jin is living
happily with his money

214
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,829
If you want that
money back

215
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,958
Bring 500,000 Korean Won
by next week

216
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,960
Before I tell
that loan shark

217
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,237
I think this is the place

218
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:45,572
What?

219
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,742
- What do you mean?
- The envelope with the money

220
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,371
I already told you
I couldn't find it

221
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,123
Is that really true?

222
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,043
Yes, I couldn't find it

223
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,714
Kang-jin,
tell me the truth

224
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,592
Did you really
not find it?

225
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,682
Your look
really nervous

226
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,311
Come here,
what's wrong?

227
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,071
Where's my money?

228
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,156
That's...

229
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,245
You're brave
Kang-jin

230
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,126
Where's my money?

231
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,421
Answer me

232
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,714
Someone took it!

233
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:45,924
He took it from me!

234
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,315
Okay

235
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,443
Let's think it over

236
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:10,574
It's difficult to tell when
the customer will pay up

237
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:11,950
Customer?

238
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,578
Those who took my
money are customers

239
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,289
No job
No guarantee

240
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,460
We usually receive the
physical rights waiver

241
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,838
- Physical rights... waiver?
- Listen to me!

242
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,507
That's what
we normally do

243
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,342
But you and
I are friends

244
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,179
And the amount
is not big

245
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,521
How about
working for me?

246
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:47,527
What?

247
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,448
I'm still under
20 years old

248
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,075
Even middle school students
work to make money

249
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:58,872
You can go to the top
without hard work

250
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,584
I'll teach the skills,
so bring my money back

251
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,671
Or do you want to go with
the normal procedures?

252
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,467
You want me to
become a loan shark?

253
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,887
In Korea, a student can kill
someone and not go to prison

254
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,140
But how can I lend money...

255
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,643
Aren't you listening
to what I'm saying?

256
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,979
I'm going to help you

257
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,148
You're in this situation
because of money

258
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:29,069
I'll help you
make that money!

259
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,405
For people like you,
this is the only way to get rich

260
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,116
- But...
- There's no other way

261
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:49,756
The purpose is to tell others
that this man owes money

262
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,343
It's more effective when
there are many people

263
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,429
What will people think
when they see him?

264
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,225
How did he lend money
from a loan shark?

265
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,768
Don't you think so?

266
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:07,274
In Korea, those who lend
money are shameful

267
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,443
Step 1,
make him embarrassed

268
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:14,197
When one door of happiness closes,
another opens

269
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,409
But often we look so
long at the closed door

270
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,996
that we do not see the one
which has been opened for us

271
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:27,252
This is what Helen Keller
said about happiness

272
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,715
What is your condition
of happiness?

273
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:37,512
Is your happiness based
on the amount of money?

274
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:44,477
If so,
I can tell you clearly

275
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,148
that you're wrong

276
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,277
Instead of the condition of
happiness set by the world

277
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,406
you must have your own
condition of happiness

278
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:57,949
Also, you must find it

279
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,370
As Helen Keller said,
don't look at that closed door

280
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,208
Pay back the money!

281
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,547
People will begin
to avoid him

282
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:16,468
As the Korean society emphasizes
on human relationship

283
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,720
He will pay
back the money

284
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,181
What do you mean by
paying back the money?

285
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,225
You stole my money
from my jacket!

286
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,686
It's not my money,
it's the loan shark's money

287
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,440
You stole the
loan shark's money!

288
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,485
Why would I do that?

289
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,111
I think there's a
misunderstanding

290
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,698
You normally
don't talk like that!

291
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,952
- What?
- Why?

292
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,205
Are there too many
people watching?

293
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,166
Everyone knows
who you really are

294
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,211
Do you think you're
popular in the school?

295
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,214
That's because
your family's rich

296
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,215
Am I wrong?

297
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:59,094
Kim Ki-young,
answer me!

298
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,221
So shut up and
pay back my money!

299
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,972
Hey, Lee Kang-jin!

300
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,308
What do you think
you're doing?

301
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,894
Oh Nam-young
stole my money!

302
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,021
You!

303
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,858
Sir, I think Kang-jin
has a misunderstanding

304
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,073
You have to fill up
both sides of the paper

305
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,597
Step 2,
annoy other family member

306
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,732
Where did you
go yesterday?

307
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,191
I went to collect
my money

308
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,486
Someone else in the family
must pay back the money

309
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,658
Mr. Oh Sung-tae,
father of Oh Nam-young!

310
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,244
I came to collect
your son's debt!

311
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,877
What did you do to
Oh Nam-young?

312
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,297
I heard others talking,
and it's really serious

313
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,091
You should
go home early

314
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,926
Hey!

315
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:45,909
Let's go

316
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,611
Get up

317
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,074
Damn

318
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,912
Medley must be sang when
there's only 1 minute left

319
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,587
Pay back
the money

320
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,427
Wow,
I have no choice

321
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,680
I'll have to sing
another song

322
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,279
Immediate Loan - Daily Installment Loan
M.P. 010-348-4982

323
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,286
Didn't you hear
my presentation?

324
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,913
Oh, I understand

325
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,875
You messed up
my presentation

326
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,376
Listen carefully

327
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,381
Don't look at
that closed door

328
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,259
See the door of
happiness open to us

329
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,137
That's what
Helen Keller said

330
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,078
Damn it,
what is it?

331
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,375
Step 3,
punishment is a medicine

332
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,807
Since you're a student
deadline is until next Friday

333
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,268
Stealing and
hiding the money

334
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,480
and even compensation for lying

335
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,107
I'll just receive more
as much as you stole

336
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,735
I'm a honest person

337
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,335
That's a legal document
for our customer

338
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,505
that he received the information
and has no objections

339
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,342
If you pass the deadline,
10% will be added every week

340
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,929
Since 1 week has already passed
10% is already added

341
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,347
- That's correct
- You're right

342
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,559
Since I'm a honest businessman,
our annual interest rate is 100%

343
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,107
Maximum legal
interest rate is 20%

344
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,277
Students are
smart nowadays

345
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,035
But can't figure out
what's going on?

346
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,792
You know,
I'm a student

347
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,253
Can you really
deal with it?

348
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,673
He's only
19 years old

349
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,550
He's birthday is early,
so he's 18 years old

350
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,178
Students can fight, right?

351
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:35,680
Right?

352
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,727
Wow

353
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,573
A rich kid from
a rich family

354
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,909
So you did everything
you wanted

355
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,872
I'll call the police

356
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,708
That's a good idea

357
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,014
Hey!

358
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,644
How can you
hit him like that?

359
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,605
Should I call the police?

360
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,580
Let's see

361
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,388
What about the
original amount?

362
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,100
I brought the
exact amount

363
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,227
This is only
the interest

364
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,395
Weekly interest of 10%

365
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,314
You signed with
your thumbprint

366
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:10,775
Hey

367
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,320
You know
this is illegal

368
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,697
It doesn't have
any legal force

369
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,117
I'll visit your father's
company again

370
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:23,162
I'll have to talk more
about your debt

371
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,042
But since you paid the interest,
I'll have to reward you

372
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,087
Are you crazy?

373
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:41,889
Good job

374
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,528
How did you feel when
you collected the money?

375
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,780
Were you nervous
like before?

376
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,741
- No
- Exactly

377
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,077
Nothing is more
important than money

378
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,662
Money is power

379
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:07,874
What about the
original amount?

380
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,001
I'll receive it next week

381
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,676
- Keep it when you receive it
- What?

382
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,513
You earned it,
nothing is free

383
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:24,849
Thank you

384
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,351
Say thank you after
you collect the money

385
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,270
It's only yours after
you receive it

386
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,315
Yes

387
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,606
I have money

388
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,442
We can go
somewhere better

389
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,572
Our house is bankrupt

390
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,742
My dad's business got bankrupt
when I was in middle school

391
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,373
Really,
I didn't notice

392
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,669
People will avoid
me it they knew

393
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:39,799
Anyway, since our family
became poor

394
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,009
we never ate outside

395
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,805
and we never ate
dinner together

396
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,061
When I was in third grade,
I ate dinner here for the last time

397
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,733
Call me if you want
to go somewhere

398
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,987
But only in this place

399
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,513
- Come outside
- Give it to me here

400
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,115
It's not enough

401
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,534
What?

402
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:52,413
I said 20% for
2 weeks, right?

403
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,212
Lower your voice
in front of others

404
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,680
Damn it!

405
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,141
You idiot!

406
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,144
Do you think this
will go on forever?

407
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,646
Get real!

408
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,191
Don't overrate yourself

409
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,777
You can't even transfer
to another school

410
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,404
I have friends everywhere

411
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,239
Friends?

412
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,744
- What friends?
- What?

413
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,707
Are your friends scarier
than the loan shark?

414
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,127
I won't give you
a reward today

415
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,755
Do a good job!

416
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,027
- Did you check my message?
- Message?

417
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:07,655
I didn't know

418
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,365
Why?

419
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,244
I'm getting tired of
Lee Kang-jin

420
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,457
- So what?
- So what?

421
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,877
Where's your pride?

422
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,546
Aren't you embarrassed?

423
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,634
Why are you
cursing at me?

424
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,929
- What did you say?
- What are you going to do?

425
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,932
Are you going to fight the
loan shark and his gangsters?

426
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,226
This is because
you stole the money

427
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,979
Did you lose your mind?

428
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,482
Why did you steal the money?

429
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,900
Your family's rich

430
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:51,824
I think you should know
your position at school

431
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,935
Are you the student
Shin Da-young?

432
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,645
I'm sorry to
surprise you

433
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,857
I'm not a strange person
I'm a policeman

434
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,735
Do you know
Park Won-joon?

435
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,280
- 2 million Korean Won?
- Yes

436
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:35,743
I can close the case
with that money

437
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,662
I don't think it
a lot of money

438
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:40,498
Da-young?

439
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:46,879
Are you going to ruin your life
for that 2 million Korean Won?

440
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:53,636
Or the other option
that I talked about

441
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,930
Think about it

442
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,230
This is a letter from Park Won-joon
for settling this case

443
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,733
He requested 4 million
for settling the case

444
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,115
Read it and
think it over

445
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,555
Are you use
to it now?

446
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,978
Yes, but I'm not sure
whether this is right

447
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,399
Then you have to work
in your own field

448
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,317
Where?

449
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,571
In the school
where you belong

450
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,489
In the school?

451
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,741
Who will use private
loan at school?

452
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,077
High school students spend
more than college students

453
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,914
Where did they get the
money to buy all that?

454
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,834
They will be scared of
using private loan

455
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,211
You have to throw
out that prejudice

456
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,840
Just lend small money
that they need

457
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,843
Friends lend money and
receive interest, right?

458
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,178
It's the same thing

459
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,724
I'm not saying
this thoughtlessly

460
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,977
Look,
it's really cheap

461
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,396
I just need a little
bit more money

462
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,107
I saw a shoes that I wanted
but I couldn't buy it

463
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,818
I just got my allowance

464
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,862
and I just need
200,000 Korean Won

465
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,323
I can pay it back with my
next month's allowance

466
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,242
Kang-jin?

467
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,997
Your family should reunite
after paying back all the debt

468
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,499
You experiences it, right?

469
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:52,421
Your parents can't pay back
just by working in the factory

470
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,183
Everyone looks happy

471
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,061
They don't seem to
have any worries

472
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,398
Who doesn't have worries?

473
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,777
They just pretend that
they don't have any worries

474
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,908
Or they don't know
that they have worries

475
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,922
- Kang-jin?
- Yes?

476
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:42,388
How did you put up with
Nam-young's bullying?

477
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,108
I'm just...

478
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:59,154
curious about how you
put up with his bullying

479
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,913
What's going on?

480
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,211
If I can help,
I'll help

481
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,468
We went to elementary
school together

482
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,646
You should say something

483
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,982
Why don't
you say it?

484
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,156
Stop whispering
and say it!

485
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,870
I'm actually worried

486
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,289
I'm worried, too

487
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,541
About what?

488
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,171
About what
you said earlier

489
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:01,717
Doing business with
high school students

490
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:07,848
How can we do business with
students taking money from others

491
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:12,269
I think it's inappropriate
for students

492
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,146
You guys are
really frustrating

493
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,982
Am I doing this
for charity?

494
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,612
When students use private loan,
what will the parents think?

495
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,407
The money comes
from the parents

496
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,244
Oh!

497
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,835
Let Kang-jin experience
this business

498
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,838
He will be doing it even
if we don't force him to

499
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,717
- You're right, sir
- But...

500
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,095
will he do this
kind of job?

501
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,431
He wasn't born
to do this job

502
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,935
You and I weren't
born to do this job

503
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,605
Let's see if he
comes or not

504
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,947
Students who are
tired of studying

505
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,118
we will fill their heart
with private loan

506
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:11,870
Wow!

507
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,915
Isn't it beautiful?

508
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,544
That's not money,
it's love

509
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,174
Follow those guys to
learn the business

510
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,176
It may look easy,
but you have to learn

511
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,136
Each person has
different personality

512
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,430
We need a
customized system

513
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:34,059
Your friend who threatened
to call the police

514
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,645
- Oh Nam-young
- Yes, he's a beginner

515
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,147
Let's move on to the
advanced lesson

516
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,567
We have to
make progress

517
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,193
Of course

518
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:09,636
Is this enough?

519
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,602
Good job

520
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,739
How can you
have a girlfriend?

521
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,701
Isn't that Lee Kang-jin?

522
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,369
What's he doing there?

523
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,707
Kang-jin and I put up
with him for a long time

524
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,003
From when did he have
ties to those people?

525
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,379
Ties?

526
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,884
I heard his parents had
ties with those people

527
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,845
Is Oh Nam-young
going to study abroad?

528
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,973
It's difficult to go
abroad on third grade

529
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,560
I think he'll lay low from
the embarrassment

530
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,146
and look for a chance
to come out again

531
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,316
Shut up
you guys!

532
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:06,944
Did you have
a good sleep?

533
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:15,410
I can't say
whatever I want

534
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,081
Why are you interfering?

535
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,040
What?

536
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,876
What did you say?

537
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,506
What's wrong?

538
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,469
What are you going
to do about it?

539
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,472
Damn it

540
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,207
Are you crazy?

541
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,584
What is this?

542
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,130
Did you go
through my stuff?

543
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,590
Stop it!

544
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,176
I'll report you
as a stalker

545
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,971
You're not this kind of girl

546
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,808
- Stop it and come back...
- Who cares!

547
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,686
It's none of your business!

548
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,647
Do you think
you're my friend?

549
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,524
Don't get it wrong

550
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,609
You're disgusting

551
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,712
You have to eat
or you'll get sick

552
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,056
How long are you
going to do this?

553
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,642
You'll never see them
after high school

554
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,811
You're making
things worse

555
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:11,485
- We have to go to college
- Hey

556
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,654
Leave me alone

557
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,078
I'll get expelled from
school anyway

558
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,459
I already submitted
all the homework

559
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,504
So come back
to school

560
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,072
Let's start with
Kang Byung-koo in Class 3

561
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,918
He's trying to buy a
motorcycle from a website

562
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:13,255
but he's short on money
to lend from others

563
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:17,801
He also has many friends
riding on a motorcycle

564
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,137
What does it mean?

565
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,807
If we persuade him,
we can attract many customers

566
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,684
I heard from Man-soo

567
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,019
that you're working
for a gangster

568
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,438
It's not a gangster

569
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,066
Hurry up

570
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,820
I'm just helping someone

571
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,406
I heard Oh Nam-young
got humiliated

572
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,658
I'm his friend

573
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,577
How can I trust you?

574
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,334
You have to trust
the money, not him

575
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,378
How much can
you lend me?

576
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,546
How much
do you need?

577
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:56,798
About 1 million Korean Won?

578
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,967
1 million Korean Won?

579
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:01,887
Okay

580
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,060
What is this?

581
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:13,106
Since we're students,
you need a guarantee

582
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,984
Take one of your parents' ID
and send it to us

583
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,446
- What?
- If you don't like it...

584
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:23,200
- All right
- Great

585
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,497
Your thumbprint here

586
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,194
What's this message?

587
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,404
Let's go and see

588
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,399
Hello?

589
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,362
Yes,
you can come now

590
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,823
I heard someone's
helping him

591
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,075
Do you really believe that?

592
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,704
- How about the money?
- Maybe he's rich

593
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,081
It's just petty cash

594
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:58,795
Hey guys
come here!

595
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,882
It's cold, right?

596
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,884
Come near the fire

597
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:10,807
Nice to meet
you guys!

598
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,145
Kneel down
idiots!

599
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,964
- Did you hear the news?
- What news?

600
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,301
About the
new members

601
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:50,513
- What about them?
- I've never heard about them

602
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,308
We can't let
everyone in our club

603
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:57,687
The new member
organized this event

604
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,357
It doesn't
mean anything

605
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,444
- I'll pay for it next time
- That's your parent's money

606
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,071
Those new members...

607
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:07,906
Look

608
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,010
What is it?

609
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,389
You look better

610
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,474
Why didn't you
do it earlier?

611
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,192
- Thank you
- What?

612
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,611
About helping me
last time

613
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,117
You have to pay back
it's not free

614
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,911
Of course
I'll pay back

615
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:47,505
But Lee Kang-jin Loan
sounds stupid

616
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,848
- Don't be surprised
- About what?

617
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,230
- Hello sir!
- Yes

618
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:08,359
Come here
and sit down

619
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,992
I don't think you
came as a teacher

620
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,787
I should cut
my credit card

621
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,248
It's difficult to use
several credit cards

622
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,837
I'll lower the interest
if you introduce others

623
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:30,673
How much?

624
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:35,470
- Lower than the major banks
- Really?

625
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,264
I really appreciate it!

626
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:42,602
There are other teachers in the
school who'll lend the money

627
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,188
I know several teachers

628
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:50,068
Everyone's getting a loan
because it's difficult

629
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,695
The banks don't
lend money to us

630
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:06,668
Out of curiosity

631
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,587
if I pass the deadline

632
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:15,009
will gangsters come to
the school to threaten me?

633
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,266
There will be no problem
if you pay on time

634
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,445
What's up with
your face and clothes?

635
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,496
Get out if you came
to start a fight

636
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,333
I'm sorry about
last time

637
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,338
Lee Kang-jin came to
the Gold Club

638
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:54,882
What?

639
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,304
They probably need
the money, too

640
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,599
Even if they're rich
they still receive allowances

641
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,477
If we leave
him like this

642
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,814
he'll take over
the neighborhood

643
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,076
How many people
used his loan?

644
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,330
Everyone from the
Gold Club and neighborhood

645
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,291
At first, they were happy
to receive the money

646
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,960
but now, some can't even
pay the late interest

647
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:35,006
Lee Kang-jin,
he's a loan shark now

648
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,843
Do you think
that's important?

649
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,140
If you don't come to
school next week

650
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,975
there's nothing
we can do

651
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,519
Don't worry

652
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,648
Now I'm ready to
return to school

653
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,529
You surprised me!

654
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:01,574
What is it?

655
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,119
I have something to
say to Lee Kang-jin

656
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,205
But I can't find
that idiot

657
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,751
Why are you asking me
about Kang-jin?

658
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,254
- I don't take orders from him
- Are you sure?

659
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,465
That's what everyone
thinks about you

660
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:24,013
- Who said that?
- Why are you mad?

661
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,307
If it's not true
that's fine

662
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,395
Hi
Man-soo?

663
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,151
It's been a long time

664
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,536
- Man-soo?
- Yeah?

665
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,708
How much do you get
from working for Kang-jin?

666
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,129
I'm not working for him
I'm his strategic partner

667
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,965
We divide shares

668
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,591
Don't lie to me

669
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,845
How do you know he's
really dividing the shares?

670
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:09,517
Doesn't he go to meet
the loan shark alone?

671
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,980
I don't think you're
getting enough money

672
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,982
He's probably making
all the money

673
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,570
- He's lying to you
- He's really something

674
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,239
Giving debt to
everyone at school

675
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:24,365
Damn

676
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,745
I should have known
that loan shark first

677
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,413
What a shame

678
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,915
I envy you
Man-soo

679
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,463
Making easy money and
gangsters supporting him

680
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:44,677
Kang-jin!

681
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,013
Let's go have lunch

682
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,810
I slept late
counting money

683
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,313
You have to
eat something

684
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,985
Get me some bread

685
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,571
Can't you see
I'm sleeping?

686
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,133
Hey
Lee Dong-hae

687
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,304
Hey!

688
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,685
Get me some
bread and milk

689
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,230
What?

690
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,984
Go and get me some
bread and milk

691
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,587
What are you saying?

692
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,841
I'll help you

693
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,635
(Hee-won)
"Settle it first with this money"

694
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,558
Let's become
friends again

695
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,188
You're really disgusting

696
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,693
Don't talk to me again

697
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,576
Hee-won
what are you doing?

698
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,961
- Hey!
- Stay still

699
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,005
Crazy girl

700
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,215
Give it back!

701
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:50,177
- She's strong
- Please!

702
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,054
What are you saying?

703
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,142
Look at this

704
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,362
Damn it

705
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,745
Oh, so many people

706
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:25,046
Give me some
more time to pay back

707
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,592
Hey!

708
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:35,056
- Are we charity like UNICEF?
- No

709
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,351
You said that
you needed money

710
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,938
Do you think
I'm that easy?

711
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:49,820
- Damn it
- I think he can understand

712
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:00,456
Hey!

713
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,708
It's been a long time
Oh Nam-young

714
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:07,713
How have you been?

715
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,133
I needed the money

716
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:14,011
but it's frustrating
to pay it back

717
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,472
How many people lend
the money in your school?

718
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,808
Almost everybody

719
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,396
What if you don't
pay it back?

720
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,315
Damn, I don't want
to get beat up

721
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,444
I think
there's a way

722
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,032
It's not enough

723
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:39,203
- What's the problem?
- He'll pay tomorrow

724
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,707
But the deadline
is today

725
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,502
I cut him some slack
because he's my friend

726
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,756
This is business
don't get personal!

727
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,759
He said
he'll pay tomorrow

728
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,888
Hey, we're not lending
money for game money!

729
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,308
Collect the money today!

730
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,688
Are you losing your mind?

731
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:31,881
- You want me to divide areas?
- Yes

732
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:36,010
Since we're covering
too much area

733
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,095
it's difficult for Kang-jin
to care alone

734
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:41,182
We can't refuse
the customers

735
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:46,812
It's more efficient
to divide areas

736
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,817
I think it can
save his trouble

737
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:53,861
You're a traitor

738
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,322
What?

739
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,576
Are you trying
to trick me?

740
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:05,039
You just want to
make more money

741
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:09,293
I'm just worried about
Kang-jin as a friend

742
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:11,128
I'm worried about you

743
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:14,590
- Hold on tight, it's going to hurt
- I'm just his friend

744
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:21,931
- You can get hurt
- You're right!

745
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:25,810
- What's right?
- What you said is right

746
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,230
I wanted to make
more money

747
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,731
It's the truth

748
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,567
You know...

749
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,613
I hate people
who betray friendship

750
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,158
- I'm sorry
- But...

751
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:45,079
I really hate people acting like
a gentleman in front of money

752
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,706
- Do you understand?
- Yes

753
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,208
Sit down

754
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,881
- Me?
- Let's talk business

755
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,474
- Explain it to me
- Yes

756
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,145
Kang-jin can take care of
Geumwha High School

757
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:20,239
I have a good idea for
not paying back the money

758
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,158
Will you trust us?

759
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,580
- Really?
- We don't need to pay back?

760
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:34,712
- I told you to believe me!
- I'm so excited!

761
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,505
I'm not going to
pay back the debt!

762
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:54,106
Hey, what's this?

763
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,359
It's exactly what it says
in the message

764
01:09:58,861 --> 01:09:59,403
What?

765
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,198
It's difficult for you to
take care of everything

766
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,367
You looked tired

767
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:09,079
I told him so you can
work more easily

768
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,040
I'm really disappointed

769
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:14,293
I thought you were
going to thank me

770
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,719
What is this?

771
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:28,557
He's crazy

772
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:33,938
Kang-jin
what's up?

773
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,985
It was the boss's order,
what can I do?

774
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:43,405
If you guys have problems,
solve it by yourself

775
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:44,657
Hello?

776
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,534
Damn it!

777
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,957
- Were you still here?
- Yes

778
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,376
Sorry, I'm in a hurry
I'll call you

779
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:03,467
This is so easy

780
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:05,803
Everyone's so cooperative
because they don't have to pay back

781
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:10,975
Do you think the loan shark
will let it go by?

782
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,361
- How much are we short?
- About 50%

783
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,697
What should we do?

784
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,283
We have to
tell the boss

785
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,118
Will he understand?

786
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:30,911
Since it's our first time
maybe he will forgive us

787
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,707
- Start calling!
- Okay

788
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,920
I have something
to tell you

789
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:45,509
Can you postpone
this settlement?

790
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:48,012
I have some problem,
but I can solve it

791
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:48,762
Are you crazy?

792
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,723
Are you really crazy?

793
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,727
- What?
- Who said you can postpone?

794
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:58,397
- That's not the reason
- Are you crazy?

795
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,109
I'll calculate the
interest from tomorrow

796
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,111
so bring me that money quickly
or you'll be in trouble

797
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:07,614
I think you're
misunderstanding something

798
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:10,409
You're the debtor
and I'm the creditor

799
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:12,286
Never forget that

800
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,413
That's not
what I meant

801
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:17,708
Shut your mouth!

802
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,961
A student in a
private loan business?

803
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,297
You need a better
lie than that

804
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,965
It's the truth

805
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,885
- Believe me, stupid
- Stupid?

806
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:32,890
- Do you know where you are now?
- There's a Lee Kag-jin Loan!

807
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:35,726
The world is
coming to an end

808
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:39,229
Young students
crazy about money

809
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,691
What are you trying to be
when you grow up?

810
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,736
Ouch!
I'll walk by myself!

811
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:47,946
Another high school student?

812
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,157
Is this a high school
reunion?

813
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,576
- I don't know
- Hey! Sit here

814
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:56,205
- Go and sit there
- Sit down

815
01:12:57,581 --> 01:13:00,918
Don't play around,
let's finish this quickly

816
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:05,005
How can you take
money from others?

817
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,508
I'll get in big trouble if
I can't pay back the private loan

818
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,302
Private loan?

819
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,471
It's called
Lee Kang-jin Loan

820
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:13,972
What's Lee Kang-jin Loan?

821
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,017
Officer, don't you
know Lee Kang-jin?

822
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:22,815
Lee Kang-jin from
Geumwha High School

823
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,442
He lends private loan
to other students

824
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,113
Private loan by a
high school student?

825
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,155
I'm telling the truth!

826
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:34,243
He's just a
normal student

827
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,123
but there's a loan shark and
gangsters helping him

828
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,378
You still can't
trust me?

829
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,256
I'll show you proof

830
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:51,427
Look

831
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,980
From what's going on,
it's time to get started

832
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,107
Collect 5 million
per person

833
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,278
But we already collected
most of the money

834
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:12,614
Do you think the parents will
let their child get in trouble?

835
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:13,407
You're right

836
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:16,785
Speed is
most important

837
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,579
Go and collect
the money quickly

838
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,706
- I understand
- Yes, boss

839
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:32,384
Who is it?

840
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,846
Your son borrowed money
and didn't pay back

841
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,142
What are you
talking about?

842
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:43,312
This is a bond of debt,
and you have to pay 5 million

843
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:48,150
How can 500,000
become 5 million?

844
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,110
Damn it!

845
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:54,740
All he needed to do was
kick the ball into the net!

846
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,743
I already paid it to
Lee Kang-jin

847
01:14:58,076 --> 01:14:59,036
To Kang-jin?

848
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:02,956
Why did you pay
our money to Kang-jin?

849
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:15,010
- The bond of debt
- Thank you

850
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:16,887
- Is it right
- Yes

851
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:19,515
Thank you
Let's go

852
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,584
- Hey, Lee Dong-hae
- What?

853
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,546
- You owe me, right
- Yeah

854
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:52,965
Pay me now

855
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:58,720
- It's until next month
- It's urgent!

856
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:04,351
- I'll give you a discount
- I don't have it now

857
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:07,604
Just give it to me!

858
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:09,731
I don't have it now!

859
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,774
Kang-jin

860
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,777
Do you really have to do
that to your classmate?

861
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:15,988
Are you a loan shark?

862
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:17,739
Wake up

863
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:25,080
I'll give you
more discount

864
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:29,376
- You're going too far
- What?

865
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:31,461
I don't need to
pay now

866
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:32,796
Are you a
loan shark?

867
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,256
Do I look like
a pushover?

868
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,174
Damn you!

869
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,428
What's with that
attitude now?

870
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:42,055
You're the one
who needed the money

871
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:45,434
Do you know what happens
if you can't pay back?

872
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,814
Kang-jin
what are you doing?

873
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,858
We're just talking

874
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,610
It's none of
your business

875
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,619
What should
we do about this?

876
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:07,497
Da-young is stealing, and
her boyfriend is lending private loan

877
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:10,208
It's not easy

878
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,711
We have to
solve this case

879
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:18,008
We have to send to
the prosecutor's office

880
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:22,596
I can't help you
at that point

881
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:24,890
Da-young?

882
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,818
You shouldn't
think too much

883
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:57,422
It's been a
long time, Rang!

884
01:17:58,048 --> 01:17:58,924
How's business?

885
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:03,637
I heard you're making
money out of students

886
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,305
Are you that desperate?

887
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:10,686
It's none of
my business

888
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:15,107
You need to lay low
for 2~3 weeks

889
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,694
I'll clean the
mess up nicely

890
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:22,489
You know
who I am

891
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:25,367
I'll make sure
you won't get into trouble

892
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,285
As long as
you pay up

893
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,663
What's happening?

894
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:32,040
- Nobody's answering!
- Damn it

895
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:36,545
Are you trying to
hide by yourself?

896
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:39,381
- Who is it?
- Everyone

897
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,718
You really
didn't know?

898
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:47,055
For those
who already paid

899
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,890
Rang threatened the parents
to collect 5 million

900
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,851
You've been exploited

901
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,068
Hey,
Shin Da-young!

902
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,499
So this is the palace
of our princess?

903
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,127
- It's impressive
- I'm disappointed

904
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:20,172
You've been acting
proud all that time

905
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:22,549
but you were talking
behind our back

906
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:27,179
Why didn't you say that
you needed a guy?

907
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:28,305
Are you having fun?

908
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,975
Playing detective?

909
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,772
I forgot to
show you this

910
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,824
It's so difficult to
see my girlfriend

911
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:59,544
Why are you talking
so mean to her?

912
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:05,634
Da-young?

913
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,596
I think there was
a misunderstanding

914
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,224
What misunderstanding?

915
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:15,811
Why am I
your girlfriend?

916
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:27,322
Stop being
such a jerk

917
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,658
Do you really
like her that much?

918
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:39,125
What?

919
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:41,503
A jerk?

920
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,133
Are you crazy?

921
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:52,973
Do you think
we're friends?

922
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:03,275
This is what happens
if you're nice to pitiful girls

923
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:05,902
- I'm sick and tired
- Hey

924
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,533
- Don't go
- You slut!

925
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,246
Get lost!

926
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:33,897
I'll just turn
myself in

927
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,930
(Detective Choi)
"What? Da-young, you..."

928
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,477
I'll receive the
punishment for my crime

929
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,816
I just stole the money

930
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:50,389
I have the name and number
of those who I stole from

931
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:55,702
(Detective Choi suddenly
becomes angry and cursing)

932
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,292
Also, my conversation
with you

933
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:06,796
it's all recorded

934
01:22:06,813 --> 01:22:09,149
(Detective Choi)
"What? Wait a minute... Hey!"

935
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,850
It's all finished

936
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,146
Kang-jin?

937
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,860
- Damn it
- So pathetic

938
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,910
How was that short
feeling of being rich?

939
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:39,746
Was it you?

940
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:47,671
Acting smart
all by yourself

941
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,172
and now you knew it?

942
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:54,844
It's not easy to
become a leader!

943
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,807
You should have
listened to me

944
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:02,310
Let's go back to Kang-jin
who did my homework

945
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:10,694
Get on!

946
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,156
- Get them!
- Move!

947
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:36,886
Thank you

948
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:42,392
Why did you call me?

949
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:46,312
- Don't you know?
- About what?

950
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,982
Once a betrayer,
always a betrayer

951
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:50,650
You're ignored
me first

952
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:52,444
What?

953
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,072
Damn it!

954
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,159
This is all because
you ignored me

955
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:00,785
Stop it!

956
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:02,287
Does that matter
right now?

957
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:13,882
What about your side?

958
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:16,718
They're not
answering my calls

959
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,472
That bastard
is hiding

960
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,559
It's all because
of Oh Nam-young

961
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:26,019
Bastard!

962
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:28,813
I ruined it all

963
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:31,107
It's better that way

964
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,610
What are you
talking about?

965
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:36,071
How long were you planning
to do the business?

966
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,294
We're in trouble
get on the bike!

967
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:57,842
Just run!

968
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:10,230
(Myung-hwan)
"Who is this?"

969
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:12,899
Hey, come here!

970
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,990
- Damn it!
- Go find the rest!

971
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:35,505
Hey!

972
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:39,717
Come on!

973
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:55,441
Damn it!

974
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,113
You can't
catch Kang-jin

975
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:01,698
Idiots

976
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:04,325
Stop talking
stupid!

977
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:22,719
What's wrong?

978
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:25,013
I think we're
in trouble

979
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:33,813
Man-soo!

980
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:41,905
Hey
Man-soo!

981
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:44,282
Man-soo!

982
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:09,265
Should we go
to the police?

983
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:14,479
What?

984
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:20,568
Have you ever heard
about conditional sex?

985
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:27,408
I was caught doing
conditional sex

986
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:30,578
and the detective
came to our house

987
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:37,543
Unfortunately
I met a bad guy

988
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:47,679
But I didn't actually
have sex with them

989
01:27:49,722 --> 01:27:52,475
I just stole the money
from their wallet

990
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,396
It is a crime

991
01:27:58,940 --> 01:27:59,899
Is that a crime?

992
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:05,071
You punished
bad guys

993
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,077
Look at
what I did

994
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,634
It's going to be late,
you should go home first

995
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:30,888
Do you want me
by your side?

996
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,979
Man-soo's parents
will be here soon

997
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:41,941
Go home

998
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,280
All right

999
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:51,617
Good-bye

1000
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:10,303
I don't want to give it
to Detective Choi

1001
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:16,559
Who's calling?

1002
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:20,980
Did he hear
what I said?

1003
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:26,486
- Yes, Detective
- Are you busy?

1004
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:30,615
What's with the hurry,
Detective?

1005
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:35,703
I was just counting
your share

1006
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:38,164
No, I need you
to do a favor

1007
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:41,709
What favor?

1008
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:43,795
Lee Kang-jin's girlfriend
Shin Da-young

1009
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,505
she's threatening me

1010
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:48,674
So if I solve your problem,
you will solve mine, right?

1011
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:50,176
What happened?

1012
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:53,262
- Let's have a drink soon
- Sure

1013
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:55,473
I'll make the preparations

1014
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,517
Yes,
Bye

1015
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:01,229
Idiot

1016
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:05,066
Okay

1017
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:21,833
(Message from Nam-young)
"Loan Shark is at Da-young's house"

1018
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,382
(Bbakga)
"Boss, what should we do?"

1019
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:32,510
Your phone

1020
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,636
Yes, Boss

1021
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:38,307
How dare you!

1022
01:30:41,727 --> 01:30:42,979
Here it is, Boss

1023
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:47,692
This smartphone
is a problem

1024
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:49,360
You can do
everything with this

1025
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,821
You can't say
whatever you want

1026
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:13,968
(Message to Hee-won) "There are gangsters
at Shin Da-young's house"

1027
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,182
You guys are
all in trouble

1028
01:31:26,772 --> 01:31:29,526
(from Nam-young) "There are gangster
at Shin Da-young's house"

1029

(Background:
Da-young & Hee-won's Photo)

1030
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,161
Da-young!

1031
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:42,038
Da-young!

1032
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:45,583
He'll break
the door

1033
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,212
Are you Iron Man?

1034
01:31:52,548 --> 01:31:54,008
Kang-jin!

1035
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:01,724
You stupid!

1036
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,081
Kang-jin, are you all right?

1037
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:27,875
Kang-jin

1038
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:31,879
Why are you doing
this to Da-young?

1039
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:35,883
- Just harass me!
- Harass who?

1040
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,553
Do you think
I have a lot of time?

1041
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:41,931
You two made
things worse

1042
01:32:42,473 --> 01:32:46,435
All you needed to do was
sleep with Detective Choi

1043
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:49,313
Our business
is finished, right?

1044
01:32:50,856 --> 01:32:54,235
I made some money
thanks to you

1045
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,404
You traitor!

1046
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:02,493
Kang-jin

1047
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:05,288
This is how you
make money

1048
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:07,081
You can't
earn it honestly

1049
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:11,711
It was you guys
who needed the money

1050
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:14,505
You bastard

1051
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:19,176
Do you really
want to die!

1052
01:33:28,477 --> 01:33:29,979
Who are you?

1053
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,319
- Boss?
- Knife!

1054
01:33:37,236 --> 01:33:39,947
Boss is bleeding,
call the ambulance!

1055
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:44,410
We don't have time!

1056

"Da-young, get up"

(Kang-jin)
"Da-young, we have to go"

1058
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:49,832
Call the ambulance!

1059
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:53,502
- Ambulance!
- Blood!

1060
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:19,278
You two made
things worse

1061
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:24,075
All you needed to do was
sleep with Detective Choi

Our business
is finished, right?

1063
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:30,498
I made some money
thanks to you

1064
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:32,917
Kang-jin

1065
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:36,420
This is how you
make money

1066
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:38,255
You can't
earn it honestly

1067
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,045
It's really boring

1068
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,809
Nam-young
let's start

1069
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:42,987
What do
you think

1070
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:48,617
happiness is?

1071
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:00,296
What are you doing?

1072
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,381
What is it?

1073
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,759
Isn't it Nam-young
and Shin-ji?

1074
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,676
What are you doing?

1075
01:36:05,725 --> 01:36:06,819
(Female Students)
"Nam-young wasn't dating Da-young?"

1076
01:36:06,918 --> 01:36:09,170
- It's Nam-young and Shin-ji
- Big news!

1077
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:28,282
What's wrong?

1078
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:30,910
- What is it?
- Is that Shin-ji?

1079
01:36:31,076 --> 01:36:33,662
Hey, it's Shin-ji!

1080
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:35,706
It's raining!

1081
01:37:15,287 --> 01:37:17,414
The ocean reminds me
of my childhood

1082
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,751
What was
your dream?

1083
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,713
President

1084
01:37:35,307 --> 01:37:36,016
Why are you laughing?

1085
01:37:37,893 --> 01:37:40,521
- That was your dream, too
- You're right

1086
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,990
I thought I would really
become a president

1087
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:55,870
But now...

1088
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,667
I don't think I can
graduate high school

1089
01:38:21,478 --> 01:38:23,647
Do you think
we can go back?

1090
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:56,258
(Epilogue)

1091
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:09,480
I'll do a good job

1092
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:12,983
Spit out the gum
before you answer

1093
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:18,781
I'll do a good job
