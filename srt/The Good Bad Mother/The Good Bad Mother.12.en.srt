00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,564
WOOBYEOK'S LEAP FORWARD
BEASTS' VICTORY

3
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,442
Look who it is.

4
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,361
EPISODE 12

5
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,409
Did you watch the news?

6
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,410
The news?

7
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,872
Hang on a second.

8
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,626
Are you here

9
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,420
to talk about Hwang Soo-hyun?

10
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,131
So that's why you're here.

11
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,967
I thought you
never wanted to see me again.

12
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,136
This is no time to be so casual.

13
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,139
Even her bereaved family member
is so nonchalant.

14
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,308
-So why shouldn't I be?
-"Bereaved family"?

15
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,603
She was your son's mother.
That makes you her family.

16
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,146
Are you serious right now?

17
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,398
You're the one who started it!

18
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,612
If the police
start investigating this case,

19
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,405
both you and I will be done for.

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,450
Let's end this

21
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,871
by making Kang-ho the baby's father.

22
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,623
But of course,

23
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,460
we'll have to take care of him
before that.

24
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,172
That's right.

25
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,552
This is how a president
should manage his affairs.

26
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,553
Right.

27
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,516
Sometimes, you have to appease the masses

28
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,519
and sometimes, you have to
sacrifice some for the greater good.

29
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,731
A man like you should be the president.

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,483
But then,

31
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,318
Hwang Soo-hyun appears out of nowhere.

32
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,737
What a shame.

33
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,822
Right?

34
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,823
Mr. Song!

35
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,328
Did you have that much fun with her?

36
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,041
You son of a bitch!

37
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,627
Do I look like a pushover
because I worked with you?

38
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,212
Did I have fun with her?

39
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,839
Do you have proof?

40
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,132
Because I do!

41
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,010
I have proof that you killed Choi Hae-sik!

42
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,888
I have proof of all the dirty deeds
you committed

43
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,432
to turn Yongra Construction
into Woobyeok Group!

44
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,226
I also have proof that
you ordered Choi Kang-ho

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,645
to kill Hwang Soo-hyun
just to have something on me!

46
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,355
Do you get it?

47
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,086
As of today,

48
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,256
I'm cutting ties with Dosang Group.

49
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,092
This country will protect

50
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,428
Woobyeok Group from now on.

51
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,440
There are so many boats.

52
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:57,111
Wouldn't it be so beautiful
to see all of them floating out there?

53
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,822
They'd look like Christmas lights.

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,533
Come on.

55
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,328
You've been checking your phone
all day today.

56
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,829
Are you expecting a call?

57
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,830
No.

58
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,834
You must be cold. Come here.

59
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,169
It's okay.

60
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,879
You need it. Put it back on.

61
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,840
Listen to your guardian.

62
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,217
Gosh, you're scary.

63
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,345
Okay, Mr. Guardian.

64
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,055
All right.

65
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,100
Here you go.

66
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,310
-Kang-ho.
-Yes?

67
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,564
Look at the name of that boat.

68
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,525
It's my name.

69
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,568
-It's my name, Mom.
-No way.

70
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,821
It's "Choikangho."

71
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,866
Stand next to it. I'll take a photo.

72
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,034
A photo?

73
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,956
Say "piggy" on the count of three.

74
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:50,957
Piggy.

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,167
One, two, three.

76
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,669
Piggy.

77
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,005
That looks great.

78
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,132
-Take one of me too.
-Okay.

79
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,801
Unbelievable.

80
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,012
All right.

81
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,936
Hwang Soo-hyun.

82
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,396
What did you say?

83
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:15,982
What?

84
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
It's nothing.

85
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,819
I'll take it now.

86
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,031
One, two, three.

87
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,699
Piggy.

88
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,538
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

89
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,383
Hello?

90
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,094
What?

91
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,098
There's smoke coming from the farm?

92
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,434
Yes, okay.

93
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,728
Yes, I'll check now.

94
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,774
Kang-ho.

95
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,068
Kang-ho, wake up.

96
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,778
There's smoke coming from the farm.

97
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,205
Kang-ho…

98
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,832
Shouldn't we call 911

99
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,001
if the farm is on fire?

100
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,462
It could be a prank call,
so let's check first.

101
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,546
Can you open the gate?

102
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,757
Kang-ho!

103
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,967
Kang-ho!

104
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,766
Kang-ho!

105
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,860
Kang-ho.

106
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,614
A fire?

107
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,825
Their farm is on fire?

108
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,119
Wait. Kang-ho.

109
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,079
-Kang-ho!
-No, Sam-sik!

110
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,997
What is it?

111
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,999
What's the matter?

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,377
Is Sam-sik home?

113
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,088
I don't think so.

114
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,798
I had a nightmare.

115
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,008
Goodness. What did he do this time?

116
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,219
-Goodness.
-What's wrong?

117
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,972
Did you dream that
he stole something again?

118
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,350
Where are you going?

119
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,978
You don't think he reported it, right?

120
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,564
Of course not. He lost the evidence.

121
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,608
If anything, he'd be accused
of threatening Oh Ha-young.

122
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,446
Do you think he's onto us?

123
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,030
That's why he ran away.

124
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,700
We must get him
before things get out of hand.

125
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,742
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,578
Kang-ho!

127
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,289
Kang-ho!

128
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,666
Wait. Isn't that Bang Sam-sik?

129
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,209
Get him!

130
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,296
SAM-SIK'S MILL

131
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,425
What did they just say?

132
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,051
"Threatened"? "Ran away"?

133
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,512
They couldn't have been talking
about our son, right?

134
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,307
What did that damn punk do this time?

135
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,433
Goodness.

136
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,351
That damn punk!

137
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,936
Wait for me!

138
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,567
What's going on?

139
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,236
Fire!

140
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,404
What do I do?

141
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,697
Fire!

142
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,492
Who the hell are you?

143
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,869
Did you do this?

144
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,123
Who are you?

145
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,167
-Who the hell are you?
-What's going on?

146
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,045
Damn it.

147
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,589
Hey, get them!

148
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,049
-We need to catch them!
-Help…

149
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,384
Help me…

150
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,886
-Who is that?
-What's going on?

151
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,179
-Is that a fire?
-A fire?

152
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,098
-Fire!
-Fire!

153
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,099
What?

154
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,309
Isn't that Sam-sik?

155
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,354
-Sam-sik! Goodness!
-Sam-sik!

156
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,688
Goodness, Sam-sik!

157
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,107
What do we do? There's a fire!

158
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,776
Call 911!

159
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,402
-Right, 911!
-Goodness, Sam-sik.

160
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,654
-Call 911.
-Goodness, Sam-sik.

161
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,197
What's going on? Sam-sik!

162
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,241
-Get up!
-Fire!

163
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,951
There's a fire!

164
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,120
You guys are such a loving couple.

165
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,044
Were you guys having a late-night date?

166
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,254
How romantic.

167
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,422
Romantic, my foot.

168
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,510
We were tossing and turning in bed,
so we decided to get some fresh air.

169
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,221
In this cold weather?

170
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,056
It's -10°C tonight.

171
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,811
It's already past
the season to make kimchi.

172
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,813
Why do you have all this garlic?

173
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,940
I heard black garlic is good
for your stomach,

174
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,233
so I'm going to make some.

175
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,820
For whom? Does someone have a bad stomach?

176
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,533
Look, Mr. Son.

177
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,077
Actually…

178
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,249
She just wants to
take good care of her health.

179
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,334
Black garlic is good for you.

180
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,672
Could you give us some too?

181
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,173
Sure.

182
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,676
But why? Do you guys
have a bad stomach too?

183
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,845
Our stomachs are fine,
but his area down there…

184
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,096
What?

185
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,266
It says that black garlic is good for men.

186
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,311
He may look fine, but he's very weak.

187
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,646
You darn woman.

188
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,066
Enough with that nonsense of yours.

189
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,320
-Fire!
-Fire!

190
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,362
-Fire!
-What?

191
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,989
-Fire!
-Fire?

192
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,867
What are you talking about? A fire?

193
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,452
Here you were.

194
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,828
What were you doing?

195
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,289
It's a disaster! There's a fire!

196
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,125
Where's the fire? I don't see it.

197
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,669
I was praying in the mountains

198
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:33,049
when I saw a fire blazing
from Kang-ho's farm.

199
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,008
What?

200
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,301
Oh, dear!

201
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,761
Goodness!

202
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,764
Goodness, Mr. Son!

203
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,892
Mr. Son! This is bad!

204
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,478
Goodness, what's going on?

205
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,771
-Oh, dear!
-Call 911!

206
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,689
-Okay!
-Isn't this Sam-sik?

207
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,484
What's wrong with him?

208
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,527
Did he set this fire?

209
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,279
Shut your mouth!

210
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,406
Where are Kang-ho and his mom?

211
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,908
Her truck is here,

212
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,369
-but she won't pick up.
-Oh, no!

213
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,704
We don't have time!

214
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,122
Let's put out the fire!

215
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,082
-Okay!
-Over there!

216
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,708
Hurry!

217
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,418
-Goodness.
-Why are you lying here?

218
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,920
-Goodness!
-Stay with him!

219
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,006
What about our Sam-sik?

220
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,633
Go on. Pull it out.

221
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,551
Who's that?

222
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,387
Isn't that Young-soon?

223
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,513
-Ms. Jin!
-Goodness!

224
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,806
-Goodness!
-Young-soon!

225
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,058
What's going on?

226
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,559
Goodness!

227
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,186
-Oh, dear!
-Be careful!

228
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,688
Be careful!

229
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,232
-You're okay now.
-Kang-ho.

230
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,400
-Where's the water?
-Kang-ho.

231
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,734
-Kang-ho?
-Kang-ho?

232
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,445
-Where is he right now?
-Kang-ho…

233
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,948
He's in there.

234
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,949
-What?
-What?

235
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,451
Are you saying he's in there?

236
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,120
-Kang-ho!
-Oh, no.

237
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,371
-No!
-Kang-ho!

238
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,747
-No!
-No!

239
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,207
-Kang-ho!
-No!

240
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,459
-Oh, dear!
-Kang-ho…

241
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,464
-Mi-joo!
-Mi-joo!

242
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,134
Stay here.

243
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,136
Sam-sik, are you okay?

244
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,597
-What?
-Mr. Yang.

245
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,765
Turn on the water.

246
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,933
-Right.
-Turn it on!

247
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,101
-Turn it on!
-Turn it on!

248
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,394
Stick it in there!

249
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,020
-Goodness!
-Hey!

250
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,814
What are you doing?

251
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,691
Goodness me!

252
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,775
Goodness!

253
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,947
You lunatic! What are you doing?

254
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,245
Spray it in my direction.

255
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,329
What?

256
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,623
Okay.

257
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,460
-No!
-Sam-sik!

258
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,003
-Sam-sik!
-Sam-sik!

259
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,337
Sam-sik!

260
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,964
Don't go in there!

261
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,467
-Don't do it!
-Don't go in!

262
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,343
No, Sam-sik!

263
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,806
Kang-ho!

264
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,974
Sam-sik!

265
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,477
-What do we do?
-Sam-sik!

266
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,103
-Goodness!
-Sam-sik!

267
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,271
Sam-sik!

268
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,482
There they come!

269
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,816
They're here!

270
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,818
-Goodness!
-Over here!

271
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,111
Hurry up!

272
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,446
Wait!

273
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,865
Look! Someone's coming out!

274
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,870
Goodness! Sam-sik is carrying
Kang-ho on his back!

275
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,456
-Well done, Sam-sik!
-Well done!

276
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,707
-I'm so proud of--
-Sam-sik!

277
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,125
Hold on!

278
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,378
Isn't that Kang-ho?

279
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,796
-What?
-What?

280
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,137
Kang-ho is carrying Sam-sik!

281
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,311
Kang-ho!

282
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,271
-Kang-ho!
-Sam-sik!

283
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,190
Sam-sik!

284
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,901
They're okay.

285
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,611
It's Kang-ho.

286
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,779
Sam-sik.

287
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,114
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

288
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,700
Kang-ho. Oh, dear.

289
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,536
-Oh, dear.
-My Sam-sik.

290
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,912
Wake up, Kang-ho.

291
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,206
Call the ambulance!

292
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,165
Are you okay?

293
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,043
Goodness, my Sam-sik.

294
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,086
Sam-sik!

295
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,068
You should be lying down. You're unwell.

296
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,197
They said his oxygen therapy went well

297
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,575
and he'll wake up soon, so don't worry.

298
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,413
You've been so busy today because of us.

299
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,123
I'm sorry, Mi-joo.

300
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,458
Don't worry about that.

301
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,255
Ms. Jin, you should lie down.

302
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,132
-Sam-sik.
-Sam-sik.

303
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,759
Where am I?

304
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,928
You darn punk. Where do you think you are?

305
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,597
It's the hospital.

306
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,307
The hospital?

307
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,978
Why would you jump into the fire?

308
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,855
Are you a moth
drawn to a flame or something?

309
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,149
Why would you do such a thing?

310
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,984
You lunatic.

311
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,279
That's enough. He's still recovering.

312
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,698
Why would you call me a moth?

313
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,909
-Hey.
-Yes?

314
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,619
Is this funny to you?

315
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,954
Come on. Don't be so serious.

316
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,916
You almost died back there.

317
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,042
What?

318
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,710
What if something happened to you?

319
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,756
What if we lost our precious only son?

320
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,843
I got mad at you first

321
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,678
so others wouldn't.

322
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,305
She beat you first

323
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:37,353
because she couldn't stand the thought
of you getting beaten up by others.

324
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,272
Do you even know
how it feels to be so harsh

325
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,524
to your own child?

326
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,736
It's okay to cause trouble.

327
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,197
You can even become a jobless thug.

328
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,326
Just stay alive, will you?

329
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,453
Is that so hard?

330
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,747
It's not, right?

331
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,627
Goodness me.

332
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,712
You son of a gun.

333
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,217
How dare you make my man cry?

334
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,470
It's not hard, is it?

335
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,390
Don't cry now.

336
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,643
You're awake. What a relief.

337
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,813
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

338
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,856
Yes, I'm fine.

339
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,441
Right.

340
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,110
How's Kang-ho?

341
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,154
They need to run a few more tests,

342
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,739
so they're transferring him
to a general ward.

343
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,411
You're awake.

344
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,874
We're looking into the cause of the fire.

345
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,085
We found traces of gasoline

346
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,005
near the farm's entrance
where the fire started.

347
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,924
We suspect that
there were explosives around the area.

348
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,427
I can explain.

349
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,970
You see,

350
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,598
I went to the farm to look for Kang-ho.

351
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,561
And some suspicious-looking guy
was coming out of the farm.

352
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,478
I did it.

353
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,439
-It was me.
-What?

354
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,857
It was a mistake.

355
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,983
What was?

356
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,568
So…

357
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,279
It was my fault that the fire broke out.

358
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,948
I shouldn't have put the gasoline
near the fire.

359
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,116
I was in a hurry.

360
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,493
Ms. Jin, what are you talking about?

361
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,328
I saw him.

362
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,788
This guy…

363
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,708
No. It wasn't just one guy.

364
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,544
Do you see this on the back of my neck?

365
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,921
-They hit me really hard.
-I see.

366
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,340
That's not the only place you're injured.

367
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,384
-Sorry?
-Goodness, you're a mess.

368
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,261
What happened to your lip?

369
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,221
-Goodness.
-Well, this…

370
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,308
There's no need to
further investigate this.

371
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,020
I'm the victim, so why would I lie?

372
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,607
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

373
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,358
-I'm so sorry.
-What…

374
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,485
But…

375
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,403
What are you doing?

376
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,158
Who's the suspicious guy you saw?

377
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,659
Did you eavesdrop?

378
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,036
Answer me.

379
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,371
He isn't a villager, right?

380
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,041
No one in our neighborhood would do that.

381
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,293
Let me go.

382
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,004
He was really tall and burly.

383
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,923
He was as big as Don Lee.

384
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,174
When I got there,

385
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,343
I saw him running out of the farm.

386
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,053
You saw it too.

387
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,514
The gate to the farm was latched.

388
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,516
It couldn't have been done
from the inside.

389
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,559
Then why did Ms. Jin lie?

390
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,729
Beats me. I'm baffled too.

391
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,857
Maybe she caught on to it.

392
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,400
Caught on to what?

393
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,236
What?

394
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,115
Goodness.

395
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,407
That came out wrong.

396
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,160
Sam-sik, you know something, don't you?

397
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,329
I've never known anything in life.

398
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,372
Is that so?

399
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,666
Then why were you there so late?

400
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,711
That was because…

401
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,506
I went there to see Kang-ho.

402
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,216
Are you serious? At that hour?

403
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,509
Looking like this?

404
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,720
What happened to your face?

405
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,139
Who beat you up?

406
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,890
I wasn't beaten up.

407
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,060
I fell down the stairs earlier.

408
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,524
Do you really want to
fall down the stairs?

409
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,151
-Do you?
-What are you doing?

410
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,610
Tell me the truth,

411
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,364
or I can't help but think that
you set the fire.

412
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,782
What? Darn it.

413
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,783
That makes no sense!

414
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,034
Why not?

415
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,537
You've been jealous of Kang-ho
because I like him.

416
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,580
You like him?

417
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,166
I… No, I don't.

418
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,251
Anyway, so why did you set the fire?

419
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,377
Why?

420
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,214
It wasn't me! It was Oh Tae-soo's guys!

421
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,552
Oh Tae-soo?

422
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,637
-The Oh Tae-soo we all know?
-Yes.

423
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,056
Mi-joo.

424
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,975
I'll be honest.

425
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,520
Kang-ho is in danger.

426
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,569
Mi-joo.

427
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,446
What's going on?

428
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,073
I thought you had left with Sam-sik.

429
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,491
Report them to the police.

430
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,620
What? Report whom to the police?

431
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,955
Those people who want Kang-ho dead.

432
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,378
Ms. Jin.

433
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,094
What did you hear?

434
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,930
Sam-sik told me everything.

435
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,433
He said Kang-ho knew about
Assemblyman Oh's secret.

436
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,602
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo's secret?

437
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,229
His illegitimate son.

438
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,607
Apparently, Kang-ho had
the original copy of the DNA test.

439
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,943
He did?

440
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,319
You didn't know?

441
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,948
They went after Sam-sik because of it too.

442
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,824
Why him?

443
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,868
The test result was in the bag

444
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,870
that you had given to Ms. Park.

445
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,871
What?

446
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,585
So tell me. Where is it now?

447
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,671
Sam-sik had it,

448
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,965
but Oh Tae-soo's men took it from him.

449
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,133
Then it's over now.
They have the evidence.

450
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,010
So why are they doing this to Kang-ho?

451
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,972
He must feel uneasy about
Kang-ho knowing the truth.

452
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,975
But why? Kang-ho has lost his memories.

453
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,560
Because if Kang-ho
ever regained his memories,

454
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,688
he'd find the evidence again.

455
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,023
That's why he's doing this.

456
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,067
So we must report this now.

457
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,861
No, don't.

458
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,821
Ms. Jin.

459
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,864
We don't have any evidence of this.

460
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,118
Provoking them could put Kang-ho
in further danger.

461
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,370
Don't you still get it?

462
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,955
Kang-ho is already in danger.

463
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,373
I know.

464
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,417
That's why…

465
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,924
That's why…

466
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,969
we're going to leave.

467
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:46,972
What?

468
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,685
I don't have much time anyway.

469
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,021
Once he wakes up,

470
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,648
we're going to move and go into hiding

471
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,942
and prepare for immigration.

472
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,780
So Mi-joo, you don't need to
worry about him anymore.

473
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,657
This is ridiculous.

474
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,868
Why must you guys run away

475
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,620
when Oh Tae-soo is the guilty one?

476
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,955
Let's just report him.

477
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,958
Then the police will reveal the truth

478
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,668
and protect Kang-ho.

479
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,046
That's how his dad died.

480
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,548
What?

481
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,842
A fire broke out at our farm in the past.

482
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,678
He lost his life

483
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,014
while trying to expose the truth.

484
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,768
No one protected him.

485
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,897
Neither the court nor our neighbors.

486
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,191
Even I, his wife,

487
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,902
was powerless.

488
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,571
That's why

489
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,823
I was so strict with Kang-ho.

490
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,243
I wanted him to become a powerful person.

491
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,122
He must've resented me so much

492
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,667
throughout those lonely and painful years.

493
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,716
I'm going to protect Kang-ho from now on.

494
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,011
I won't let him
meet the same fate as his dad.

495
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:15,018
Kang-ho was only able to endure
those lonely and painful years

496
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,938
because of you.

497
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,235
During those long years
he was preparing for the bar exam,

498
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,072
he always sang "I am Happy."

499
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,117
That's your favorite song.

500
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,001
I am happy

501
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,172
I am happy

502
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,383
I am…

503
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:50,137
-I am happy
-I am happy

504
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,224
-I am happy
-Keep it down. You're being too loud.

505
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,645
There are so many places
that make pancakes in Seoul.

506
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,731
We visited most of them.

507
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,899
You see,

508
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,318
he was craving mung bean pancakes.

509
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,321
But he wasn't happy with any of them.

510
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,837
How is it? Is it good?

511
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,213
How…

512
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,386
-Looking back,
-Sorry.

513
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,429
It's okay.

514
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,557
he was looking for the taste
of your mung bean pancakes.

515
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,436
Kang-ho

516
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,605
didn't resent you.

517
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,940
He was worried about you

518
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,193
and missed you a lot.

519
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,203
Was it you?

520
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:58,705
Sorry?

521
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,957
Were you the girl

522
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,586
he wrote about in his journal?

523
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:10,133
You were the girl he loved to death.

524
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,761
It was you.

525
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,513
That's why

526
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,807
despite losing his memories,

527
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,393
he still searched for you
and had those feelings.

528
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,272
Mi-joo.

529
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,819
It must've been
so hard and painful for you.

530
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,822
Why didn't you tell me?

531
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,203
I'm sorry.

532
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,372
I know it's late,

533
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,875
but let me apologize on his behalf.

534
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,212
-I'm truly sorry.
-I'm sorry as well.

535
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,716
I should've told you sooner.

536
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,054
It's taken me too long.

537
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,100
That's okay.
What could you possibly be sorry about?

538
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,894
It's all our fault.

539
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,355
-You had no choice--
-I'm…

540
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,566
not married.

541
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,903
Ye-jin and Seo-jin…

542
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,448
are Kang-ho's kids.

543
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,703
But they're my kids now.

544
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,872
I only found out about the pregnancy
after we broke up.

545
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,376
And I decided to have them without him.

546
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,338
I never planned to use them as an excuse
to hold onto Kang-ho.

547
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,384
And I don't intend to get back with him
by using them either.

548
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,512
He may not remember right now.

549
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,142
But he abandoned me in the past.

550
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,269
He didn't.

551
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,647
Kang-ho…

552
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,276
wanted to avenge his dad.

553
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,363
So he was going to become
the son of his dad's murderer

554
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,033
and marry the accomplice's daughter.

555
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,702
What do you mean?

556
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,539
Are you saying his dad was murdered by--

557
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,623
Song Woo-byeok

558
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,834
and Oh Tae-soo.

559
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,963
Kang-ho never abandoned us.

560
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,091
If things went haywire,

561
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,345
he knew we'd be in danger

562
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,930
for being his loved ones.

563
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,808
That's why he chose to leave us.

564
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,062
The only person

565
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,189
he ever abandoned

566
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,691
was himself.

567
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,945
Kang-ho.

568
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,322
Kang-ho.

569
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,661
Kang-ho, are you awake?

570
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,329
Mom.

571
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,087
Mi-joo.

572
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,884
Are you Mr. Choi Kang-ho?

573
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,511
Who are you?

574
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,638
Police.

575
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,934
We already explained everything
to the other officers.

576
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,519
What are you referring to?

577
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,771
Aren't you here because of the fire?

578
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,567
Or did you…

579
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,279
Mr. Choi.

580
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,824
You're under arrest on suspicion
of murdering Mr. Hwang Soo-hyun.

581
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,248
An anonymous source
sent these photos to us.

582
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,959
Then four hours later,

583
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,462
these photos were taken
on the coast of Taebu Island.

584
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,465
As for Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun,

585
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,009
her body was found near Jemyeon Island,

586
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,429
which is about 5km away from Taebu Island.

587
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:29,142
She was wearing
the same clothes and bag from that day.

588
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,352
So?

589
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,939
Are you insinuating that
my son murdered her?

590
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,108
Mr. Choi.

591
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,528
You know her, right?

592
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,948
No.

593
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,867
What about this baby?

594
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:51,206
You often visited her
at the postpartum care center!

595
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,708
Everyone there thinks you're the dad!

596
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,127
What are you talking about?

597
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,297
He had a fiancée back then.

598
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,426
And we suspect that's the reason
why he committed this crime.

599
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,764
He must've had to get rid
of Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun and the baby

600
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,850
to become the son-in-law
of such a powerful family.

601
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,854
Unbelievable.

602
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,358
I'll be honest.

603
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,486
The woman and her baby…

604
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,156
aren't related to him. They're…

605
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,200
Mom, I'm hungry!

606
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,451
What?

607
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,620
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

608
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,163
-Kang-ho.
-What?

609
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,790
-Food.
-Kang-ho!

610
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,083
What are you doing?

611
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,626
No, don't do this!

612
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,044
Don't do this!

613
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,256
What the…

614
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,842
-That's not a rag.
-Kang-ho.

615
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,552
Are you not hurt?

616
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,012
Mom, I'm hungry. I want to go home.

617
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,181
I'll bring you some food.

618
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,599
No, I want to go home.

619
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,144
Those men keep yelling at me.
I'm so scared. I want to go home.

620
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,355
-Kang-ho!
-Get him.

621
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,773
Don't do that!

622
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,401
-Get him!
-Mom!

623
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,318
Kang-ho!

624
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,904
Come here!

625
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,282
-Stay still.
-Stay still.

626
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,825
What are you doing?

627
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,034
That hurts!

628
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,452
Let him go!

629
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,414
It's okay. It's Mom.

630
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,124
You're all right.

631
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,959
Let's go home.

632
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,044
Let's go home.

633
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,714
Tell me.

634
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,550
Does being in the same car
make him the murderer?

635
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,094
Do you have proof that he killed her?

636
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:33,266
How could you use force on my son
who isn't mentally stable?

637
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,643
I want to see your chief.

638
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,605
I'm going to sue you all for violating
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities!

639
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,775
It's okay.

640
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,705
Thank you for lending us your tracksuit.

641
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,583
Should I send it back by courier?

642
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,461
I'm going to gather evidence
and come back.

643
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,712
So keep it with you.

644
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,590
Don't even think about running away.

645
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,342
That'll only aggravate his penalty.

646
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,398
Kang-ho.

647
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,754
Jeez, I stink.

648
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,048
I'm going to take a shower.

649
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,013
I've been waiting for a very long time.

650
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,893
Aren't you going to greet me?

651
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,329
You're back.

652
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,874
Welcome back.

653
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,627
It's been a while.

654
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,299
I was so afraid

655
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,970
that I might never see you again.

656
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,265
I knew

657
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,808
I had to

658
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,604
ask for your forgiveness
for everything I had done.

659
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,066
I was afraid
I might never be able to do that.

660
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,198
I'm sorry, Kang-ho.

661
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,577
It was wrong of me.

662
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,382
I'm back,

663
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,260
Mother.

664
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,985
Mom, I think you should stay
at the hospital.

665
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,195
Kang-ho.

666
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,863
I'm okay.

667
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,329
By the way, how did you know?

668
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,539
How could I not? I'm your mom.

669
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,334
You could be an actor.

670
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,921
That was some incredible acting.

671
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,800
I had to get out of there at all costs

672
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,760
to do what I needed to do.

673
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:58,930
What do you…

674
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,349
Don't tell me…

675
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,477
No, Kang-ho.

676
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,270
It's too dangerous. I won't allow it.

677
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,191
Father,

678
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,653
Hwang Soo-hyun, and the fire at our farm.

679
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,697
Do you still not get it?

680
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,866
They'll keep coming after us.

681
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,369
All the evidence is gone.

682
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,873
I'm sorry.

683
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,502
I didn't know
things would pan out this way.

684
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,755
Kang-ho.

685
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,090
Let's just leave.

686
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,260
Why don't we go somewhere far away?

687
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,970
That's what Ms. Hwang tried to do,

688
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,346
and look

689
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,849
what happened to her.

690
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,728
They'll find us

691
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,063
one way or another.

692
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,943
So we must find evidence against them
before they do anything to us.

693
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,615
But how will you possibly do that?

694
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,036
You need seven different lies

695
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,747
to conceal one.

696
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,333
It's the same with crimes.

697
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,669
To conceal one,

698
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,672
you need to commit multiple crimes.

699
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,219
And there's always evidence left behind.

700
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,848
I'll find it at all costs.

701
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,979
However, no one can find out
that I've regained my memories

702
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,355
until everything is over.

703
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,692
And you should never be alone.

704
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,485
Do you understand?

705
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,820
I got you.

706
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,575
Wait for me.

707
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,969
That's impressive.

708
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,733
Pasta or pizza?

709
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,915
Babe, how are you guys here together?

710
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,625
We ran into each other.

711
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,877
Let me pack up. One minute.

712
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,671
-Sure.
-Jeez.

713
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,925
Gosh, my babies. Aren't you cold?

714
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:41,884
It's okay.

715
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,365
Hi, Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

716
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,201
It's Kang-ho oppa.

717
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,875
I'm sorry that I didn't recognize you.

718
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,504
To be honest,
I didn't recognize you either.

719
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,047
Did you get a new hat?

720
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,173
You're wrong!

721
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,426
He's worn this hat more than ten times!

722
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,262
It's okay if you don't recognize me.

723
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,180
I'd know you from a mile away.

724
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,558
Come here.

725
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,827
Ye-jin and Seo-jin…

726
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,996
are Kang-ho's kids.

727
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,384
Isn't he the prosecutor from last time?

728
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,432
WHEN NAILS COME

729
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:12,933
What…

730
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,728
did you just say?

731
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,438
Petit Nail.

732
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,774
Bar Exam Meal.

733
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,902
Fried tofu rice balls.
Ten square root of two.

734
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,904
I remember everything now.

735
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,615
Does this mean you're all better now?

736
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,533
Yes.

737
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,827
I see.

738
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,871
I'm so relieved.

739
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,169
You're better now?

740
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,464
Then I can give you a beating now,
you asshole.

741
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,383
Hey!

742
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,803
Why didn't you tell me?

743
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,182
I wanted to die multiple times a day.

744
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,603
I cried, cursed,

745
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,939
and resented you every single day.

746
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:04,527
How could you put a pregnant woman
through such a difficult time?

747
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,363
You know why Ye-jin and Seo-jin
are bad-tempered?

748
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,824
It's all because of you, you asshole!

749
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,996
If I ever saw you again,

750
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,208
I was going to kill you.

751
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,377
But you were unwell.

752
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,631
So I just waited until you got better.

753
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,716
Then I found out that

754
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,552
you were in more pain than I was.

755
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:36,475
I'm the one who was abandoned and hurt.

756
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,645
So why can't I resent you
for what you did?

757
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,398
Why did you have to suffer more than me?

758
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,614
I'm sorry.

759
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,366
I'm sorry, Mi-joo.

760
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,038
But Mi-joo,

761
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,291
don't forgive me just yet.

762
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,834
What?

763
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:06,213
The thing I have to do without you
hasn't ended yet.

764
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,924
So don't

765
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,177
forgive me just yet.

766
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,847
Keep cursing and resenting me

767
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,390
for now.

768
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,393
Once I come back safe and sound,

769
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,270
I'll beg and ask for your forgiveness.

770
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,149
And I'll be the one waiting

771
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,652
for your forgiveness.

772
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,079
Hi, Sung-ae.

773
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,706
It's me.

774
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:45,628
Please come to the village hall
with Mr. Bang by 6 p.m.

775
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,671
And don't eat beforehand.

776
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,259
Okay, see you then.

777
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,515
Who is it?

778
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:05,940
What brings you here?

779
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,317
I heard there was a fire at your farm.

780
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,611
Is that farm cursed or something?

781
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,447
It's one misfortune after another.

782
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,157
Tell me about it.

783
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,035
I should've just sold that cursed farm

784
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,997
to a certain despicable guy back then.

785
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,499
What a shame.

786
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,377
"Despicable guy"?

787
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,674
That despicable guy is leaving.
I'm moving out.

788
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,094
I have something for you before I leave.

789
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,597
I see.

790
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,935
There's no need for parting gifts,
but I appreciate the thought.

791
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,564
No, not that.
I came to return your container.

792
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,691
I see.

793
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,026
Goodness.

794
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,445
I feel bad

795
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,782
for a lot of things I did to you.

796
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,451
Take good care of yourself.

797
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,453
Here.

798
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,918
You have to survive.

799
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,880
Wait.

800
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,925
A goodbye party?

801
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,513
He's moving to Seoul tomorrow.

802
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,764
Is that why

803
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,393
you made all this food by yourself?

804
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,271
After everything that he's done to you?

805
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,149
Maybe she poisoned the food.

806
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,526
-Goodness.
-Are you serious right now?

807
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,279
Goodness, I'm sorry I'm late.

808
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,989
-Come on in.
-Come in.

809
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,115
Hi, kids.

810
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,618
-Come here.
-My babies.

811
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,078
Welcome. My dear Ye-jin.

812
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,622
You like pancakes, don't you?

813
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,791
I also brought dumpling soup
and radish water kimchi, your favorites.

814
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,168
Go sit down.

815
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,962
-Sit down.
-Goodness.

816
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,048
You shouldn't have cooked

817
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,342
when you haven't even fully recovered yet.

818
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,385
-Where's Kang-ho?
-Sorry?

819
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,972
The doctors needed to run
a few more tests on him,

820
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,599
so he's still at the hospital.

821
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,935
Don't worry. He's much better now.

822
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,233
I'm truly grateful for all you've done

823
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,653
-to save our farm.
-Please.

824
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,572
I'm also sorry that

825
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:24,036
I failed to appreciate you all
because I was so focused on working.

826
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,871
-Stop that.
-What's gotten into her?

827
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,081
From this moment on,

828
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,875
I'm going to put aside my worries

829
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,128
and live happily with you all.

830
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,421
-Sure.
-Do that.

831
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,673
Yes.

832
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,383
There's even a song about it.

833
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,344
Let's put aside our worries

834
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,388
And cha-cha-cha

835
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,806
Cha, cha, cha.

836
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,516
-And cha--
-Come on!

837
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,850
Is this why you brought me?

838
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,270
One, two.

839
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,231
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

840
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,568
If you cannot stop them

841
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:00,948
From leaving

842
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:05,244
-Don't turn your back and cry
-Don't turn your back and cry

843
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,580
-Spare yourself the tears
-Spare yourself the tears

844
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:13,419
-Tomorrow
-Tomorrow

845
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:17,464
-There will be
-There will be

846
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:23,470
-A new wind
-A new wind

847
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,471
-Three, four.
-Three, four.

848
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,640
-Let's put aside our worries
-Let's put aside our worries

849
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,267
-And cha-cha-cha
-And cha-cha-cha

850
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,256
Imagine the expectations I had
when I assigned

851
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,800
such an important task to you.

852
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,761
Didn't I tell you that Woobyeok Group

853
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,098
and all of our lives were at stake?

854
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,183
I'm sorry, sir.

855
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,226
We didn't expect it
to drag on for so long.

856
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,561
But thankfully, we caught…

857
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:20,068
What's so damn hard about
killing that idiot?

858
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,945
Damn it.

859
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,363
Damn it!

860
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,910
Were you the one who sent these…

861
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,328
Mr. Oh!

862
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,502
What happened to Kang-ho?

863
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:40,047
He was questioned this morning about
Hwang Soo-hyun and released a while ago.

864
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,548
He was released?

865
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,176
A vehicle was recovered at the
scene of the accident at Taebu Island.

866
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,137
And the doors and windows
were locked from the inside.

867
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,807
So you're telling me

868
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:54,311
Hwang Soo-hyun
was never in the car to begin with?

869
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,985
That means Kang-ho duped me.

870
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,824
Then who the hell killed her?

871
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,788
OH TAE-SOO

872
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,209
Tail him

873
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,379
and make sure you see it through.

874
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,284
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

875
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,068
-You're home. Goodness.
-Mom!

876
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,987
-Hey. Goodness.
-Did you have fun?

877
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,532
My dear Mi-joo.

878
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,659
My pretty Mi-joo.

879
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,536
-Goodness, here's a kiss.
-Right.

880
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,875
-You let an ill person drink?
-I only had one glass.

881
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,293
Just one.

882
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,380
I'm in such a great mood today.

883
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,049
Tell me about it.

884
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,551
It's unlike you to drink like that

885
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,137
and insist on sleeping
at our house tonight.

886
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,182
I'm going to sleep
with Seo-jin and Ye-jin.

887
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,225
-Seo-jin and Ye-jin…
-Goodness me!

888
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,686
-Let's put her to bed.
-Okay.

889
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,313
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

890
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,481
Ye-jin.

891
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,651
-Seo-jin. Wait for me.
-Let's go.

892
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,612
-Wait for me.
-You're killing me.

893
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,198
-Well done.
-Let's sleep together.

894
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,116
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

895
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,702
-You guys, come here.
-Mi-joo…

896
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,496
Let's go outside.

897
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,790
-Let's let her sleep.
-I want to sleep with them.

898
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,501
-Ye-jin and Seo-jin.
-Turn off the light.

899
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:26,171
-Okay, you can sleep with them.
-My babies.

900
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,882
-Let's sleep together.
-Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

901
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,133
My babies.

902
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,641
-Everyone was so happy today.
-I'm sorry.

903
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,434
They were all dancing and singing.

904
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,853
Really?

905
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,939
Why were they so happy?

906
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,732
I'm not sure.

907
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:50,696
I think they were happy to hear that
Mr. Baek was leaving.

908
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,573
What's this?

909
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,076
I took several videos to show you,

910
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,994
but none of them got saved.

911
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,413
Give it to me.

912
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,248
Let me see.

913
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,457
Look.

914
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,543
Your storage is full.

915
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,795
You should've deleted
unnecessary ones beforehand.

916
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,715
None of them are unnecessary!
They're all my work.

917
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,216
Really?

918
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,134
Okay.

919
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,010
What's this?

920
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,429
That?

921
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,807
I filmed Kang-ho's ex-fiancée.

922
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,686
Just delete it.
It's the most useless video ever.

923
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,480
-I hate it.
-Wait, hold on.

924
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,606
Hold on.

925
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,776
Do you see this Banz?

926
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,611
My grandma told me that

927
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,364
only those who are very rich
can drive one.

928
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,242
All right. Let's take a peek inside.

929
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,581
I see the lady Kang-ho brought with him.

930
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,292
She took something out of her bag.

931
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,032
No way.

932
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,701
They both could've died,

933
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,536
so why would she slip him pills?

934
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,164
I heard the driver that day was a woman.

935
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,167
Then it makes absolutely no sense.

936
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,086
Why would she spike her own drink?

937
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,631
I'm sure they were some supplements.

938
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:36,134
What's important is that
Kang-ho drove when they departed.

939
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,845
That means they switched places midway.

940
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,057
They could've done that if he was tired.

941
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,725
But the reason is just strange.

942
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,353
Apparently, Kang-ho fell asleep,

943
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,022
and she was outside the car
when the accident happened.

944
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,650
That's why she was unscathed and met me.

945
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,360
Isn't it so odd?

946
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,571
Well…

947
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,699
It is too convenient
to call it a coincidence.

948
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,077
This won't do.

949
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,703
I need to meet her.

950
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,080
What? Hey.

951
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,290
You can't do that!

952
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,459
Can't you see the state I'm in?

953
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,631
I even eat in here
in case those men come back for me.

954
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,424
It's too dangerous to go by yourself.

955
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,676
Don't worry.

956
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,011
I won't be going alone.

957
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,270
I can't believe this.

958
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,813
Hey!

959
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,610
Mi-joo.

960
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:39,865
I'm truly honored and touched
that you chose me to do this with you.

961
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,367
But this isn't right. It's too dangerous.

962
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,037
Then will you live in a closet forever?

963
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,165
A closet is better than a coffin.

964
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,459
You've never met those guys.

965
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,170
If I get caught again,
I really might end up dead!

966
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,131
-Look.
-What?

967
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,674
-Now!
-Hey, Mi-joo!

968
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,677
Are you insane? Goodness.

969
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,848
Who is it?

970
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:08,852
Hello, is this Ha-young's house?

971
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,187
I'm a close friend of hers.

972
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,732
But I couldn't reach her.

973
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,776
Is she home right now by any chance?

974
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,447
I'm sorry, but she's not home.

975
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,032
Then can I…

976
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,283
Darn it.

977
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,286
SILLIM FRESH RAW FISH

978
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,412
He's not here?

979
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,331
No.

980
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,625
He sold the restaurant
a year ago and left.

981
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,168
Where did he go?

982
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,171
I'm not entirely sure where he went.

983
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,841
But we suddenly lost touch.

984
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,020
Hello?

985
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,691
Hello, who is this?

986
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,110
Prosecutor Choi, it's me.

987
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:00,904
Investigation Officer?

988
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,032
Your car suddenly disappeared,

989
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:07,535
so I called your mother to check.

990
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,455
You and I were the only ones
who knew where the car key was.

991
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,207
I'm truly glad.

992
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,960
I knew you'd come back.

993
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,213
-Sir.
-Yes?

994
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,132
I still have some work to do,

995
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,218
so please keep this a secret until then.

996
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,302
Of course.

997
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,681
I'm forever indebted to you.

998
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,182
You know me.

999
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,768
Have I ever asked you to lend me money?

1000
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,063
But my mother is getting surgery tomorrow.

1001
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,275
Could you please help me out this once?
I'll pay you back at all costs.

1002
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,028
Hello?

1003
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,155
Hello…

1004
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,243
Woobyeok Paper Company's
corporate transaction records and ledger

1005
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,953
for the third and fourth quarters
are missing.

1006
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,456
I'm sorry. I'll find them and get it to…

1007
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,211
-Sir?
-Take care of your personal matters

1008
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,963
so you can focus on work.

1009
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,174
You don't have to come to work
until the weekend.

1010
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,301
Take good care of your mother.

1011
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,305
My mother would have passed away
without having a chance to get surgery

1012
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,517
had you not helped me back then.

1013
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:17,439
Maybe that's why I couldn't say no
to anything your mother asked of me.

1014
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,858
Don't worry.

1015
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,026
I'll help you no matter what.

1016
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,822
Goodness.

1017
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,658
You've been throwing up all day.

1018
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,245
You shouldn't have drunk in your state.

1019
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,956
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

1020
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,125
We already know what I have.

1021
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:45,633
My body has become too weak
to handle a single glass of makgeolli.

1022
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,182
Oh, no.

1023
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,602
What a small world.

1024
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,271
That was random.

1025
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,066
I've met Oh Ha-young before.

1026
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,276
What? When?

1027
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,154
I won't apologize.

1028
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,114
There.

1029
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,033
What'll you do now?

1030
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,536
In that case, it can't be helped.

1031
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,092
Goodness, you're still here?

1032
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,220
Ha-young's phone is still off.

1033
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:35,100
Ma'am, I really need to see her.

1034
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:40,355
I've been studying abroad for five years,
and I flew in temporarily.

1035
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,941
Once I go back,

1036
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,485
I don't know when I'll return.

1037
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,821
I can't believe that woman.

1038
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,322
Could you please

1039
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,783
help me out this once?

1040
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,660
-Please.
-My goodness.

1041
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,662
You see…

1042
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,457
She's a bit ill,
so she's in a hospital right now.

1043
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,959
Which hospital?

1044
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,877
-I'll visit her.
-No!

1045
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:09,175
Anyway, it'll be difficult
to see her for the time being.

1046
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,552
So meet her next time.

1047
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,013
Come by again next time.

1048
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,349
Next time when?

1049
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,560
After the presidential election.

1050
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,728
I'm sure you'll be able to meet her then.

1051
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:25,400
Ma'am, please help me.

1052
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:28,194
Please…

1053
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,747
That lady

1054
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,458
looked very anxious.

1055
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,293
Did you notice it too?

1056
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,172
She's in a hospital,

1057
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,925
but that lady won't dare
tell you which hospital it is.

1058
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,137
And she said you should come back
after the election.

1059
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,514
But that's in four months.

1060
00:57:56,598 --> 00:58:00,351
How ill could she possibly be
to be hospitalized for that long?

1061
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,438
I don't think the duration matters.

1062
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:06,107
I think it's the election part
that's important.

1063
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,359
Right. I saw this earlier.

1064
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,736
Maybe

1065
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,530
it has something to do with this.

1066
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,949
ASSEMBLYMAN OH'S DAUGHTER
DISAPPEARS AT HER WEDDING…

1067
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,075
No way.

1068
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,077
Think about it.

1069
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,581
The election is right around the corner,
and this is what his daughter did.

1070
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,124
Right.

1071
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,252
Plus, she's aware
of her father's illegitimate child.

1072
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:30,798
If I were him, I would've broken her legs
and locked her up somewhere.

1073
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,843
Do you think she's even in a hospital?

1074
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:38,723
Would he really risk the doctors
and nurses spreading rumors about her?

1075
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:42,352
And is there even a hospital
that admits you for four months?

1076
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,072
-Sam-sik!
-Oh, my god!

1077
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,908
I know where it is.

1078
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,701
What are you talking about?

1079
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,036
The hospital.

1080
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,496
It must be

1081
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,873
Woosung Medical Center.

1082
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,590
Hey.

1083
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,885
What is this?

1084
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,428
Can't you read?

1085
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,140
It's a medical certificate.

1086
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,892
"Fourteen weeks of recovery"?

1087
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,562
Did you not expect something like this
when you kicked me?

1088
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,364
You messed with the wrong person.

1089
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,992
You know who my dad is, right?

1090
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,287
Fabricating a medical certificate
is a cakewalk for him.

1091
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,539
He could turn someone like you

1092
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:49,377
into a lunatic and have you locked up
in a hospital forever.

1093
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,506
I did hear that your father

1094
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,967
is an assemblyman
who'll be running for president.

1095
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,011
"Oh Ha-young"?

1096
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,597
But I only just found out

1097
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,889
his last name.

1098
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,726
"Woosung Medical Center."

1099
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:06,394
I see.

1100
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:09,564
I understand that Assemblyman Oh
is a powerful figure

1101
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:12,108
who can fabricate medical certificates

1102
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,193
and threaten innocent people with them.

1103
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,405
I'll make sure to remember him
during elections.

1104
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,287
Do you think she's really here?

1105
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:27,081
She has to be. For Kang-ho's sake.

1106
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,335
You and your dear Kang-ho.

1107
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,338
And also for your sake, Sam-sik.

1108
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:41,554
People always mention
the most important person last, right?

1109
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,056
Right?

1110
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,141
Wait up.

1111
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,191
Excuse me.

1112
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,860
Have you seen this man before?

1113
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,487
I don't think so.

1114
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,113
Thank you.

1115
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,115
May I ask you something?

1116
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,992
Have you seen this man before?

1117
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,544
Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you something?

1118
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,097
GWANGMYEONGHO

1119
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,983
Name, Cho Yeong-jae. Age, 55.

1120
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,820
After he sold
his restaurant in Sillim-dong,

1121
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:41,197
he changed his address to his hometown.

1122
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,865
But no one is living there.

1123
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:47,745
And I looked into a boat
named Gwangmyeongho as you asked.

1124
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,122
I found out that

1125
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:52,792
there are boats by that name
in Dangjin, Pohang, and Haenam.

1126
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,795
Mr. Cho!

1127
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,635
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1128
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,867
You've worked tirelessly to support me,

1129
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,702
so I'll make sure
you don't regret your efforts.

1130
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,996
Did Mr. Choi run away?

1131
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,290
Don't ever come back without a warrant.

1132
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,916
Is everything going well?

1133
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,587
-That must be where Oh Ha-young is.
-What?

1134
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,590
How could you do something so dangerous?

1135
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:43,593
I do know this very secretive place.

1136
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,470
Jin Young-soon!

1137
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:47,430
Come out!

1138
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,599
I figured the two of them

1139
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,142
needed some time alone.

1140
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,727
You weren't by our side,

1141
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:56,022
but I was always with you.

1142
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:02,570
