00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,271
-Mom!
-My babies!

3
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,940
-My gosh! Have you been well?
-Mom!

4
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:06,858
-Oh, my!
-Mom!

5
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,526
-Goodness, come here.
-Mom!

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,570
I came for you!

7
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,865
Mommy came to get you both!

8
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,533
Goodness, look.

9
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,036
Ye-jin, how are you?
Seo-jin, how about you?

10
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,913
-Mom!
-You've both grown so much!

11
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,915
-My babies!
-Mom!

12
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,416
Did you miss me?

13
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,047
Who could it be? Is it someone scary?

14
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,174
Let me check. Stay here.

15
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,763
Who is it?

16
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,658
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

17
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,452
-Happy birthday dear Kang-ho and…
-Happy birthday dear Mi-joo

18
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,579
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

19
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,801
What did you wish for?

20
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,306
For you to complete your training
at the top of your class.

21
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,146
And for us to live happily
for a long time.

22
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,484
What about you?

23
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,653
Me?

24
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,948
That I won't be nervous.

25
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,659
-Nervous?
-The candles are melting.

26
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,327
-Right.
-One, two, three!

27
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,539
-Happy birthday, Mi-joo!
-Happy birthday, Kang-ho!

28
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,709
What is it?

29
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,377
I made it myself.

30
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,629
It's a limited edition, one-of-a-kind.

31
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,006
-Really?
-Yes.

32
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,802
You have to wear it
to your appointment ceremony, okay?

33
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,679
Okay, I will.

34
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,763
Good.

35
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,850
But what's this? Ten square root of two?

36
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,189
-Love.
-I see.

37
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,400
-Love.
-Love.

38
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,277
-Love.
-Love.

39
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,030
I ten square root of two you.

40
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,283
The gifting portion is over.

41
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,994
Let's move on to the next part.

42
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,624
Let's sit and wait.

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,554
-Oh, my!
-Wait.

44
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,265
I taught myself,

45
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,309
so I'm not that good.

46
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,520
But still, listen to the end.

47
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,231
Okay.

48
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,153
Pray for me.

49
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,655
Don't let him be nervous.

50
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,989
Don't let me be nervous.

51
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,880
A tiring day passed by

52
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,842
Two are under the moonlight

53
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,846
As one shadow

54
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,808
That distant happiness is

55
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:32,313
Still there seemingly within my reach

56
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:38,444
When I close my eyes

57
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,162
-Open up.
-Okay.

58
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,209
You're back!

59
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,549
What took you so long to tell me that?

60
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,680
Am I your first love?

61
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,933
Yes.

62
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,853
You're my first love, Yeong-min.

63
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,066
-You have to brush vertically.
-What?

64
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,443
Careful.

65
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,403
-You're bleeding.
-What?

66
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,446
Got you.

67
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,908
-Gosh, your hair is long.
-Okay, I'll stay still.

68
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,289
You're so good.

69
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,957
Is there anything you can't do?

70
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,584
One more coat, and we're done.

71
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,943
Eat up.

72
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,154
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

73
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,239
What a cute couple.

74
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,724
What is it?

75
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,687
I'm home.

76
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,275
-Hey.
-Hey.

77
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,944
How have you been?

78
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,948
KANG-HO'S VISIT

79
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,953
Of course, I should come.

80
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,704
You're beautiful.

81
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,289
-Am I? I'm relieved.
-Yes.

82
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,958
-Let's take a picture.
-Okay.

83
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,401
KANG-HO'S VISIT
KANG-HO'S APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

84
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,988
Congratulations on your appointment

85
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,950
Congratulations on your appointment

86
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,871
Congratulations, my dear Kang-ho…

87
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,803
Congratulations on your appointment

88
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,681
DEAR KANG-HO
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT

89
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,525
What are you waiting for? Make a wish.

90
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,277
I did.

91
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,822
What did you wish for?

92
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,993
That I won't be nervous.

93
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,441
Tell me.

94
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,569
There's something I want to do.

95
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,701
And it's something…

96
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,914
you need to do on your own.

97
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,803
It's money I've saved up.

98
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,894
BANKBOOK

99
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,370
This is it?

100
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,249
I thought I would get much more

101
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,626
for devoting myself
to making you a prosecutor.

102
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,504
It's not as much as I thought.

103
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,049
All right.

104
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,968
In any case,

105
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,097
set me up with a colleague
or whoever else that'll take

106
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,473
the bar exam.

107
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,018
This time, someone richer.

108
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,604
You know that

109
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,856
I'm good at cooking and chores.

110
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,691
Right.

111
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,611
And at giving love.

112
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,531
Who was it?

113
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,825
It was nobody. Let's go.

114
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,910
Let's go.

115
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,205
Who was it?

116
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,831
Wait…

117
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,209
There's nobody here.

118
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,805
If you wanted to find
that bouncy ball so badly,

119
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,932
you should've taken me with you.

120
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,727
It's dangerous for you
to go out alone without telling me.

121
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,938
I was really worried.

122
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,441
Where's your phone?

123
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,528
Wait.

124
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,570
Where's my phone?

125
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,323
My phone is gone, Mom.

126
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,492
Goodness.

127
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,563
Mom, are you sick?

128
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,149
Yes.

129
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,484
Because of me?

130
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,528
Yes.

131
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,788
Goodness.

132
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,666
Do you feel sad when I'm ill?

133
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,876
Yes.

134
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,378
I feel sad when you get hurt too.

135
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,797
So don't let this happen again, okay?

136
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,466
Okay.

137
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,930
-By the way, Mom.
-Yes?

138
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,642
Why am I in pain?

139
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,396
You bruised and scraped yourself
so of course, you're in pain.

140
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,315
No, not there.

141
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,317
Right here.

142
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,234
What?

143
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,488
You feel pain there? Why?
When did it start?

144
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,783
After seeing that pretty lady.

145
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,077
Pretty lady?

146
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,705
Who?

147
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,292
Someone I don't know.

148
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,420
But it hurts right here.

149
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,098
What?

150
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,559
You never know what will happen in life.

151
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,521
Who knew that would happen to him?

152
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,857
His mom was thrilled
and even threw a feast

153
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,236
saying her prosecutor son
would be an assemblyman's son-in-law.

154
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,366
Mom, is Bar Exam a bad guy?

155
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,535
Is that why he's behind bars?

156
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,953
BAR EXAM MEALS

157
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,625
Give it to me.

158
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,294
Why did you go through her things?

159
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,256
I wanted to see
if she got us anything from America.

160
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,301
Actually, Kang-ho lost
the bouncy ball she got for us.

161
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,053
You little rascal!

162
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,806
Don't refer to him like that!
He's your mom's friend!

163
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,808
What do you mean?

164
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,851
Kang-ho is Mom's friend?

165
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,520
He's our friend.

166
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,646
You rascals!

167
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,191
They keep doing this.

168
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,111
I feel bad whenever I see his mom.

169
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,448
You two.

170
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,076
Don't do that again.

171
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,578
Then what do we call him?

172
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,913
Kang-ho oppa? Uncle Kang-ho?

173
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,211
Don't call him.

174
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,007
Don't ever meet him
or play with him again.

175
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,924
Okay?

176
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,759
But…

177
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,053
Do you both understand?

178
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,221
-Yes.
-Yes.

179
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,765
That's enough.

180
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,144
They're excited to see you again
so stop scolding them.

181
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,771
Wait.

182
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,650
Why did you suddenly come home?

183
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,735
Is something wrong?

184
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,279
Goodness, nothing's wrong.

185
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,198
I just decided to stop by.

186
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,921
My babies, I have presents for you.

187
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,882
Let's see what I got for you. Where is it?

188
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:25,966
MY FIRST KOREAN WORDS

189
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,760
You should've bought them

190
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:32,431
comic books, slime, push pop,
or other things like that.

191
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,391
Then again,

192
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,394
you left as soon as you weaned them.

193
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,938
You couldn't have known.

194
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,732
Sorry.

195
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,902
I didn't get you anything.

196
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,820
This is plenty.

197
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,371
My hands never looked this fancy
in my 60 years of living.

198
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,126
You'd always look at my hands

199
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,922
and get angry saying,
"Why are your hands like this?"

200
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,385
I had to pay for your dad's dance craze,

201
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,305
and my hands were covered with dirt
from farming all the time.

202
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,557
I never even imagined
getting my nails done.

203
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,102
Back then,

204
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:22,898
although you were the youngest,
you were the most considerate.

205
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,360
You always knew

206
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,655
what was going on
just by looking at my face.

207
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,541
That's how it is
between a parent and a child.

208
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,628
You don't have to say a word.

209
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,423
You can tell just by
the look on their face.

210
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:54,471
My daughter suddenly shows up one day

211
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,558
and she has
the look on her face that I had

212
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,270
when my husband had an affair
and ran away,

213
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,355
creditors came and destroyed my house,

214
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,066
and my future seemed so grim.

215
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,861
So…

216
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,197
how can I not recognize it?

217
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,126
It must've been so tough for you.

218
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,479
Your children will start school soon,

219
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,648
and I'm now too old and tired
to look after them.

220
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,818
I don't know what's going on,

221
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,030
but seeing how you came back
with all your stuff,

222
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,409
it looks like you've come to stay.

223
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,039
I know it wasn't easy for you to come.

224
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,041
And it might not be easy,

225
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,335
but let's live together.

226
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,756
I once heard this singer sing on TV

227
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,218
that if you live on,

228
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,929
you can continue to live.

229
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,767
-Okay.
-All right.

230
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,482
You feel pain there? Why?

231
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,858
When did it start?

232
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,861
After seeing that pretty lady.

233
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,114
Who could it be?

234
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,158
Ms. Jin!

235
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,080
I made it according to your instructions.

236
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,998
Okay. Put it there.

237
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,251
-Give it to them in there.
-Okay.

238
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:02,015
I know how much you care
for your own piglets.

239
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,103
But this piglet has lost its mom.

240
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,230
Please share your milk, okay?

241
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,570
Goodness.

242
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,655
You must've been hungry.

243
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,533
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

244
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,996
It was scheduled
for sawdust to arrive today,

245
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,874
but the forecast says
there is an 80% chance of rain.

246
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,585
Let's push it back then.
Ask them to come when it's dry.

247
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,502
Okay.

248
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,806
Kang-ho.

249
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,017
It's forecast to rain today.

250
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,103
We have a hospital appointment
so stay home, okay?

251
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,563
Don't go outside.

252
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,608
Okay.

253
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,740
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

254
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,466
Hello.

255
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,926
Hello.

256
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,345
You're so adorable!

257
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,263
What's its name?

258
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,390
-Tiger.
-"Tiger"?

259
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,477
That's a unique name.

260
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,938
May I hold it?

261
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,357
Here. Careful.

262
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,151
-Tiger, careful. Come here.
-There we go.

263
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,070
Hello.

264
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,782
By the way, who are you?
I've never seen you here before.

265
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,911
Ms. Jo, it's me, Mi-joo.

266
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,205
Mi-joo?

267
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,625
Goodness! Gum-ja's youngest daughter!

268
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,044
-Yes.
-Yes, it's you!

269
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,256
You've grown really old,
so I didn't recognize you.

270
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,175
I thought you were in America.
Did you come back?

271
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,886
-Yes.
-I see.

272
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,809
How have you been?

273
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,938
I've been busy.
Life is really busy over there.

274
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,898
Mi-joo.

275
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,780
INTRUSION UPON HABITATION

276
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,324
I'm feeling it. Wait.

277
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,995
"Criminal Act, Article 319,
Intrusion upon Habitation."

278
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,872
"A person who intrudes upon
one’s residence, guarded building,

279
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,417
structure, ship, or occupied room,
shall be punished

280
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,628
for up to three years
or by a fine under five million won."

281
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,965
"Intrusion into My Heart"!

282
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,176
When did you come in?

283
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,887
Into my heart?

284
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,517
Into my tightly shut heart?

285
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,603
It'll sound good with a bit of work.

286
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,855
Oh, my.

287
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,234
Darn it.

288
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,830
Darn it.

289
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,966
Excuse me. Outsiders can't come in here.

290
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,429
Lady, why are you here?

291
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,723
How did you…

292
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,017
I get it now. This poop-smelling truck.

293
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,102
This is where the poop smell comes from!

294
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,021
What will you do about this?

295
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,482
-What is that?
-My clothes.

296
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,859
They're all ruined
because of the poop smell!

297
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,904
I'm sorry if the smell caused
any inconvenience.

298
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,405
It's usually fine,

299
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,617
but when it's windy and rainy,
it gets a little worse.

300
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,494
"A little worse"?

301
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,829
No one can breathe around here.

302
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,207
We're doing our best about that.

303
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,876
We have a smell reduction system
and sprayed ozonated water,

304
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,838
but no matter how clean we keep the place,
they're still livestock.

305
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,050
It's impossible to get rid of
the smell completely.

306
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,260
If you can't get rid of the smell,

307
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,514
you should get rid of the pig farm!

308
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:15,143
You're ruining other people's careers
just to make a living for yourself.

309
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,853
Isn't that right?

310
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,106
What are you talking about?

311
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,690
I didn't ruin anyone's career!

312
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,651
I'm a composer. An artist.

313
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,904
But I'm unable to do anything
because of this poop smell.

314
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,490
What if I can never write songs again?

315
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,492
Are you going to provide for me?

316
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,993
I'm warning you.

317
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,411
Stop being disrespectful.

318
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,163
Or what? What will you do?

319
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,623
Then I'll stop being polite too.

320
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,376
So you're a composer?
But you can't write a song?

321
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,461
Let me tell you why.

322
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,463
It's not because of the smell of the poop.

323
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,174
It's because you're an awful person!

324
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,093
You have no basic manners for others

325
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,761
and zero authenticity!

326
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,429
Forget it.

327
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,974
My business is legally registered,

328
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,227
and I'm operating my farm
without any legal problems.

329
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,104
So if you have any issues,

330
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,107
go file a complaint or sue me!

331
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,608
Do whatever you want.

332
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,736
I have no manners?

333
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,032
I'll show you what I'm made of.

334
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,409
You're dead.

335
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,162
Livestock Division!

336
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,330
-Livestock Division!
-How may I help you?

337
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,010
Livestock Division…

338
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,137
How may I help you, sir?

339
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,517
Is this

340
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,603
the Livestock Division?

341
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,021
It's the Livestock Division.

342
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,150
I thought you'd like pizza.
But you didn't even finish half.

343
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,028
It's too greasy, and it tastes bad.

344
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,654
Wait.

345
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:54,409
When we go to America, do we
have to eat food like this every day?

346
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,745
It's awful.

347
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,289
Can you just ask Dad to live in Korea?

348
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,709
Right, when will he come?

349
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,127
Well…

350
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,424
Things are busy at the beauty salon,
so he can't come for a while.

351
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,179
What a relief.

352
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,515
Right? I was scared that he might come.

353
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,477
-What?
-Look, there's a clothing store.

354
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,397
The nail salon next door?

355
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,608
It's been closed for a while.

356
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,277
They picked the wrong business.

357
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,950
Most of the customers
around here are elderly farmers.

358
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,286
Who would get their nails done
in this rural village?

359
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,414
I'm about to go bust too.

360
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,589
It's a hassle to do it every year,

361
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,342
but once we cut and dry them,

362
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,970
we can eat pumpkin seeds,
porridge, pancakes,

363
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,888
and rice cake all winter.

364
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,266
It's the best snack, isn't it?

365
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,059
I mean,

366
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:05,855
I always tell her
we should all come and work together.

367
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:10,277
How come she never shows up?

368
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,904
Don't be so harsh on her.

369
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,948
It's not easy to raise pigs.

370
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,117
I'm not talking about Young-soon!

371
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,122
Let me ask you something.

372
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,918
Mr. Son, when, where, how, and why…

373
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,839
did you meet someone like her?

374
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,466
I've never heard the story either.

375
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,721
I haven't been able to tell you
for the sake of our village's safety.

376
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,434
But I think it's finally time.

377
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,604
She was actually…

378
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,697
a daughter of a newly rising yakuza boss

379
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,990
in Japan.

380
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,241
-What?
-What?

381
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,580
Her family had to disperse
to avoid their enemies' attacks.

382
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,833
And that's how
she ended up coming to Korea.

383
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,587
She wandered around,

384
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,757
then she collapsed in a valley
at Mount Gyeryong.

385
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,178
I found her and saved her.

386
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,262
Excuse me.

387
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,806
Hello?

388
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,100
Wake up.

389
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,435
Are you all right?

390
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,985
If her true identity is leaked,

391
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,445
there will be…

392
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,197
-Goodness!
-Goodness.

393
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,573
…bloodshed in this village.

394
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,243
So if you don't want to die…

395
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,372
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

396
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,499
Get the porridge ready.

397
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,459
Pumpkin porridge.

398
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,843
You totally got us!

399
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,720
You scared us!

400
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,056
It's not like you to make such jokes.

401
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,933
"Get the porridge ready!"

402
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,476
-Goodness!
-My gosh!

403
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,811
Good grief!

404
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,354
You scared me!

405
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,897
I'm sorry.

406
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,899
I'm late, aren't I?

407
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,568
What?

408
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,986
Which one should I cut open first?

409
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,953
-My gosh!
-What's up with you?

410
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,789
-My gosh.
-Look at this.

411
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,499
I don't want to die.

412
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,376
Your nails are so pretty!

413
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,629
Mi-joo did it for you, right?

414
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,926
I already know you take
great care of your farm.

415
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:44,389
But we're civil servants,
so we must deal with complaints.

416
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,559
I'm sorry my farm
is taking up your busy schedule.

417
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,727
Don't mention it.

418
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,479
I should speak with you in person,

419
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,356
but it's foot-and-mouth disease
control period

420
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,899
so farm visits are restricted.

421
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,443
Yes, I'm well aware.

422
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,864
I'll do what I can to take care of it,
so don't worry about it.

423
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,323
Yes.

424
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,867
Okay. Goodbye.

425
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,590
Mom, look.

426
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,385
I can fully squeeze this now.

427
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,724
You're the best.

428
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,894
See? All the exercise
is paying off, isn't it?

429
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,061
Yes.

430
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,356
If you continue to practice walking
and treat your legs,

431
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,442
you'll be able to walk very soon.

432
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,359
Gosh.

433
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,573
Mom.

434
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,618
There's something I want.

435
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,328
-Something you want?
-Yes.

436
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,790
There's something you want?

437
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,709
Tell me. I'll buy anything for you.

438
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:56,878
A dog.

439
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,297
-A dog?
-Yes.

440
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,591
We have a dog at the farm. Yellow.

441
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,635
No, not like Yellow.

442
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,347
A dog that I can keep in the room
like Ms. Jo's dog.

443
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,641
A dog that I can carry in my arms.

444
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,185
No, you can't have that.

445
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,978
And in the room?

446
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,149
What about all the fur?
And who will pick up after it?

447
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,318
Who will feed and wash it?

448
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,153
I will! I'll do everything.

449
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,325
Kang-ho, who made you breakfast
this morning?

450
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,661
You did.

451
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,622
Who bathed you and helped you get dressed?

452
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,335
Goodness.

453
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,087
And you have rhinitis too.

454
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,171
So, no.

455
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,714
Come on, Mom. Please.

456
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,800
-Please, just this once.
-No.

457
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,636
You can't have a dog.

458
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,477
HAPPY FARM

459
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,064
We're here. Let's go.

460
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,492
Good. One second.

461
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,205
Kang-ho, great job.

462
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,084
Let's try moving your feet.

463
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,168
How…

464
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,297
can I live with this?

465
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,718
Don't get discouraged.

466
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,679
Kang-ho. Look at me.

467
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,308
You're doing great right now.
You got this.

468
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,352
You're a miracle.
A miracle in our hospital.

469
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,313
Not everyone can recover so quick--

470
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,523
-No, dog.
-Yes, dawg, you're tough!

471
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,774
Tougher than anyone!

472
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,067
No, not that!

473
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,029
That dog! I want that dog!

474
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,407
Oh, my Happy?

475
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,036
You can't have Happy. That's my dog.

476
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,207
The foot-and-mouth disease also broke out
in North Gyeongsang.

477
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:02,587
Quarantine authorities are doing
everything they can to prevent the spread.

478
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,505
Next story.

479
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,049
-Ms. Jin Young-soon.
-Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo

480
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,550
-Come to the endoscopy room.
-of the Jeilmirae Party

481
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,801
-Yes.
-declared candidacy

482
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,887
for the primary presidential election.

483
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,764
Park Min-hui reports.

484
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,266
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo,

485
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,977
with the highest approval ratings
as a potential candidate,

486
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,063
-held a press conference
-That's…

487
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,314
in his office in Yeouido,

488
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,149
-officially declaring
-"Oh Tae-soo…"

489
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,525
his presidential candidacy.

490
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,236
-His first schedule
-He's that prosecutor.

491
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,614
-was visiting a nearby market
-Oh, my.

492
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,491
-to encourage businesses.
-He must be running for president.

493
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,909
-The marketplace was packed
-Ms. Jin.

494
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,994
-with reporters and supporters.
-Come in.

495
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,204
-Okay.
-Assemblyman Oh

496
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,581
promised the revitalization
of local marketplaces

497
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,583
and took his first step for the campaign.

498
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,767
-I need to make a bathroom run.
-Okay.

499
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,748
What's this?

500
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,390
He was with another woman.

501
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,642
He even had a child with her.

502
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,860
He wanted to marry you,

503
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,321
so he killed her and his child.

504
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,245
I can't believe this.

505
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,466
Do you expect me to believe this?

506
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,594
Dad, what's wrong with you?

507
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,013
Fine.

508
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,434
Let's say this is true.

509
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,479
Why didn't you
report him to the police then?

510
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,446
It was 30 years ago.

511
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,450
He knew I was involved
in his father's death.

512
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,869
He's trying to use you
to take revenge on me.

513
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,165
Jujubes are said to be
natural tranquilizers.

514
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,709
You said your symptoms weren't severe,

515
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,045
so don't take any medication.

516
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,172
Just have some jujube tea before bed.

517
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,302
I went to the marketplace in the morning
to get them, so don't throw them away.

518
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,306
If I report him to the police
and an investigation is launched,

519
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,268
everything will be exposed to the world.

520
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,814
And that'll be the end of me.

521
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,944
Ha-young.

522
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,987
We should end this first.

523
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,001
If news of his
son's draft evasion breaks out,

524
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,546
people will turn their backs.

525
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,923
This is why

526
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,844
it's best to have daughters
since they're free of military service.

527
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,639
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

528
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,225
Ha-young.

529
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,020
-What happened to your hand?
-Hello.

530
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,482
Goodness.

531
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,194
I gave him the pills to kill him.

532
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,988
What are you saying?

533
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,448
-Take her upstairs.
-Please come upstairs.

534
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,491
Dad.

535
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,077
I did it.

536
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,454
-Ha-young!
-Wait.

537
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,915
I did it, Mom.

538
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,500
Dad.

539
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,918
Dad?

540
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,461
-Please come upstairs.
-I did it.

541
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,714
Dad?

542
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,301
I'm telling you, I did it.

543
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,344
Kang-ho ended up like that,

544
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,973
so he must be like a dog off its leash.

545
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,149
He needs to be squeezed tight

546
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,443
to realize who's holding his leash, right?

547
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,695
I'll find Yang Gu-man's suicide note.

548
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,364
Mr. So, that's not a card we can play.

549
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,993
Who'll believe
what's on a criminal's suicide note?

550
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,830
Even if we do find the water bottle
with Kang-ho's blood on it,

551
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,166
how are we going to prove
Ha-young did that?

552
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,169
Oh Tae-soo knows all this.

553
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,545
He was once a prosecutor.

554
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,633
So we need to secure
a hidden ace up our sleeves

555
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,927
to use in unforeseen situations.

556
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,887
Bring me that.

557
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:26,035
I already know you take
great care of your farm.

558
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:30,498
But we're civil servants,
so we must deal with complaints.

559
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,007
What are you doing there?

560
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,176
I want to see you.

561
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,011
Mom.

562
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,555
Why are you so pretty?

563
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,350
You're prettier than people on TV.

564
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,769
You're much prettier than IU, Mom.

565
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,980
I said no.

566
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,192
Why not?

567
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,945
Mi-joo likes dogs.

568
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,072
Mi-joo?

569
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,907
Oh, my.

570
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,117
Do you remember her?

571
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,994
I keep thinking of her.

572
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,291
So please, Mom.
Buy me a dog so that I can show her.

573
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:17,295
But Mi-joo is married
and lives in America now.

574
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,880
So even if you had one,
you couldn't show her.

575
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,634
No, Mi-joo lives at Ye-jin's house.

576
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,971
I'm going to go to visit our neighbor.

577
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,806
Don't go out and stay home.

578
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,851
Don't go out.

579
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,694
Yellow.

580
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,697
Come here, Yellow.

581
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,199
Good boy. Yellow.

582
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,660
All right, come here. Good boy.

583
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,954
Come here. It's all right.

584
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,124
Good boy.

585
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,793
All right. One second.

586
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,343
Stay still, Yellow.

587
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,220
-No!
-No!

588
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,056
This can't happen! Yellow!

589
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,391
-No, Yellow! Gosh.
-Kang-ho.

590
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:16,354
Hold this. Halt immediately!

591
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,757
FROM THE PIG FARM
PLEASE ENJOY

592
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,262
You surprised me.

593
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,642
This isn't your first time seeing me.
Why are you so surprised?

594
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,227
You're right.

595
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,437
Are you going somewhere?

596
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,981
Yes, to get my nails done.

597
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,191
I see.

598
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,236
-See you around.
-Okay.

599
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,491
Wait.

600
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,577
What kind of dog is that?

601
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,289
Canine.

602
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,667
Yes, I know that.

603
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,963
I meant the breed.

604
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,633
Bi…

605
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,094
Bickering?

606
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,305
It was something like that.

607
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,515
Bishop?

608
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,977
-Bi…
-Bichon?

609
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,479
Yes, that's right.

610
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,775
Bichon.

611
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,570
Bichon.

612
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,905
Bichon.

613
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,785
I understand what you're saying,

614
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,788
but to be precise,
the farm was in the village first.

615
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,499
You moved in after.

616
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,877
There's nothing we can do
in this situation.

617
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,630
I already spoke to the farm
and provided guidance.

618
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,673
Guidance?

619
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,135
Even a street dog could
give them this much guidance.

620
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,555
What did you say?

621
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,184
I mean, a citizen is suffering from it.

622
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:22,730
My rights to the pursuit of happiness
are being violated!

623
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,482
And who provides your paycheck?

624
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,233
You're paid by our tax money.

625
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,570
I'm the reason why you're making a living!

626
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,363
You're crossing the line.

627
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,449
The farm owner is a citizen too.

628
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,659
She pays taxes too.

629
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,621
Or has she done anything illegal
at the farm?

630
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,165
Why are you giving her such a hard time?

631
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,292
What's your name? Where's your name tag?

632
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,836
And why are you yelling at me?

633
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,172
I'll call the Minister of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs

634
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:52,468
and make sure you get
the biggest lesson of your lifetime.

635
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,844
I'll end your life!

636
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,054
Go ahead.

637
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,434
Even the old villagers don't say anything,
and you roll in and do this?

638
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,895
"Roll in"? I'll show you how I roll.

639
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,940
I will defend
my right to pursue happiness!

640
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,692
I will defend
my right to pursue happiness!

641
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,331
Bichon.

642
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,500
Bichon.

643
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,627
Bichon.

644
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,045
Goodness.

645
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,464
How can I work with these hands?
They're so pretty.

646
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,050
Right? Goodness.

647
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,427
Forget working.
I don't even want them to get wet.

648
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,887
How can I cook?

649
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,973
Make your husband cook.

650
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,349
What are husbands for?

651
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,475
Should I do that?

652
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,520
My hands are as pretty as my maiden days,

653
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,064
so maybe he'll do it for me, right?

654
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,983
Oh, my.

655
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,027
Were your hands
as huge as a caldron lid back then?

656
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,030
-Caldron lids?
-Never mind.

657
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,242
Caldron lids are at least shiny.

658
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,326
You little…

659
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,537
-You and your mouth.
-Stop it.

660
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,873
When did he come and leave this here?

661
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,835
I don't think he came and left it.

662
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,254
It was in the drain.

663
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,466
Does this mean
we can't see Kang-ho anymore?

664
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,262
No way. We live in the same village.

665
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,306
We'll run into each other sometimes.

666
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,017
Do we pretend he's a stranger?

667
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,270
I'm sure a little nod will be fine.

668
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,524
Poor Kang-ho.

669
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,985
He must be bored without us.

670
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:37,489
But why do we seem more bored
than he might be?

671
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,292
Kang-ho!

672
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,753
I mean, Kang-ho oppa.

673
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,671
I mean, Uncle Kang-ho.

674
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,798
Seo-jin, Ye-jin. What brings you here?

675
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,925
This is our home,

676
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,719
so we're usually here.

677
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,721
Right.

678
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,183
Anyway, what's that?

679
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,851
My goodness.

680
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,645
Is that a pig?

681
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,606
This is my pet pig,

682
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:12,983
Lion!

683
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,611
A dog named Tiger

684
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,364
and a pig named Lion.

685
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,741
What an odd village.

686
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,284
May I hold the pig?

687
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,411
Sure.

688
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,416
Be careful.

689
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,547
By the way,
are there any other people in the house?

690
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,840
Other people?

691
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,550
There are lots of people.

692
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,386
Lots?

693
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,972
No, Lion!

694
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,432
-No!
-No!

695
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,393
-No!
-Lion!

696
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,311
-No!
-Catch it!

697
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,522
I have to give it to Mi-joo!

698
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,607
What?

699
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,609
Kang-ho left with a pig?

700
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:58,112
I deserve to die, Ms. Jin.

701
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,073
That punk.

702
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,492
HAPPY FARM, PIG FARM, OFFICE

703
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,873
-Wait, Lion!
-Hurry up!

704
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,209
-Hurry up and catch it!
-No, Lion!

705
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,211
-Lion!
-Lion!

706
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,504
Lion!

707
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,135
Choi Kang-ho!

708
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,137
-Catch it!
-Lion!

709
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,013
-Lion!
-Lion!

710
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,391
-Lion!
-Run!

711
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,145
-Lion!
-Lion!

712
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,229
Yes.

713
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,230
You said you know

714
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,190
the Minister of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs, right?

715
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,817
How do you know him?

716
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,153
Yes, the minister has a daughter.

717
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,613
The daughter's friend? Yes.

718
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,656
And…

719
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,825
Hey, if that's the case,

720
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,161
I might be closer to him, you punk.

721
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,581
-Hey, listen.
-Lion!

722
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,166
-Lion!
-Lion!

723
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,876
-Lion!
-Where are you going?

724
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,002
-I'll really kill--
-Lion!

725
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,170
-Lion!
-Lion!

726
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,839
-Lion!
-Lion!

727
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,466
I just had an accident.

728
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,093
Yes, I was driving!

729
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,261
I'm sorry!

730
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,804
Hey, stop right there!

731
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,431
You rascals!

732
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,933
Damn it!

733
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,644
Damn it! Hey!

734
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,273
-Lion!
-Lion!

735
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,942
-No!
-I can't.

736
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,027
No!

737
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,741
Guys, come on.

738
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,701
I can't run anymore!

739
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,953
Yes, we're done.

740
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,705
You should go.

741
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,375
Come here.

742
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,669
If your mom catches
the three of us on that,

743
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,962
we're dead meat.

744
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,714
We're already dead because of Lion.

745
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,257
Come quickly!

746
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,178
Kang-ho!

747
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,096
-Ye-jin!
-Seo-jin!

748
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,348
-Assemble!
-Assemble!

749
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,516
Seo-jin!

750
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,559
Ye-jin!

751
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,480
-Move!
-Move!

752
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,898
-Lion!
-All right!

753
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,067
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

754
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,693
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

755
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,736
-Bye.
-Bye.

756
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,904
-See you later.
-Thanks.

757
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:04,947
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

758
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,241
-Bye!
-Goodbye.

759
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,580
-Mom.
-Yes?

760
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,916
Should I open a nail salon here?

761
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,960
You saw how thrilled they were.

762
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,712
Women will be women
even in a rural village.

763
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,381
They all want to be pretty.

764
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,092
What do you think?

765
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,260
Do you have

766
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,053
enough money?

767
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,641
How will you open it?

768
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,352
Just go set the table.

769
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,105
Come on, Mom.

770
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,277
Stop right there!

771
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,445
Mom, catch it!

772
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,780
-Catch Lion!
-Catch the pig!

773
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:47,906
-Mom, hurry!
-Mom!

774
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,992
-Catch the pig!
-Catch it, Mom!

775
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,619
-Catch the pig!
-Mom, catch it!

776
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,662
Lion!

777
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,415
Mom, catch Lion!

778
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,666
-Catch Lion!
-Mom, hurry!

779
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,585
-Lion!
-Catch it!

780
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,919
She caught it! Mom!

781
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,838
-Yes.
-What a relief.

782
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,256
What a relief.

783
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,299
Thank you.

784
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,262
Lion.

785
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,315
It's…

786
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,162
Choi Kang-ho!

787
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,331
Run! Now!

788
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,625
Stop right there!

789
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,293
-Hurry up!
-Hurry!

790
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,377
That little…

791
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:43,879
Darn it.

792
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,466
Hello?

793
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,926
Yes, Director.

794
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,013
Yes, regarding the dog
you asked about earlier.

795
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:57,059
Let me call you back right back.

796
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,518
Stop right there!

797
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,027
Mi-joo?

798
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,035
Oh, my.

799
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,747
Kang-ho really was talking about you.

800
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,833
Goodness, he mentioned Mi-joo?

801
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,461
He kept saying he had to show her a dog,

802
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,588
and I had no idea what he meant.

803
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,175
Anyway, are you back for good?
What about your husband?

804
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,719
Well, the thing is…

805
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,639
He owns a huge beauty salon in America.

806
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:36,640
Right.

807
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,308
She's back for the children.

808
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,227
It's just her for now.

809
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,895
I see.

810
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,357
But isn't it wonderful?

811
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,443
Your husband is successful,
and you have adorable children.

812
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,362
Right.

813
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,533
Is Kang-ho back?

814
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,911
Yes, don't let him into the piggery.

815
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,540
I'm sorry. I have to get going.

816
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,463
-Come by for a visit.
-Okay.

817
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,298
-Bye.
-All right.

818
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,467
-Bye.
-Bye.

819
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,852
If I catch them, I'll kill them.

820
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,573
What is this? What's this water?

821
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,949
Wait a second.

822
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,827
It smells like disinfectant.

823
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,996
ALL INCOMING CARS
MUST BE DISINFECTED

824
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,709
Do you know how sensitive pigs are?

825
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,879
When one of them is infected,
they all get sick.

826
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,299
This one ran all around the village,

827
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,093
so who knows what it caught?

828
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,220
What are we going to do with it?

829
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,806
I'm sorry.

830
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,726
It lost its mom
and is the runt of the litter

831
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,936
that gets pushed around by other pigs.

832
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,773
I had to feed the poor thing
through a surrogate mom.

833
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,400
Mom.

834
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,444
Can I keep this one?

835
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,654
I'll feed it,

836
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,740
wash it, and put it to sleep.

837
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,949
What?

838
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:21,369
I have you,
but this pig doesn't have a mom.

839
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,455
I'll be its mom.

840
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,208
Nonsense.

841
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,960
How will you raise
a dirty and smelly pig at home?

842
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:34,716
"Everyone thinks
pigs are dirty and smelly,

843
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,426
but that's not the case."

844
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,721
"They not only
do their business in one place,

845
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,556
but they also only sleep
where it's clean."

846
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,645
"But humans started to lock them up
in tiny pigsties."

847
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,481
"Isn't that so sad?"

848
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,486
That's what you said.

849
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,617
Who could it be?

850
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,869
All right.

851
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,162
Come here.

852
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,206
Let's go inside.

853
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,791
Go in. I'll be right back.

854
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,926
Coming!

855
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,263
Who is it?

856
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,599
Hey. Are you kidding me?

857
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,728
Oh, no.

858
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,272
Are you bummed about the food?

859
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,898
Then look at my car.

860
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,818
I almost totaled the car not long ago.

861
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,695
But you let out the darned pig again

862
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,531
and made me drive it into a ditch.

863
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,699
I'll have to scrap it!

864
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,493
I don't know what happened,

865
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:48,248
but I'll compensate you if you were harmed
in any way because of us.

866
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,584
Okay, good.
Then give me a billion won a year.

867
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,168
What?

868
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,545
I'm a composer.

869
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,340
I write at least 60 songs a year
for 10 million each,

870
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,092
so that's 600 million won.

871
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:01,011
Plus the royalty

872
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,429
and album sales.

873
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,098
You haven't even released
ten songs altogether.

874
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,475
And they're off the market

875
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,019
because of plagiarism.

876
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,313
You were sued for the newest song

877
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:15,025
because it was the same as
"Ripe Persimmon" by Na Hoon-a.

878
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,402
-What's your problem?
-Goodness.

879
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,113
Are you a detective or something?

880
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,866
-Who the heck are you?
-What's with you?

881
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,451
-Let go!
-What the…

882
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,161
-Who are you?
-Hey!

883
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,120
Hey!

884
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,500
Darn it. Hey!

885
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,630
So you're saying

886
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,383
Mr. Choi Kang-ho here attacked you first?

887
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,301
Yes.

888
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,888
I'm sorry.

889
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,182
I won't do that again. I'm sorry.

890
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,017
Don't apologize.

891
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,852
You didn't do anything wrong.

892
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,396
You did nothing wrong, okay?

893
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,067
I mean,

894
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,654
there's no son who would hold back
when he sees his mom

895
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,280
being grabbed and hurled on the floor.

896
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,951
I was grabbing her,

897
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,579
but he suddenly rushed at me,

898
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,165
then pushed me, so I let go of her.

899
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,833
I'm not going to settle.

900
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,293
Just arrest him.

901
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,046
All right, don't be like this.

902
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,632
Ms. Jin here is
a woman of great character,

903
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,301
and she has a great relationship
with everyone here.

904
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,887
You've become neighbors now, so--

905
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,263
"Neighbors"?

906
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,432
I'm a civil man,
so I haven't done anything,

907
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,601
but I can sue them for a lot of things.

908
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,811
Hey, tell them.

909
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,355
You intruded on my house,

910
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,024
and then you brought
that pig out on the road.

911
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,485
That's why I'm in this mess.
Isn't that so?

912
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,528
It's Lion.

913
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,238
It was a pig, you idiot!

914
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,155
Hey!

915
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,242
"Idiot"?

916
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:51,746
My son is much smarter
and has much better judgment than you do!

917
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,125
Then you tell me
with your better judgment.

918
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,461
Did you see me get into a car accident?

919
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,380
-Did you or did you not?
-I did!

920
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:03,967
Game over.

921
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,137
-He saw me.
-That man…

922
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:08,888
I'll really kill--

923
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,726
He saw Lion, tried to dodge it,
and then the car swerved and crashed.

924
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,936
And he said this into the phone.

925
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,230
"I just had an accident."

926
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,399
"Yes, I was driving!"

927
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:23,528
Then he got out of the car and fell down.

928
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,613
Hang on.

929
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,198
Hold on.

930
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,700
That means

931
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,786
you used your phone while driving.

932
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,373
Were you even wearing your seatbelt?

933
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,084
Well…

934
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,962
I mean,

935
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,630
well…

936
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,799
Phone use is a violation

937
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,594
of Article 49, Paragraph 1,
Item 10 of the Road Traffic Act.

938
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,679
Neglect of a seatbelt is a violation

939
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,723
of Article 50, Paragraph 1
of the Road Traffic Act.

940
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,895
-I'll fold.
-Another one.

941
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,730
-Give him one.
-I'm done.

942
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,441
Hey, bring me a pack of cigarettes!

943
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,485
-Yes.
-Here we go.

944
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,826
Bet big, will you?

945
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,994
I'll take one.

946
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,291
Enjoy your cigarettes.

947
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,464
-Hey, a pack of cigarettes.
-Yes, sir.

948
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,508
-Goodness.
-What now?

949
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,635
Okay.

950
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,428
Good work.

951
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,347
-Gosh.
-That's your paycheck.

952
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,475
You little…

953
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,562
You bastard.

954
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,563
Let go!

955
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,315
You bastard.

956
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,110
I've been looking everywhere for you.

957
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,779
-Bang Sam-sik?
-Yes, that's me, you asshole.

958
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,906
You knew it was stolen, right?

959
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,283
You sent me there knowing it was stolen.

960
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:55,036
I rotted in prison for months
because of you!

961
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,704
Your friend is a prosecutor!

962
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,041
I thought he would get you out.

963
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,086
He was never my friend, you punk.

964
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,254
Goodness!

965
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,674
This afternoon,
a violent fight between gangs broke out

966
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:11,511
at an adult entertainment business
in Ilcheong-dong,

967
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,556
-resulting in 2 deaths and 17 injuries.
-Goodness.

968
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,142
It must be heartbreaking news

969
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,395
for the parents of those punks.

970
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:24,858
You know, Sam-sik may have quick hands,

971
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,818
but he doesn't get into fights.

972
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,319
Isn't that a relief?

973
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,073
Don't I look different today?

974
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,492
My head hurts. Oh, my.

975
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,493
Wait.

976
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,791
These fell off your nails.

977
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,918
How did those end up there?

978
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:47,005
No, it's all right.

979
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,758
My wife looks

980
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:55,972
so sexy for the first time in 40 years.

981
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,184
What's with you? Gosh.

982
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,270
Oh, my.

983
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,105
-Just eat your meal.
-No.

984
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,398
Oh, my.

985
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,357
Next story.

986
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,902
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo, the presidential
candidate of the Jeilmirae Party,

987
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:12,071
volunteered to do laundry
at the temporary shelter

988
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,115
for flood victims in Anseon,

989
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,576
now designated as a special disaster area
due to the typhoon.

990
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,370
Assemblyman Oh
made his visit with his family

991
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:23,416
and was surprised to see
how the situation seemed worse in person.

992
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,670
You're banned from going out
except for official occasions.

993
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,924
Don't schedule any performances
for the time being

994
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,300
and don't meet anybody.

995
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:35,011
Is that my next job?

996
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,723
Sure, I'll do as you say.

997
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,685
If you're still worried, take this.

998
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,980
You never know
when I'll start acting crazy again.

999
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:48,858
Ha-young.

1000
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,694
Listen to me carefully.

1001
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:58,076
If you ever get in my way,
I will not condone it,

1002
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,329
even if it's you.

1003
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,541
Dad.

1004
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,753
Don't worry.

1005
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,174
Nothing in Korea can threaten you.

1006
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,426
-Hello, Assemblyman Oh.
-Hello.

1007
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,762
-Are you doing okay?
-I'm fine.

1008
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,307
Unless…

1009
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,561
he regains his memories.

1010
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,026
Let's get rid of

1011
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,820
Choi Kang-ho.

1012
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,288
Hey, Kang-ho.

1013
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:44,914
Yes?

1014
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,249
Well…

1015
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,962
About what you said at the police station.

1016
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:54,132
You know, the Road Traffic Act.

1017
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,217
How did you remember that?

1018
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,303
Road Traffic…

1019
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,725
What? What's that?

1020
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,654
Kang-ho.

1021
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,781
You go in first.

1022
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,783
I'm going to stop by Mr. Son's place.

1023
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,035
I'll go too.

1024
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,537
No, I'll be quick.

1025
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,623
But still…

1026
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,626
Right, what about Lion?

1027
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,171
Lion didn't have dinner.
It must be hungry.

1028
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,464
Right, Lion.

1029
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,259
Okay, then. Come home quickly.

1030
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,095
-Okay.
-I'll feed Lion so come back quickly.

1031
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,356
Goodness.

1032
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:56,235
What kind of a jerk made a scene
and made you suffer like this?

1033
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,820
Goodness, it's okay.

1034
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,448
It's just a stomach cramp.

1035
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,867
The medicine will help me feel better.

1036
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,953
This is bad. You're sick so often.

1037
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:10,124
Our medicine cabinet
is empty because of you.

1038
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,671
Goodness, woman. Stop talking nonsense.

1039
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,464
You and that red face mask!

1040
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,341
I'm just saying.

1041
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,218
Don't worry about it,

1042
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:23,179
although it's costing us a fortune
to refill the medications.

1043
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,222
What?

1044
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,224
I'm sorry.

1045
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:30,436
I'll go to town and refill
your medicine cabinet tomorrow.

1046
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,521
Goodness, no.

1047
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,814
It's all right.

1048
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:36,609
Anyway, if you're this sick,
shouldn't you get a checkup?

1049
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,612
I got a gastroscopy yesterday.

1050
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,364
I'll get the result next week.

1051
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:45,076
It's because you have
too much on your plate.

1052
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,163
I'll meet with that composer or whatever,

1053
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,040
so don't worry about him.

1054
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,167
Thank you, Mr. Son.

1055
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,548
Will you do something
about that red face thing?

1056
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,800
Take it off or turn it off!

1057
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,803
Damn it. It's yellow now.

1058
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:29,495
I'm relieved that Mom
is at Mr. Son's place.

1059
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:34,876
Gosh, Lion. What are you going to do now?

1060
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,336
You're going to get kicked out.

1061
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:43,926
Mom.

1062
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:45,970
Mom?

1063
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,306
No!

1064
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,477
No.

1065
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,657
Who are you?

1066
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,629
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1067
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,021
Promise me you won't
get into trouble like last time.

1068
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:40,274
-Promise.
-Mi-joo!

1069
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,442
Mi-joo!

1070
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,819
Do you know him?

1071
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:44,862
No, I…

1072
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,031
I don't want to see you anymore.

1073
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,742
This is the last time
I'll be helping you out.

1074
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:50,827
Mom.

1075
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,161
Please help me, sir.

1076
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,164
-Help me.
-Sam-sik.

1077
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:56,958
Are we friends?

1078
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,919
How dare they say that to our friend?

1079
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:03,047
The pig farm was kind of an inconvenience.
We can't deny that.

1080
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:06,968
And now, she'll be betrayed
by the villagers she trusted.

1081
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:08,970
Mom.

1082
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:16,602
