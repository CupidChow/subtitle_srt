00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,338
Who are you?

3
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,839
Who are you people?

4
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,426
Kang-ho!

5
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,182
Kang-ho!

6
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,689
Ma'am, it's been a while.

7
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,651
Your late husband

8
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,070
was such a courageous man.

9
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:55,115
And Kang-ho takes after him.

10
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,577
I took care of him like my own.
What an ungrateful kid.

11
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,495
Let me see.

12
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,457
Tell me, Kang-ho.

13
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,418
What were you going to do to me?

14
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,671
-Mom!
-Stop it.

15
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,339
Stop it.

16
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,590
Stop it!

17
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,802
Stop it…

18
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,722
Please…

19
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,766
Please don't do this.

20
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,521
You know he had an accident
and hurt his head.

21
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,106
He doesn't remember anything.

22
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,777
He can't harm you!

23
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,028
Who knows?

24
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,781
He could remember everything any day

25
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,409
and stab me in my back, couldn't he?

26
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,621
I heard he's gathered
tons of evidence against me

27
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,082
while working for me all these years.

28
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,126
I'm here to find it.

29
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,377
It's not here.

30
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,046
Not anymore.

31
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,548
Look at that.

32
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,592
I burned it all.

33
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,927
You did? Why?

34
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,389
I knew it. So there was something, right?

35
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,478
I did it so he wouldn't
go back to his old life.

36
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,984
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea
after finding out who his father was.

37
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,778
I didn't want him
to be in any more danger.

38
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,238
I'm telling you the truth.

39
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,493
He doesn't know what went on between us.

40
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,458
And what exactly

41
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,627
was that?

42
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,802
Let me…

43
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,097
answer that question.

44
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,016
No.

45
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,143
No!

46
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,186
No!

47
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,941
HAPPY FARM, PIG FARM, OFFICE

48
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,525
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

49
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,110
Kang-ho.

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,155
Kang-ho.

51
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,427
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

52
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,345
EPISODE 10

53
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,723
Jeez, I'm so sick of him.

54
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,767
What's wrong? Was that your son?

55
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,685
Yes.

56
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,771
TO-DO LIST FOR HAPPY FARM REOPENING
100 MOTHER PIGS, DISINFECT PIGGERY…

57
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:35,149
…after all that his dad went through
to get him that job.

58
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,902
But he already quit
after working there for a few days.

59
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,488
-What's the reason this time?
-It's obvious.

60
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,908
He still wants to become a movie director.

61
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:44,867
Goodness.

62
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:50,707
I heard even decent directors struggle
for years without making any money.

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,001
Does he think
he's Bong Joon-ho or something?

64
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,753
Maybe I'm Bong Joon-ho.

65
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,839
After all, I gave birth to a parasite.

66
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,424
I'm sick of him.

67
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:03,720
Gosh, it takes boys ages to mature.

68
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,180
They might once they
have a family of their own.

69
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,809
My son completely changed
after getting married.

70
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,103
-Is that so?
-Yes.

71
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,065
He has a loving wife
and adorable children to look after.

72
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,525
So of course he has to mature.

73
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,903
MARRY HIM OFF

74
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,324
You're going to suffer
worse symptoms soon.

75
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,534
I don't think
taking medicine will suffice.

76
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,746
Why don't you get hospitalized
and receive treatment?

77
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,913
I can't do that.

78
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,584
What I mean is…

79
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,295
Later.

80
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,673
There are some things
I need to do right now.

81
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,593
Lion, look at this.

82
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,014
"Choi Kang-ho,
Supreme Prosecutors' Office."

83
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,600
Isn't it cool?

84
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,287
Lion, do I look like myself
in the picture?

85
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,170
Lion, that's it. Come here.

86
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,173
Good job.

87
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,508
Lion, come here.

88
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,343
-Gosh.
-Where are you going?

89
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,260
Goodness.

90
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,554
-Hi, Lion.
-Lion!

91
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,352
Lion has become so much stronger.

92
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,646
You're right.

93
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,941
We should build a separate house for her.

94
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,860
Let's build her a small house

95
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,196
so she can get used to
living in an enclosed space

96
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,615
until she's ready to have piglets.

97
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,912
Then, in the future, she won't have any
problems living with other pigs.

98
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,873
-Other pigs?
-Yes.

99
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,835
We're getting new pigs next week.

100
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,089
Does that mean you're going to
run the farm again?

101
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:04,966
No.

102
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,969
You will.

103
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,306
From now on,
you're the owner of Happy Farm.

104
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,935
Then

105
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,854
what about my job as a prosecutor?

106
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,106
I won't be a prosecutor anymore?

107
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,525
Who told you that

108
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,444
you were a prosecutor?

109
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,573
Mr. Son, the ladies,
and the rest of the villagers.

110
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,534
They told me to get better
and be a prosecutor again.

111
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,286
Kang-ho.

112
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,038
Listen carefully.

113
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,124
You're no longer

114
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,750
a prosecutor.

115
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,836
No matter what people say,

116
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,797
deny it and tell them you don't know.

117
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:51,262
From now on,
you'll live a happy life running the farm.

118
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,347
I beg you.

119
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,061
Please don't remember anything
and let's just live like this, okay?

120
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,861
I know I can be a good farmer.

121
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,863
After all, you taught me everything.

122
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,743
Of course, you can. You're my son.

123
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,039
Lion.

124
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,666
Lion.

125
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,211
Lion.

126
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,340
Here you are.

127
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,012
Lion, I'm the owner now.

128
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,015
The owner of Happy Farm.

129
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,519
I'm going to build you a new house.
Aren't you happy?

130
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,983
But it feels weird.

131
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,654
Everyone is telling me to get better
so that I can return

132
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,489
to being a prosecutor.

133
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,575
But not my mom.

134
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,079
She told me not to remember anything
because it'll be dangerous.

135
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,711
I wonder what happened.

136
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,590
-Kang-ho oppa!
-We're here!

137
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,177
Let's go, Lion.

138
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,806
Could you please give me
a 50,000-won discount?

139
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,143
You're unbelievable.

140
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,647
You're like the Yeouido interchange
at 6 p.m. on a weekday.

141
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,440
"Yeouido interchange"?

142
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,775
There's no getting through to you.

143
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,027
Gosh.

144
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,612
I bought it for my girlfriend

145
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,115
to celebrate our 1,000th day together.

146
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,535
But she cheated on me.

147
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,332
Were you happy

148
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:48,337
For the past 1,000 days?

149
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,047
Mi-joo

150
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,383
-Mi-joo
-All right. Quiet down.

151
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,552
I'll transfer the money right now.

152
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,138
You've made a wise decision.

153
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,307
I'll wrap it up right away.

154
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,154
Hello, sir. Have you been well?

155
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,116
Something strange was wired
to my bank account just now.

156
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,952
The amount should have been
200 million won,

157
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,413
but it's missing two zeros.

158
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,916
Just like how you'll be missing

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,960
both of your kidneys soon.

160
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,504
I wired you the interest first.

161
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,215
I see. So that's what it is.

162
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,467
Then when will I

163
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,637
be able to receive the principal?

164
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,057
Don't take it the wrong way.

165
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,601
I'm not rushing you.

166
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,646
Why would I? Right, Sam-sik?

167
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,148
Your house is worth 180 million won.

168
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,901
Your mill is worth 250 million won.

169
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,943
Right.

170
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,529
Your parents also set up

171
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,240
life insurance for you.

172
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,744
Please, sir!

173
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,537
Sam-sik's head

174
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,916
Is hanging from the eastern cottonwood

175
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,461
You better wire me the rest
by this weekend if you want to avoid that.

176
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,219
Don't sing.

177
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,263
Don't sing, you punk!

178
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,265
Hey.

179
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,478
What did the streetlamp sing
for you to beat it up?

180
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,649
Say hello. They're from the
Rural Development Administration.

181
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,275
The Rural Development Administration?

182
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,194
Hello.

183
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,530
We stumbled across this
while visiting some farms.

184
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,198
Gosh.

185
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,575
You did an excellent job
growing the lettuce.

186
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,745
I highly doubt
that this lousy kid grew them.

187
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,998
Where are those men?

188
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,459
-Lion!
-Lion!

189
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,711
-Lion!
-Here she is!

190
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,714
Why do you keep coming back…

191
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,468
What were you thinking
digging a hole here?!

192
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,429
Oh, dear.

193
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,641
Ms. Jin will be upset once she finds out.

194
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,810
-Are you sure you saw it?
-Of course.

195
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,312
I may not be the brightest,
but I have great eyesight.

196
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,400
Feel free to bury me
in the lettuce field if I'm wrong.

197
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,238
Where are they going?

198
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,365
They left.

199
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,536
What… No way.

200
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,080
It was…

201
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,207
It was right here.

202
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,252
Hide!

203
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,468
-I told you to stay in the truck.
-Mom.

204
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,470
-Let me carry them. They're heavy.
-It's okay.

205
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,096
-They're heavy.
-Come on, let's go.

206
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,484
Mom.

207
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,778
Can you hold Lion for a minute?

208
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,946
Don't let her run off.

209
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,699
-Lion.
-No!

210
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,549
Goodness, he's so strong.

211
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,512
All right.

212
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,185
Have I told you

213
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,104
that I'm going to marry you?

214
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,276
-Lion!
-Lion!

215
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,278
-No! Lion!
-Lion!

216
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,077
Hello?

217
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,246
Yes.

218
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,916
Sorry?

219
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,168
Okay.

220
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,838
We have a situation!
We need to get out right now!

221
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,674
-Hurry!
-Why?

222
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,925
What's the matter?

223
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,802
Is it…

224
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,179
-who I think it is?
-Yes.

225
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,682
Mr. Bang.

226
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,392
-What?
-They want to interview us.

227
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,270
What interview?

228
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,147
About our lettuce.
We don't have much time. We must hurry.

229
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,108
Mr. Cha.

230
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,943
Step back.

231
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,822
One, two, three!

232
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,951
That worked!

233
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,252
-We have plenty of alcohol,
-Right.

234
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,130
-so have it with some pancakes.
-Goodness.

235
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,049
Gosh, why did you cook?

236
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,343
I mean,

237
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,012
I was actually peckish.

238
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,221
-Right.
-Here.

239
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,557
-Come and have some.
-Sure.

240
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,641
It looks good.

241
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,852
-Here.
-Thanks.

242
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,063
-Gosh, it looks good.
-Try some.

243
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,064
How is it?

244
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,319
This is insane.

245
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,531
What a surprise. I can't believe
you're complimenting my food.

246
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,700
It's insanely bitter.

247
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,828
What in the world did you put in?

248
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,418
It tastes just fine!

249
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,756
Look at that. I knew it.

250
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,925
You said you were on a diet.

251
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,885
Have you caved in already?

252
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,471
Goodness.

253
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,973
Darn it.

254
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,391
-Goodness!
-Come on.

255
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,185
Here you all are.

256
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,395
-Goodness, come join us.
-Come here.

257
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,147
-Come.
-Come sit.

258
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,274
-Sit here.
-Take a seat.

259
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,610
Sit and have some.

260
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,695
-It's still very hot.
-Here.

261
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,948
Are you sure there will be enough?

262
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,825
-How is it?
-It's good.

263
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,787
So you're telling me that this dish

264
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,580
is tasty, right?

265
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,665
Yes.

266
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,670
It would've been tastier
had it been less bitter.

267
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,384
How is this bitter?

268
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,427
It tastes just fine.

269
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,221
You must be making alcohol.

270
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,973
We need to make it now

271
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,975
for it to last the rest of the year.

272
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,810
We all need to help out.

273
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,978
Exactly.

274
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,563
If you need all the help you can get,

275
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,691
why do you always leave me out?

276
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,068
Don't take it the wrong way.

277
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,698
It's just that you've been so busy
taking care of the pigs and Kang-ho.

278
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,284
I know how considerate you've been
and I'm grateful for that.

279
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,413
But from now on,
please invite me and Kang-ho too.

280
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,623
We're all neighbors.

281
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,210
It hurts my feelings
whenever you leave us out.

282
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,879
-Gosh, we're not leaving you out.
-That's not true.

283
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,423
All right then.

284
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,342
From now on,
I want you and Kang-ho to join us.

285
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,762
You better make it every time
until Kang-ho fully recovers

286
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,764
and becomes a prosecutor again.

287
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,726
-Mr. Son.
-Yes?

288
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,187
Kang-ho won't go back
to being a prosecutor.

289
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,567
He never will.

290
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,739
You don't have to be so adamant about it.

291
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,948
-Mr. Son.
-Yes?

292
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,576
Remember the lady you mentioned?

293
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,828
The daughter of the family
that runs the orchard.

294
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,372
Could you set her up with Kang-ho?

295
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,665
What?

296
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,376
I want to marry him off.

297
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,627
-What?
-What?

298
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,005
You want to marry him off?

299
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,089
Yes.

300
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,343
If he meets a decent woman
and starts a family,

301
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,140
I think he'll be more stable
and happier than he is now.

302
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,225
I'd appreciate your help.

303
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,188
Okay!

304
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,856
All right!

305
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,941
As the village head of Jou-ri,

306
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,570
I'll see to it that Kang-ho gets married!

307
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,197
Let's go!

308
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,615
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

309
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,700
-Let's go!
-All right!

310
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,994
You're eating so well.

311
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,663
Are you really not going to eat?

312
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:06,168
No, I need to be slim
if I want to wear a pretty wedding dress.

313
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,588
What are you drawing?

314
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,756
Let me see.

315
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,802
It's a bride and a groom. Open up.

316
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,638
I'm going to have an outdoor wedding.

317
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,850
The groom is so handsome.

318
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,977
He has a small face and long legs.

319
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,647
-What is he holding?
-A rock.

320
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,108
He must be very strong too.

321
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,859
A man needs to be strong.

322
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,282
He's useless.

323
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,541
I'll open it.

324
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,587
Are you eating well?

325
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,339
Here, you have some too.

326
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,341
Eat up.

327
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,968
I'm done.

328
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,637
-Ta-da.
-Goodness.

329
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,805
That looks nice.

330
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,973
OWNER OF HAPPY FARM

331
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,474
"Happy Farm"?

332
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,269
Yes, Kang-ho oppa is the owner now.

333
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,355
"Owner of Happy Farm."

334
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,400
The new pigs will arrive next week.

335
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,487
Then I'll be the wife
of the owner of Happy Farm.

336
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,739
Goodness.

337
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,199
"Wife"?

338
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,492
Dream on.

339
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,703
Starting tomorrow,
he'll be looking for a match…

340
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,413
-What?
-What?

341
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,293
…to set things on fire.

342
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,003
What?

343
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,797
Gosh, it's so greasy. I need kimchi.

344
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,429
What? Why in the world would he do that?

345
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,680
What is she talking about?

346
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,896
Why did I say that
in front of my unmarried daughter?

347
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,023
I'm such a fool.

348
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,983
I'm here.

349
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,777
I'm producing an incredible song--

350
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,446
What?

351
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,908
What's going on?

352
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,368
We're done for.

353
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,539
They ran off with all the investment money

354
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,459
that we scraped using your name!

355
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,461
Hold on.

356
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,677
What is…

357
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,887
My money!

358
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,389
-Where is he?
-There he is!

359
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,642
-There he is!
-The company went under!

360
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,851
What's going on?

361
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,063
-You bastard! Give me back my money!
-You bastard!

362
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,606
-My money!
-What is this?

363
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,899
Even his hair was fake!

364
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,152
Mom.

365
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,737
Did it hurt?

366
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,698
Mom, why do I need to do this?

367
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,203
Because we need to go somewhere today.

368
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,164
Where are we going?

369
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,049
Kang-ho.

370
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,592
Look.

371
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,473
This is for your fiancée.

372
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,433
-"Fiancée"?
-Yes.

373
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,603
A friend who'll live here

374
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,065
and run the farm with you.

375
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,609
You'll care for and love each other.

376
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,444
She'll be by your side forever.

377
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,322
A friend?

378
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,242
Like Mi-joo?

379
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,077
Not her.

380
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,081
Mi-joo has people she loves,

381
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,041
so she can't be by your side.

382
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,044
And who are they?

383
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,797
There's Ye-jin, Seo-jin,

384
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,008
and their dad who's in the US.

385
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,176
That horrifying bastard?

386
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,264
You've never even met him.
You can't call him like that.

387
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,850
Don't worry.

388
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,937
I'll find you someone better than Mi-joo.

389
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,231
All right.

390
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,780
Okay now.

391
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,700
Let's get you dolled up.

392
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,287
Why isn't this working?

393
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,040
-Hold on.
-Mom.

394
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,624
Mom.

395
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,336
Step aside!

396
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,342
Mousse.

397
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,730
That's incredible.

398
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,482
-You look handsome.
-What do you say?

399
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,194
Goodness! You look so handsome.

400
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,278
What do you say?

401
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,114
Is it my turn now?

402
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,377
What on earth is her deal?

403
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,463
A yakuza's daughter.

404
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,842
Let's go pick out his clothes.

405
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,345
-Let's see.
-Goodness.

406
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,973
Look at her meddling with my work.

407
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,852
All right.

408
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,230
Let's pick some out.

409
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,397
Goodness.

410
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,982
-What about this one?
-Gosh.

411
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,275
Doesn't it look elegant?

412
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,194
He'll look intelligent.

413
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,904
Okay.

414
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,534
Oh, my. This is just to my taste.

415
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,162
Let's see.

416
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,790
-What do you think?
-I love it.

417
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,544
One, zero, two?

418
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,462
Is that a zero?

419
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,548
-It looks good.
-Yes.

420
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,258
Adding cologne would be nice.

421
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,760
-Cologne?
-It's always good to smell good.

422
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:51,972
Oh, my.

423
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,682
She still has it.

424
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,517
It's 0.5 carats.

425
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,062
Hi, 0.5 Carats.

426
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,315
I hope you find a nice owner.

427
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,943
Hi, 0.5 Carats.

428
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,779
I wonder who your owner will be.

429
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,032
We shouldn't try these on, right?

430
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,844
Goodness.

431
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,679
You look so handsome.

432
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,181
You look great.

433
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,850
You look amazing!

434
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,603
-You look so handsome.
-He does.

435
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,438
You look so handsome.

436
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,273
My dear Kang-ho.

437
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,357
Where are you going?

438
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,445
You're finally wearing these again.

439
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,699
Here. Try them on.

440
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,833
They fit me perfectly.

441
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,045
Of course. They're yours.

442
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,006
-Turn around.
-Goodness.

443
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,758
Oh, my!

444
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,635
Gosh, you look so handsome.

445
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,886
Goodness me.

446
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,638
Goodness.

447
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,097
-You look great.
-You look amazing.

448
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,724
They must be here.

449
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,937
SAM-SIK'S MILL

450
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,026
That's enough.

451
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,278
Put it down.

452
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,446
Hey.

453
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,576
Look who it is.

454
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,373
It's Choi Kang-ho,
the most eligible bachelor of Jou-ri.

455
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,332
You're right.

456
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,167
It seems like

457
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,128
he's on a blind date
to find himself a match.

458
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,965
I don't know who the lucky lady will be,

459
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,300
but she sure will be hitting the jackpot.

460
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,803
You're totally right.

461
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,785
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD
CHOI KANG-HO

462
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,079
He was incredibly smart

463
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:25,125
ever since he was young.

464
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,587
Bubbles.

465
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,839
Okay.

466
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,090
-Bubbles.
-Right, bubbles.

467
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,801
I have a few more.

468
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,895
He's handsome, well-built,

469
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,522
and kind.

470
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,652
How many pigs
do you have at your farm again?

471
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,279
We have about--

472
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:55,989
They have--

473
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,409
-They have 500 pigs--
-Go!

474
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,578
-That's Kang-ho!
-Go!

475
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,746
Go?

476
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,751
Their potato field
is over 10,000 pyeong wide.

477
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,169
No, it's 1,000 pyeong.

478
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,130
Right, 1,000 pyeong.
Let me explain how big that is.

479
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:16,343
It could contain over 300
30-pyeong apartment units.

480
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,136
No, 30 apartment units.

481
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,096
Right?

482
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,681
And the potato field is…

483
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:24,893
All right.

484
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,936
This is his house.

485
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,147
-Goodness.
-Take out the pigsty.

486
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,525
The remaining land costs
700,000 won per pyeong.

487
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,570
However, the only thing is…

488
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,948
There's just one tiny catch.

489
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,578
Kang-ho, how old are you?

490
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,498
I'm seven years…

491
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,419
I mean, I'm 35.

492
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,800
Something was off
when you kept talking about pigs.

493
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,510
This isn't right.

494
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,512
I can't believe we sat down with an idiot.

495
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,013
-"Idiot"?
-Let's go.

496
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,264
-Let's go, Mom.
-Wait…

497
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,808
-"Idiot"?
-Wait.

498
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,726
-I'm so offended.
-"Idiot"?

499
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,103
-That darn…
-How dare she…

500
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,525
Mom, can't I just live with you?

501
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,571
Goodness.

502
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,575
Do this.

503
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,331
Thank you for today.

504
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,836
Don't worry too much.
He'll find his match.

505
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,465
She's right. I'll look for someone better,
so don't you worry.

506
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:42,220
If we can't find one,
then I'll make one for him.

507
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,306
Shall we hurry home and make one then?

508
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,184
What? You should do it
while you still can.

509
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,853
-Let's go.
-Okay.

510
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,604
Get home safely.

511
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,648
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

512
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,899
-Bye.
-Bye.

513
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,402
SAM-SIK'S MILL

514
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,823
Let's buy some paint while we're in town.

515
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,744
Mom, why don't you buy any pesticides?

516
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,205
Pesticides? What for?

517
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:18,256
You want to show Mi-joo
how well-dressed you are, right?

518
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,305
All right. I'll buy some paint
and go to her salon.

519
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,182
So you can go there first.

520
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,059
I'll go pick you…

521
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,856
I'll go pick you up!

522
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,402
Gosh, you come here quite often.

523
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,570
Right.

524
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,532
It may not seem like much,

525
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,744
but getting my nails done
relieves my stress.

526
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,245
It feels good

527
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,997
and smells nice too.

528
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,838
-Mi-joo, I'm off to the storage.
-Okay.

529
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,220
What do you do after work?

530
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,639
Why do you ask?

531
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,518
Why don't we go somewhere nice
and have a cup of coffee?

532
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,812
I also have a few questions.

533
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,396
Like what?

534
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,859
For example, I'm curious about

535
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,154
how you give hand massages.

536
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,073
There are various types of massages.

537
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,617
There's oil massage.

538
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,412
There's also outcall massage.

539
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,832
Let me show you something.

540
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,458
That's it.

541
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,877
Like this.

542
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,922
There's this kind of massage too.

543
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,050
-Like this?
-That's right.

544
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,510
There's also this

545
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,011
and this.

546
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,224
If you do something like this again,
I'll snap your neck right off.

547
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,059
-You little…
-No.

548
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,227
Not by me.

549
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,062
But by your wife.

550
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,856
What?

551
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,940
Hey!

552
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,275
What did I do?

553
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,194
You kept glancing at my breasts
and groping my hand.

554
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,780
And what? Outcall massage?

555
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,156
Don't you know who I am?

556
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,408
Of course, I do.

557
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,951
You're Lee Bong-su,
the business alliance rep,

558
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,329
who's been going around
pestering young ladies

559
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,125
at hair salons and coffee shops
like a horny dog.

560
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,711
Leave. Come out.

561
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,589
Leave. Go.

562
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,551
Do you want to be humiliated
in front of everyone,

563
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,927
Representative Lee Bong-su?

564
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,053
You little…

565
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm bleeding!

566
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,727
You crazy bitch!

567
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,021
Come here!

568
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,607
-How dare you hurt me?
-What's going on?

569
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,983
-You little…
-What's wrong?

570
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,277
I'll put you behind bars
for attempted murder!

571
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,820
-What?
-Come here, you bitch!

572
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,875
Who the hell are you?

573
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,426
Goodness!

574
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,097
What…

575
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,724
Who are you?

576
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,434
I'm…

577
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,602
Well…

578
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,895
He's a prosecutor.

579
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,064
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

580
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,066
-What?
-You're in trouble now.

581
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,319
Babe, put him behind bars this instant.

582
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,947
He groped me, cursed at me,
and sexually harassed me.

583
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,491
Come on, be a prosecutor, babe.

584
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,910
Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office?

585
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,500
Hey, why would a prosecutor from Seoul

586
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,502
date someone like you?

587
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,003
-What did you say?
-Mi-joo.

588
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,797
Why don't you answer me?

589
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,007
Are you a prosecutor? Are you?

590
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,218
-Seriously, that…
-Mi-joo.

591
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,096
Who are you trying to fool?

592
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,347
No, I…

593
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,142
Mi-joo, I'm not a prosecutor…

594
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,941
The lucky color is yellow
for the Year of the Dragon.

595
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,527
Mi-joo!

596
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,569
Over here!

597
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,488
-This way.
-Mi-joo, don't die.

598
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,954
Oh, no! Are you okay, Mi-joo?

599
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,122
-Are you okay?
-That bastard!

600
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,748
They must be hurt.

601
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,958
What…

602
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,086
"Choi Kang-ho."

603
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,755
"Supreme Prosecutors' Office."
He is a prosecutor.

604
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,092
See! He really is a prosecutor!

605
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,093
What are you going to do?

606
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,678
You better leave.

607
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,514
-Kang-ho.
-Go or you'll get in trouble!

608
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,100
-Are you okay? Wake up.
-Go mind your own business.

609
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,936
-I'll call 911.
-Are you okay? Hang in there.

610
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,854
Are you okay?

611
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,940
You're bleeding. Get up.

612
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,234
Are you okay? Oh, no.

613
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,612
Oh, no. Are you okay?

614
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,823
This is all my fault.

615
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,408
What do I do?

616
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,328
-Oh, no.
-No, it's okay.

617
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,711
It's okay, Mi-joo.

618
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,049
I can take the exam next year.

619
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,442
HAPPY FARM

620
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,036
Kang-ho, earlier in town…

621
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,831
Kang-ho.

622
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,374
Choi Kang-ho.

623
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,292
Yes?

624
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,837
What are you painting?

625
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,512
Wait.

626
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,890
-What happened to your forehead?
-What?

627
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,228
A motorcycle?

628
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,605
Are you out of your mind?

629
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,690
Let me see.

630
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,984
Are you hurt anywhere else?

631
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,194
No, I'm okay.

632
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,116
Wait, Mom…

633
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,953
You're not okay. You also hurt your arm.

634
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,788
Kang-ho.

635
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,917
What were you thinking
running toward the motorcycle?

636
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,461
Mi-joo almost got hurt.

637
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,383
So what?

638
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,634
Did she die?

639
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,845
Kang-ho.

640
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,140
Why would you say that?

641
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,060
I don't know.

642
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,396
It suddenly popped into my head.

643
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,734
All right, eat up.

644
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,628
So what?

645
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,380
Did she die?

646
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,883
I must've hurt him

647
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,386
very deeply.

648
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,474
That's why he still remembers those words.

649
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,269
But he can't regain his memories just yet.

650
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,523
He needs to get married
and start a family.

651
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,693
That way,

652
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,489
he won't act recklessly

653
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,325
to avenge you…

654
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,329
even if all his memories return.

655
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,459
So I beg you.

656
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,921
Please don't let him…

657
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,051
regain his memories until then.

658
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,815
I must've been crazy.

659
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,567
I was insane.

660
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,903
Darn it.

661
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,133
Mi-joo, why do you have
a plastic bag over your head?

662
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,676
Hey.

663
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,052
Hi, Kang-ho.

664
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,596
-Hi.
-I was a bit cold.

665
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,515
-You were cold?
-Yes.

666
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,601
You look like a hermit crab.
Or a greenhouse.

667
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,104
Right, because I'm wearing this.

668
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,944
-You should get going.
-Okay.

669
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,029
Bye.

670
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,739
Bye.

671
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,456
Mi-joo.

672
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,166
Yes?

673
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,501
I can't hold back anymore.

674
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,067
Did you have seaweed again?

675
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,028
There's another one over here.

676
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,405
"Again"?

677
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,533
I smelled seaweed
when we kissed back in town.

678
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,535
And you have some on your lips right now.

679
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,080
That's because I had gimbap for lunch.

680
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,165
I see.

681
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,168
You should brush your teeth to stay clean.

682
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,089
Why are you speaking casually to me?

683
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,091
You spoke casually to me
since we first met.

684
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,093
That's right. I did.

685
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,928
But you didn't up until yesterday.

686
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,263
So why did you suddenly change?

687
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,182
Do you see me as a pushover now?

688
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,725
No, I like you.

689
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,403
Bye.

690
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,906
Kang-ho.

691
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:10,866
Yes?

692
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,413
Do you want some beer?

693
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,915
No, I can't drink.

694
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,583
Bye.

695
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,963
As if.

696
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,673
You used to love beer.

697
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,800
Hold on.

698
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,302
What seaweed?

699
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,111
We need to nourish the pigs

700
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,281
so that they're happy and healthy.

701
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,120
PIG FEED MANAGEMENT

702
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,455
Goodness.

703
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,582
You're doing so well.

704
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,835
I picked the perfect owner.

705
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,507
Goodness.

706
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,551
I should cut your nails.

707
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,971
It's okay. I can cut them later.

708
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,599
We can do it right now.

709
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,392
Give me your hand.

710
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,560
Mom.

711
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,021
I noticed that
the feed tube was clogged up.

712
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,397
Let me go check.

713
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,859
The pigs need to eat.

714
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,486
But…

715
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,988
It won't take long. Bang, bang, bang.

716
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,200
-Ms. Jin.
-Hey.

717
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,993
Right. Hold on.

718
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,829
From now on, the owner of Happy Farm

719
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,208
is not me but him, Mr. Choi Kang-ho.

720
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,793
Right?

721
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,798
Yes.

722
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,980
I request a consultation.

723
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,565
About what?

724
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,113
Have you found a partner for Kang-ho yet?

725
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,491
No.

726
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,285
I have a female friend in my major.

727
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,746
Would you like
to set them up on a blind date?

728
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,498
That would be great.

729
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,042
Can you set up a date?

730
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:25,960
Okay.

731
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,920
-As soon as possible.
-Okay.

732
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,757
You're so cute. Give me a kiss.

733
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,386
Damn it.

734
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,930
It went in my mouth!

735
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,349
Come here, you punk!

736
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,726
Come here.

737
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,645
How could you pee on me?

738
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,813
-Seriously.
-Goodness.

739
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,983
Gosh, seeing you both on all fours,

740
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,028
I can't tell which of you is the real dog.

741
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,489
Come on. That's a bit harsh.

742
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,450
Wait, what's going on?

743
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,536
Where are you going with your lipstick on?

744
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,621
I'm going to town to search for a bride.

745
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,707
A bride? Gosh.

746
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,377
Shouldn't I have a say in whom you pick?

747
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,878
But there's no need.

748
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,132
There's a woman
who captured my heart ages ago.

749
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,633
Right?

750
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,760
The only woman who's ever captured you

751
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,470
is a female police officer.

752
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,222
Mom!

753
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,932
It's for Kang-ho.

754
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,519
Don't you dare go out and get in trouble.
Just stay home, okay?

755
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,438
Kang-ho?

756
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,064
Yes.

757
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,318
What's the point of
having that expensive jewelry?

758
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,069
The moment girls meet Kang-ho,

759
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,739
they have absolutely
no desire to marry him.

760
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,158
You better stay home today!

761
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,784
Okay.

762
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,873
Oh, a blind date?

763
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,709
She's Andrea's friend from college.

764
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,880
Apparently, she wants to marry a nice man
and settle down in Korea.

765
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,090
So he told her about Kang-ho,

766
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,551
and she wanted to meet him.

767
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,304
Then why isn't Kang-ho here?

768
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,765
You said she wanted to meet him.

769
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,934
Well, I'm just worried.

770
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,146
She may say she's down to meet him.

771
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,149
But what if she doesn't like him
when they actually meet?

772
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,735
I don't want Kang-ho to get hurt again.

773
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,156
Don't worry too much.

774
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,575
What could Kang-ho possibly lack?

775
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,244
Let's be frank.
He's the perfect husband material.

776
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,330
If I had another daughter,

777
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,832
I would've immediately
married her off to him.

778
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:34,046
So don't concern yourself
with those rude brats.

779
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,675
Let's just focus on this blind date.

780
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,801
-Yes.
-Sure.

781
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,469
Let's focus on this instead.

782
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,804
Hold on.

783
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,555
Look at me.

784
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,351
What's with your face?

785
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,645
Jeez. Hold on.

786
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,271
Do this.

787
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,232
That's it.

788
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,692
Do this. Goodness.

789
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,904
You must've been stressed lately.
You look a bit rough.

790
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,739
You should wear some lipstick.

791
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,991
-Okay.
-Come on.

792
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,995
Don't go around looking so pale
and haggard as if your days are numbered.

793
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,499
You're looking livelier already. Gosh.

794
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,042
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

795
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,794
He's a prosecutor.

796
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,963
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

797
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,924
Babe, put him behind bars this instant.

798
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,219
You're no longer a prosecutor.

799
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,139
You're the owner of Happy Farm.

800
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,603
Kang-ho!

801
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,315
Kang-ho, let's play.

802
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,943
Have you eaten?

803
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,069
Ta-da.

804
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,489
We should celebrate
your new position as the owner

805
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,032
of Happy Farm.

806
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,701
But I can't drink.

807
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,871
You're wrong.
You're actually a good drinker.

808
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,832
So drink up. Come on.

809
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,167
I can't.

810
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,919
Choi Kang-ho, you're an adult.

811
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,629
A man should know how to drink

812
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,381
and black out every now and then.

813
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,717
Who knows?
Maybe your memories will come back.

814
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,469
Here.

815
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,553
Drink up.

816
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,847
Cheers.

817
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,599
Drink up.

818
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,600
Go on.

819
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,768
Drink up.

820
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:17,024
Kang-ho, you punk.

821
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,277
You're a true man. I approve.

822
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,070
-Sam-sik.
-No.

823
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,449
We're out of alcohol. We're done.

824
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,617
It's not about that.

825
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,911
How can I become a prosecutor?

826
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,371
I want to become one again.

827
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:40,964
You want to become a prosecutor again?

828
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:41,924
Yes.

829
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:45,552
Then I should help you as your friend.

830
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,265
A prosecutor

831
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,893
should be a jerk.

832
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,229
A jerk.

833
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,523
But don't worry. You were born as one.

834
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,274
I see. That's a relief.

835
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,234
Second.

836
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,818
Second.

837
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,654
A prosecutor…

838
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,490
Right. Handcuffs.

839
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,242
You should have a pair of handcuffs.

840
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,077
For all the criminals you catch.

841
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,080
Handcuffs? What if I don't have any?

842
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,041
Don't worry. I'll get a pair for you.

843
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,459
Will you really do that?

844
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,253
Trust me.

845
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,379
I'm Bang Sam-sik.

846
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,174
Right!

847
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:29,471
If I were to get you
a pair of handcuffs for free,

848
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,307
you'd probably feel indebted, right?

849
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,225
No.

850
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,310
Come on.

851
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,646
Think carefully.

852
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,022
I'm sure you will.

853
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,732
All right.

854
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,859
How about this?

855
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,112
We'll give each other a gift.

856
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:48,448
I'll get you the handcuffs.

857
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,866
As for me…

858
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,827
What do I want?

859
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,455
Right! A ring!

860
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,582
A ring?

861
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,750
I've been dying to get a ring lately.

862
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,252
-Here.
-You want a ring?

863
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,378
Like this one.

864
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,671
You get it, right?

865
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:05,257
A ring like this.

866
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,425
Sam-sik.

867
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,176
-Yes?
-I have this.

868
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,386
Do you?

869
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,387
Yes, I do.

870
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,932
I didn't think you'd have one,
but I guess you do.

871
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,601
-I do.
-Gosh.

872
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,396
Then I guess
you could give it to me as a gift.

873
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,732
I can't.

874
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,733
It's for my fiancée.

875
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,901
Do you even know what a fiancée is?

876
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,737
-I do.
-What is it?

877
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,739
-A friend.
-"A friend"?

878
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:29,656
Yes.

879
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,535
-You're right!
-See?

880
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,871
You're so smart.

881
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,247
-I am.
-Gosh.

882
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:41,043
You're right. A fiancée is a friend.

883
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,211
You and I are friends, right?

884
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,631
That means I'm your fiancée.

885
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,091
Are you now?

886
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,928
Don't you want the handcuffs?

887
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,473
Go and get your fiancée's gift.

888
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,392
Don't you want the ring?

889
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,312
I do. I desperately want it.

890
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,522
-Do you?
-Of course, I do!

891
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,900
Okay, but promise me
you'll get me the handcuffs.

892
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,611
-I'll get them right now.
-All right.

893
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,155
-Do you want the ring?
-I do!

894
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,490
Shout if you want it!

895
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,617
Once more if you want it!

896
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,244
Once more for the last time!

897
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:17,954
Stop!

898
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,000
Hey, have you identified the body yet?

899
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:26,129
Yes, according to the DNA result, it's a
36-year-old female named Hwang Soo-hyun.

900
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,757
We found a passport in her bag,

901
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,509
and it was fake.

902
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,761
A fake passport?

903
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,180
Cause of death?

904
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:39,142
Based on the state of her body
and the autopsy result,

905
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,936
I doubt it was a murder.

906
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,646
How would you know?

907
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,647
Sorry?

908
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,275
We found 30 million won's
worth of dollars in her bag.

909
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,194
In a zipper bag at that.

910
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:52,906
Do you think she committed suicide
while carrying a fake passport

911
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,324
and 30 million won?

912
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,993
-You're right.
-All right.

913
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,996
Let her family know

914
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,915
and look into stowaway ships.

915
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,500
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

916
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,341
Still no word from Mr. So?

917
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,176
No, sir.

918
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,137
This won't do.

919
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,222
I'll have to go there myself.

920
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,356
He's so handsome.

921
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,403
Kang-ho is the best-looking in this town.

922
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,616
But I heard he was unwell.

923
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,535
If you have any videos of him,

924
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,996
I'd like to watch one.

925
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,458
I do. I have a video of him.

926
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:49,004
Ye-jin wanted to create
her own video channel,

927
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,298
so she took all kinds of videos.

928
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:52,966
Here's Kang-ho.

929
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,678
Hello, everyone.

930
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:01,516
Today, we're going to meet Kang-ho oppa,
the person I love the most.

931
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,852
He's drawing right now.

932
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,520
What are you drawing?

933
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,482
-My mom.
-I see.

934
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,066
Why are you drawing her?

935
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:11,985
Because I like her.

936
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,488
What do you like so much about her?

937
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,992
She's pretty, she has a beautiful voice,
and she's also very smart.

938
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,662
-He loves his mom.
-She's friendly and cooks well.

939
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,872
Goodness.

940
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,751
I don't know.
I just can't stop thinking about her.

941
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,545
All done.

942
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,631
Ta-da.

943
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,302
You look so pretty.

944
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,054
Oh, my.

945
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,223
You look very young

946
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,767
-in this drawing.
-Let me see.

947
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:44,768
Goodness.

948
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,854
Kang-ho is so in love with his mom.

949
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,105
Goodness me.

950
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,149
He drew so well.

951
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,819
I like him.

952
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,321
He seems like a nice person.

953
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,199
Can I meet him?

954
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,868
Of course, you can.

955
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,245
Are you serious?

956
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:06,039
-This is great!
-Thank you!

957
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,250
Thank you!

958
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,502
-You have a call!
-This is great!

959
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,421
-I am happy
-I am happy

960
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,382
-Hello?
-I am happy

961
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,176
-I am happy
-I am happy

962
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,427
The police station?

963
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:20,887
What is this?

964
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,722
What's going on?

965
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,432
Why are you here again?

966
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,811
You crazy bastard. You son of a gun.

967
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,438
-You punk.
-You just can't change!

968
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,941
You just can't change,
can you, you son of a gun?

969
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,443
Our village has been crime-free
for the past 20 years,

970
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,237
so Mr. Son was going to be awarded

971
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,489
by the prime minister
at the end of this month.

972
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,199
We had just 20 days to go.

973
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,493
What have you done, Sam-sik?

974
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,995
Gosh, my 20 years.

975
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,123
My 20 years…

976
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,666
Mr. Choi Kang-ho is here.

977
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,878
CONGRATULATIONS, JOU-RI!
CRIME-FREE FOR 20 YEARS

978
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,337
Sam-sik.

979
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,261
This was reported to be stolen.

980
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,596
Is it yours?

981
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,141
-Gosh.
-Wait.

982
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,018
Why is this here?

983
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,145
Goodness, it is hers.

984
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,688
Oh, dear.

985
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,981
My 20 years!

986
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,861
It all went down the drain!

987
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,488
I gave this to him as a gift.

988
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,325
-What?
-What?

989
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,327
It was a gift?

990
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,329
You gave this to him?

991
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,288
Yes.

992
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,206
I gave it to him.

993
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,918
Goodness.

994
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,794
Right.

995
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:39,174
Kang-ho gave it to him as a gift.

996
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,842
Gosh, our dear Kang-ho.

997
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,427
How kind of you.

998
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,888
-Let's put this back up.
-Yes.

999
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,308
-Why?
-It was a gift.

1000
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:49,976
A gift.

1001
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,896
Why did you give this to him?

1002
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,147
Because…

1003
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,859
he's my fiancée.

1004
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,486
Right, Sam-sik?

1005
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,029
What?

1006
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,989
What did he say?

1007
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,664
You really got the handcuffs.

1008
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,000
Thank you, my fiancée.

1009
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,002
What is he talking about?

1010
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,135
Mom.

1011
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,805
I'm sorry.

1012
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,895
Don't you know what's yours

1013
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,314
and what's important?

1014
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,067
I told you not to give away
what's yours to others.

1015
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,486
Mom.

1016
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,281
I want to be a prosecutor.

1017
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,744
Kang-ho, no.

1018
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,872
You promised me.

1019
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,875
You promised to run Happy Farm

1020
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,045
-with your fiancée and--
-No.

1021
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,381
I don't want to do that.

1022
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,966
I'm going to be a prosecutor again.

1023
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,884
You're no longer a prosecutor.

1024
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,136
Yes, I am.

1025
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,472
Mi-joo said I work at Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

1026
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:16,438
Is she the reason
why you want to be a prosecutor?

1027
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,522
Yes.

1028
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,691
That's why.

1029
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,818
You little…

1030
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,156
Why won't you listen to me?

1031
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,991
Why are you giving me a hard time?

1032
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,285
Say that you were wrong.

1033
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,705
Promise me that
you won't say something like that again!

1034
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,963
I did everything you told me to.

1035
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,133
I ate well.

1036
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:49,304
I exercised diligently
and I even moved my arms and legs.

1037
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,766
I took medicine and received acupuncture.

1038
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,227
It was really painful and exhausting.

1039
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,189
When you tossed me into the water,

1040
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,274
I was terrified.

1041
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,570
But I still endured it all.

1042
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,531
Because it made you happy.

1043
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,659
I wanted to make you happy.

1044
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,123
So why won't you
let me do what I want to do?

1045
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,919
Why do you always decide for me?

1046
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,089
Is it because

1047
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,425
you also see me as an idiot?

1048
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:38,937
WHEN NAILS COME

1049
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,527
I'm sorry for dropping in on you
like this.

1050
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,736
It's okay.

1051
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,656
Is something going on?

1052
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,536
Kang-ho is getting married soon.

1053
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,830
Sorry?

1054
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,083
He went on a blind date today,

1055
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,627
and the lady seemed to like him.

1056
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,506
She's a foreigner.

1057
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,384
But she majored in nursing in Vietnam.

1058
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,554
She also worked at a hospital
and a school for the disabled.

1059
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,891
So I think she'll understand
and take good care of him.

1060
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,104
Speaking of which,

1061
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,483
could you please help him?

1062
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,528
What do you mean?

1063
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,321
What can I do?

1064
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,074
Kang-ho…

1065
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,453
seems to like you a lot.

1066
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,706
I told him numerous times that

1067
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,251
you were married to someone else,

1068
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,628
but I don't think he understands.

1069
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,631
So Mi-joo,

1070
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,760
could you please talk some sense into him?

1071
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,226
Please, Mi-joo.

1072
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,897
The lady will be visiting us tomorrow.

1073
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,108
He needs to get married this time.

1074
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,818
I'm running out of time.

1075
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,945
So please help me.

1076
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,120
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

1077
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,748
Something's going on, right?

1078
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,460
No, nothing's going on.

1079
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,920
No, something's up.

1080
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,089
You bought herbicide last time,

1081
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,009
and Kang-ho told me
that you abandoned him.

1082
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,222
And now, you're rushing his marriage.

1083
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,182
Something's going on, right?

1084
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,352
Please tell me.

1085
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:46,064
That's the only way I can help.

1086
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,193
Well…

1087
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,323
Mi-joo.

1088
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,327
The thing is…

1089
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,288
I'm quite unwell.

1090
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,335
I'm dying soon.

1091
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,063
There's something I want to do.

1092
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,721
-Hi!
-Hi.

1093
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,432
-Hello.
-Hello.

1094
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:04,183
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-Say hi.

1095
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,227
-This is my friend, Kim Jun-won.
-Hello.

1096
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,313
Hello.

1097
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,527
He's not bad, right?

1098
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,280
I'm sorry for not telling you this sooner.

1099
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,115
-What?
-Actually…

1100
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,033
Yes?

1101
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,869
I'm pregnant.

1102
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,495
What?

1103
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,372
What did you say?

1104
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,790
You're pregnant?

1105
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,796
Does he know?

1106
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,299
I didn't tell him.

1107
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,801
You idiot. You should've told him.

1108
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,554
He said there was something
he wanted to do.

1109
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,183
And that he could only do it without me.

1110
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:51,522
It was important enough
for him to break up with someone he loved.

1111
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,526
If I told him I was pregnant
with his babies,

1112
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,113
he would've given it up.

1113
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:06,079
I don't want to ruin his life anymore.

1114
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,456
Wait. "Babies"?

1115
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,749
What?

1116
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,000
What do you mean?

1117
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,756
Twins.

1118
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,386
I got an ultrasound.

1119
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,346
I saw two peas.

1120
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,806
It was so adorable!

1121
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,557
Lee Mi-joo!

1122
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,810
Are you saying
you're going to have the babies?

1123
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,978
Yes.

1124
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,108
My twins and I will wait for him.

1125
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,735
Kang-ho…

1126
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,905
will return once he's done.

1127
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,076
SUPREME COURT OF KOREA

1128
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,286
There's your mommy.

1129
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,872
What did they say?
Can you get your money back?

1130
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,752
Even if the judge orders
the landlord to pay,

1131
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,673
they can ignore it and get away with it.

1132
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,093
That's ridiculous.

1133
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,554
Didn't you say
the landlord has many houses?

1134
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,723
You should get your money even by force.

1135
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,392
They already put the houses
under someone else's name,

1136
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,060
so compulsory execution is not an option.

1137
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,398
Oh, dear. What's wrong?

1138
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,025
It's okay.

1139
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,487
I'm sorry, guys.

1140
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,032
I wanted you guys
to live in a bigger house.

1141
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,369
But I'm afraid we'll have to live
in Sillim-dong for now.

1142
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:33,207
I'm broke because I haven't been working
since giving birth.

1143
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,668
Sun-young.

1144
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,838
I should start working again.

1145
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,345
Let's hurry home.

1146
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,140
-Let's go.
-Over here.

1147
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:50,850
Kang-ho.

1148
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,060
Hurry.

1149
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,483
Hey, isn't that Choi Kang-ho?

1150
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,067
Hey, isn't that Choi Kang-ho?

1151
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,694
It is.

1152
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,988
He finally made it.

1153
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,949
Why would such a wealthy girl

1154
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,910
date someone like him?

1155
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,078
He has neither money nor connections.

1156
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,206
She's his money and connection.

1157
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,459
He had been following her around
ever since he was at the institute.

1158
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,587
You dedicated yourself
to supporting him while he studied,

1159
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:22,089
and what he wanted to do
was meet some well-off girl?

1160
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,592
What a jerk.

1161
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,677
You better hope I don't catch you.

1162
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,429
You're dead meat if I do.

1163
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,316
PETIT NAIL

1164
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,573
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

1165
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,616
What are you doing?

1166
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,460
Gosh, who is it so early in the morning?

1167
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,546
Goodness.

1168
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:08,636
Who are they?

1169
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,356
MOM, IT'S MI-JOO. PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF MY BABIES, YE-JIN AND SEO-JIN.

1170
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:29,907
Mi-joo.

1171
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,828
Mi-joo, come on out.

1172
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,413
Mi-joo!

1173
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,833
Mi-joo, you crazy brat!

1174
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,919
Where the hell are you?

1175
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,045
Mi-joo!

1176
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,132
Goodness.

1177
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:50,261
Oh, dear. What do I do?

1178
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,599
-What do I do?
-I should've told him that I was pregnant.

1179
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,144
Even if he was
eventually going to leave us,

1180
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,480
Kang-ho still should've known.

1181
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,401
I made a mistake

1182
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,279
to Kang-ho,

1183
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,698
Ms. Jin,

1184
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,243
my kids,

1185
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,455
and…

1186
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,710
to you, Mom.

1187
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,089
What did you say?

1188
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,300
So you're saying

1189
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,887
Kang-ho is their father?

1190
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,683
Choi Kang-ho from the pig farm?

1191
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,437
The Choi Kang-ho that we all know?

1192
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,652
Oh, dear.

1193
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,987
No.

1194
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,657
Why do you have to end up
with an idiot like him?

1195
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,492
Hang on.

1196
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,079
Who knows about this?

1197
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,498
Did you tell his mom?

1198
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,750
No.

1199
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,963
Goodness. Thank God.

1200
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,923
That's a relief.

1201
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,969
Listen to me carefully.

1202
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:14,762
You can't be with him.

1203
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:19,558
Do you know how exhausting it is
to care for someone who's unwell?

1204
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:22,269
You'll have to sacrifice your entire life.

1205
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,064
What will you tell the kids?

1206
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,148
Last time,

1207
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:29,860
when Seo-jin said that he wished
Kang-ho were his dad,

1208
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,072
didn't you see
how Ye-jin had a fit about it?

1209
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,370
Goodness.

1210
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,623
Goodness.

1211
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,333
Oh, dear.

1212
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,382
Oh, dear.

1213
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,009
Oh, dear.

1214
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:55,636
Goodness.

1215
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,473
I can't believe this.

1216
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,101
They say you're unlucky with your kids

1217
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,729
if you're unlucky with your husband.

1218
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,816
I can't believe this.

1219
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:19,035
Gosh, my poor babies…

1220
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,165
Oh, no…

1221
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:28,002
My poor babies…

1222
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,003
Why?

1223
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,174
Why do you pity us?

1224
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,596
You don't have to.

1225
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,681
There's no reason to pity us.

1226
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:58,949
Do you like them?

1227
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:01,994
Okay.

1228
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,294
Gosh, you're so handsome.

1229
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:11,462
Kang-ho.

1230
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,591
Let's eat and get ready.

1231
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,053
We'll be having a guest soon.

1232
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,558
You're upsetting me right now.

1233
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,795
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1234
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,984
I'm my mom's guardian.

1235
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,944
Hey, get away from him!

1236
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,030
Yes, I'm your mom.

1237
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:23,868
"DNA Test Result." It's a test result.

1238
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,662
Sam-sik, why aren't you picking up?

1239
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:30,457
No one can prove it
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

1240
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,876
Mom.

1241
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:35,921
-I already know.
-I'm such a bad mom.

1242
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,965
Mom, why are you so mean?

1243
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:43,304
I want to spend every minute and second
I have left being happy with you.

1244
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:51,520
