00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,896
EPISODE 9

3
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,689
Look at that color.

4
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,275
This year's kimchi will be delicious.

5
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,234
Of course.

6
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:13,615
It's due to these
fully-ripened red chilis.

7
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,201
We couldn't sun-dry the chilis last year

8
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,577
because of all the rain.

9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,038
I'm glad the weather's nice this year.

10
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,790
Hello.

11
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,333
You're here.

12
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,211
Oh, my. Look at the color
of the red chili powder.

13
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,548
Wait.

14
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,009
That's her, right?

15
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,427
You're right.

16
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,016
Grandma!

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,519
That lady who came
with Kang-ho oppa last time

18
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,812
is getting married.

19
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,313
-What?
-What?

20
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,398
-Oh, my.
-What are you talking about?

21
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,316
What?

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,109
-What?
-Let me see.

23
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,904
-What?
-Oh, my. She's right.

24
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:57,075
So she was
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo's daughter?

25
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,868
Does that mean Kang-ho

26
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,162
almost became the president's son-in-law?

27
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,413
-Goodness.
-My goodness.

28
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,541
That's not what's important right now.

29
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,418
Goodness, that cursed brat.

30
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,129
It hasn't been that long
since Kang-ho's accident

31
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,797
and she's already marrying someone else?

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,425
If it were the son of Dosang Group,
I'd get married in an instant too.

33
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,428
Don't say something like that
in front of your husband.

34
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,055
Knock on wood right now.

35
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,431
-Knock, knock, knock.
-Knock, knock, knock.

36
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,851
Young-soon's already so stressed out.

37
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,854
She'll be really upset when she finds out.

38
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,980
What are you saying?

39
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,858
We can never let her find out, okay?

40
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,527
-Make sure you all keep it a secret!
-Okay.

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,695
I already know.

42
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,029
-What?
-Goodness!

43
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,615
Everyone has the right
to live their own life.

44
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,243
She's right.
The living has to go on living.

45
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,452
That's enough.

46
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,579
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

47
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,456
Mr. Bang, may I speak with you?

48
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,250
Me?

49
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,003
-Push it in until it clicks.
-Yes.

50
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,088
-Then you'll see this window.
-Right.

51
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,798
Put the cursor right here.

52
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,842
-Do you see the cursor?
-Yes.

53
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,635
Click twice quickly,

54
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,638
then you can see it like this.

55
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,390
Thank you so much.

56
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,726
It wasn't anything.

57
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,354
If you have any more questions,

58
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,648
-call me anytime.
-Okay.

59
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,984
Kang-ho, I'll be going now.

60
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,444
Okay. Thank you.

61
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,571
-My goodness.
-Oh, my back.

62
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,281
All right.

63
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,492
Click here twice, right?

64
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,244
Click-click.

65
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,996
What's this?

66
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,539
Password.

67
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,374
-Password.
-Password.

68
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,419
Password. 0907, my birthday.

69
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,630
That's for our bank account.

70
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,009
But you never know.

71
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,015
Zero, nine, zero, seven.

72
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,767
ENTER PASSWORD

73
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,103
Of course. It wouldn't be this easy.

74
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,481
What could it be?

75
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,857
What could it be, Kang-ho?

76
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,859
Any numbers you remember?

77
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,818
Numbers?

78
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,946
Numbers…

79
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,659
Numbers…

80
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,165
-Mom.
-Yes?

81
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,584
Isn't your birthday on March 12?

82
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,963
Oh, my.

83
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,839
Do you remember my birthday?

84
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,385
Mom, this is weird.

85
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,679
This was written on September 7,

86
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,223
but it says I'll see you next week
on your birthday.

87
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,391
You're right.

88
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,229
"I'll see you next week on your birthday."
Could this mean…

89
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,897
Zero, three, one, two.

90
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,783
-It's correct!
-We did it, Mom!

91
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,620
You're so smart. How did you catch that?

92
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,583
All right. Let's see what's in here.

93
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,588
Kang-ho,

94
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,299
this looks like your journal.

95
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,345
"March 3, 2008."

96
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,349
MARCH 3, 2008
I FINALLY GOT INTO SNU SCHOOL OF LAW…

97
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,184
WELCOME, FRESHMEN OF 2008
JOIN A CLUB

98
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,480
I finally got into SNU School of Law.

99
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,985
Choi Kang-ho, the top student
in this year's entering class.

100
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,366
Tell us why you chose law school.

101
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,291
Korea is a constitutional state
that protects liberal democracy.

102
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,418
Law is meant to provide public welfare

103
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,588
for the happiness
and benefit of the majority,

104
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,423
as well as justice for all…

105
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,680
As well as justice for all…

106
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,435
For what reason did your dad die?

107
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,395
I need to know that!

108
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,359
Actually,

109
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,862
I wanted to find out for myself.

110
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,572
What?

111
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,699
I want to find out the reason why

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,494
I had to attend law school.

113
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,081
That's why I'm here.

114
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,791
Kang-ho!

115
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,584
DETECTIVE UNIT 1

116
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,835
Kang-ho.

117
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,629
What…

118
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,047
What happened to you?

119
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,674
What happened to my son?

120
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,552
They got into an argument
over grades at school,

121
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,472
and Mr. Choi initiated
a physical altercation,

122
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,725
so he'll be booked on charges
unless they can reach a settlement.

123
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,851
Settlement?

124
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,020
I don't want to settle.

125
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,565
He didn't attend class,
take tests, or complete homework,

126
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,983
yet he's at the top of our class.

127
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,195
How could they fabricate his grades
and award him a scholarship

128
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,988
just because his mother's a judge?

129
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,074
-And at a law school at that.
-Damn it.

130
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,077
I'd like to add defamation

131
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,621
and dissemination of false information.

132
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,666
No, wait.

133
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,126
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,670
Let me apologize on his behalf.

135
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,421
He's always earned scholarships

136
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,340
to help out his mom who's a pig farmer

137
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,093
and was probably disappointed
not to come out as the top of the class.

138
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,010
Please.

139
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,178
Damn it.

140
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,683
Damn, I was wondering what that smell was.

141
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,395
If it seemed so unfair, why didn't you
major in livestock production?

142
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,648
Then your farmer mom
could have helped you.

143
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,899
You bastard.

144
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,401
Ma'am!

145
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,613
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,450
Please forgive him just once.

147
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,328
Come here and beg.

148
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,747
Tell him you were wrong.

149
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,127
Beg him, or you'll go to jail!

150
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,045
-Beg for forgiveness!
-Mom.

151
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,548
-Beg him for forgiveness!
-Mom.

152
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,300
-Do it!
-Mom!

153
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,721
So you're saying…

154
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,558
I have to beg this jerk?

155
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,603
You're telling me to
kneel before this son of a bitch

156
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,938
because I can't take the bar exam
if I go to jail.

157
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,274
Right.

158
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,027
That's what you want.

159
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,531
You want me to become a cowardly snob
who'd do anything to get my way.

160
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,040
Hey.

161
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,127
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,546
I didn't know my place and got cheeky.

163
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,884
I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me just this once.

164
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,762
Please let me take the bar exam.

165
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,681
Please forgive me.

166
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,142
No, please forgive me, sir.

167
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,894
-On that day,
-Just this once.

168
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,855
I realized why,

169
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,524
for what reason…

170
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,150
JUNE 18, 2009

171
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,236
…I had to attend law school,

172
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,949
and what I must do from now on.

173
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,464
Excuse me. I'm the bereaved.

174
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,926
I'd like to see my father's trial record
and the ruling.

175
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,177
SON: KANG-HO

176
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,012
FAMILY HEAD: CHOI HAE-SIK

177
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,557
I can only view the ruling?

178
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,144
I followed the procedure to get
his trial and witness examination records.

179
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,396
So why can't I see it?

180
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,648
Trial records
and witness examination records

181
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,193
include sensitive contents,
so we cannot release them.

182
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,446
But my father has already passed.

183
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,781
Disclosure of trial records

184
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,034
falls within the jurisdiction of the
prosecutor the case was transferred to,

185
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,079
so we cannot give them to you
if they decline.

JUDGMENT

188
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,756
THE EVIDENCE CORRESPONDING TO ARSON…

189
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,599
DEFENDANT: SONG WOO-BYEOK
PROSECUTOR: OH TAE-SOO

190
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,518
Locate the suspect
and bring him in, you punk.

191
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,728
What arrest warrant?

192
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,813
What?

193
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,440
Why are you still here?

194
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,482
Please show me.

195
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,777
According to the
Official Information Disclosure Act,

196
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,614
the bereaved family is entitled
to the investigation report.

197
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,240
This is a dereliction of duty.

198
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,576
What?

199
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,869
Dereliction of duty?

200
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,412
I can't believe this.

201
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,624
Hey, who do you think you are, you punk?

202
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,169
Are detectives a joke
just because you study law?

203
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,712
-No, that's not--
-Forget it.

204
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,547
You need to leave.

205
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,757
Take the bar exam,

206
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,467
become a prosecutor,

207
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,886
and then come arrest me
for my dereliction of duty.

208
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,014
Then I'll give you
every investigation report

209
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,351
from 22 years ago,
no, even from 100 years ago.

210
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,935
-Get out of here.
-Detective.

211
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,063
Get lost, you punk! I'm busy!

212
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,872
Once you study hard
and become a prosecutor,

213
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,458
no one will be able to
look down on you or bully you.

214
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,294
That's true power.

215
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,338
Do you understand?

216
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,512

00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,027
Top graduate of the School of Law,
Choi Kang-ho.

220
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:40,074
The student has graduated
as the top student of the Class of 2013…

221
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,745
PRE-LAW AND LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION

222
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,584
I'll send money to this account monthly
from now on.

223
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,128
And find a bigger place too.

224
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,379
Okay?

225
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,047
BANKBOOK

226
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,680
That's when I met her.

227
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,437
The one who shed a ray of warm light

228
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,606
into my dark, cold, and rough life.

229
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,610

Look at that.

232
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,118
The nerdy Kang-ho
has a rather elegant hobby.

233
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,995
You're going to ballet?

234
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,788
I'm not going for the ballet.

235
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,707
It's to see Chief Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo.

236
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh Tae-soo?

237
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,171
Oh Ha-young is his daughter.

238
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,675
No matter how busy he is,
he always attends her ballet galas.

239
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,180
It's a perfect chance to see him up close.

240
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,724
I might even get to greet him
if I get lucky.

241
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,935
You aren't just a fanatic.
You're a stalker.

242
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,812
Guys!

243
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,981
Big news.

244
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,399
Chief Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo

245
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,027
is coming to our next special lecture!

246
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,195
Really?

247
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,239
Good for you, Kang-ho.
You were dying to meet him.

248
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,658
Hey, my mom told me

249
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,244
Chief Prosecutor Oh will resign next year

250
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,871
and run for office.

251
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,832
He is? Instead of becoming
the prosecutor general?

252
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,668
It means he has bigger plans ahead.

253
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,711
No way.

254
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,670
The presidency?

255
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,255
Bingo.

256
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:23,469
Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo, who was in charge
of my father's trial 28 years ago,

257
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,555
became the chief prosecutor
of the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office.

258
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,517
Have we met before?

259
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,018
You look familiar.

260
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,230
No, sir.

261
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,940
-We've never met.
-Dad.

262
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,109
We're late. Let's go.

263
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,486
Okay.

264
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,531
The newly appointed
probationary judicial officers

265
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,242
of Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office, welcome.

266
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,829
I'll debrief you on the locations
of each office and their current tasks

267
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,249
so make sure you keep up.

268
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,625
All right.

269
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,169
Penalty Enforcement Division
One and Two work over there.

270
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,088
That's the archives.

271
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,967
You'll find all files
and case records regarding a trial.

272
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,969
Next, the Criminal Department.

273
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,264
Come on, chicks.

274
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,223
-Peep, peep.
-Peep, peep.

275
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,475
-Chicks.
-Peep, peep.

276
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,518
Peep, peep.

277
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,061
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

278
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,105
Excuse me.

279
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,232
Hello.

280
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,359
I'm Choi Kang-ho,
a probationary judicial officer

281
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,485
-of Criminal Division 8.
-Hello.

282
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,952
Pardon me,

283
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,038
but may I ask you for another case file?

284
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:33,956
Sure.

285
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,293
CASE 614 OF THE YEAR 1988

286
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,461

287
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,965
CASE 614 OF THE YEAR 1988

288
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:49,054
I finally got my father's trial record
that I always longed to see.

289
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,933
I'm sure the beginning
of my mother and my twisted fate

290
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,019
can be found in this record.

291
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,520
CHARGED WITHOUT DETENTION
CHARGED WITH ARSON

292
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,024
LIST OF EVIDENCE

293
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,777
REPORT OF TRIAL

294
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,824
Hey, it's that exam meal punk…

295
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,118
I mean, it's Bar Exam Meal.

296
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,703
Hey.

297
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,538
-Should I wait?
-I'll be out.

298
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,459
He's so devoted.

299
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,169
He doesn't miss a single day.

300
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,379
Just get married
if you two are so in love.

301
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,965
He hasn't even been appointed yet.
It's too soon to think about marriage.

302
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,093
That's it. The appointment ceremony.

303
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,347
His mother will come to Seoul that day.

304
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,933
He'll officially introduce you to her
and propose.

305
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,893
You think so?

306
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,103
Of course!

307
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,731
Darn it. He's messing up the window.

308
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,191
-Hey, wipe that off!
-Okay.

309
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,234
Sun-young, I'm off now.

310
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,569
You clean up the window!

311
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,905
Okay, Sun-young. Love you. Bye.

312
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,657
Make sure you wipe it tomorrow!

313
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,158
-Okay, bye!
-Okay.

314
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,743
I'll do it.

315
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,287
-Here.
-What is this?

316
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,084
You were curious about the food
at the Prosecutors' Office.

317
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,756
You packed all this?

318
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,591
Yes. I'm the best, right?

319
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,301
Of course, you are.

320
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,012
You stole food from the office.

321
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,307
What if they catch you red-handed
and arrest you for theft?

322
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,060
Goodness, Mi-joo. You know the law?

323
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,145
I've learned plenty being by your side.

324
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,691
Feel free to ask me
if you have any questions.

325
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,317
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,570
All right.

327
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,865
Tell me what you can
make out of this situation.

328
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,825
Sure.

329
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,744
-A prosecutor requested a witness
-Okay.

330
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,162
for his case.

331
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,789
And that witness

332
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,875
made a statement
against the victim in court.

333
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,293
Why did he do that?

334
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,753
Wait.

335
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,631
The prosecutor must have
called that witness

336
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,508
-to help the victim, right?
-Yes.

337
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,219
But the witness
testified against the victim?

338
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,849
That means the witness changed their mind.

339
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,892
-Exactly.
-Hey.

340
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,436
Then it's obvious.

341
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,189
The witness could've held a grudge
against the victim.

342
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,692
Or they purposely
decided to screw them over.

343
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,653
Or something must've
changed their mind before the trial.

344
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,365
For example, they could've been
threatened or bribed.

345
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,410
Right?

346
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,621
That's obviously the case, right?

347
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,043
Kwak Sang-cheol.

348
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,170
A firefighter who was close to my father

349
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,631
and often came to inspect his farm
for fire prevention.

350
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,010
But during the trial,

351
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,764
he gave a questionable testimony that
there were many problems

352
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,058
with the electrical facility
at my father's farm.

353
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,188
Excuse me.

354
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,357
Are you Mr. Kwak Sang-cheol?

355
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,402
I should've never done that to Hae-sik.

356
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:54,990
I'm so sorry.

357
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,329
But I thought we'd all be in danger
if I continued to resist.

358
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,792
Danger? What do you mean?

359
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,504
Mr. Kwak, you're a civil servant, right?

360
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,715
If a civil servant hinders
a state project,

361
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,217
it makes them a communist.

362
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,012
I get that it's for our country,
but how could you set his farm on fire?

363
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,806
Right? I agree with you.

364
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,936
I shouldn't have burnt his farm down.

365
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,689
If I set his house on fire,

366
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,526
we wouldn't be in so much trouble, right?

367
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,073
YONGRA

368
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,741
A fire begins without warning.

369
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,494
It can start at your house

370
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,580
or even at your mother's hospital.

371
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,748
Right?

372
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,208
Always beware of fire.

373
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,709
Let's not let down our guard!

374
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,088
You have a great place here.

375
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,172
Goodness.

376
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:58,095
I thought something was off
when I heard Hae-sik had passed away.

377
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,889
I had a feeling that
those men were behind it.

378
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,686
But there was absolutely no evidence
after the investigation,

379
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,563
and I had to keep my mouth shut,

380
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,439
afraid of Director Song's retaliation.

381
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,901
By Director Song, you mean…

382
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,611
You're right.

383
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,071
Director Song Woo-byeok
of Yongra Construction,

384
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,198
who fought against your father in court.

385
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,201
He's now Woobyeok Group's chairman.

386
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,578
WOOBYEOK'S CHAIRMAN SONG…

387
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,219
I'm home.

388
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,347
-Hey.
-Hey.

389
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,473
How have you been?

390
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,433
Fine.

391
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,152
Your mother is coming to your
appointment ceremony tomorrow, right?

392
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,529
No.

393
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,656
What?

394
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,742
She's not coming? Why not?

395
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,245
Did you not tell her about it?

396
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,416
Kang-ho, you shouldn't--

397
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,334
Mi-joo.

398
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,130
All right.

399
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,178
What about me?
When and where should I go tomorrow?

400
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,432
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,517
I should go alone tomorrow.

402
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,145
I have to be somewhere right after.

403
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,064
-It's important.
-But…

404
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,404
All right then.

405
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,533
It'll be weird for me to go if your mother
won't be there either, right?

406
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,830
Instead, let's have
a party tomorrow night.

407
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,832
Let's do that.

408
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,378
I'll wash up.

409
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,382
And now,

410
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,968
the parents and families
of new prosecutors

411
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,054
may come up and put the gown on them.

412
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,975
Please show your support by putting
the untainted black gown on them,

413
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,978
a symbol for them to maintain
fairness and impartiality

414
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,604
in their journey as prosecutors.

415
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,608
Newly appointed prosecutors shall relay
a warm regard to your parents

416
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,819
for supporting you
over a long period of time.

417
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,696
Please encourage one another.

418
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,863
Congratulations.

419
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,074
Prosecutor's oath.

420
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,492
-Our oath!
-Our oath!

421
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,412
As of this moment,
I accept the call of my country and people

422
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,998
and receive the honor
to serve as a prosecutor.

423
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,417
So you're a prosecutor?

424
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,337
Your mother must be quite disappointed.

425
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,840
I heard about your baby. Congratulations!

426
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,303
Hae-sik is so thrilled that
he's already wondering whether it'd be

427
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,054
a son or daughter and thinking of names.

428
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,016
I'll be happy with either a girl or a boy.

429
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,184
I just want our baby to be healthy

430
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,647
and raise them to be a painter.

431
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,566
-A painter?
-Yes.

432
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,569
I always wanted to be a painter.

433
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,489
My parents passed away
while I was preparing for art school,

434
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,949
so I had to give up.

435
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:12,080
I have a feeling that our baby
will take after me and be good at drawing.

436
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,125
Isn't that so?

437
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,627
I will courageously lift
the darkness of injustice.

438
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,560
I will stay warmhearted for those
who are weak and underprivileged.

439
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,149
THE 32ND
HANJU DAILY NATIONAL YOUTH ART CONTEST

440
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,319
Why are you doing this?

441
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,406
What's wrong with you?!

442
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,876
I will only follow the truth
and remain impartial.

443
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,182
I will remain strict and upright.

444
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,393
I hereby take my oath
to serve our people and nation

445
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,146
as a prosecutor, upon my honor.

446
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,327
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

447
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,039
Bring me the investigation record
for Choi Hae-sik's death in 1988.

448
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,874
INVESTIGATION RECORD
OF THE DEATH OF CHOI HAE-SIK

449
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,417
SUSPECT: SONG WOO-BYEOK
CHARGED WITHOUT DETENTION

450
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,963
That's how I finally met my father.

451
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,965
SCENE OF INCIDENT

452
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,007
PHOTOS OF VICTIM

453
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,219
There was no evidence of murder.

454
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,806
And the autopsy result showed
it was suffocation due to airway blockage.

455
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,766
It was a suicide.

456
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,606
LIGATURE MARK 4.0 CM UNDER THE CHIN
12 NAIL MARK ABRASIONS

457
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,659
Are these from the scene,

458
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,203
and are these from the autopsy?

459
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,539
Yes, that's correct.

460
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,083
Who was the detective in charge?

461
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,132
These are photos of the victim
taken at the scene.

462
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,676
Doesn't it seem odd?

463
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,553
I'm not sure.

464
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,932
Take a close look at his neck.

465
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,560
The only wound you can see

466
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,729
is the pressure from the rope,
the ligature mark.

467
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,191
It means there was no struggle

468
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,736
until the moment he suffocated to death
although his hands were free.

469
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,280
Well, that is possible.

470
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:55,493
There are cases where
a suicide victim dies from a broken neck

471
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:59,915
depending on the weight of the victim
and the height of the noose.

472
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,628
Then what do you think about this?

473
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,297
This is from his autopsy.

474
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,885
The nail marks that were absent
at the scene

475
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,471
suddenly appear clearly
during the autopsy.

476
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,598
I'm not sure.

477
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,478
This is…

478
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,773
Someone must've questioned
whether it was truly a suicide.

479
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,359
Look at this.

480
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,401
Isn't this weird?

481
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,862
The scar on his neck is too smooth.

482
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,323
Even if he was determined to die,

483
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,661
there should be some trace
of struggle due to pain, right?

484
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:42,082
His neck was too clean
for someone who suffocated slowly

485
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,334
to his death.

486
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:49,673
Of course, one could have argued
he died from a broken neck.

487
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,051
Unfortunately, the victim wasn't
found at a scene

488
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,553
high enough for him to die instantly.

489
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:56,930
Hence,

490
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,517
there was a high possibility
the victim's suicide was staged

491
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,187
after he was murdered or made unconscious.

492
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,815
Someone was afraid
the truth might leak, so they created

493
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,526
such false resistance marks
before the autopsy.

494
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,487
Who was it?

495
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,073
Sorry?

496
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,492
Goodness.

497
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,537
I have no idea what you're talking about.

498
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,789
I noticed that you were promoted

499
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,333
right after this case was closed.

500
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,836
And you also bought a house and some land.

501
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,256
As I said, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

502
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,926
So you don't know?

503
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,975
I heard you'll be retiring in a month.

504
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,061
I guess I'll find out within a month

505
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,480
whether you'll retire or be dismissed.

506
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,524
What's with you?

507
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,192
It's been over 30 years!

508
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,444
Yes, it has!

509
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,321
It's been over 30 years.

510
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,448
But I still have to bring justice
to the wronged!

511
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,159
It may have been over 30 years,

512
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,620
but he's still my father.

00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,698
It wasn't Song Woo-byeok.

521
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,993
It was Prosecutor Oh Tae-soo.

522
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,165
All right, we're here.

523
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,459
Let's go.

524
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,962
-I'm hungry.
-Goodness, I'm hungry,

525
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,298
and I want a drink too.

526
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,717
Let's hurry inside.

527
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,267
Do you want to know…

528
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,231
what it is that I want to do?

529
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,066
If you tell me,

530
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,944
will it change anything?

531
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,740
No.

532
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,119
Then I also say…

533
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,122
no.

534
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,552
PETIT NAIL

535
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,017
Don't ever let her find out

536
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,854
how much I loved her.

537
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,898
Don't ever let her find out

538
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,235
how much I love her.

539
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,071
And please,

540
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,157
don't ever let her find out

541
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,995
why our love must end
so painfully like this.

542
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,082
Let her loathe me and resent me

543
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,502
as she forgets me

544
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,045
and erases me from her memories.

545
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,633
Let her forget that she must forget me,

546
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,636
and let her be happy.

547
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,515
SEE YOU NEXT TIME

548
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,058
"MY DAUGHTER TEACHES ME
HOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING"

549
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,560
FORMER CHIEF PROSECUTOR
OH TAE-SOO RUNNING FOR…

550
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,104
PROSECUTOR CHOI KANG-HO

551
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,235
A DANCER'S DREAM

552
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,649
I received a tip-off about drugs.

553
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,915
It was my first time clubbing.

554
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:45,260
I couldn't have injured my knee
at a worse time!

555
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,845
Seriously!

556
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,432
I'm so frustrated right now.

557
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,687
Kang-ho, buy me a drink.

558
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,021
Let me call you back.

559
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,523
No. Wait, don't hang--

560
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,571
DO NOT LITTER
CCTV IN OPERATION

561
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,591
YOON JAE-MIN, THE GUY
WHO ALWAYS CAME TO OUR BAR

562
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,025
-What are you doing?
-You crazy bitch.

563
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,027
Let go of me, you crazy asshole!

564
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,280
Hey! Let go!

565
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,163
Hey, get up.

566
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,167
Get up.

567
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,644
What's this?

568
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,397
The CCTVs near Woo Mi-jeong's incident
were either broken or wiped,

569
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,316
so the case was almost abandoned.

570
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,903
Thankfully, I found one nearby
installed to monitor littering.

571
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,614
So? What do you want to show me?

572
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,327
Do you see this car?

573
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,122
If you consider the time
and location of the incident,

574
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,793
there's a high chance this car's dashcam
recorded the incident.

575
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,129
It'll take a while
to process the license plate number,

576
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,174
but I'll reveal the truth soon.

577
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,469
Kang-ho, let's just let this one slide.

578
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,806
Is it because of Yoon Jae-min?

579
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,895
He might dispose of Jung Jong-gu?

580
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,149
He'll stage Jung Jong-gu's suicide
as if he did it out of guilt.

581
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,444
He'll think it's the easiest way
to tie up loose ends.

582
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,031
He'll go as far as to kill
an innocent man?

583
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,075
Don't you know what Chairman Song is like?

584
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,952
He can do much worse things.

585
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,253
Sir, let me take on this case.

586
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,005
What?

587
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,007
You're about to become
the deputy chief prosecutor.

588
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,552
You want to avoid getting tangled up
in a messy case like this.

589
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,263
Please allow

590
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,267
your junior prosecutor the opportunity
to run with this case,

591
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,893
Sir.

592
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,812
I mean, Deputy Chief.

593
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,523
I'll oversee this case with care.

594
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,281
I didn't kill Mi-jeong.

595
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,827
But even my lawyer doesn't believe me.

596
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,287
Mr. Jung,

597
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,831
you did not kill Ms. Woo.

598
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,294
I'll find the evidence.

599
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,421
So until then,

600
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,798
you must stay alive in here.

601
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,095
You must trust me and do as I say

602
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,557
until I find indisputable evidence.

603
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,853
I will save you at all costs, Mr. Jung.

604
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,313
Do you understand?

605
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,440
Yes.

606
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,196
Why did Woo Mi-jeong forget her lipstick
and leave your stall in a hurry?

607
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,031
Because…

608
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,200
she was angry with me.

609
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,659
Why was she angry?

610
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:40,953
Because…

611
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,416
I tried to wipe
the tteokbokki sauce off of her,

612
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,752
but she suddenly hit my face.

613
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,921
You must've been offended.

614
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,090
You were just being considerate.

615
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,174
Yes.

616
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,010
I mean…

617
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,014
Despite that, you went out
to give the lipstick back to her,

618
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,894
all the way into an alley
80m away from the main road.

619
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,020
However,

620
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,650
when you saw Woo Mi-jeong
with another man,

621
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,276
you returned to your stall

622
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,570
in case you incur
a misunderstanding, correct?

623
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,655
Yes.

624
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,324
If you did not have any feelings for her,

625
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,451
you should have returned the lipstick

626
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,870
even if you saw her with another man.

627
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,081
So why did you return to your stall?

628
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,416
And why did you go back to the alley?

629
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:33,047
It shows the defendant didn't go out
to find Woo Mi-jeong

630
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,716
just to return the lipstick.

631
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,010
Jung Jong-gu, the defendant,

632
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,764
was assaulted by Woo Mi-jeong,
whom he liked, as he showed kindness.

633
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,225
While he was ashamed and humiliated,

634
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,938
he saw her with another man
and decided to commit this crime.

635
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,440
Defendant.

636
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,817
Do you admit to the crime?

637
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,694
That's absurd!

638
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,945
Goodness!

639
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,113
Jong-gu!

640
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,615
You didn't kill her!

641
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,200
Tell him you didn't.

642
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,660
-Jong-gu!
-Tell him no!

643
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,453
-Please be quiet.
-Defendant.

644
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,456
Do you admit to the crime?

645
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,674
-Mom, I want to go home!
-Jong-gu, say it!

646
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,759
-Defendant, calm down!
-I want to go home!

647
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,553
-Defendant.
-That is all.

648
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,933
Sir, he's here.

649
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,185
You're here.

650
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,565
Leave this letter on my desk.

651
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,735
Goodness, thank you for coming a long way.

652
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,031
Please excuse my clothes.
Things have been hectic lately.

653
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,991
You look nice and comfortable.

654
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,624
This is Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho,
who took charge of the trial.

655
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,917
It's a pleasure.

656
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,668
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho

657
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,295
with the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

658
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:00,968
Your grandson's name will not be mentioned
during the course of this trial.

659
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,430
Prosecutor Choi
will ensure discretion throughout it.

660
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,475
This trial, I mean.

661
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,394
Are you after money or power?

662
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,564
If I want it,

663
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,025
can you give it to me?

664
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,737
You just saved my grandson.

665
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,280
So why not?

666
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,078
In that case, both.

667
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,377
In return, from now on,

668
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,837
you'll be a part of my family.

669
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,967
Thank you.

670
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:44,971
Thank you.

671
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,055
Thank you very much.

672
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,848
That's enough.

673
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,851
I'll do my best, Mr. Song. Thank you!

674
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,941
Find out the license plate number
of the car

675
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,901
and recover the dashcam footage
no matter what.

676
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,736
Kang-ho.

677
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,947
How about this one?

678
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,699
You should wear this today.

679
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,242
Okay?

680
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,748
No, I'll wear the one you gave me
for our first anniversary.

681
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,793
No, that's too flashy.

682
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,169
This is perfect.

683
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,171
Let's go with this one.

684
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,258
Yes, this is perfect.

685
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,636
Dad.

686
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,890
Happy birthday to you.

687
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,100
Thanks.

688
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,019
I'm glad my daughter--

689
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,318
Who is he?

690
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,405
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho.

691
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,743
You must be surprised.

692
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,552
HA-YOUNG

693
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,351
You reek of something.

694
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,062
Ever since we first met.

695
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,938
What could it be?

696
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:22,193
Is it the smell of dirt
since you came from the bottom up?

697
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,448
Someone like you can never call me Father.

698
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,078
Though you must not understand
since you don't have a father.

699
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,886
Sir, it's me, Choi Kang-ho.

700
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,268
It's good.

701
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,567
Have some of this.

702
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,735
That's it. Good.

703
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,987
It's good.

704
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,494
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo used to
cover things up for Woobyeok Group.

705
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,623
Why is he suddenly
siding with Dosang Group?

706
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,960
You really don't know?

707
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,171
Hey.

708
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,674
Chairman Song used to be a thug.

709
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,217
Think about all the shady acts

710
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,553
they have committed
in their 30 years together.

711
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,389
There are rumors that
those two are behind the death

712
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,683
of the chairman of Yongra Construction,
which is now Woobyeok Group.

713
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:39,103
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.
He's cleaning up after himself

714
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,604
before it becomes a problem.

715
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,982
But if Assemblyman Oh runs for president,

716
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,734
Chairman Song wouldn't just
sit by and watch.

717
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,113
Did you seriously think
Oh Tae-soo wasn't prepared for that

718
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,739
when he dropped this bomb?

719
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,076
If things go sour,
only Woobyeok will get destroyed.

720
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,786
That's why Chairman Song

721
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,039
is dying to take down Oh Tae-soo.

722
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,125
Anyway,

723
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,795
Chairman Song
is a tactless brute to the bone.

724
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,007
All he did was bribe
and seduce him with women.

725
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,802
A sly man like Oh Tae-soo
would never fall for such tricks.

726
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,262
I'd be a sucker for that.

727
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,852
Who are you?

728
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,148
Are you Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun?

729
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,402
Chairman Song was always anxious that

730
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,654
Oh Tae-soo might betray him.

731
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,115
Corporate sales

732
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,452
have actually increased
by 21.5% compared to last year.

733
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,078
That's why

734
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,956
he sent me to work
as Oh Tae-soo's assistant

735
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,708
to keep an eye on him.

736
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,087
At first, I was just doing my job.

737
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,216
I'll move abroad and live quietly.

738
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,678
No, can you please tell him that
we're both already dead?

739
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,263
"Both"?

740
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,612
Okay then.

741
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,155
Let's do this.

742
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,823
I'll keep you

743
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,826
and your baby safe.

744
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,828
I give you my word.

745
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,166
In order to do that,
I must get Oh Tae-soo under my thumb,

746
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,419
and I can only do that
through Chairman Song.

747
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,631
Can you share with me
the confidential files you have

748
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,717
regarding Woobyeok Group?

749
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,645
In return, please do as I asked you.

750
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,234
Your baby is adorable.

751
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,859
I'm going to show the DNA test result
to Chairman Song tomorrow.

752
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,485
The day has finally come.

753
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,155
The moment Oh Tae-soo finds out
about the baby,

754
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,618
you, your mother, and those around you
might be put in danger.

755
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,162
You know that, right?

756
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,582
Prosecutor Choi, please be careful.

757
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,417
Okay.

758
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,630
You have a call from the lobby.

759
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,175
Yes?

760
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,470
Hello, sir. This is the security office.

761
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,431
Your mother is here.

762
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,515
Tell her I'm not home.

763
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,946
HAPPY FARM

764
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,952
Please take me in as your real son.

765
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,039
-What did you say?
-I want to become

766
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,166
your legal son.

767
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,127
Then as your son,

768
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,296
I will marry Oh Tae-soo's daughter.

769
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,924
You'll have Oh Tae-soo.

770
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,550
Oh Tae-soo will have me.

771
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,679
And I'll have a father.

772
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,849
None of us will be able
to betray one another.

773
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,559
We'll become a true family.

774
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,688
-Hello.
-Hello.

775
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,147
Take a look at this.

776
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:58,070
Woobyeok Group set up this paper company
in Singapore two years ago--

777
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,446
Pack up.

778
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,407
Sorry?

779
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,376
You'll be safer there than in Korea.

780
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,510
No one will be able to find you.

781
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,223
Don't worry too much. It'll all work out.

782
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,435
Thank you for doing as I asked.

783
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,343
Ms. Hwang.

784
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,889
We're here.

785
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,117
Over there.

786
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,164
Here.

787
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,002
He's the owner of a restaurant
I used to work at.

788
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,755
He'll take you to a stowaway ship
that will take you to the Philippines.

789
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,843
You may get seasick on the boat,

790
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,386
but hang in there for an hour.

791
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,138
The larger ship will be more stable.

792
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,974
Also,

793
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,434
here.

794
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,146
This is the address to your house
in the Philippines, passports,

795
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,023
and money for living expenses.

796
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,406
Oh Tae-soo may look for you,

797
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,492
so try to remain out of sight, okay?

798
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,327
Thank you so much.

799
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,246
Don't worry.

800
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,206
If my plan goes well,

801
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,875
you can return
and live happily with your baby.

802
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,421
I'm counting on you, sir.

803
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,049
Don't worry. I'll see her off
and get in touch with you.

804
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,175
Okay.

805
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,427
All right.

806
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:28,929
This way.

807
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,342
I took care of it.

808
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,935
SILLIM FRESH RAW FISH

809
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,826
Be polite to his mother.

810
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,330
And remember what I told you earlier.

811
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:37,748
Okay?

812
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,422
You must be feeling uneasy
to share difficult news with your mother.

813
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,924
The moment Chairman Song
accepted me as his son,

814
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,177
she became a stranger to me.

815
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,306
I'm only going there
to seal the legal procedure,

816
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:55,974
so I feel at ease.

817
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,436
We'll get going.

818
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:20,957
SILLIM FRESH RAW FISH

819
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,092
I got this at the biggest
jewelry shop in town.

820
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,929
They're diamonds.

821
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,599
Take a look.

822
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,646
Can you wait outside?

823
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,689
Okay.

824
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,440
Why?

825
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,990
May I have something to drink?

826
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,826
Sure. Give me a moment.

827
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,576
Goodness.

828
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,704
Come to think of it,

829
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:43,290
your fiancée was born
in the Year of the Pig.

830
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,459
It must be destiny.

831
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,502
Who am I?

832
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,337
I'm a pig farmer.

833
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:53,341
She was destined to marry
into our family, right?

834
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,809
What is this?

835
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,194
"Adoption Agreement"?

836
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,404
What is this?

837
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,157
Are you going to adopt a child?

838
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,494
Why?

839
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,912
Can she not get pregnant?

840
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,749
I will be adopted by Chairman Song
who has been raising me all along.

841
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,794
Please stamp your seal there.

842
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,633
I cannot fight against them
with Father's case,

843
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,427
as the statute of limitations
had already expired.

844
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,304
OCTOBER 3, 2021

845
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,515
No, perhaps

846
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:46,770
Father's case probably
didn't mean much to me from the beginning.

847
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,482
What I really wanted to avenge

848
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,111
was your life they utterly destroyed,

849
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,034
and the pain you felt

850
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,746
living as a bad mother
to your most beloved son.

851
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,922
I will now become Song Woo-byeok's son

852
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,383
and Oh Tae-soo's son-in-law

853
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:01,678
to destroy everything
they have ever built.

854
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,474
Since I know how difficult
and dangerous this journey will be,

855
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,853
I have to sever my ties with you.

856
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,397
Please forgive this awful son.

857
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,822
One day, when everything ends

858
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,742
and I can return to your side,

859
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,537
I wish to lie in your arms

860
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:32,125
and eat mung bean pancakes
just as I did when I was a little boy.

861
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,438
Don't do it.

862
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,066
Don't do it.

863
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,151
Don't do anything now.

864
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,028
Mom.

865
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,534
Mom.

866
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,703
Mom, where are you going?

867
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,413
Mom.

868
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,585
No.

869
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,481
Mom.

870
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,275
Mom, are you okay?

871
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,946
Mom, what's wrong?

872
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,992
So that's why you were so cold to me?

873
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,954
To pursue revenge by yourself?

874
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,290
To take all the risks by yourself?

875
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,716
My poor boy.

876
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,513
It must've been so tough.

877
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,602
It must've been so scary and lonely.

878
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,825
You have to stop everything.

879
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,368
Okay?

880
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,668
HAPPY FARM

881
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,511
What's that?

882
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,597
Goodness.

883
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,183
Their son is about to die any day now.

884
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,393
How long do these old geezers
want to live?

885
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,939
"Prostate Medicine"?

886
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,150
I might end up getting a sibling.

887
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,737
Good grief. I made a mess.

888
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,739
Darn it.

889
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,242
What's that?

890
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,466
My goodness.

891
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,765
Where should we meet tomorrow?

892
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,893
I don't accept credit cards.
Only wire transfer or cash.

893
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:37,977
Goodness!

894
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,065
Darn it.

895
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,822
Mom, what are you doing?

896
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,949
-Give it to me.
-These are mine!

897
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,492
You said these were mine!

898
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,409
Choi Kang-ho!

899
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,287
Listen very carefully.

900
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,539
These are bad things.

901
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,500
It'll put you in danger if you keep it.

902
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,378
You might end up like your dad.

903
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,380
Like Dad?

904
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,050
What happened to him?

905
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,469
We have to get rid of them.

906
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,186
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

907
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,375
If you destroy yourself in revenge,

908
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,544
that isn't revenge.

909
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,380
True revenge

910
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,676
is forgetting everything completely,
even the reason you wanted revenge,

911
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,471
and living a good life.

912
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:57,849
Let's forget.

913
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,144
Let's forget it all now.

914
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,314
You,

915
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,523
me,

916
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,734
and…

917
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,446
you too.

918
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,911
What's that?

919
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,040
Oh, my goodness!

920
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,552
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

921
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:36,864
From now on,

922
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,325
you're the owner of Happy Farm.

923
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,743
I want to be a prosecutor.

924
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,454
Goodness! You look so handsome.

925
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,999
The most eligible bachelor of Jou-ri.

926
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,585
I want to marry him off.

927
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,713
Please don't let him
regain his memories until then.

928
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:54,882
Tell me, Kang-ho.
What were you going to do to me?

929
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,135
Something's going on, right?

930
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,511
Please tell me.

931
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,889
Kang-ho, let's play.

932
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,602
How about this?
We'll give each other a gift.

933
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,229
It all went down the drain!

934
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,856
He's a prosecutor.

935
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,817
Babe, put him behind bars this instant.

936
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,111
Mi-joo, I can't hold back anymore.

937
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,740
Kang-ho still should've known.

938
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:24,621
