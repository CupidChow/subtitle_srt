1
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,437
OH TAE-SOO

3
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,938
FINALE

4
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,110
I'LL BE TAESOCRATES DISSATISFIED
RATHER THAN A PIG SATISFIED

5
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,701
I'm surprised to see you.

6
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,079
I heard you were
badly injured in an accident.

7
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,122
I was surprised too.

8
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,124
I thought it was an accident.

9
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,210
But it turns out,

10
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,544
it wasn't an accident.

11
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,424
Just like how your mistress
Hwang Soo-hyun's corpse was discovered.

12
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,259
Are you here to--

13
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,177
No.

14
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,432
I wouldn't have bothered to come here
if I was coming after you.

15
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,852
If a prosecutor
were to leak damaging information,

16
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,687
your opposing party…

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,606
No.

18
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,983
This entire country would be bent

19
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,902
on taking you down.

20
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,362
Choi Kang-ho.

21
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,489
I'll be straightforward with you.

22
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,283
I only have one goal.

23
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,993
It's to catch

24
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,705
Chairman Song, the man who murdered
my father and also attempted

25
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,708
to kill my mother and me.

26
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,257
I want you to testify against him

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,884
regarding all of his crimes
and corrupt deeds

28
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,970
that you swept under the rug.

29
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,807
Then I won't disclose your crimes.

30
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,225
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,143
Oh Ha-young.

32
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,187
She's with me right now.

33
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,706
Her resentment and hatred for you
seem quite deep.

34
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,292
If you refuse to testify,

35
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,044
then Ha-young will take the stand instead.

36
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,590
I'm not asking you for a favor.

37
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,759
I'm giving you a chance.

38
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,140
So what will it be?

39
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,519
Will you take down Song Woo-byeok with me

40
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,813
and become president?

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,441
Or will you side with him

42
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,276
and go to hell together?

43
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,949
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

44
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,120
Goodness, you're working hard
night and day.

45
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,915
Is our food here yet?

46
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,792
HOTEL CAPTAIN

47
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,420
Why did you put it back here?

48
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,508
-What are you doing?
-My gosh, you startled me!

49
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,969
What are you doing to our food?

50
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,012
Give it to me!

51
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,556
I was just curious about

52
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,392
what people at the Prosecutors' Office
have for a meal.

53
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,729
But I guess they're no different from us.

54
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,232
Don't tell me

55
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,068
you spiked our food.

56
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,027
Hey.

57
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,447
Do you think it's that easy to get drugs?

58
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,825
I'd rather spend that money
on buying myself supplements.

59
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,370
I haven't slept well
since you guys arrived.

60
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,080
Look at how haggard I am.

61
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,831
Can you tell?

62
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,875
You should just quit drinking.

63
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,960
Sam-sik.

64
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,836
By the way,

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,299
is this what people call
an office romance?

66
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,885
What are you talking about? What romance?

67
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,683
The prosecutor
and his investigation officer.

68
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,230
They're on fire!

69
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,318
Why are you crying?

70
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:41,572
Next, tell me what you and your dad
talked about on the day of the accident.

71
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,075
I'm not sure about this.

72
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,411
What? What do you mean?

73
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,705
Even if I claim that he made me do it,

74
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,165
I have no evidence.

75
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,960
Then I'll end up taking all the blame.

76
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,966
I know I should pay for what I've done.

77
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,927
But I'm afraid
that I may not be of any help

78
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,680
to Kang-ho.

79
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,184
You're already helping him greatly

80
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,520
by doing this.

81
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,815
He said he'll find evidence,

82
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,608
so let's trust him and wait.

83
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:34,459
Song Woo-byeok has ties
with the prosecution and the court.

84
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,003
So it won't be easy to get a warrant.

85
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,174
If you attack him
without being fully prepared,

86
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,469
he'll catch on to your plan.

87
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,138
And that'll put everyone in danger.

88
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,308
When will you return from the US?

89
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,518
If I could,

90
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,688
I'd love to stay and watch
the World Series before coming back.

91
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,317
Are you saying you'll neglect
the Woobyeok Beasts this season?

92
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,735
You're right.

93
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,406
I must be getting senile.

94
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,500
My goodness.

95
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,752
What a killer view.

96
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,923
I get to see this thanks to you.

97
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,218
By the way,

98
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,887
why are you here alone?

99
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,139
Did you have to do that?

100
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,309
I devoted my entire life

101
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,728
to serving you, sir.

102
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,730
Did you really have to try to kill me?

103
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,649
What are you…

104
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,489
Are you crying?

105
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,867
A grown man crying is embarrassing.

106
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,578
Sir, we should get going.

107
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,001
Hey.

108
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,087
If you made it out alive,

109
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,341
you should've fled
to another country to survive.

110
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,803
Why would you come back here
and drive a nail into your coffin?

111
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,973
In any case, I want to thank you.

112
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,976
When I heard that you were still alive,

113
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,312
I was hesitant about
going on this business trip.

114
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,690
But now, I can leave at ease.

115
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,693
Goodbye, then.

116
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,490
You asked why I came alone.

117
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,080
Mr. Cha will hear
everything you just said.

118
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,040
One of us

119
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,293
must stay alive to expose you.

120
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,212
You son of a bitch!

121
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,590
You were crying all this time,

122
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,550
and you start bargaining with me

123
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,553
when it's almost time
for my flight, you bastard?

124
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,478
What do you want?

125
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,897
Tell me! You'll be dead soon enough.

126
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,690
Do you need a house? Or money?

127
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,360
Do you want me to adopt you
like I did with Kang-ho?

128
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,363
I had the opportunity to farm
thanks to you.

129
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,950
Interestingly enough,
I reaped everything that I sowed.

130
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,078
You'll also reap what you've sown.

131
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,748
How dare you?

132
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,500
Die, you son of a bitch!

133
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,710
-Chairman Song.
-What?

134
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,056
Kang-ho.

135
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,019
You're alive?

136
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,395
My goodness.

137
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,856
I don't care about anything else.

138
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,276
I'm completely fine as long as I have you.

139
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,697
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,574
But I've only just begun.

141
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,035
Song Woo-byeok.

142
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,164
You're under arrest for special assault

143
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,582
and attempted murder.

144
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,750
What are you doing?

145
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,669
You have the right to remain silent.

146
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,880
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

147
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,173
Kang-ho.

148
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,383
Will you be okay?

149
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,135
Please don't skip your meals.

150
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,514
Take him.

151
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:31,946
SO

152
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,907
Hello?

153
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,410
-Hey.
-Let me talk to Choi Kang-ho.

154
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,786
Kang-ho?

155
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,246
Kang…

156
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,539
Hold on.

157
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,959
It's for you.

158
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,088
-Hello?
-Choi Kang-ho.

159
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,590
Run away.

160
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,426
It'll be difficult
to obtain an arrest warrant

161
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,844
for Chairman Song's past crimes.

162
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,555
That only leaves us with one option.

163
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,683
We need to catch him red-handed.

164
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,186
But I heard he'll be going
on a business trip to the US.

165
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,105
When is that?

166
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,815
Here's the plan.

167
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,943
Once I get to the rooftop,
I'd like for you all to accompany me

168
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,362
and carry out a search and seizure
of Woobyeok Group. Got it?

169
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,405
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

170
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,074
Now that he's back,
I'm motivated to work hard.

171
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,211
Recently, a victim claimed to have
received death threats

172
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,297
from Chairman Song Woo-byeok,
and thus we conducted an investigation.

173
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,923
And yesterday at 2 p.m.,

174
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,009
we arrested him at the scene

175
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,261
at Woobyeok Group's headquarters

176
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,181
after he assaulted again
and attempted to murder the victim.

177
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,061
Since the suspect attempted
to destroy the victim's phone

178
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,772
and was due to fly out to the US,

179
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,941
we deemed it likely that he might
try to destroy evidence and flee.

180
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,277
How will you carry out this investigation?

181
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,945
-Sir.
-A civil servant

182
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,491
must be impartial
when serving the country.

183
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,994
As per the Prosecutor General's words
to carry out fair investigations

184
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,121
even against the powerful,

185
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,626
we will carry out an honest, transparent,
and thorough investigation.

186
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,380
-What is the victim's current state?
-Did the suspect admit to the charges?

187
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,307
Sir.

188
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,017
It's me, Oh Tae-soo.

189
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,730
Young-soon, hurry up. It's starting.

190
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,815
Coming.

191
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,821
When did you enter my heart

192
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,948
And make me fall in love?

193
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,199
Come on.

194
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,244
-You're…
-My babies.

195
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,662
I brought you some snacks.

196
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,998
Sweet potatoes again.

197
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,542
Do you not like sweet potatoes?

198
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,877
Do you want mung bean pancakes?

199
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,755
-That's enough.
-Come here.

200
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,424
Can we please just watch?

201
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:00,094
Is that the song that Mr. Baek wrote?

202
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,429
That's right.

203
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,641
Apparently, the song is very popular now.
What was the title again?

204
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,980
-"Intrusion into My Heart."
-That's right.

205
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,607
-Come here.
-Goodness.

206
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,151
How nice!

207
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,319
You're blocking the TV.

208
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,946
This is great!

209
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,531
Let us watch the TV.

210
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,199
Hold on.

211
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,828
Move aside! You're blocking the TV.

212
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,329
-What?
-What is it?

213
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,248
-What is that?
-What is that?

214
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,001
Song Woo-byeok from Woobyeok Group
was arrested?

215
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,294
What?

216
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,921
Chairman Song has allegedly
engaged in assault and death threats

217
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,548
prior to this incident.

218
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,635
People are in an uproar after learning
that there have been many victims.

219
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,762
Recently, a victim claimed to have
received death threats

220
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,432
from Chairman Song Woo-byeok,
and thus we conducted an investigation.

221
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,517
What am I looking at?

222
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,519
Is that Kang-ho?

223
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,607
Can you slap me?

224
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,613
It's him.

225
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,157
It hurts, so that must be Kang-ho.

226
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,992
It hurts, so that is Kang-ho!

227
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,077
Our son

228
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,954
Kang-ho is back!

229
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,498
Kang-ho!

230
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,082
That's Sam-sik's best friend,

231
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,752
Kang-ho!

232
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,253
What is this?

233
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,131
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,467
Did you not trust me?

235
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,136
Answer me!

236
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,262
We're in-laws!

237
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,597
-What?
-What?

238
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,099
-"In-laws"?
-With whom?

239
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,726
With me!

240
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,563
Right, Mother?

241
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,275
How about

242
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,570
we all visit Seoul together?

243
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,490
-Sure!
-We must!

244
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,574
Let's go!

245
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,285
Is your seat belt on?

246
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,079
Do you like fish?

247
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,289
Feel free to rest your head on this.

248
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,415
Move.

249
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,669
We could've gone by ourselves.

250
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,170
Why is he here?

251
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,213
Shut it.

252
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,299
If something happens to you on the way,
he'll suspect me.

253
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,634
Easy on the brakes.

254
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,761
I just had them replaced.

255
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:09,056
I bought this car to drive
to the award ceremony.

256
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,268
It fits five people perfectly.

257
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,727
You're right.

258
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,897
Gum-ja must've become
a widow for this very day.

259
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,023
What did you say?

260
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,317
I'll buy a bigger car soon,

261
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,819
so let's go again another time.

262
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,320
That sounds great!

263
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,698
Your son is still considered a suspect.

264
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,658
We still have our eyes on him.

265
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,785
I don't want to hear it.

266
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,495
Just keep your eyes on the road.

267
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,080
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,627
Honey.

269
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,588
Are you watching from above?

270
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,757
The day has finally come.

271
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,473
Our son will carry out the judgment

272
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,853
that we failed to do.

273
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,778
Please help him stay strong.

274
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,034
Please help him not to doubt, falter,

275
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,994
or be intimidated.

276
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,122
Let him stay strong.

277
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,503
PROSECUTOR

278
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,969
Help him look them in the eye

279
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,888
and state the truth.

280
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,681
DEFENDANT

281
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,558
Just like how you did

282
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,269
in front of them,

283
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,022
please help Kang-ho

284
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,150
remain confident

285
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,736
until the end.

286
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,530
All rise.

287
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,161
With sincerity,

288
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,789
resentment,

289
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,209
and desperation…

290
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,545
I pray to you.

291
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,049
You may be seated.

292
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,179
Case 133 of the year 2023.

293
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,931
We will now begin the trial.

294
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,062
The assault that occurred
in Jou-ri on January 20

295
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,564
was just a simple fight between colleagues

296
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,316
over their pecking order.

297
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,860
So Ji-seok's claim
that Chairman Song Woo-byeok

298
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,280
ordered an assault
to be carried out is completely false.

299
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,366
The recent incident transpired

300
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,868
due to Mr. So attacking Chairman Song.

301
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,245
And the latter

302
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,039
simply reacted to defend himself.

303
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,461
Did you just say
that the victim attacked the defendant?

304
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,922
Are you talking about this?

305
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,383
Please play it.

306
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,596
Mr. Cha will hear
everything you just said.

307
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,974
One of us

308
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,393
must stay alive to expose you.

309
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,646
-You son of a bitch!
-What is that?

310
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,648
You were crying all this time,

311
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,734
and you start bargaining with me

312
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,611
when it's almost time
for my flight, bastard?

313
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,030
I'll submit this as evidence.

314
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,745
I'd like to question the victim
who's also the witness to that incident.

315
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:23,083
After the assault in Jou-ri,
you came to me for help and claimed

316
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,587
that the defendant was trying
to murder you. Is this correct?

317
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:27,963
Yes.

318
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,299
Why did he want to kill you?

319
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,678
Because as his trusted secretary,

320
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,264
I had a great deal of information
about his actions.

321
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,226
The defendant spent about
30 years as the CEO

322
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,021
of Yongra Construction and Woobyeok Group.

323
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,274
He must've had many employees
who worked closely with him,

324
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,986
and they must've known
a lot of private information as well.

325
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,238
Are you telling me that they're all dead?

326
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,119
Yes.

327
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,289
Objection, Your Honor.

328
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,542
-It hasn't been verified--
-Right, so I verified his claim.

329
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,586
In the past 30 years,

330
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,005
the defendant had four other secretaries

331
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,049
who worked closely with him.

332
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,469
Two committed suicide
and one died in a car crash.

333
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,389
And the last secretary's body
was recently found near Jemyeon Island.

334
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,518
It was Hwang Soo-hyun.

335
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,230
Your Honor, the prosecution is referring
to a case that is irrelevant to--

336
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,024
I'm verifying the witness' statement.

337
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,442
How is that irrelevant?

338
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,237
Prosecution.

339
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,155
You may continue.

340
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,200
That's right.

341
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,161
This USB was found
at the defendant's office

342
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,372
during a search and seizure.

343
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,958
Do you know what it contains?

344
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,336
It contains confidential documents
related to Woobyeok's corrupt deeds,

345
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:53,549
Chairman Song's double bookkeeping,
breach of trust, and embezzlement.

346
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,092
It belonged to Hwang Soo-hyun.

347
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,302
What is he talking about?

348
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,387
Hwang Soo-hyun?

349
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,307
Could you explain this video

350
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,977
that was found on your secretary's laptop?

351
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,603
Please play it.

352
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,480
Don't be ridiculous.

353
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,860
I already know the hit-and-run accident
and suicide were in the contract.

354
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,825
A year ago, Chairman Song
ordered me to visit Yang Gu-man's wife

355
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,535
and retrieve his money.

356
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,995
Jeez.

357
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,415
All right. Then I'd like
to ask the defendant.

358
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,333
According to the investigation,

359
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,211
Hwang Soo-hyun was last seen
before her death

360
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,046
on October 3, 2021.

361
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,592
It's the same day
the last video on this USB was saved.

362
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,511
So why was this USB found in your desk?

363
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,268
Look.

364
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,354
How would I know anything
about the USB or that Mr. Yang

365
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,940
when he's the one who schemed everything?

366
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,528
So you're claiming
that the victim schemed everything himself

367
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,574
and that you never murdered
or abetted murder?

368
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,617
Correct.

369
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,951
That's a lie!

370
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,872
He also ordered me to kill people.

371
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,793
He ordered you to kill people?

372
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,545
Who were they?

373
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,673
Jung Jong-gu, the defendant
in the murder case

374
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,884
that Chairman Song's grandson
was involved in,

375
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:23,096
and Park Cheol-su, the defendant
in the Woobyeok construction site case.

376
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,849
So did you carry out your orders?

377
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,018
They were both incarcerated,

378
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,937
so I couldn't.

379
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:37,152
I found a few odd things
during this investigation.

380
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,612
It is the fact that

381
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,741
not only the defendant's secretaries
but also many of those

382
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,161
who raised suspicions about
the defendant or his company

383
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,622
or were involved in the trials

384
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,085
suddenly passed away or disappeared.

385
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:57,005
Objection, Your Honor.
The prosecution is distorting the truth

386
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,757
solely based on the victim's claims.

387
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,344
Then let me summon another witness
who can verify this.

388
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,362
Approved.

389
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,406
Witness, Mr. Oh Tae-soo,

390
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,116
please come forward.

391
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,537
Oh Tae-soo?

392
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,913
Oh Tae-soo?

393
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,101
What is this?

394
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,894
Why is he testifying?

395
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,901
"I pledge this."

396
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,406
"I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

397
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,450
and agree to receive punishment

398
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,535
in accordance with perjury
should there be any falsehood."

399
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,787
"Witness, Oh Tae-soo."

400
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,373
If Song Woo-byeok gets arrested,

401
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,585
Bareun Hanguk Party, the political
and business worlds, and even the media

402
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,379
will find fault with you.

403
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,507
Because everyone knows about

404
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,885
your secret ties with him
and how far they go back.

405
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,848
But what if

406
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,851
you testify against him?

407
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:38,023
It'd be a perfect chance
to dispel all the suspicions

408
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,444
regarding the relationship
between you and him.

409
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,823
You have indicted Chairman Song many times

410
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,201
for 30 years since 1987.

411
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,119
-Is this true?
-Correct.

412
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,372
However, most of these indictments
were dismissed.

413
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,918
The majority of these cases,
13 in total, were dismissed

414
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,795
due to the victims' deaths.

415
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,963
That's correct.

416
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,132
Did you ever find the repeated deaths

417
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,010
of the plaintiffs or victims rather odd?

418
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,224
There was no issue
in the investigation of their deaths,

419
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,019
and the bereaved families
didn't raise any suspicion.

420
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,313
So I didn't find them particularly odd.

421
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,652
However, I found something odd

422
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,279
in this trial.

423
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,533
It is the death of Hwang Soo-hyun,

424
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,493
his secretary.

425
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,664
She worked as my secretary

426
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,291
from 2018 to 2020.

427
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,836
Then one day in 2020,

428
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,922
she told me that she wanted to quit.

429
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,841
The reason being…

430
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,220
that getting pregnant
had put her life in danger.

431
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,602
Her pregnancy had put her life in danger?

432
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,020
Correct.

433
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,440
She said Chairman Song was the father.

434
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,533
If you do this,

435
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,827
all the disgusting work

436
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,747
that I forced myself to put up with
will go to waste.

437
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,293
I was even willing to serve time in jail

438
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,004
to make you become president,

439
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,630
you son of a bitch!

440
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,299
Defendant, please sit down!

441
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,009
How is that baby mine?

442
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,596
As if killing that poor baby
wasn't enough,

443
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,974
are you trying to
turn him into a bastard now?

444
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,475
You even plotted

445
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,811
to kill Choi Kang-ho with your daughter!

446
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,771
-You son of a bitch!
-Defendant!

447
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,773
-How dare you utter such nonsense?
-Please calm down!

448
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,401
You son of a bitch! I'm not going down.

449
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,155
No, not yet, honey.

450
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,742
If I waver right now,
our son will waver as well.

451
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,287
Everything he's done up to now
will be ruined.

452
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,580
Please, honey.

453
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,874
Keep me here for a little longer.

454
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,126
Please…

455
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,794
Just a little longer.

456
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,795
Sit down!

457
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,131
-Sir. Please.
-I ought to kill you.

458
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,716
Damn it!

459
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,183
It's true.

460
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,978
I slipped

461
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,649
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho sleeping pills.

462
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,997
We will accept the prosecutor's request.

463
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,751
We believe verifying the facts
is of the utmost importance.

464
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,963
You may cross-examine the two witnesses.

465
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,594
I was deceived into believing that
Prosecutor Choi, my then fiancée,

466
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,263
had another woman and a baby.

467
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,808
And that he even killed them

468
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,559
so he could marry me.

469
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,980
Who told you that?

470
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,856
It was my father,

471
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,400
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo.

472
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,241
It's all my fault.

473
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:21,871
I've been threatened by Chairman Song
ever since I decided to run for president.

474
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,042
He wanted me to protect
his corrupt company

475
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,087
and himself.

476
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,300
When I refused,
he attempted to use my daughter

477
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,385
to get rid of Prosecutor Choi.

478
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,639
Why did Chairman Song want me dead?

479
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,184
That's because 35 years ago, Chairman Song

480
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,564
murdered Prosecutor Choi's father.

481
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,942
Is that true?

482
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,448
Simply put,

483
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,576
there were two people
Chairman Song needed to get rid of.

484
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,786
Hwang Soo-hyun, his mistress,

485
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,748
and Choi Kang-ho, Choi Hae-sik's son.

486
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,334
That's why he killed her

487
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,627
and framed Prosecutor Choi for it.

488
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,631
And after that, he ordered my daughter
to kill Prosecutor Choi.

489
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,091
Stop lying.

490
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,848
It was you who wanted him dead.

491
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,644
It was also you
who killed Hwang Soo-hyun and her baby.

492
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,272
They were your mistress and son.

493
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,403
I saw the DNA test result

494
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,114
with my own eyes.

495
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,587
This is my daughter's medical record
from the mental hospital.

496
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,757
That's right.

497
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,469
My daughter isn't sane.

498
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,721
I've been hiding it

499
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,184
in fear that my dear daughter
would get caught in political mudslinging.

500
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,353
Dad!

501
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,320
Dad.

502
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,242
What happened to you?

503
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,162
Who made you like this?

504
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,959
Dad.

505
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,710
It's me.

506
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,838
It's me, Ha-young.

507
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,384
I'm Oh Ha-young, your beloved daughter.

508
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,720
I'm so scared right now.

509
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,854
I'm in so much pain.

510
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,402
Dad.

511
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,447
Can you please stop here?

512
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,490
I beg you.

513
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,326
Please come back, Dad.

514
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,871
Please?

515
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,956
Let's stop here.

516
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,624
Please?

517
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,384
Please consider that she qualifies
as an individual with a mental disorder

518
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,972
as per Article 10, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act.

519
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,193
There's another reason

520
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,487
that I helped my father.

521
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,323
It was because

522
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,953
my father schemed with Chairman Song

523
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,081
and murdered Choi Hae-sik,
Choi Kang-ho's father, 35 years ago.

524
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,506
Unbelievable.

525
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,801
At that time,

526
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,345
he bribed the detective in charge

527
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,473
and fabricated the marks
on the victim's body.

528
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,353
I believe my daughter
is very unstable right now.

529
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,188
I request that you adjourn this trial.

530
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,690
Witness, please sit down.

531
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,819
The court will decide whether to adjourn.

532
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,704
Taking their testimonies
into consideration,

533
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,873
I believe the answer to this case

534
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,543
lies in the death of Hwang Soo-hyun,

535
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,546
Chairman Song's former secretary.

536
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,674
Witness Oh Tae-soo
claims the defendant, Chairman Song,

537
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,510
murdered Hwang Soo-hyun.

538
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,013
But Song Woo-byeok and Oh Ha-young
claim that Oh Tae-soo killed her.

539
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,515
In addition,

540
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,476
the police consider me,
Choi Kang-ho, as a key suspect.

541
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,271
And it is most likely

542
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,982
that the baby's father killed her.

543
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,401
Then there's only one solution.

544
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,238
We'll see if the baby's DNA…

545
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,117
matches any of ours.

546
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,829
What is he saying?

547
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,872
Prosecution.

548
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,584
You're not allowed to summon
any more witnesses.

549
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,021
The baby…

550
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,357
is alive.

551
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,419
Choi Kang-ho.

552
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,716
You said you'd rather be

553
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,344
Taesocrates dissatisfied
rather than a pig satisfied.

554
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,721
But you're wrong.

555
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,141
No matter how hungry a mother pig is,

556
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:01,646
she wouldn't move recklessly
so as not to harm her piglets.

557
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,567
Someone like you who used his child
as a murder weapon

558
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,653
and heartlessly attempted to kill them

559
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,656
could never fathom such parental love.

560
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,664
Prosecutor Choi

561
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,417
is trying to taint my reputation
before the presidential election.

562
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,003
This is a political maneuver and slander.

563
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,840
I will find out who's behind this
and hold them responsible.

564
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,091
Please sit down.

565
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,176
-I refuse to testify anymore.
-Witness.

566
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,346
Stop, or I will consider it an attempt
at destroying evidence and fleeing.

567
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,556
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho!

568
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,182
You bastard.

569
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,560
Oh Tae-soo.

570
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,479
You, and your accomplice Song Woo-byeok,

571
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,691
are under arrest for abetting the murders
of Hwang Soo-hyun and her son,

572
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,570
myself and my mother, Jin Young-soon,

573
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,324
and Choi Hae-sik who died
in the 1988 arson case in Bongu-dong.

574
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,537
You have the right to remain silent.

575
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,042
Hurray!

576
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,336
Hurray for Choi Kang-ho!

577
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,089
-Hurray for my son!
-Hurray!

578
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,383
-Hurray!
-Hurray for Choi Kang-ho!

579
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,885
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

580
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,179
-Quiet down, everyone!
-Hurray!

581
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,306
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

582
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,142
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

583
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,502
Breaking news.

584
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,754
This afternoon,
Jeilmirae Party's Candidate Oh Tae-soo

585
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,173
was arrested for abetting murders.

586
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,801
The prosecution is investigating

587
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,513
Chairman Song's slush fund worth
hundreds of billions and the embezzlement…

588
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,890
He colluded with Oh Tae-soo
and destroyed evidence.

589
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:04,936
And in return, monopolized the
distribution rights for hand sanitizers…

590
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,189
This is the CCTV footage of the culprit
in front of the VIP ward.

591
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:12,360
Suspect Yoon Jae-min was found guilty
of using drugs and rape.

592
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,446
A retrial was filed
after digital forensics results

593
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,784
revealed that the fall of Jung Min-ho
at the construction site

594
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,994
was in fact
the fault of Woobyeok Construction.

595
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:26,165
The public is keenly interested
in the Bongu-dong fire incident

596
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,625
and Choi Hae-sik's death.

597
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,212
-Release Assemblyman Oh!
-Release Assemblyman Oh!

598
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,402
They say you shouldn't bark
if you can't bite.

599
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,946
You'll have to resign
if you want to take me down.

600
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,030
So what'll you do?

601
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,991
You're the one who taught me,

602
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,492
"Hit a home run or strikeout."

603
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,744
Now that I've hit a home run,

604
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,080
I'll gladly take a strikeout.

605
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,796
WE BELIEVE IN YOU, ASSEMBLYMAN OH

606
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,723
Excuse me.

607
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,559
Ye-jin.

608
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:30,062
"Happy" is spelled with a "p."

609
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,606
Turn the "d" letter upright.

610
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,483
Okay? Try it.

611
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,445
-Gosh, they look so happy.
-Here.

612
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,822
-Here, let me.
-All right.

613
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,033
All right.

614
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,160
-You little brat.
-What?

615
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,413
You should've told me sooner
that he had recovered.

616
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:51,417
I thought you'd urge me
to marry him if you found out.

617
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,127
What do you mean?

618
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,005
I didn't want to make you look bad.

619
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,131
Goodness.

620
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,883
Hey, did you hear?

621
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,385
Kang-ho and Mi-joo--

622
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,889
You heard?

623
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,099
I watched it.

624
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,645
What do you mean? Watched what?

625
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,438
The JBC drama.

626
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,193
Darn it. Move aside.

627
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,278
Hey.

628
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,949
Sam-sik, let me.

629
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,743
You must be tired from the trial.

630
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,912
You should just rest.

631
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:31,874
Since Mr. Sam-sik never works,
he can serve the food today.

632
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:36,754
In other words, he's jobless.

633
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,755
Seo-jin, you…

634
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,594
Sure, laugh while you still can.

635
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,055
Once you find out who Kang-ho really is,

636
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,349
you won't be laughing anymore.

637
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,269
Hey, watch what you say to a kid.

638
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,688
-Sam-sik, why are you idling around?
-Let's go.

639
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,939
What did you say to them?

640
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,440
Goodness.

641
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,276
I don't think I've ever felt

642
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:03,698
this happy and proud in my life before.

643
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,909
-Prosecutor Choi.
-Yes?

644
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:12,039
You were absolutely amazing today.

645
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,834
"Oh Tae-soo."

646
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,588
"You're under arrest for abetting murder."

647
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,218
Now,

648
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:28,764
let me introduce the woman
who raised this wonderful prosecutor.

649
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,308
The star of the day!

650
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,518
I bring you

651
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,353
Ms. Jin Young-soon!

652
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,604
Mom.

653
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,148
-Come on, Mom.
-Gosh.

654
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,817
-Hurray for Jin Young-soon!
-Jin Young-soon!

655
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,029
-My mom!
-Jin Young-soon!

656
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,864
Gosh.

657
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,408
You're embarrassing me.

658
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,997
It's already been 35 years

659
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,793
since I moved here
with a single pig on my truck.

660
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:03,007
I had no money or knowledge.

661
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,551
I was just

662
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,472
an unwelcome pregnant woman
who suddenly barged in here.

663
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,767
But you all welcomed me with open arms.

664
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,311
No, we didn't.

665
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,689
We hated the stinky pig smell
and protested your move.

666
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,858
You even carried Sam-sik on your back.

667
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,818
It's true.

668
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,154
You're right.

669
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,199
You barged into my house

670
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,701
wielding farm tools.

671
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,454
Then I suddenly went into labor.

672
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,790
And you helped me deliver Kang-ho.

673
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,999
Me too.

674
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,542
That's right.

675
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,087
-You were born in that room.
-Yes, Mi-joo too.

676
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,467
Just like how
we can't predict when we'll be born,

677
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,304
we can't predict when we'll die either.

678
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:55,393
I'd like to thank you all

679
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,396
while I still have a healthy mind.

680
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,190
People might say

681
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,653
that I'm the most unfortunate woman.

682
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,990
I lost my husband as well as my parents.

683
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,620
And then my son was seriously injured,
and I have an incurable illness.

684
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,624
I doubt there's anyone
who's more unlucky than me.

685
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,212
But you know what?

686
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:30,636
Life is so fascinating
and makes you grateful.

687
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,557
When it takes one thing from you,

688
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,936
it always replaces it with something else.

689
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,899
Losing my parents

690
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,694
taught me to value my husband.

691
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,490
And losing my husband
taught me to value my son.

692
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,243
And when my son was unwell,

693
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,538
I learned to value myself

694
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,915
so I could take care of him.

695
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,252
And because my life was cut short,

696
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,339
I learned to value everyone here,

697
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,010
who will be in his life in my stead.

698
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,931
Not many people are lucky enough

699
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,895
to encounter all these blessings
in their lifetime.

700
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,232
I'm truly blessed

701
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,988
for being able to live this precious life.

702
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,159
Mr. Son.

703
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,369
Yes?

704
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,997
Mr. Bang.

705
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,795
And Sung-ae and Gum-ja.

706
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,844
Thanks to you,

707
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,222
I've never felt lonely

708
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,474
and lived

709
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,477
such a chaotic, happy life.

710
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,399
Later…

711
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,401
Much later in life,

712
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,614
when you move
into the neighborhood up there,

713
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,990
I'll be the one

714
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:19,161
hurrying out
and welcoming you with open arms.

715
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,371
Gosh.

716
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,830
Goodness.

717
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,290
Please.

718
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,750
Until then,

719
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,002
I pray that you'll be healthy

720
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,756
for a very long time.

721
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,341
All right.

722
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,885
You better welcome us with open arms.

723
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,387
Sing for us too.

724
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,391
Gosh, I'm embarrassing myself.

725
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,518
One, two, three, four.

726
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,771
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

727
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:49,525
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

728
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:53,737
-Happy birthday, dear Young-soon
-Happy birthday, dear Young-soon

729
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,992
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

730
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,371
Wait.

731
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,539
Make a wish first.

732
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,802
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOM

733
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,225
All right, hop on.

734
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,729
I'll make rounds for getting into college,
passing the bar exam,

735
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,105
and becoming a prosecutor.

736
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,773
-Goodness.
-Yes, Kang-ho!

737
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,025
-Come on.
-You're awesome!

738
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,281
-Oh, no!
-Gosh!

739
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,866
-Gosh!
-Oh, my!

740
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,118
-Goodness.
-You're still very healthy, Mom.

741
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,328
Do it again.

742
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,580
-You should lose some weight.
-Carry me again.

743
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,664
All right. Here.

744
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,458
-All right.
-Let's do it again.

745
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,878
This is for getting into college!

746
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,138
Here.

747
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:07,853
This was the very first ring
your father-in-law got me.

748
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,900
And here.

749
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18,030
This was the very first ring
I got your dad.

750
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:25,454
People say to love
as if it's your first time.

751
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,373
But

752
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,876
I'd like you to love
as if it's your last time.

753
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:36,423
"These are the last words
that they're going to hear from me."

754
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,343
"This is the last image of me

755
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,762
that they'll remember."

756
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:46,308
That mindset will make you
think twice about how you speak

757
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,519
and act towards each other.

758
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,524
Just like how

759
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,611
I still remember
your dad's last words to this day.

760
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,906
What were his last words?

761
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,162
"See you later."

762
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,334
He hated saying bye
because it implied an end.

763
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,380
That's why he always said,
"See you later," instead.

764
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,924
"See you later."

765
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,260
"See you later."

766
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,306
Saying it over and over
gave me butterflies

767
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,769
because it really felt like
we were going to meet again.

768
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:43,031
Think of each other as gems
and treat one another preciously.

769
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,160
Take good care and love each other.

770
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,495
And live a happy life.

771
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,664
-Okay?
-Okay.

772
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:51,915
Okay.

773
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,505
Come to think of it, both of you were born

774
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:03,844
in that room on the same day and time.

775
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,803
Right?

776
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,350
Mi-joo, your grandma once said this.

777
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,312
"We say it's meant to be…"

778
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,314
We say it's meant to be

779
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,567
to someone whom we meet
for the first time.

780
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,570
But fate is

781
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:26,658
what we say to someone
who stays with us until the end.

782
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,289
Don't you think our kids
were fated to end up with each other?

783
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,512
What?

784
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,680
Why are you here?

785
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,517
Are you going to sleep here?

786
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,768
Of course.

787
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,313
I'm going to sleep
next to you until I get married.

788
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:57,898
Goodness.

789
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,151
I should start looking
for a venue tomorrow.

790
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,319
What?

791
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,946
Do you hate it that much?

792
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,615
It's gross. You're a grown man.

793
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,077
It's not like you're Seo-jin or Ye-jin.

794
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:14,498
Seo-jin's eyes and lips remind me of you

795
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,042
when you were his age.

796
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,254
And Ye-jin

797
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,548
is excellent at drawing.

798
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,969
They're definitely your kids.

799
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,933
Whatever. I'm going to sleep with you.

800
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,726
-Lie down.
-Gosh, what are you doing?

801
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,437
Just lie down. Let's sleep side by side.

802
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,730
All right.

803
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,357
-Goodness.
-Here.

804
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,236
There.

805
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:45,946
All right.

806
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,033
Are you tired?

807
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,076
Yes.

808
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,579
I'm a bit tired.

809
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,290
It's been

810
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,501
a long journey.

811
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,296
Right?

812
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:11,471
All right. Let me massage your legs.

813
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,806
Goodness.

814
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,808
That's okay.

815
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,478
Come lie down.

816
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,607
Sing me a lullaby.

817
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,318
-What?
-That song.

818
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,947
The song you sang for me

819
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,658
after our first date.

820
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,912
I want to fall asleep to that song.

821
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:42,044
Okay. Your wish is my command.

822
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,137
A tiring day passed by

823
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,683
Two are under the moonlight

824
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,811
As one shadow

825
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,023
That distant happiness is

826
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:07,903
Still there seemingly within my reach

827
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,863
When I

828
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,742
Close my eyes

829
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,786
I'm so happy.

830
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:23,543
Though your wounded heart

831
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,922
May cast a shadow

832
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:31,176
On your dream

833
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,388
But don't forget

834
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,934
That someone

835
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,562
Who loves you dearly

836
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,025
Is by your side

837
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:52,447
At times, this road

838
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,284
May seem endless

839
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:03,333
And you may shed tears of sadness

840
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,421
But until the day

841
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,799
We can reminisce these moments

842
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,220
Let's become

843
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:21,017
A place of shelter for one another

844
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:55,427
Even if the dreams we yearn for

845
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,973
Can't be found

846
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,436
Over the rainbow in the future

847
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,316
These moments

848
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,319
That we spend

849
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,491
Together

850
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,872
Are more important

851
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,877
Than anything else…

852
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,343
Mom…

853
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,137
Mom…

854
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:47,938
Mom.

855
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,861
See you later.

856
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,334
LATE JIN YOUNG-SOON

857
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:18,718
REST IN PEACE

858
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,485
When will I need to do this?

859
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,612
Later.

860
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,531
Much later.

861
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,284
So let's try it.

862
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:18,737
Goodness.

863
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:25,201
Goodness.

864
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:30,540
Goodness.

865
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,420
Goodness.

866
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:39,299
-Goodness.
-I am happy

867
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:43,053
I am happy

868
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,848
I am happy

869
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,393
I am very very happy

870
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:54,147
The long awaited day has come

871
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,694
I am

872
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,739
Happy

873
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:08,912
I am happy

874
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:13,375
I am happy

875
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,462
I am very very happy

876
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,505
That's right.

877
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,635
-I am happy
-I am happy

878
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,556
-I am happy
-I am happy

879
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,769
-I am happy
-I am happy

880
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:36,690
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

881
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:41,611
-I am happy
-I am happy

882
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,949
-I am happy
-I am happy

883
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,995
-I am happy
-I am happy

884
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:54,457
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

885
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:58,378
-I am happy
-I am happy

886
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:02,465
-I am happy
-I am happy

887
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:07,095
-I am happy
-I am happy

888
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:10,932
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

889
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,478
-I am happy
-I am happy

890
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,399
-I am happy
-I am happy

891
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:23,319
-I am happy
-I am happy

892
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,865
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

893
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:30,827
I am happy

894
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,414
I am happy

895
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,847
I told you to stop calling me.

896
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,850
What if the kids catch on to us?

897
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,895
You released another new song?

898
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,068
"The Lovely Gumja Tower"? Get out.

899
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,614
I told you not to name
your songs so obviously.

900
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:09,949
So tell me.

901
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,204
When will you be visiting again?

902
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,251
Visit at dawn.

903
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,546
When everyone is still fast asleep.

904
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,930
That was Grandma Jung, the crazy--

905
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:35,058
I mean, that was Grandma Jung
who's crazy in love.

906
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,435
By the way, what are you doing?

907
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,105
I'm searching for stroke symptoms.

908
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,398
Her pronunciation is off.

909
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:47,070
I'm happy

910
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,531
Where's Sam-sik?

911
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,658
What is it? Is something missing again?

912
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,286
He stole my brand new
cashmere long johns, socks,

913
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,539
and underwear!

914
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,709
What could he possibly use them for?

915
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,796
I'm speaking from experience.

916
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,048
Goods from outside are much better.

917
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,176
These are

918
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,763
cashmere long johns,
so they're extremely light

919
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:14,806
and warm.

920
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:19,561
And these socks are from a famous brand.

921
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:23,731
You'll look awfully stylish
if you wear these

922
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,984
under that cobalt uniform.

923
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,652
As for the underwear…

924
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,904
Would they be too big for you?

925
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,449
My mom does have a big butt.

926
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,662
Thank you.

927
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,333
Gosh, don't mention it.

928
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,712
Two years will pass

929
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,589
in the blink of an eye.

930
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,090
They will just fly by.

931
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,384
What's truly important

932
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,053
is that you and I are meant to be.

933
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,764
Meant to be.

934
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,018
Do you need anything else?

935
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,021
Do you need sesame oil?

936
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:03,938
Red chili powder?

937
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,109
We grew some tasty cabbage this year.

938
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,903
Would you like some?

939
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,368
-I am happy
-I am happy

940
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:20,997
-I am happy
-I am happy

941
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,791
-I am happy
-I am happy

942
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:27,337
-I am very very happy
-I am very very happy

943
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,464
Gosh, what's your secret?

944
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,591
You always have a bountiful harvest.

945
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,842
There's no secret.

946
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,137
You just reap what you sow.

947
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,353
What's with the cars
in front of Mr. Son's house?

948
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,691
No, don't come out, Tiger.

949
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,235
Honey!

950
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,320
Wait!

951
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,073
What's happening?

952
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,158
Why are you leaving out of the blue?

953
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,754
Thank you for everything you've done.

954
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:15,969
My father re-established
a newly-rising yakuza.

955
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,137
So I must return.

956
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,724
You irritated everyone
with your perfect Korean.

957
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,768
But now, you speak with an accent.

958
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,728
This isn't fair.

959
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,857
Then what were
all those years we spent together?

960
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:30,817
No.

961
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,486
What was I to you?

962
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,946
Was I just for your enjoyment?

963
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,699
I couldn't even enjoy you.

964
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,409
You know that.

965
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,745
It's time. Please get in the car.

966
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,629
Wait.

967
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,306
Pregnant?

968
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:03,850
What?

969
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:10,481
Tell Father that I am carrying
someone's child.

970
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,359
How's that possible?

971
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,827
Honey.

972
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,126
HAPPY FARM

973
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,881
There he is.

974
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,090
Mom.

975
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,134
-Jong-gu!
-Mom!

976
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,011
-Mom!
-What took you so long?

977
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,305
Mom, don't cry.

978
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,723
My poor son.

979
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,601
SEOBU PENITENTIARY

980
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,062
Mr. Jung Jong-gu.

981
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,274
I'm sorry it took so long.

982
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,236
Don't be.

983
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,156
I knew you'd come back for me.

984
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,824
Thank you.

985
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,912
Sir, here.

986
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:10,500
Your mother has been sending us kimchi,

987
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:14,337
side dishes, and red chili powder.

988
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,839
We wanted to refuse,

989
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,050
but they were so delicious.

990
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,844
So we've been accepting them
all this time.

991
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,973
Please tell her
she doesn't have to anymore

992
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,184
and that we're grateful.

993
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,105
I will.

994
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,649
Kang-ho!

995
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,529
Kang-ho!

996
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,114
Be careful.

997
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,035
Dad!

998
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,413
-Seo-jin!
-Ye-jin!

999
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,000
He's my dad? I will never accept that.

1000
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:56,003
How could she steal
her own daughter's man?

1001
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,047
Where are you going?

1002
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,174
Let's play together.

1003
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,176
Let's play together.

1004
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,886
Come on.

1005
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,013
Ye-jin.

1006
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,267
Hi.

1007
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,231
We just moved here today.

1008
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,358
Where does the village head live?

1009
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,987
The trip there will be quite rough.

1010
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,114
So let me escort you there myself.

1011
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,657
This way, Mother.

1012
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:28,870
HAPPY FARM

1013
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,038
When did you decorate all this?

1014
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,623
Where did you get the money?

1015
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,210
Do you remember this?

1016
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,672
It's the bankbook you gave me.

1017
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,135
I wanted to throw this at your face
the next time we met,

1018
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:46,012
so I didn't spend a single penny.

1019
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,389
But you know what?

1020
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,433
Your mom told me

1021
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:54,979
to think of you as a gem
and treat you preciously.

1022
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,442
-Right. Come here.
-What?

1023
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,736
PIG FARM, OFFICE
WELCOME, HAPPY FARM

1024
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,073
Take a look.

1025
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,493
Look.

1026
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:11,037
That's Father, and that's Mother.

1027
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,664
And I love this photo.

1028
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,959
We took this to commemorate

1029
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,045
the donation we gave
under the name of Happy Farm

1030
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,214
after receiving a prize
for our pig farm business.

1031
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,757
This was such a proud moment, wasn't it?

1032
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,133
It was.

1033
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,098
This is the cutest photo of you
taken on your first birthday.

1034
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,730
And that's a photo
of your parents' wedding.

1035
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,649
And…

1036
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:45,863
I thought long and hard about
what photo to hang next to it.

1037
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:47,156
And I think

1038
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:51,577
it'd be nice to hang
something similar to this one.

1039
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,163
If you have any good ideas, let me know.

1040
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,165
Okay?

1041
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,042
-Next to that one?
-Yes.

1042
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,171
Go get changed.

1043
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:03,631
Okay.

1044
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,709
To my beloved son, Kang-ho.

1045
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:45,047
Do you remember the very first letter
you had written to me?

1046
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,051
"We may be apart,

1047
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:54,348
but I still live

1048
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:58,269
in the memories
I shared with you and Father."

1049
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,566
By the time you read this letter,

1050
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,943
I'll be feeling the same.

1051
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,696
Kang-ho.

1052
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,657
The Chinese character for "connection"

1053
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:15,745
contains the characters
for "thread" and "pig head."

1054
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,833
The connections we build with others
are just as difficult

1055
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,836
as leading a pig with a thread.

1056
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:32,303
You and I were connected
as mother and son.

1057
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,015
It's such a precious bond

1058
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:39,602
so I wanted to become
the best mom for you.

1059
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,730
But you only get one life

1060
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:45,316
and it was my first time being a mom,

1061
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:49,153
so I'm sorry that I wasn't good enough.

1062
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:53,991
I made a wish before blowing out
my birthday candles.

1063
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:59,205
I prayed that
I'd become your mom once again.

1064
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,959
If that ever happens,

1065
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,586
I promise to be a better mom.

1066
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:14,345
I won't tell you not to be sad about
not having a dad.

1067
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,933
I won't say that your grades
are all that matters in life.

1068
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:24,313
I won't ignore your talent for drawing.

1069
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,068
I won't turn away

1070
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,529
when I know that you want to eat more.

1071
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,532
I won't hold back my tears

1072
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,284
when I see you in pain.

1073
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,705
I'll help you get up when you fall.

1074
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,082
I'll embrace you when you're afraid.

1075
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,794
I'll say, "Good job,"

1076
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,421
"thank you,"

1077
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,840
and "I love you,"

1078
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,551
every single day.

1079
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,096
And I won't

1080
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,849
leave you so soon.

1081
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,477
I love you, my son.

1082
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:09,066
I hope you live a long, happy life

1083
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,736
with Mi-joo, Seo-jin, and Ye-jin.

1084
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,406
And we'll meet again

1085
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,576
on the day my prayer is answered.

1086
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,954
From your bad mother.

1087
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:50,608
Today

1088
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,987
is the day propose to Mi-joo

1089
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,449
to ask her to live
a long and happy life with me.

1090
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,994
But you ruined everything.

1091
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,712
Please watch over me

1092
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,340
so that I won't be too nervous.

1093
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,176
No.

1094
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,888
Protect us.

1095
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:30,981
Lee Mi-joo!

1096
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:35,694
You're under arrest for becoming my wife!

1097
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:39,115
You don't have the right to remain silent.

1098
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,408
You cannot ask your mother for help
when we argue.

1099
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,785
How childish.

1100
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,829
This isn't a proposal.

1101
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,164
-Why not?
-What you just said

1102
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,875
might be used against you later in life.

1103
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,252
So watch out, okay?

1104
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,922
-This won't do.
-What?

1105
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:56,674
All right. I need your help.

1106
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,217
-What?
-All right.

1107
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,722
Lee Mi-joo!

1108
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,766
I saved your life three times.

1109
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,685
So even if I get so annoying,

1110
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,186
even if we argue,

1111
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,605
and even if I get downright childish,

1112
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:16,819
promise to live with me happily
for the rest of our lives.

1113
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,451
All right, go ahead.

1114
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:25,828
-Come here.
-Go to mommy.

1115
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,664
-No!
-Oh, no!

1116
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,664
-Kang-ho! Hang on, I…
-We have to look good.

1117
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:14,668
Come on, think of our age.

1118
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:18,005
-He is a napa cabbage flower
-Napa cabbage flower

1119
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:22,760
A new wind will blow

1120
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:23,802
SAM-SIK'S MILL

1121
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,722
I don't even eat marinated crabs

1122
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:28,349
because it's so good
I'd steal to eat them!

1123
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:29,558
I hate stray cats even more.

1124
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,644
They're like little thieves.

1125
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,188
Do you know how shocked I was

1126
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:36,523
when The Thieves was released?

1127
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,317
Hey!

1128
01:10:55,626 --> 01:11:00,631
