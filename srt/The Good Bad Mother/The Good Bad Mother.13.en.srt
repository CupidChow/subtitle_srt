THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,938
EPISODE 13

3
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,152
GWANGMYEONGHO

4
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,616
Mr. Cho!

5
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,301
Mr. Cho, it's me.

6
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:36,930
Mr. Cho.

7
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,023
Have you been well?

8
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,026
Mr. Cho.

9
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,529
Mr. Cho, it's me, Choi Kang-ho.

10
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,423
Mr. Cho, what's wrong?

11
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,470
Are you all right?

12
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,931
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

13
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,266
Suicide?

14
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,520
Ms. Hwang committed suicide?

15
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,564
Strictly speaking,

16
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,775
it was suicide.

17
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,033
It should be here by now.

18
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,548
Is that the one?

19
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,348
That must be the boat Kang-ho mentioned.

20
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,441
We're here. Please get ready.

21
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,384
You need to hide. Now!

22
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,765
Darn it!

23
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,601
You need to hide! Hurry!

24
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:54,943
Who are you?

25
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,527
Darn it, you…

26
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,735
After that day,

27
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,571
I called you many times,

28
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,824
but you couldn't be reached.

29
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,451
So I went to the Prosecutors' Office,

30
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,662
and I heard you got into a car accident

31
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,956
and fell into a vegetative state.

32
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,960
I had a feeling
those same men were responsible.

33
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,714
I didn't dare report it to the police.

34
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,175
I was helping her stow away illegally,

35
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,344
and if they found out I was alive,

36
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,805
they would've tried to kill me again.

37
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,018
That's why I sold off my business

38
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,978
and began to live in hiding.

39
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,233
I'm sorry for earlier.

40
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,610
When I saw you standing there,

41
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,113
looking rather healthy and normal,

42
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,573
I got scared.

43
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,117
I can't believe anybody anymore,

44
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,869
not even you,

45
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,787
who were like my son.

46
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,003
FLOOR INFORMATION

47
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,213
"Wards, dermatology…"

48
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,925
It can't be the neonatal unit.

49
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,179
It's just as we expected.

50
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,223
They completely denied
that there's a patient here by her name.

51
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,768
What?

52
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,314
Perhaps we were wrong.
Maybe she's not here.

53
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,067
We should look around some more.

54
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,443
Okay.

55
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,320
What are you doing?

56
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,323
-What is it?
-Come here.

57
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,076
-What is it?
-I saw a suspicious man.

58
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,243
What's with you?

59
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,162
Darn it.

60
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,706
You're the most suspicious one here.
Hurry up and hide.

61
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,833
-I'm serious.
-Okay, just hide.

62
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,132
Get in. It's okay.

63
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,468
-So this is the first floor.
-Going up.

64
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,517
What's with you?

65
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,565
The doors are closing.

66
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,405
-Found it.
-What?

67
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,118
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,912
Goodness, Sis.

69
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,498
I found the OB-GYN department.

70
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,793
-It's on the eighth floor.
-Yes, right.

71
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,878
The eighth floor.

72
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,839
My gosh.

73
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,925
I wonder how big your baby is now.

74
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,427
-Goodness.
-I know, right?

75
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,763
I wonder how big my baby is.

76
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,142
Auntie needs to be here for you.

77
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,189
Goodness.

78
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,941
-We're here.
-Yes, we are.

79
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,318
-My niece.
-Gosh, we're here.

80
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,530
Mi-joo, are you okay?

81
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,033
-Do you want to die?
-Maybe later.

82
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,828
-Let's go.
-What's wrong with you?

83
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,955
This way. Hide.

84
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:36,956
What?

85
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,877
LEADING THE FUTURE
OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL INDUSTRY

86
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,423
Bingo.

87
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,842
That must be where Oh Ha-young is.

88
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,218
What? Oh Ha-young?

89
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,386
How do you know?

90
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,598
-Do you see that guy wearing a cap?
-Yes.

91
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,849
If he's there,

92
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,392
it means she's there too.

93
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,643
Who is he?

94
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,235
On the day I met Oh Ha-young…

95
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,487
Yes?

96
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,447
…he tried to kill me.

97
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,866
I saw his tattoo.

98
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,784
Let's go down.

99
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,080
I recognized him back there,

100
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,416
-but you stepped on me so hard.
-Sorry about that.

101
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,834
-Wait.
-What?

102
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,758
Those who are in love
don't say sorry to each other.

103
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,427
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,970
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

105
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,096
Sam-sik, my friend.

106
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,598
I'm so truly sorry.

107
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,850
Damn it.

108
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,060
Damn it.

109
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,770
-Follow me.
-I'm sorry.

110
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,981
-Hurry.
-Why?

111
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,442
Why are we here?

112
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,527
-What?
-Why?

113
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,653
It's locked?

114
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,323
Why? It's not like anyone's going to
steal from the laundry room.

115
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,367
We are here to steal something though.

116
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,493
What?

117
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,453
-Yes, you're right.
-That's right.

118
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,288
Hide.

119
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,542
-We seem even more suspicious.
-No.

120
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,336
-Wait.
-What?

121
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,887
All right.

122
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,014
-I think I can do this.
-All clear.

123
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,897
I got it.

124
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,319
My gosh, Sam-sik!

125
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,696
Welcome.

126
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,823
My babies. I'm coming.

127
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,663
What brings you here?

128
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,040
We came to check a few things.

129
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,417
Is Mr. Choi Kang-ho inside?

130
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,838
He just fell asleep.

131
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,047
This is urgent.

132
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,882
Wait, sir.

133
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,884
Sir.

134
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,553
You can talk to me.

135
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,638
You know his condition.

136
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,309
He's not in the state to remember things
to answer your questions.

137
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,937
The visit to the police station
was very disturbing for him.

138
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,023
He's been having screaming fits.

139
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,357
-Detective Cho.
-Yes, sir.

140
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,775
Wait, sir.

141
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,319
Sir!

142
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,070
Please.

143
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,822
Did Mr. Choi

144
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,574
run away?

145
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,327
If he didn't, please let go.

146
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,204
-Mr. Choi.
-Sir.

147
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,293
We're the police. May we have a word?

148
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,762
You need to stop!

149
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,182
Why do you keep coming
to harass my son who's unwell?

150
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,393
If his condition worsens
because of the shock,

151
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,020
will you take responsibility?

152
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,272
Wait.

153
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,150
Do you even have a warrant?

154
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,029
Then you can't just
barge into my house and do this!

155
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,365
It's Intrusion upon Habitation.

156
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,033
Goodness.

157
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,452
Excuse me.

158
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,793
I've warned you.

159
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,545
Don't ever come back without a warrant.

160
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,381
If you do…

161
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,093
I don't care if you're detectives.
I won't stand back.

162
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,805
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

163
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,068
You can come out now.

164
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,156
I almost suffocated.

165
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,911
I've been worried

166
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,415
you might suddenly end up losing your job.

167
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,709
I'm relieved to hear
that you're going back.

168
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,596
Thank you for all your hard work.

169
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,433
This isn't much,

170
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,394
but use it for your flight back home.

171
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,105
It's your severance pay.

172
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,651
Ms. Jin, you're wonderful.

173
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,410
Thanks to you,
I learned a lot about farming

174
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,288
and got addicted to makgeolli too.

175
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,376
Although Korean
is still freaking hard to learn.

176
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,670
Right, Ms. Jin.

177
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,965
I just learned a new word.

178
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,009
What was it?

179
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,802
In…

180
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,971
In…

181
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,725
Intrusion upon Habitation.

182
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,394
I love it to death

183
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,063
When you intrude into my heart

184
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,860
This is a huge hit.

185
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,489
It's blowing up right now.

186
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,367
What on earth is happening?

187
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,827
Tell me about it.

188
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,331
How did you come up with these lyrics?

189
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,707
"Intrusion into My Heart"?

190
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,792
You must be a genius.

191
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:18,339
We're going to the top
the Billboard charts with this song.

192
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,590
Kang-ho!

193
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,760
Thank you, Kang-ho!

194
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,554
Congratulations, Mr. Son.

195
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,599
A crime-free village commendation

196
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,184
for Jou-ri.

197
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,771
I hear you're the first village
in our area to receive it.

198
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,272
I mean, seriously.

199
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,025
I knew it
when I first heard the name Jou-ri.

200
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,736
Mr. Son, you must feel jolly.

201
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,822
Come on. This is…

202
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,033
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,661
…all because they picked
the great village head.

204
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,829
I never bothered to say it,

205
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,291
but do you have any idea
how much stress I've endured?

206
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,960
They wouldn't even pave the road

207
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,586
because there weren't
enough people in the village.

208
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,339
Because of it,
we couldn't get early morning deliveries.

209
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:04,510
And because of that,
people wouldn't move into our village.

210
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,053
-It was a--
-Goodness.

211
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,013
That's good.

212
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,183
I'm finally getting some recognition.

213
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,601
That stings.

214
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,897
-What is this, acupuncture? Be careful.
-That's an acupuncture point. You're fine.

215
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,567
Hey, honey.

216
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,152
How does the suit look?
Is the color all right?

217
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,489
Honey, come and look at me.

218
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,533
What on earth are you up to?

219
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,329
I want to make a suit for our baby too,

220
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,540
since Daddy's receiving a huge award.

221
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,463
She treats her dog
better than her husband.

222
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,591
I'm also an animal expert,

223
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,843
so I'll make a nifty suit for your dog.

224
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,263
You're an animal expert?

225
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,141
Well, just birds.

226
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,185
I used to run a fried chicken restaurant.

227
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,353
It went under.

228
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,900
That's my phone.

229
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,276
But I can't move, can I?

230
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,736
-Please be careful.
-My phone…

231
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,030
-Can you answer it?
-Sure.

232
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,656
Be careful. You'll get paralyzed.

233
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,707
You've never seen a village like this.
Is this Jou-ri or heaven?

234
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,793
This is the phone of the village head

235
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,503
of Jou-ri, a crime-free village.

236
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,298
Where?

237
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,674
The police?

238
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,092
What?

239
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,680
A mur…

240
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,390
Murder case?

241
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,144
Oh, my.

242
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,271
You didn't have to.

243
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,691
This is really good…

244
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,862
More for you, doggy.

245
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,907
Gross. He can't have what a human touched.

246
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,537
Sir.

247
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,832
We came to check a few things with you.

248
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,168
You know Mr. Choi Kang-ho, right?

249
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,713
Yes, of course, I know him well.

250
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,340
He's like a son to me.

251
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,385
This is Mr. Choi

252
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,638
during his police investigation
at our station.

253
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,268
And this is him

254
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:22,106
when he was at the hospital
with his mother, Ms. Jin Young-soon.

255
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,234
I checked with the hospital

256
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:29,863
and heard he met the doctor himself
as his mother's guardian

257
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,907
to discuss her condition.

258
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,414
And these documents
were also filled out by him.

259
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,625
What do you think?

260
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,212
There's too much of a difference
to say these are the same person, right?

261
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:49,216
In your opinion,
which man is the true Mr. Choi?

262
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,342
The one at the police station,

263
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,386
or the hospital?

264
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,805
Police station?

265
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,223
Or hospital?

266
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,477
Come on.

267
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,439
You must be able to tell
if he's like a son to you.

268
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,858
Goodness, a son?

269
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,485
I never said that.

270
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,695
The sun.

271
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,530
He's like the sun.

272
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,866
He's always around his mother,

273
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,659
refusing to leave her side.

274
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,910
So we all said,

275
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:21,498
"He's like the sun that's always there."

276
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,381
Hey, Sung-ae. Are you there?

277
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,383
-You're here.
-Hello.

278
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,470
Where's our minivan?

279
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,805
Where's Sam-sik? Have you seen him?

280
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,765
No.

281
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,018
Sam-sik pulled a Sam-sik again.

282
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,480
Hey, don't pile on like that.

283
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,273
Have you had dinner?

284
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,233
-If not, you should eat.
-What?

285
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,321
My gosh, what's all this?

286
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,865
Skate, braised short ribs,
sweet and sour pork,

287
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,158
and stir-fried glass noodles too?

288
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,744
Is it a special day?

289
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,496
It's nothing like that.

290
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,998
I just made them
because the kids enjoy them.

291
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,416
Eat up.

292
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,834
Don't worry about the kids.

293
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,960
Just play your hand.

294
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,170
-Yes.
-It's my turn?

295
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,630
-Yes.
-Let's see.

296
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,798
Then…

297
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:14,885
This one.

298
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,970
Goodness me.

299
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,516
How many times do I have to tell you
that these are different suits?

300
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,226
This one is all black

301
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,311
but this one is mixed with red dots.

302
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,771
Good grief.

303
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,981
In that case,

304
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,400
-what should I play?
-Come on!

305
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,902
Goodness gracious.

306
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,738
You can't show me your entire hand!

307
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,739
Wait.

308
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,700
You only got three cards.
I went first, so you should have four.

309
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,619
-Really?
-What?

310
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,704
-Goodness. What?
-Where did it go?

311
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,414
-We're done with this round.
-Wait.

312
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,500
-Did you pick up an extra card?
-We're done?

313
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,211
-Wait.
-I almost lost big. What a relief!

314
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,131
I was so close to winning the game,

315
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,757
-but you ruined it!
-Put it down.

316
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,634
-I had it in my hand.
-Put that down.

317
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,219
This is awful.

318
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,138
Goodness, are you two in this together?

319
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,347
Darn it!

320
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,765
Don't worry.

321
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,018
We'll play all night
and you can win all this from me.

322
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,979
All night?

323
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,482
You never play Go-Stop.
What's gotten into you?

324
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,525
Tell me about it.

325
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,236
You've been acting odd since last night.

326
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,363
Not only did you sing and dance,

327
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,032
you even had a drink.

328
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,786
When someone acts out of the ordinary,
it means they'll die soon.

329
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,455
Sung-ae!

330
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,166
You startled me.

331
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,209
Why are you yelling?

332
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,252
Please!

333
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,381
You need to stop blurting out words
without thinking.

334
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,217
Come on. Don't be like that.

335
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,052
What the hell did I do?

336
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,054
I was just making a joke

337
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,932
to have a laugh.

338
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,017
To have a laugh?

339
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,977
Is life and death funny to you?

340
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,395
Is it?

341
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,149
There are things
you should and shouldn't say.

342
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,652
How dare you
say something like that to her?

343
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,237
"How dare you"?

344
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,406
Darn it.

345
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,993
That's how you've thought of me all along?

346
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,828
So you're saying

347
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,247
a mother of a thief like me

348
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,709
shouldn't dare to speak that way

349
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,587
to a mother of a prosecutor?

350
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,880
Tell me!

351
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,381
Is that what you're saying?

352
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,468
-You must be drunk. Stop it.
-Don't! I'm not drunk!

353
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,678
What do you know anyway?

354
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,474
A mother like you with a smart son
has no idea what it's like!

355
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,935
Kang-ho got all the attention

356
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,187
for being smart and getting good grades.

357
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,357
And now he's getting all the attention

358
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,943
because he's become an idiot.

359
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,613
Hey, do you even know

360
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,659
how much derision I suffered

361
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,745
because people compared your son to mine?

362
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,163
Have you gone insane?

363
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,706
What's wrong with you?

364
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,959
-Come here! Let's go home.
-Darn it. Let go!

365
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,378
I'll walk out on my own!

366
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,338
-Let's go! Cut it out!
-Let go of me!

367
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,924
-I don't care if he's a prosecutor.
-That's enough!

368
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,969
-You can't do this to me.
-Stop it!

369
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,804
-Darn it.
-That's enough!

370
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,681
Good grief!

371
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,017
Good grief!

372
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,436
-I can't deal with this!
-Where are you going?

373
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,938
Good grief!

374
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,233
Goodness.

375
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,277
No, it's all right.

376
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,071
Goodness, it's all right. Don't cry.

377
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,073
My babies, don't cry.

378
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,617
Why are you acting so childish?

379
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,618
-Goodness me.
-Sung-ae.

380
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,578
I need to talk to you.

381
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,957
Hear me out!

382
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,502
Forget it, you brat.

383
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,462
You're out of my life for good,

384
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,466
so just have fun
humoring Young-soon all the time

385
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,094
-and have a great life!
-Enough.

386
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,304
Goodbye.

387
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,763
Young-soon

388
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,473
is dying.

389
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,229
She has stage four stomach cancer.

390
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,566
No surgery or medicine

391
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,734
can make her better.

392
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,408
That brat must've gone crazy.

393
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,160
What kind of nonsense is that?

394
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,204
I honestly wish I was just insane.

395
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,541
I really want this to be nonsense.

396
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,668
How can this…

397
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,546
How can… What will she…

398
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,515
Jin Young-soon!

399
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,018
Come out!

400
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,453
Sung-ae.

401
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,130
You.

402
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,258
How could you do this to me?

403
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,428
How could you do this to me
to the very end?

404
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,388
You turned me into this crazy woman.

405
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,976
You can't go anywhere.

406
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,064
Stop this nonsense!

407
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,274
I won't accept this.

408
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,112
There is no terminal illness
in this day and age.

409
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,656
There's no illness that's incurable!

410
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,825
So,

411
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,911
go get yourself treated right now!

412
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,332
You can't go anywhere.

413
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,960
You need to stay by my side

414
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:43,130
and fight with me for the rest of my life.

415
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,548
You brat.

416
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,341
Go get treated now.

417
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,261
Go get treated, you brat.

418
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,179
Good grief!

419
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,059
I hate you.

420
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,228
You damned brat.

421
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,065
You need to live to see Sam-sik succeed.

422
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,901
You must live to envy me

423
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,530
and be mean to me out of jealousy.

424
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:13,160
You must live
to throw a fit at me, you brat.

425
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,287
Sung-ae,

426
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,498
I always envied you.

427
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:25,630
You have a wonderful husband
by your side that loves you

428
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,384
and a son who's healthy and amiable.

429
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,055
I was always jealous.

430
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,850
Goodness, what are we going to do?

431
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,061
You poor brat.

432
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,191
What do we do with you?

433
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,484
You poor thing…

434
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,990
-Thank you.
-I had a good trip thanks to you.

435
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,074
And this.

436
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,327
This is fresh abalone.

437
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,370
Please have it with your mother.

438
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,663
Goodness, abalone?

439
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,499
They're her favorite. Thank you.

440
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,502
I'll see you soon.

441
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,629
Okay, sir.

442
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,840
Let me know whenever you need my help.

443
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:09,799
I will.

444
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,525
-Investigation Officer.
-Yes?

445
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,489
This phone belonged to Park Cheol-su.

446
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:36,534
He was the defendant in the Woobyeok
construction site case two years ago.

447
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,079
Can you run a digital forensic on this?

448
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:43,667
But he abandoned the appeal,
and the case has been closed.

449
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,584
I know.

450
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:50,423
But there's new evidence,
so we must uncover the truth, even now.

451
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,010
Anything that would
help take down Woobyeok Group would do,

452
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,095
so please take a look.

453
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,681
Are you really

454
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,641
going to take down Woobyeok?

455
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,102
Well…

456
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,105
The higher-ups colluded

457
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,650
to destroy all the evidence,

458
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,403
-so it won't be easy.
-It's not that.

459
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,779
To be honest,

460
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,743
I'm not sure if you're
Woobyeok's enemy or ally.

461
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,956
Mr. Park Cheol-su's wife visited me
and told me about this phone.

462
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,042
She made a scene saying
you destroyed the only evidence

463
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,003
and then got dragged out.

464
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,172
The same goes for Yoon Jae-min's case.

465
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,342
Last time, your mother came
and got into a huge fight

466
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,804
with Jung Jong-gu's mother
who was protesting.

467
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:38,888
That day

468
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,268
was the first time
I felt like quitting my job.

469
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,437
Your mother

470
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,441
yelled at her saying that her son
wouldn't have done something so terrible,

471
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:53,194
but I couldn't side with her.

472
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,827
I've stood by your side
and assisted you for the longest time.

473
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,162
But to be honest,

474
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,748
I'm not sure what you're really like.

475
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,219
Thank you

476
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,389
for not quitting your job.

477
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,141
Sorry?

478
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,561
I finally have a chance to show you
what I'm really like.

479
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,731
I can't guarantee…

480
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,525
that I'll succeed.

481
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,654
But for the longest time,

482
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,116
you've worked tirelessly to support me,

483
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,119
so I'll make sure
you won't regret your efforts.

484
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,462
Can you really

485
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,215
keep that promise?

486
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,595
Then I'll do it.

487
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,599
We have to do that to Choi Kang-ho?

488
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,559
I always wondered

489
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:11,022
why Oh Tae-soo
was so desperate to kill Kang-ho.

490
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,192
And it turns out, it wasn't Kang-ho
who killed Hwang Soo-hyun.

491
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,028
I knew it.

492
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,614
Kang-ho isn't the type of guy

493
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,367
to let go once he's onto something.

494
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,410
However,

495
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,662
Oh Tae-soo got wind of it

496
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,455
and acted first.

497
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,416
He killed

498
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,376
Hwang Soo-hyun and the baby,

499
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,256
then framed Choi Kang-ho as the father

500
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,427
and the prime suspect in the murder.

501
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,053
So,

502
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:46,307
what if the baby's body is found

503
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,643
or Choi Kang-ho regains his memories?

504
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,020
What will happen then?

505
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,815
Now, before any of that happens,

506
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,527
we'd have to get rid of him, right?

507
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,325
How long do we have to stay like this?

508
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,121
Why isn't that punk leaving?

509
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,627
This won't do.

510
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,255
The hospital will close
before that punk leaves.

511
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,466
-Let's begin.
-Sam-sik.

512
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,676
Wait.

513
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,178
Why don't you do it instead?

514
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,679
This is killing me.

515
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,223
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

516
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,309
What do you think Oh Ha-young will do
when she sees me?

517
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,311
This may be killing you

518
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,313
but I'll really be dead if she catches me.

519
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,484
Okay, give me a second.

520
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,198
Look at me. Wear this and the mask.

521
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,616
Gosh, you look so smart.

522
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,451
You look very clever.

523
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,745
You can do this. You got it, Mi-joo!

524
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,538
No, I can't!

525
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,000
I really can't do this. Sam-sik, please.

526
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,502
I don't have a choice then.

527
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,047
-I must help you.
-How?

528
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,048
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

529
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,607
What is it?

530
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,651
I'm here to see the patient.

531
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,110
A doctor was just here.

532
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,030
The doctor who just came by called.

533
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,449
The patient has
a severely unstable state of mind,

534
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,992
so she requires counseling.

535
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,036
I'll go back if she doesn't need me.

536
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,162
Wait.

537
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,630
"Joo Gwang-cheol"?

538
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,218
Such a masculine name, right?

539
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,513
My parents gave me this name
hoping to have a son next.

540
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,599
Aren't we all sick and tired
of this preference for boys?

541
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,395
The counseling will take some time.

542
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,914
Ms. Oh Ha-young?

543
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,666
Get out.

544
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,837
May I have a word with you?

545
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,213
Get out of here.

546
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,882
Yes, exactly.

547
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,550
Let's get out of here together.

548
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,603
You know Choi Kang-ho, right?

549
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,193
If you scream now,

550
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,446
you'll never get out of this room.

551
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,328
Do you remember
what you asked of me a while ago?

552
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,039
I'll find the evidence.

553
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,124
So until then,

554
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,460
you must stay alive in here.

555
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,798
Find out the license plate number
of the car

556
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,717
and recover the dashcam footage
no matter what.

557
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,262
I have that footage.

558
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,239
You should cut your nails once you're out.

559
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,500
I got this only a month ago.

560
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,464
Who are you?

561
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,051
Why are you doing this?

562
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,594
What about you?

563
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,931
Why did you do that to Kang-ho?

564
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,432
What did I do?

565
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,810
Aren't you the least bit sorry?

566
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,312
He was once

567
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,606
someone you loved, wasn't he?

568
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,025
He betrayed me first.

569
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,945
He betrayed me before he betrayed you.

570
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,239
But I didn't try to kill him.

571
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,992
Let's get out.

572
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,535
You must confess everything.

573
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,619
No!

574
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,788
Why not?

575
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,540
Because of your dad?

576
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,419
He's capable of killing his own child.

577
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,170
He already did.

578
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,091
He killed your sibling, a newborn baby.

579
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,176
And what about you?

580
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,345
Look what he's done to you.

581
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,973
Do you think this is living?

582
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,269
He put you up to killing a man

583
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,604
and locked you up in here
as a mental patient.

584
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,066
Even beasts wouldn't do that to their own.

585
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,901
And now,

586
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,447
he wants to be a president of a country?

587
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,366
No, I can't condone it.

588
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,036
If you don't do it, I'll stop him.

589
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,249
Then he'll kill you too.

590
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,584
I'm sure.

591
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,796
He's a man who would destroy
anything that gets in his way.

592
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,965
Just recently,

593
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,634
he tried to kill Kang-ho again.

594
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,638
As if killing his father wasn't enough,

595
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,515
this time, he locked him up
with his mother in the farm

596
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,975
and set it on fire.

597
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,438
This is

598
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,067
your last chance at redemption.

599
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,193
At this rate,

600
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,404
Kang-ho may really die.

601
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:37,033
If you ignore it,
you'll become an accomplice again.

602
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,242
But of course,

603
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,244
you won't go to jail.

604
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,370
Because…

605
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,957
the moment something happens to Kang-ho,

606
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,460
you'll die at my hands.

607
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,971
Let's say I do get out of here.

608
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,434
Then what?

609
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,894
Report my dad to the police?

610
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,231
His influence runs deep.

611
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,234
That includes the police
and the prosecution.

612
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,944
Everywhere,

613
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,112
but one.

614
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,239
Choi Kang-ho.

615
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,828
It's been over an hour.

616
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,539
-Move aside!
-What?

617
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,207
She's in hypovolemic shock!

618
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,416
Hype what?

619
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,751
Hypovolemic shock!

620
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,128
It's an emergency!

621
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,171
-Wait! Just one call!
-It's an emergency!

622
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,381
Sam-sik!

623
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,258
-Mi-joo!
-Sam-sik! Come on!

624
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,886
-Sam-sik, let's go!
-Let's go.

625
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,513
-Are you okay?
-It's an emergency!

626
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,556
Get them!

627
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,016
-Goodness.
-They're coming!

628
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,309
Wait!

629
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,186
Come on.

630
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,481
No!

631
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,067
My goodness!

632
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,068
Sam-sik, hurry!

633
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:57,947
Wait, you're that…

634
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,990
Damn it.

635
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,951
Wait for me!

636
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,703
-Hurry!
-Come on!

637
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,872
Close the doors!

638
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,249
-Close the doors!
-Go away!

639
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,967
Take the stairs.

640
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,222
Run!

641
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,725
Mi-joo!

642
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,685
Kang-ho, catch!

643
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,939
Mi-joo!

644
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,901
How could you do something so dangerous?
You're in for it now!

645
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,404
-Goodness.
-Go!

646
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,617
-Get in.
-Okay. Oh Ha-young too!

647
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,410
-Get in the back!
-Hurry!

648
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,954
Wait, I'm not insured with this car.

649
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,123
-Are we good?
-Go!

650
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,333
Hurry!

651
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,674
Are you all insane?

652
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,843
-Mi-joo, you.
-No.

653
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,096
We were perfect. Everyone was great.

654
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,890
It was excellent.

655
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:11,771
Our plan was more perfect than General
MacArthur's Incheon Landing Operation.

656
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:16,943
They may not have seen our faces,
but they probably got the plate number.

657
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,403
Come on. Who am I?

658
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,447
I'm Bang Sam-sik.

659
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,033
I disguised it beforehand.

660
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,827
Even ghosts wouldn't know who we are.

661
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,538
SAM-SIK'S MILL

662
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,708
What now? Even ghosts wouldn't know?

663
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,126
-Let go of me.
-That's enough, Mi-joo.

664
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,253
What's wrong?

665
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,462
Is something going on?

666
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,173
It'll be too dangerous
to return to the village.

667
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,383
Let's find a different place.

668
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,094
Can't we just report this to the police?

669
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,387
-No.
-No.

670
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,888
We abducted her.

671
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,306
Who are we going to report?

672
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,350
We didn't abduct anyone.

673
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,227
We rescued her.

674
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,770
Who would believe that?

675
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,021
Would you?

676
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,399
Man, what's with my life?

677
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:57,942
I'm a thief,

678
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,569
a blackmailer, and now an abductor?

679
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,738
Darn it.

680
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,158
What did I get myself into
while trying to help a friend?

681
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,243
Wait.

682
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,954
Friend?

683
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,292
Who's my friend?

684
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,003
Come to think of it, this is absurd.

685
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,423
Why in the world
am I helping you, Kang-ho?

686
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,801
I begged you to help me,

687
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,346
but you didn't even flinch
and locked me up in prison.

688
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,641
You're nitpicking over that now?

689
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,269
-It's okay.
-I didn't have an opportunity before.

690
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,272
He's only just regained his senses!

691
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,356
All right.

692
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,274
First off,

693
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:42,153
Ha-young participated in the escape,
so this isn't abduction.

694
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,698
The security cameras would've caught it,
so they can't report us.

695
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,617
But we also can't report them.

696
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:53,331
We can't let anybody find out
until we're thoroughly prepared.

697
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,874
Okay, Mi-joo?

698
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,586
A place where nobody can find us.

699
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:02,548
Man, I do know this very secretive place.

700
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,762
Where are we?

701
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,847
A place that isn't open to just anybody.

702
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,850
However, it's also a place
that's hard to leave.

703
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,228
If we go inside, I can't guarantee
that we'll make it out alive.

704
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,355
DO NOT ENTER

705
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,106
-He's coming out!
-What?

706
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,317
Hey! Goodness.

707
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,818
Good grief.

708
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,780
-What?
-What are they doing?

709
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,074
Why are they so scary?

710
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,701
Kang-ho, listen carefully.

711
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,788
I'm risking my life bringing you here.

712
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,165
Because we're friends.

713
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,708
Hey, where are you going?

714
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,461
You crazy punk! Where are you going?

715
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,387
Mom, mom, come here

716
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,890
And look at this

717
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,184
Look at this.

718
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,895
You've been ignoring my calls.

719
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:02,900
I never imagined you would

720
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,862
Show up on your own

721
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,823
So?

722
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,951
Did you bring what you promised?

723
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,330
It's not ready yet.

724
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,332
Instead,

725
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,751
I brought my best friend.

726
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,466
Your friend?

727
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,265
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,476
Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

729
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,274
-Please sit.
-Sir, this way.

730
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,276
May my officers sit too?

731
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,862
Of course. Come this way.

732
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:48,946
-Please.
-Sure.

733
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,327
You've illegally purchased,

734
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,955
renovated, and sailed a ship,

735
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,166
and even operated a gambling house.

736
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,960
Also, you failed to pay your employees,

737
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,129
blackmailed, confined,
resorted to violence,

738
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,256
and made
an illegal organ trading contract.

739
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:13,095
It seems that your business
should be discussed with me, a prosecutor.

740
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,348
But apparently, you have business
with my dear friend, Sam-sik.

741
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,643
No, sir. I have no idea
what you're saying.

742
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,854
Sam-sik, do I have

743
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,315
any business with you?

744
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,650
You wanted 100 million won from me.

745
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,486
Gosh.

746
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,821
Did you really take it that way?

747
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,033
There must be a misunderstanding.

748
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,495
Sam-sik and I were very close

749
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,038
since our schooldays.

750
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,414
We weren't.

751
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,794
Sam-sik and I attended the same school.

752
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,671
Not that school.

753
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,549
Prosecutor Choi,
you already know what I mean.

754
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,219
I closed the gambling house ages ago,

755
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,304
and look at my staff.

756
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:58,307
They don't look like they'd blackmail,
confine, or hurt anyone.

757
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,768
Come on, smile.

758
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,103
Aren't they cute?

759
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,941
Something like that
has never happened around here.

760
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,193
I see.

761
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,988
But I heard this hotel
was a private gambling den

762
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,448
open for members only.

763
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,284
Goodness, that's absurd.

764
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,329
This is simply my home.

765
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,790
My house of joy. Home sweet home.

766
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,295
In that case,

767
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,550
may my officers stay here for a few days

768
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,759
and investigate?

769
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,261
Sorry?

770
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,389
Of course.

771
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,558
Of course, this is just my home.

772
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,476
You can just live here.

773
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,646
If anything happens to my officers

774
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:50,150
or to my dear friend Sam-sik…

775
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,237
It'll be my fault, obviously.

776
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,823
I'll make sure they don't get hurt.

777
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,909
Goodness.

778
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,452
Look at that mess.

779
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,706
Once they burn all those shady ledgers,

780
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,583
they'll be wetting their beds tonight.

781
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,586
What's that?

782
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,677
What?

783
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,764
Fireworks?

784
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,601
My gosh, that's pretty.

785
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,853
-Did you prepare this?
-How did you know?

786
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,691
My gosh.

787
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:36,989
Aren't you cold?

788
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,367
I am. It's a bit chilly by the sea.

789
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,162
I told you to stay inside.

790
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,539
Why did you come out?

791
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,834
I figured the two of them

792
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,669
needed some time alone.

793
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:01,972
How pretty.

794
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,853
I know it wasn't an easy decision.

795
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,689
Thank you.

796
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,610
I'm not doing this for you. It's for me.

797
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,072
My life will be a living hell
if I don't do this.

798
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,866
And I'm the cause of that hell.

799
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,373
You were innocent,
but I dragged you into this.

800
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,792
I hurt you deeply.

801
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,169
I'm sorry.

802
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,214
Did you…

803
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,549
ever love me?

804
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,760
I was in love

805
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,553
with someone else.

806
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,267
I thought so.

807
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,437
You always seemed to yearn for someone.

808
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,065
I hated that

809
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,609
and it made me jealous.

810
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,823
That must be why I fell
for my dad's lie when he said

811
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,450
Hwang Soo-hyun was your woman.

812
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,704
The person you love…

813
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,041
is Lee Mi-joo, right?

814
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:14,878
Yes.

815
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,381
It's Lee Mi-joo.

816
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,183
What's taking you so long
to pick up your jacket?

817
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,066
I'm sure they're after us.

818
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,777
So don't leave the hotel, okay?

819
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,195
Where are you going?

820
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,489
I found Ha-young thanks to you two.

821
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,117
I need to find evidence on Song Woo-byeok.

822
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,493
Song Woo-byeok?

823
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,537
How are you going to find that?

824
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,581
I thought the evidence you had
were all destroyed.

825
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,127
There's one last evidence left.

826
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,504
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

827
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,548
It's not dangerous, is it?

828
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,134
I'm going there
to make sure there's no further danger.

829
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,348
My dear friend, Bang Sam-sik.

830
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,477
Please keep them safe.

831
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,729
I'll be back.

832
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,355
Okay.

833
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,994
Hey, Mi-joo!

834
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,302
I told you, didn't I?

835
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,930
That if you saved my life once again,

836
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,932
I'd let you marry me.

837
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,726
You saved me from choking on candy

838
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,811
and from the motorcycle accident.

839
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,147
Do you know
the last thing you did to save me?

840
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,066
Our children.

841
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,944
You weren't by our side,

842
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,489
but I was always with you.

843
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,830
So make sure you come back.

844
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,835
Come back and live with us
for the rest of your life, okay?

845
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,260
Thanks, Mi-joo.

846
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,721
I'll make sure I do that.

847
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,690
I'll be back.

848
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,026
Hey.

849
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,988
A little lower and my lips are right here.

850
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,447
Was it too far down?

851
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,491
Was it too far for you to reach down?

852
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,535
Was it?

853
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,821
Goodness.

854
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,116
You always came over with a stomachache,

855
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,827
but it never dawned on me
that you had to see a doctor.

856
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,954
I shouldn't be the village head.

857
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,998
How is that your fault?

858
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,044
You told me to see a doctor
time and time again,

859
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,754
but I never listened.

860
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:47,215
You had to suffer all alone.

861
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,428
We spent our time in this village
like a family.

862
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,263
Why didn't you tell me?

863
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,349
How could you let me hear this

864
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,435
from a detective
who's a complete stranger?

865
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,728
Detective?

866
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,355
Yes.

867
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,691
Some detectives came in the afternoon
and asked me about Kang-ho,

868
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,194
regarding a murder case.

869
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,656
No, it wasn't Kang-ho.

870
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,992
Goodness, of course, it wasn't.

871
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,744
Young-soon.

872
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,622
I know it's hard for you,

873
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,416
but I need to know what's going on
to help you.

874
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,379
So tell me everything.

875
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:29,508
What on earth is happening to Kang-ho?

876
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,347
Please stop crying.

877
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,725
You'll break Young-soon's heart even more.

878
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,312
Goodness.

879
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,399
Sung-ae, please stop crying.

880
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,608
Goodness.

881
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:51,697
By the way, why do you have
those spoons on your eyes?

882
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,408
I can't open my eyes from crying so much.

883
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,869
Why is everyone crying?

884
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:03,458
Everyone is crying,
so it's making me cry too.

885
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,588
Goodness.

886
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,756
Goodness.

887
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,967
Not you kids as well.

888
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,552
Don't cry.

889
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,762
Goodness, don't cry, my babies.

890
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,389
Don't cry.

891
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,640
Your mom.

892
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,475
Let's call your mom.

893
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,983
Mi-joo, it's me.

894
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,776
Can you pick up the kids

895
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,820
from Kang-ho's place on your way home?

896
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,490
Mom, I was actually going to call you.

897
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,909
I won't be home tonight.

898
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,662
I actually won't be home for a few days.

899
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,331
What do you mean?

900
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,126
Where are you? Why can't you come home?

901
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,296
Well, my friend's father passed,

902
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,589
so I'm at a wake.

903
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,215
Mi-joo, the food is here. Come.

904
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,468
Wait.

905
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,677
That voice.

906
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,679
Isn't that Sam-sik?

907
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,347
Are you with him?

908
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,851
Yes, she's a mutual acquaintance.

909
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,021
Your jjajangmyeon is getting soggy. Come.

910
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,647
-Jjajangmyeon?
-Hurry.

911
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,733
So you eat jjajangmyeon at a wake?

912
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,651
You brat. Where are you?

913
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,986
Mom, the thing is…

914
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,989
What are you doing with Sam-sik
that you can't come home?

915
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,115
Have you

916
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,034
moved on from Kang-ho
to Sam-sik, of all people?

917
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,536
It's nothing like that.

918
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,206
Anyway, I can't tell you now.

919
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,791
What do you mean?

920
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,417
Why can't you tell me?

921
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,460
Wait.

922
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:30,796
Mi-joo.

923
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,964
Something is going on, right?

924
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,300
I heard Sam-sik took his parents' minivan.

925
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,553
Are you in trouble right now?

926
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,180
Tell me if that's the case.

927
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,556
I'll call the police right away.

928
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,933
No, Mom. Don't.

929
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,851
-Not the police.
-Not the police?

930
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,562
Goodness, so something
is going on with you.

931
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,898
Sam-sik, that punk. That son of a gun!

932
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,942
Mom, please. Calm down.

933
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,944
How can I calm down right now?

934
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,904
How? I'm hanging up.

935
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,156
-I have to call the police--
-Mom, please!

936
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,830
The thing is,

937
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,540
it's not about me.

938
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,459
It's Kang-ho.

939
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,920
What? Who?

940
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,839
Kang-ho?

941
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:14,840
Yes.

942
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,592
So I have to help him for a few days.

943
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,637
But he's in the hospital.

944
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,888
Are you staying out

945
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,558
to look after him?

946
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,227
I will explain everything later.

947
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,728
You brat!

948
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,314
You cursed brat.
You're still out of your senses.

949
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,024
I know

950
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,652
you tried to run into the farm

951
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,113
to save Kang-ho when it was on fire.

952
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,825
You gave everything you had
to support him through everything,

953
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,618
yet he abandoned you.

954
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,788
So why are you still hung up on him
and looking after him?

955
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,082
Why do you keep acting like an idiot?

956
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,001
Because I take after you.

957
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,253
What?

958
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,380
You lived like that.

959
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,509
Dad always put you through so much,

960
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,680
but you only loved him and waited for him.

961
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:07,642
You know better than anyone
how painful that is.

962
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,187
That's why you're angry at me. Right?

963
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,440
But Mom,

964
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,361
you can also understand me
better than anyone right now.

965
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,574
You know I'll never get over Kang-ho,

966
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,785
that I'll never leave him,

967
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,247
and that in the end,

968
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,541
I'll go back to him.

969
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,835
You know, right?

970
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,671
You're…

971
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,090
my mom,

972
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,134
so you know that.

973
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,263
Thank you.

974
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,810
I've always wanted to tell you that.

975
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,230
You never abandoned Dad…

976
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,609
even though you went through so much.

977
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,320
That you let me…

978
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,867
have a dad.

979
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,915
I also want to be a mother like you
to Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

980
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,543
So help me do that, Mom.

981
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,717
You awful brat.

982
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:27,597
Why the hell do you want to
live your life like me?

983
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,641
Fine, you brat!

984
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:34,270
It's your darned life,
so do whatever the hell you want.

985
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:38,108
But don't you dare
come back to me crying with regret, okay?

986
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,859
Mom.

987
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,486
I'm hanging up!

988
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,241
I can't believe her.

989
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,454
How could she use that against me?

990
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,125
It's all…

991
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,796
your fault, Lee Choon-gil!

992
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,298
If Mi-joo becomes unhappy,

993
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,884
I'll seriously kill you.

994
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,678
Wait.

995
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,097
You're already dead.

996
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,142
Who is it?

997
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,476
Who's there?

998
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,232
Young-soon.

999
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,403
My gosh, Young-soon.

1000
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,947
Goodness, poor Young-soon.

1001
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:33,705
It sounds like Choi Kang-ho
is with Lee Mi-joo and Bang Sam-sik.

1002
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,957
What now?

1003
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,753
Over there.

1004
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:41,880
Get that license plate.

1005
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,806
-Three, eight--
-Three, eight, three, five.

1006
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,435
It followed us from Seoul.

1007
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:57,479
Who?

1008
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,315
Us? Why?

1009
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,025
Let's find out.

1010
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,308
Go slowly so they don't notice.

1011
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,520
Okay.

1012
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,502
FAIRY BREWERY, FAIRY REAL ESTATE,
FAIRY FORTUNE TELLING

1013
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,223
Find them.

1014
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,575
I see a few familiar faces.

1015
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,326
Chairman Song must've sent you here.

1016
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,744
Why?

1017
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,038
Did he tell you to get rid of us
after we kill Kang-ho?

1018
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,498
Of course.

1019
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,210
We do know a little too much about
Chairman Song.

1020
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,170
What?

1021
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,714
I'm only an assistant,
so I don't know that much.

1022
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:53,303
But you did learn
how to dig and bury things

1023
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,888
while cultivating that lettuce field.

1024
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,266
Which one should I bury first?

1025
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,065
-Nice!
-What are you doing? Get in!

1026
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,861
Okay!

1027
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,005
-Let go!
-You punks!

1028
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,548
-My goodness!
-Hey!

1029
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,634
-Who are you thieves?
-You're all dead!

1030
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,093
And we know one more thing!

1031
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,970
What Mr. Yang trusts more than his deity

1032
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,598
is an anti-theft system.

1033
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,016
-Come quickly!
-Faster!

1034
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,100
These thieves.

1035
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,685
-Round them up!
-You punks!

1036
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,187
-Goodness.
-My goodness.

1037
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,022
Gosh, this could've gone badly.

1038
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,107
-How dare you break in?
-Get them away!

1039
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,026
-Take them!
-Round them up!

1040
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,653
-Darn you.
-Hurry up.

1041
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,027
-Hey, Kang-ho.
-Is everything all right?

1042
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:38,908
I have way too many bodyguards
for anything to happen.

1043
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,036
They're like the Avengers.

1044
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,959
What about you?

1045
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,461
Is everything going well?

1046
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,213
This is only the beginning.

1047
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:57,260
I'M TRAVELING THROUGH A STAR CALLED SEA

1048
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,435
Presidential candidate Oh Tae-Soo
of the Jeilmirae Party

1049
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,729
visited an aquarium in Ilsung-dong, Seoul,

1050
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,648
to commemorate
the second Marine Life Month today,

1051
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,359
and began his campaign
for the welfare of the people.

1052
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,697
Hello, I'm Oh Tae-soo.

1053
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,117
Hello, children.

1054
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,120
-Hello!
-Hello!

1055
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,413
Were you looking at the fish?

1056
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,373
-Yes!
-Yes!

1057
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,877
"Daddy Fish isn't lonely."

1058
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,756
"Because his babies are asleep

1059
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,467
in little circular eggs."

1060
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,845
"'Daddy will dance for you every day

1061
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:43,306
until you hatch from your eggs.'"

1062
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,683
"And then…"

1063
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,643
"Crack."

1064
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,354
Remember what I told you earlier.

1065
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,689
-"Crack, crack, crack."
-You will, right?

1066
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,651
Well done.

1067
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:58,321
"His babies finally began to hatch."

1068
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:02,742
"'Hello, my babies.
It's great to see you.'"

1069
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:06,829
"The babies began to kiss Daddy Fish."

1070
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,289
"'I love you.'"

1071
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,209
"The happy Daddy Fish

1072
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:14,545
danced his last dance and slowly let out

1073
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,172
his last breath."

1074
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,549
Song Min-ho.

1075
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,718
President Oh Tae-soo, let's go!

1076
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,303
-Go!
-Thank you.

1077
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,390
Goodness, don't say that.

1078
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,308
I'm not the president yet.

1079
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,603
But now that I've heard your support,

1080
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,522
I'm starting to get ambitious.

1081
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,190
-You'll make it!
-You will!

1082
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,484
Thank you for your support.

1083
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,572
The children's book you read
was very touching!

1084
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,909
Yes, I was also moved by the story.

1085
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,786
I'll be a politician

1086
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,872
who's just like a stickleback,
showing love to our people

1087
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,500
and making sacrifices
for the sake of our citizens!

1088
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,712
Thank you. Thank you for your support.

1089
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,922
Please shake my son's hand.

1090
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,258
Gosh, you're so adorable.

1091
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,720
Goodness, I don't have a son myself,

1092
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,054
so I'm jealous.

1093
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,223
-What's his name?
-Tae-yul.

1094
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,809
Tae-yul, thank you for coming today.

1095
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:14,439
It's great to meet you.

1096
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,441
Thank you. Nice to meet you too.

1097
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,608
Thank you.

1098
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:23,072
Goodness.

1099
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,866
-That's all for today.
-That'll be all.

1100
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,587
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1101
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,608
Oh Ha-young.

1102
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,443
She's with me right now.

1103
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,446
I only have one goal.
It's to catch Chairman Song.

1104
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,822
By the way, why are you here alone?

1105
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,616
It'll be difficult
to obtain an arrest warrant

1106
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,409
for Chairman Song's past crimes.

1107
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,870
Honey, are you watching from above?

1108
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,830
Keep me here for a little longer.

1109
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:17,251
This was the very first ring
your father-in-law got me.

1110
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,754
I'm truly blessed

1111
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:25,510
for being able to live this precious life.

1112
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,179
Our son will carry out the judgment

1113
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,932
that we failed to do.

1114
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:37,230
