1
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,979
Mom, no.

3
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,355
No, Mom.

4
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,857
Mom…

5
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,817
No, Mom.

6
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,865
Kang-ho…

7
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,866
Kang-ho.

8
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,160
Kang-ho, you're…

9
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,496
You're…

10
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,633
Kang-ho…

11
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,347
You just

12
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,225
stood up, right?

13
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,980
Honey…

14
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,525
Our son… Thank you.

15
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,568
Thank you.

16
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,654
Thank you.

17
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,034
Kang-ho, do it again.

18
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,830
Stand up again.

19
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,466
Kang-ho, that was…

20
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,220
Kang-ho.

21
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,806
Kang-ho.

22
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,350
Kang-ho.

23
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,018
Kang-ho!

24
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:26,938
Kang-ho.

25
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,775
Kang-ho!

26
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,735
Kang-ho!

27
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,029
Kang-ho!

28
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,865
Kang-ho!

29
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,406
EPISODE 8

30
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,579
Let me see your fingernail.

31
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,386
I fixed it for now

32
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,222
but it could chip again.

33
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,015
Here.

34
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,685
I'll mark it with this nail polish,

35
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,480
so be careful with this fingernail, okay?

36
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,153
My mom abandoned me.

37
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,700
She took me to an unfamiliar place

38
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,287
and left without me to go somewhere nice.

39
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,998
Your mom

40
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,209
would never abandon you.

41
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,878
However,

42
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,005
if she really

43
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,883
did such a thing,

44
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,762
I'm sure she had a reason.

45
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,847
A reason?

46
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,266
Yes.

47
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,687
She may not be able to tell you now,

48
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,899
but one day, you'll understand everything.

49
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,155
Mi-joo, how do you know that?

50
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,745
Because I was abandoned too.

51
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,082
You were?

52
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:54,877
Why?

53
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm not sure.

54
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,011
I also really want to know

55
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,055
why I was abandoned.

56
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,727
But I'll never know.

57
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,194
Kang-ho!

58
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,488
Kang-ho.

59
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,180
Kang-ho.

60
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,973
About what happened--

61
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,266
What's the reason?

62
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,560
What?

63
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,146
Why did you abandon me?

64
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,691
Mi-joo told me

65
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,735
that there must be a reason for that.

66
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,492
Kang-ho.

67
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,578
I never

68
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,414
abandoned you.

69
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,301
Kang-ho, look at me.

70
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,763
Look at me. Please?

71
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,020
I'll be honest.

72
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,274
Kang-ho, the thing is…

73
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,152
I'm actually

74
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,613
a bit unwell.

75
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,327
You are?

76
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:52,954
Where?

77
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,248
Here.

78
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,001
My stomach hurts a bit.

79
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,758
Because I'm unwell, I need to
take medicine and go to the hospital.

80
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,637
Someone needs to cook,
do the laundry, and look after me.

81
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,306
But…

82
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,602
I didn't want to burden you.

83
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,063
That's why.

84
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,360
Was I a burden to you…

85
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,239
because I'm unwell?

86
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,576
What?

87
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,955
You fed me medicine
and took me to the hospital.

88
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,791
You cooked and did my laundry too.

89
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,421
To me, you're just my mom.

90
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,303
But I must've been a burden to you.

91
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,229
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,273
I was wrong.

93
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,775
You're right.

94
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,654
I'm your mom,

95
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,240
and you're my son.

96
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,951
I was so stupid to think that way.

97
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,125
Besides, you're no longer unwell.

98
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,961
You definitely stood up earlier.

99
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,338
And soon enough,

100
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,466
you'll be able to walk and run.

101
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,551
And…

102
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,137
you'll be able to take care of me.

103
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,848
That's right.

104
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,685
I also have a guardian now, don't I?

105
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,604
"Guardian"?

106
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,773
Yes.

107
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,653
You're my guardian now.

108
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,323
Your guardian.

109
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,168
So Kang-ho,

110
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,920
try to stand up

111
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,258
like you did earlier.

112
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,360
It's okay. You can do it.

113
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,654
Take your time and try it again.

114
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,655
Okay.

115
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,376
Don't give up. You're almost there.

116
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,336
A bit more.

117
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,090
I can't do it.

118
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,759
No, you did. You already did.

119
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,971
Get up, Kang-ho.

120
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:57,888
Get up.

121
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,274
Don't leave me, Mom.

122
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,905
Mom, where are we going?

123
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,828
No. I don't want to go.

124
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,166
Can't I just live with you? Please?

125
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,209
Mom.

126
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,256
Mom.

127
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,634
Mom!

128
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,968
Mom!

129
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,473
Mom!

130
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,475
Mom!

131
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,144
Mom! Save me!

132
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,228
Do you want to live?

133
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,022
Do you?

134
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,316
-Mom!
-Then get up.

135
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,318
Stand up like you did earlier!

136
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,530
-Mom!
-Get up!

137
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,866
-Kang-ho, look!
-Mom!

138
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,327
If you stand up,

139
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,537
the water will be only knee-deep!

140
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,039
-Mom.
-So get up!

141
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,083
Stand up!

142
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,126
Mom.

143
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,173
Mom!

144
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,050
The wheelchair is gone.

145
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,385
So get up.

146
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,136
Get up and walk!

147
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,806
I can't…

148
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,355
It's not that you can't. You just won't.

149
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,899
That's not true.

150
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,276
I can't do it, Mom.

151
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,195
-Really?
-Mom!

152
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,780
Really?

153
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,991
Mom!

154
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,701
-Get up.
-Mom!

155
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,829
-Mom!
-Get up!

156
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,332
-Mom!
-Get up and walk!

157
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,126
Mom!

158
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,128
Get up!

159
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,755
Mom…

160
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,388
Hold him by his pelvis…

161
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,688
Mom…

162
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,231
Get up.

163
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,733
All right.

164
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,112
It's okay. You can do it.

165
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,780
Get up.

166
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,407
-You're doing well.
-A bit more. Your left foot.

167
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,130
That's it.

168
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,090
Your legs.

169
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,800
Move your legs!

170
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,260
I can't move them.

171
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,434
Slowly. Good.

172
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,188
Well done.

173
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,231
-Well done.
-You're doing well.

174
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,941
Slowly.

175
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,902
Gosh!

176
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,246
-Move them.
-Mom.

177
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,208
I can move them, Mom.

178
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,751
Mom.

179
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,337
Well done. More.

180
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,860
-I don't want to!
-Oh Tae-soo of Jeilmirae Party

181
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,320
-Come here.
-received the highest votes

182
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,905
-Kang-ho!
-in the preliminary elections.

183
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,822
Mr. Son!

184
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,556
Come here, Kang-ho.

185
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,016
Kang-ho.

186
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:39,378
She's already been through
so much hardship.

187
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,797
With her son in that state

188
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,091
and now her farm in ruins,

189
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,343
she must be in so much distress.

190
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,846
I can't believe I made such a fuss

191
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,266
trying to get rid of her pig farm.

192
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,060
I deserve to die.

193
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,061
That's true.

194
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,146
What?

195
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,234
Don't say that.

196
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,820
We're all to blame.

197
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,614
No one here is innocent.

198
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,285
I should visit and console her,

199
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:15,372
but I feel too shameful to do that.

200
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,125
Speaking of which,

201
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,794
as her neighbors,

202
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,172
we should be doing something to help her.

203
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:28,260
Then should we all pitch in
some money for her?

204
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,680
You know her. She'd never accept it.

205
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,934
I agree. Instead of giving her money,

206
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,727
how about we give her a gift?

207
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,315
Perhaps, some nice sheet masks,
clothes, or a luxury bag.

208
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,360
She's been giving away
everything she owns.

209
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,694
I doubt she'll be happy.

210
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,821
What is she giving away?

211
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,615
Did she give you something?

212
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,661
-Did she give you something?
-No.

213
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,371
That's not it.

214
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,498
What I mean is that

215
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,710
she's not the type

216
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,130
to want nice clothes or bags.

217
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:10,344
Her only desire
is to dote on her one and only son.

218
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,806
Why don't we get Kang-ho a gift instead?

219
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,100
Goodness, that's a great idea.

220
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,059
Right.

221
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,521
Then what about a new wheelchair?

222
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:24,775
I saw that she had thrown out
his broken wheelchair a few days ago.

223
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,028
Then don't you think
she would've bought a new one already?

224
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,530
-Right.
-You think so?

225
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,741
Since he can't go anywhere without it.

226
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,826
That's true.

227
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,123
Then how about
we get him a mobility scooter?

228
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,168
It won't break since it's sturdy.

229
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,255
The roads here are very rough.

230
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,840
It's perfect!

231
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,885
You sure are an early adopter.

232
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,928
I'm all for it.

233
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,097
-Me too!
-We all are!

234
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,975
-Then let's get one already.
-Okay.

235
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,728
JIN YOUNG-SOON
CHOI KANG-HO'S MOTHER

236
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,229
JUNG GUM-JA, LEE MI-JOO

237
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,231
PIGSTY
OFFICE

238
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,112
Mr. So.

239
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,033
You startled me.

240
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,038
You jerk. I told you
not to barge in like that.

241
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,956
-We finally have it.
-What?

242
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,837
Are you serious?

243
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,006
Where?

244
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:31,967
Where is it?

245
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,014
Look at this.

246
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,140
We finally have…

247
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,476
a lettuce leaf.

248
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,145
So…

249
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,482
you didn't mean evidence.

250
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,863
You meant lettuce leaves.

251
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,615
Oh, the evidence?

252
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,619
But sir, look. We went through
the effort of planting them.

253
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:02,206
At times, we forgot
to water them or spray pesticides.

254
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,876
But look how they've grown.

255
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:06,877
So,

256
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,922
you're elated.

257
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,131
Right?

258
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,093
Yes, sir. I'm very happy.

259
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,012
It's the first time
I've planted something and seen it grow.

260
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,224
-Take a closer look.
-Don't come near me.

261
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,433
Don't!

262
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,684
Get out!

263
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,436
Go!

264
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,938
You punk!

265
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,023
Leave!

266
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,568
What are you talking about?

267
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,112
We're not qualified?

268
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,949
We're young, healthy men
who decided to farm in the countryside.

269
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,451
We've completed the required course too.

270
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,744
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,789
But both of the applicants
are employed in a conglomerate

272
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,625
and covered by social insurance,
therefore are not eligible for this loan.

273
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,837
What on earth are you talking about?

274
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,088
Then what about me?

275
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,257
What should I do?

276
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,174
Sorry?

277
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,135
What are you…

278
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,554
I'll die if I don't pay them back soon.

279
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,513
And it'll be messy.

280
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,431
They'll tear out my liver, kidneys, eyes,

281
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:05,185
lungs, intestines, duodenum,
and everything else

282
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,688
piece by piece
and that's how I'll end up--

283
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,322
I should just die.

284
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,283
I should just die.

285
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,327
I should just die.

286
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,331
I should just die.

287
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,583
I should just die.

288
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,252
What are you looking for?

289
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,088
Are there any pesticides?

290
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,132
I want to kill myself.

291
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,467
It's down there.

292
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,553
What?

293
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:44,683
Mix two tablespoons of this
in one mal of water.

294
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,978
Okay.

295
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,022
This one too.

296
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,401
Here's your insecticide.

297
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,195
-Thank you.
-Sure.

298
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,946
-Bye.
-Bye.

299
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,164
Goodness.

300
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,791
What is this? Is this for me?

301
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,959
Are you senile?

302
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,461
What? What's wrong with me?

303
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,631
Is looking for romance at my age so wrong?

304
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,007
Jeez.

305
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:22,054
This countryside has been teeming
with old ladies.

306
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,057
-All the men around here are excited
-Does it hurt?

307
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,727
to see such a young, pretty lady.

308
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,980
Mi-joo has been treating everyone

309
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,608
in this village well.

310
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,986
Thanks to her, I have more customers now.

311
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,738
She's my lucky charm.

312
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,782
Hey, young lady.

313
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,160
Are you interested in opening a nail salon

314
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,705
in a bigger and cleaner place?

315
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,083
I could easily get you

316
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,878
the best spot in this area.

317
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,879
What do you say?

318
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,800
Thank you for the offer,
but I like this place.

319
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,804
I have many regulars,
and the owners here are so lovely.

320
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,890
Did you hear that?

321
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:11,853
Don't you even dream
of stealing her from me.

322
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,523
Shouldn't you get going?

323
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,525
Excuse me.

324
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,652
Hi, Mom.

325
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,071
Mom, Dad is here.

326
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,283
What? What are you talking about?
Why would he be here?

327
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,537
-I'm working, so call me later.
-I'm not lying. I know his face.

328
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,247
He drove a Banz here.

329
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,790
I'm certain it's him.

330
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,461
Stop here please.

331
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,964
Mom!

332
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,090
Mom!

333
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,802
Mom, hurry!

334
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,721
-Hurry up!
-Okay.

335
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,431
You need to hurry!

336
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,475
Grandma is beating Dad up right now!

337
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,520
He's getting beaten up!

338
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,273
You darn son of a gun!

339
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,984
I know it's you! Stop lying!

340
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,193
-What's wrong?
-You're the guy

341
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,154
who abandoned my daughter!

342
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,280
That's not me.

343
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,364
Don't you dare lie!

344
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,951
You don't think I know your face?

345
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,163
I set a picture of you

346
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,082
as the wallpaper on my phone.

347
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,545
I wanted to make sure to recognize you
so I can beat you up.

348
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,922
I only took that because she asked me to.

349
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,965
Stop lying!

350
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,092
Darn it. And that's not even the US.

351
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,595
We took that in Seoul.

352
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,598
Be quiet.

353
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,599
The kids will hear.

354
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,060
-Dad!
-Dad!

355
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,776
The kids think you're their dad.

356
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,402
You can't show up like this.

357
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,445
Pay me back.

358
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,908
-Sun-young borrowed that money.
-I don't want to hear it.

359
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,160
You have until the end of the month.

360
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,079
If you don't,

361
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:56,541
I'll tell those ladies
who are dying to find you

362
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,751
that you're here.

363
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,225
What? What's wrong?

364
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,269
Where's Dad?

365
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,605
Dad?

366
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,816
He left.

367
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,567
He left?

368
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,610
Where did he go?

369
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,112
To the US.

370
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,656
The US?

371
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,827
Something urgent came up, so he had to.

372
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,204
He said he was sorry for leaving
without saying goodbye

373
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,040
-and that when he returns--
-I hate you both.

374
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,167
I won't go to kindergarten anymore.

375
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,546
Ye-jin.

376
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,217
There's this boy named Park Jun-seo
at our kindergarten.

377
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,761
He always teases her for not having a dad,

378
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,721
so they always get into fights.

379
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,099
So we were going to
bring Dad along tomorrow

380
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,810
and teach him a lesson.

381
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,646
But not anymore.

382
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,649
Seo-jin.

383
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,694
It's me.

384
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,072
The hen I told you to prepare,
I don't need it anymore.

385
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,123
Darn it.

386
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,629
The kids kept saying that
they wanted to see their dad.

387
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,218
So I asked my friend's boyfriend
to video-call them a few times.

388
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,138
Mom.

389
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,891
I'm sorry.

390
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,058
Don't be.

391
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:41,688
It's not like I've been
a model parent to you anyway.

392
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,026
I'm the one who started all this,

393
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,862
so you don't have to apologize to me.

394
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,030
It's just that

395
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,574
those kids

396
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,534
will be going to school soon.

397
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,747
Once they see the family register
and find out they don't have a dad,

398
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,498
they'll be so heartbroken.

399
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,048
I thought of telling them
that you guys got a divorce

400
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,091
or that he died of an illness.

401
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,677
I thought long and hard too.

402
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,638
But…

403
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,681
I just can't do it.

404
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,061
I can't bear the thought
of making them cry.

405
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:25,774
Both of them will bawl.
How can I possibly watch that?

406
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,069
They must be so heartbroken right now

407
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,489
and bawling their eyes out.

408
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,201
My babies…

409
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,787
-No way!
-No way!

410
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,414
Is this for Kang-ho?

411
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,958
Yes, what do you think?

412
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,417
Isn't it incredible?

413
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,878
It's a bit small for three.

414
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,755
What are you talking about?

415
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,340
You shouldn't ride it!

416
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,383
It's just for him!

417
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,385
Don't raise your voice at them.

418
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,845
-They could get hurt.
-He's right. You could get hurt.

419
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,640
Kids, this is very expensive.

420
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,558
So you shouldn't ride it, okay?

421
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,018
-Okay.
-Good boy.

422
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,230
The wheels are huge,
and it looks so sturdy.

423
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,606
Kang-ho will love it.

424
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,400
-Right.
-Of course.

425
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,486
This will save Young-soon the hassle too.

426
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,530
I'm glad we got it.

427
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,156
-Right.
-Hey, it's Mi-joo.

428
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,950
-Hi, Mi-joo.
-Gosh.

429
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,286
Look who's here. It's Mi-joo.

430
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,122
Did you close your salon today for this?

431
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,164
Sorry?

432
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,793
Goodness, you must be busy
with so many customers.

433
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,004
How considerate of you.

434
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,299
But then again,
she's always cared for Kang-ho

435
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,759
-since they were kids.
-That's true.

436
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,804
And Sam-sik always bullied Kang-ho.

437
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:38,805
What…

438
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,890
What on earth are you talking about?

439
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,686
Sam-sik never bullied Kang-ho.

440
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,479
He did. Be quiet.

441
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:50,483
Anyway, now that
everyone's here, let's go.

442
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,027
-All right.
-Let's go.

443
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,611
-Move aside.
-Let's go!

444
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,572
-You're going to hurt yourself!
-Go.

445
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,198
All right.

446
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,409
-Look at him.
-Goodness!

447
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,203
I need to go back to the salon now.

448
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,331
After they complimented you?

449
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,750
-What?
-Be quiet and follow me.

450
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,044
Mom…

451
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,842
We can't make any mistakes this time.

452
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,094
Do something stupid once again,

453
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,638
and you'll see lettuce roots

454
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,932
instead of leaves.

455
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,142
Roots?

456
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,603
But the roots are underground…

457
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,690
Yes, sir.

458
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,791
Hey, hide!

459
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,085
Over there!

460
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,759
Where in the world are they
after screwing me over?

461
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,595
And why aren't they picking up?

462
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,805
Darn it.

463
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,515
All right.

464
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,725
Gosh, it's so fascinating.

465
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,186
-Be careful! You'll trip and fall!
-Make way!

466
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,522
-Make way!
-Make way!

467
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,190
Make way!

468
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,983
Hey!

469
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,777
All right.

470
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,197
-Make way!
-Make way!

471
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,991
-Let's go!
-Come on, let's go!

472
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,287
Wait, why am I hiding?

473
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,141
I'll ask her to open the gates.

474
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,600
Why aren't you picking up?

475
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,102
-Hey--
-Wait.

476
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,854
-What is it?
-Hold on.

477
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:55,024
Don't you think it'd be too boring

478
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,110
to just hand it over to him?

479
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,528
-Boring?
-What do you mean?

480
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,821
-Yes.
-How about

481
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,867
you all line up in two rows?

482
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,326
-Both ways?
-Yes.

483
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,662
-Like a wedding.
-I see.

484
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,998
-Go on.
-Like this?

485
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:15,211
I'll be hiding in that corner, okay?

486
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,965
Once Kang-ho comes out,

487
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,134
I want you to shout out his name.

488
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,553
That'll be my cue.

489
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,807
-Then I'll appear with this scooter.
-What are they doing?

490
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,685
-I love it.
-Great.

491
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,354
You sure are the brains around here.

492
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,190
You're flattering me.

493
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,817
Anyway, give me my cue.

494
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,486
All right. "Kang-ho!"

495
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,697
Jeez, they're so over the top.

496
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,325
Young-soon!

497
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,827
Are you home?

498
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,912
Young-soon!

499
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,039
Young-soon.

500
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,291
I'm coming.

501
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,592
What brings all of you here?

502
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,385
Goodness.

503
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,096
Mr. Son.

504
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,183
It must've been so tough for you.

505
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,560
As the old saying goes,

506
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,397
"Neighbors are worth a thousand homes."

507
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,317
But none of us are well-off enough

508
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,361
to help you out.

509
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:26,115
We also thought you'd need some time
to cope with your loss.

510
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,284
It may sound like an excuse,

511
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,287
but we finally mustered up
the courage to see you.

512
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,998
We're truly

513
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,917
sorry.

514
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,254
Don't say that.

515
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,549
I'm the one who should be sorry
for inconveniencing the village.

516
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,509
-I'm sorry.
-Not at all.

517
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,553
-We're sorry.
-Enough.

518
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:50,473
We apologized,
and you accepted our apology.

519
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,475
We're good now, okay?

520
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,518
Sure.

521
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,061
Where's Kang-ho?

522
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,188
We haven't seen him in a while.

523
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,565
We miss him.

524
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,149
-Kang-ho?
-Yes.

525
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,401
One minute.

526
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:02,819
Kang-ho.

527
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,571
Kang-ho, come on out.

528
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,488
All right now.

529
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,657
-Should we go get him?
-We should.

530
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,950
No, stay here.

531
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,703
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

532
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,538
Goodness.

533
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,832
-Goodness…
-This is great.

534
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,417
I'm so happy for you!

535
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,668
Goodness!

536
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,005
-Goodness…
-This is unbelievable.

537
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,800
Kang-ho!

538
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,177
I'm coming!

539
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,678
Goodness.

540
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,348
Goodness, this is amazing.

541
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,642
I'm so grateful.

542
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,019
Goodness…

543
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,228
-Goodness!
-Hey!

544
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,813
Mr. Bang!

545
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,399
Dad!

546
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,443
-Dad!
-No! Move aside!

547
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,403
Honey, where does it hurt?

548
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,655
Where?

549
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,114
-My legs!
-Your legs?

550
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,366
Are you okay?

551
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,825
-Goodness.
-What do I do?

552
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,953
-Hi, Sam-sik.
-Are my legs okay?

553
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,788
Hold on. No.

554
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,623
-Call 911!
-Call 911!

555
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,166
-Call 911!
-Hurry!

556
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,129
They say sunshine comes after the rain.

557
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:49,008
God must've been moved
by your mom's perseverance and love.

558
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,261
That's why He's given you this miracle.

559
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,262
I agree.

560
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,182
And He's given me this mobility scooter.

561
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,144
You should be grateful for it.
That was a close call.

562
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,525
You two from Seoul, eat up.

563
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,567
Thank you.

564
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,819
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

565
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:11,739
Hey.

566
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,742
Focus and look around carefully.

567
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,122
We didn't come here to drink makgeolli.

568
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,456
Yes, sir.

569
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,383
A little bird told me that

570
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,593
you work at a conglomerate.

571
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,597
How did you know
we work for Woobyeok Group?

572
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,557
What?

573
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,933
I didn't know that.

574
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,561
Jeez, you work for Woobyeok Group?

575
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,566
Then you should've told me sooner.

576
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,609
Hold on.

577
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,195
If that's the case,

578
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,239
why do you want to farm?

579
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,325
We've retired.

580
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,785
Did you?

581
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,911
I see.

582
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,291
Don't you usually receive severance pay?

583
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,461
You see, I have
a really great business idea.

584
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,172
Listen up.

585
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,805
Look who's here.

586
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,891
It's Mi-joo, my love.

587
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,225
Say hello.

588
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,686
These two are my future business partners.

589
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,688
And she'll be my future--

590
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,108
Can't you see everyone is working?
Go get some makgeolli from the kitchen.

591
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,985
Enjoy.

592
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,446
That's her charm.

593
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,948
The straightforwardness and jabs.

594
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,494
I'll invite you to our wedding,
so make sure you come.

595
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,537
-We'll talk about our business later.
-Okay.

596
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,164
I'll give them to the kids.

597
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,875
Kids, there's more.

598
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,752
Eat up.

599
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,346
Wait.

600
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,599
Look.

601
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,811
I'm all better now.

602
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,687
You're right.

603
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,565
You're all better now. I'm glad.

604
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,820
Wait.

605
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,699
My mom said that

606
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,369
she didn't abandon me.

607
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,372
So I'm sure

608
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,251
that person didn't abandon you either.

609
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,350
Here you go.

610
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,728
We used to be similar in height.

611
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,856
But you're much taller now.

612
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,191
Tell me about it. You're like an adult.

613
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,026
Here.

614
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,445
If I do this, you're taller than me.

615
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,201
All right.

616
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,873
What is this? Why do I have butterflies?

617
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,499
Me too. Lift me up too.

618
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,042
Should I?

619
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,669
Come here, Seo-jin.

620
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,962
Here we go.

621
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,673
-Get a good look at the view, Seo-jin.
-And again.

622
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,841
Good boy.

623
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,259
You got a good view.

624
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,468
Sam-sik.

625
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,554
Come and eat.

626
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,682
Congratulations, Young-soon.

627
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,475
Now that Kang-ho can walk again,

628
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,187
I'm sure only good things
will come your way now.

629
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:30,813
That's right.

630
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,317
Once you open the farm again,
Kang-ho will help out. This is just great.

631
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,987
It's so fascinating.

632
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:42,950
Her pigs have been around
for the past 30 years,

633
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,119
and now that I don't smell them,

634
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,580
a part of me feels empty and strange.

635
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:53,169
I'll be honest. She used to give us
free meat every now and then.

636
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,839
We also got manure for free. It was nice.

637
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,008
Of course.

638
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,761
A pig farm is far better

639
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,972
than some trot concert hall.

640
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,017
Look at those despicable humans.

641
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:16,400
By the way,
I haven't seen Hoon-ah around lately.

642
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,526
You're right.

643
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,042
We grilled some meat.

644
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,461
So what? Are you rubbing it in my face?

645
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,880
If you haven't eaten yet,

646
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,549
you should come over and eat with us.

647
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,218
The villagers are all there.

648
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,386
No.

649
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,221
I'm allergic to pork.

650
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,305
It's beef.

651
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,558
These darn flies.

652
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,601
I hate them!

653
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,311
Go.

654
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,146
-Darn it.
-Sir.

655
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,275
I won't be alive for long.

656
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,403
I have terminal cancer.

657
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,948
Since I won't be running
the farm for long,

658
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:09,161
I told my lawyer
to hand it over to you after I die.

659
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,372
But…

660
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,293
my son can walk again now.

661
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,504
That pig farm

662
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,883
is the only thing I can leave him.

663
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,720
It's also the only thing I can teach him.

664
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,556
So please.

665
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,851
Please…

666
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,478
don't take it away from us.

667
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,406
I knew you wouldn't join us,
so I brought some meat.

668
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,490
Here.

669
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,954
Please keep my illness

670
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,291
a secret from the villagers.

671
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,293
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

672
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,420
The meat just melts in my mouth.

673
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,130
-It's like ice cream.
-It's tasty.

674
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,381
Everything's so good.

675
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,382
Gosh.

676
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,801
-I need to use the bathroom.
-It's so tender.

677
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,219
Gosh.

678
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,347
The vegetables are good too.

679
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:16,771
Hey, don't drag your feet. It's so dusty.
Where are your table manners?

680
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,023
-Where's the bathroom?
-There's dust everywhere!

681
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,196
Is this it?

682
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,367
This isn't it.

683
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,755
It's here.

684
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,257
Thank you.

685
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,717
-Gosh, thank you.
-It's so good.

686
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,844
-Use both hands.
-Just eat this.

687
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:49,887
Come on.

688
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,930
We finally have it.

689
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,391
What is it this time?

690
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,185
-Poop?
-No.

691
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,395
The evidence.

692
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,523
All his files and belongings
are in the shed back there.

693
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:01,941
What?

694
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,692
Are you serious?

695
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,154
-Let's go.
-All right.

696
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,574
Right!

697
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,076
I finally remember who you are.

698
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,244
Damn it.

699
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,578
We met before, right?

700
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,206
You were hiding in my closet,

701
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,834
and then came out and started fighting
with a knife with a guy.

702
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,877
What? With a knife?

703
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,629
-Yes.
-Are you thieves?

704
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,297
Why were you hiding in their closet?

705
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,300
What are you talking about?

706
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,429
They're my business partners.

707
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,888
Then they are thieves.

708
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:33,848
Hey!

709
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,391
-Wait.
-Come on.

710
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,143
You're wrong.

711
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,312
They recently moved here
from the city to farm.

712
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,815
-Remember my cornfield?
-Yes.

713
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,275
They bought it.

714
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,320
They're growing lettuce with Sam-sik now.

715
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,572
-Is that so?
-Yes.

716
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,032
Then come here
and have some makgeolli with us.

717
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,826
-You won't be driving.
-Come.

718
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,828
I'm afraid we need to leave.

719
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,288
We need to water the lettuce.

720
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,207
Right. We should.

721
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,418
-Excuse us.
-Bye.

722
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,336
-They're so hardworking.
-Wait.

723
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,298
Make sure you let the water run first.

724
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,426
The water in the hose is lukewarm,
so it'll kill the lettuce.

725
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,511
-How cute.
-Lion, come here.

726
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,929
Lion, come here.

727
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,390
Lion.

728
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,934
Sit down, Lion.

729
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,186
Over here.

730
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,646
Now I can play soccer

731
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,857
and hopscotch with you.

732
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,025
Right, Kang-ho?

733
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,277
Don't call him like that.

734
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,070
He's all grown up now.

735
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,239
Right, Kang-ho oppa?

736
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,409
It's okay. We're friends.

737
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,038
You're an adult so we need to
treat you like one, okay?

738
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,542
Then do we need to use honorifics too?

739
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,712
All right. I got it.

740
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,757
I actually always thought you should.

741
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,219
Is it tasty, Lion?

742
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,224
They look like one happy family.

743
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,311
Goodness, I'm sorry.

744
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,480
I can wrap up here.

745
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,815
You should go home with your kids.

746
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,816
Ms. Jin.

747
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,070
I stayed behind
because I had something to ask you.

748
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,448
Do you remember

749
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,868
when we met by the pond
when it was raining?

750
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,454
Kang-ho said something…

751
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,084
I won't do it again.

752
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,670
Never again.

753
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,965
Okay.

754
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,841
Then I won't worry anymore.

755
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,637
Thanks.

756
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,430
Likewise.

757
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,393
-"I love you"
-"I love you"

758
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,271
-Is such
-Is such

759
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,649
-A great thing to say
-A great thing to say

760
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:53,028
-I really like
-I really like

761
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,739
-These three words
-These three words

762
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:01,996
-I love you
-I love you

763
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,124
-I love you.
-I love you, Mom and Dad.

764
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,378
I'm sorry about getting mad earlier.

765
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,714
I guess Dad must've been very busy

766
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,466
if he had to leave without saying goodbye.

767
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:18,220
I'm sure he'll come
to our elementary entrance ceremony.

768
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,599
I can teach Park Jun-seo a lesson then.

769
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,978
But tell Dad to look good that day.

770
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,607
I don't know
if he was dressed the way Americans do,

771
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,569
but he looked quite shabby,
and I didn't like it.

772
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,697
I agree. Kang-ho looked great today.

773
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,366
He was tall and strong.

774
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,579
What if we pretend that
Kang-ho is our dad?

775
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,538
-No!
-No.

776
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,707
Goodness. All right.

777
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,001
You guys didn't have to get all worked up.

778
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,670
You. I told you
not to treat him like a friend.

779
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,089
-Treat him like an adult!
-Mom!

780
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,133
-Stop it.
-Hello.

781
00:43:56,216 --> 00:44:01,639
My babies.

782
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,557
It's Mr. Sam-sik.

783
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:08,562
Why do you call me "Mr. Sam-sik"
and Kang-ho "oppa"?

784
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,648
Come here.

785
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,025
What are you doing? Put me down.

786
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,277
I'm scared of heights.

787
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,154
-Don't do that!
-All of a sudden?

788
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,865
You liked it when Kang-ho lifted you up.

789
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,992
Baby.

790
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,619
Answer me, will you?

791
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,455
You reek of alcohol.

792
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,208
That's enough. Go inside and wash up.

793
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,626
-Let's go!
-No.

794
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,127
My babies!

795
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,838
Goodness. You should go home
and sleep if you're drunk.

796
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,423
You're embarrassing yourself.

797
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,842
Go home.

798
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,760
Mi-joo.

799
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,638
What is it?

800
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,806
I'm going to be

801
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,226
straightforward with you.

802
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,560
Okay.

803
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,187
Do you like Kang-ho?

804
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,481
What?

805
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,108
Does seeing him walk

806
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,944
stir up your emotions?

807
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,947
Is that why you didn't go to work today

808
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,074
and stayed behind
and helped them clean up?

809
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,702
Just go home.

810
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,289
Why can't you say you don't?

811
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,919
I don't. I don't like him.

812
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:14,878
Happy?

813
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,088
If that's true,

814
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,341
let's get married.

815
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,221
Let's live a happy life

816
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,390
and raise the kids together.

817
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,350
Let's do that.

818
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,185
They need a dad.

819
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,021
I promise to make you guys happy.

820
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,279
Should we?

821
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,741
What? What did you say?

822
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,702
Are you serious?

823
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,662
-You'll marry me?
-Yes.

824
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,540
Let's do it.

825
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,334
But you know I'm broke, right?

826
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,961
I have a ton of debt too.

827
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,796
A creditor came by today as well.

828
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,632
We can struggle together every single day

829
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,259
to pay off our debts.

830
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,637
We'll get chased around pathetically.

831
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,807
But amid all that,
let's live happily together.

832
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,642
Sure.

833
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,228
"Stir up my emotions"? "Get married"?

834
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:18,150
I work like a dog every day
to pay off my debt bit by bit.

835
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:21,528
It's tough to make ends meet
while taking care of my family.

836
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,947
I can't afford to have
my head in the clouds like you.

837
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,159
Bye.

838
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,376
Is the debt the only issue then?

839
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,673
Mi-joo, listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

840
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,675
I will be back.

841
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,305
This used to be your room.

842
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,766
You'll be sleeping here from now on.

843
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,976
But I don't want to be alone.

844
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,061
No.

845
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,396
You need to learn to be independent.

846
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,981
That's how you become an adult.

847
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:03,028
I'll teach you one step at a time. Okay?

848
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,155
Okay.

849
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,410
Who is this?

850
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,289
Hello?

851
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,513
Excuse me.

852
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,890
I'm Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho's…

853
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,935
Goodness, you're here. Please come in.

854
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,271
This way.

855
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,481
-Have this.
-Thank you.

856
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,488
On the day
you dropped off the side dishes,

857
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,700
Prosecutor Choi came by late at night.

858
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,666
If my mother comes by

859
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,502
to pick up my belongings
when I'm not here,

860
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,879
please give her this.

861
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,631
TO MY MOTHER

862
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,469
Are you moving?

863
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,263
No.

864
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,392
But I might have to.

865
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,564
Please give it to her and nobody else.

866
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,816
Please.

867
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,944
But I was off duty that day,

868
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,322
so I didn't even know that he had moved.

869
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:31,033
Fortunately, you gave me
your number last time,

870
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,743
so I'm finally giving it to you.

871
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,578
Sorry it's so late.

872
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,416
To my mother whom I miss dearly.

873
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,252
Are you healthy and well?

874
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,673
I got the side dishes
that you left at the security office.

875
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,802
I had always missed
your home-cooked meals.

876
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:55,182
I had a lovely dinner
for the first time in a long time.

877
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,645
I'm sorry that my work keeps me

878
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,065
from calling or visiting you often.

879
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,567
But Mother,

880
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,819
I want you to know this.

881
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,948
We may be apart,

882
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,618
but I still live

883
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:18,664
in the memories
I shared with you and Father.

884
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:23,210
I'll see you next week on your birthday.

885
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:27,297
"September 7.
From your beloved son, Kang-ho."

886
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,175
"Kang-ho"?

887
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,678
Did I write this?

888
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,764
It's just so odd.

889
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:41,186
You've never spoken to me
in this manner before.

890
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,523
Why did you leave this
with the security guard?

891
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,402
How did you know
I'd be packing your stuff without you?

892
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,531
Tell me.

893
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:56,576
Did you know you'd end up this way?

894
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:01,415
Were you trying
to tell me something with this letter?

895
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,542
You were, right?

896
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,378
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

897
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,716
And then…

898
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,177
Again.

899
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,722
Again.

900
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,223
Again.

901
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,392
INVESTIGATION OFFICER

902
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,686
Hello?

903
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,564
It's me, ma'am. You called.

904
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,774
I was attending a trial earlier.

905
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,068
I see. One minute.

906
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,197
Fill it out, and when they call number 25,

907
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,701
go hand them the bankbook and the seal.

908
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,161
What's the password again?

909
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,704
The password is

910
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,205
zero, nine--

911
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,500
Zero, nine, zero, seven. My birthday.

912
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,918
That's right.

913
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,087
I'm sorry.

914
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,174
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo?

915
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,552
Do you mean

916
00:50:56,303 --> 00:51:00,474
the assemblyman
who's running for president?

917
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,975
The former prosecutor?

918
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,185
Correct.

919
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:07,689
Prosecutor Choi was engaged
to his daughter.

920
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,524
You didn't know?

921
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,650
Goodness.

922
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,986
How could this be?

923
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,323
That's a relief.

924
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,076
I've been acquainted with Assembly Oh.

925
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,579
Could you give me his number please?

926
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:23,538
Sorry?

927
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,124
His daughter's number
would be even better.

928
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,961
I have a few things to check about my son.

929
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:33,215
And I think she'd know best

930
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,675
since they were engaged.

931
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,676
Gosh.

932
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,761
Ma'am.

933
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,680
There's no way for me
to know their numbers.

934
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,892
And she's getting married soon.

935
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,603
I think it'd be best
if you didn't call them.

936
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,272
Here comes the bride.

937
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,863
Where's the groom?

938
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,324
He's taking a call outside.

939
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,037
Where's the groom?

940
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,705
He's taking a call inside.

941
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,549
Is he serious?

942
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,050
He's in the room next door.

943
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,723
Make sure the baby is dressed warmly.
It's pretty windy near the sea.

944
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,685
I'll pick you up at 8 p.m.

945
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,229
Kang-ho.

946
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,399
What baby?

947
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,150
It's nothing.

948
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,111
Are you done?

949
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:41,283
I was going to surprise you
with a grand appearance.

950
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,161
Is the other one better?
Or is something fancier better?

951
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,873
You already look pretty enough.

952
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,708
Whatever.

953
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,334
You do. Let's go.

954
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,128
Kang-ho.

955
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:58,174
We're visiting your mother tomorrow.
Do you really have to go out tonight?

956
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,427
It's work-related. I won't be long.

957
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,262
You're such a workaholic.

958
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,180
Let's stop by the department store.

959
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,686
We need to make a move first.

960
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,272
I heard about your daughter's wedding.

961
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,443
You'll become in-laws with Dosang Group.

962
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,069
Yes, that's right.

963
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,114
What can I do? Our children are in love.

964
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,240
I understand.

965
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,743
Parents are always bound
to give in to their children.

966
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,786
Though there are parents who kill them.

967
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,829
Mr. Song!

968
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,998
Gosh, you startled me.

969
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,375
It's about time you dropped it.

970
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,919
It's all in the past.

971
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,253
I believe

972
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:40,300
my men found something in Kang-ho's house.

973
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,349
Do you mean
the original copy of the DNA test result?

974
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,937
As you said, it's just a piece of paper.

975
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:56,358
What if I claim that you colluded
with Bareun Hanguk Party

976
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,360
and fabricated it to take me down?

977
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,570
Then how will you prove its authenticity?

978
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,074
So why did you have to take it so far

979
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,535
as to kill the poor woman and her child?

980
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,745
What did you say?

981
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,331
I hope we never see each other again.

982
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,540
Goodbye then.

983
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,631
Right.

984
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,509
I expected nothing less from him.

985
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,436
How did it go?

986
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,939
We finally located the file.

987
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,696
In two days,

988
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,324
Oh Tae-soo will become in-laws
with Dosang Group.

989
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,494
And you just managed to locate it?

990
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,789
-Are you kidding me right--
-Choi Kang-ho

991
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,207
is walking again.

992
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,212
What do you mean?

993
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,640
See? What did I tell you?

994
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:13,309
I told you he'd walk again.

995
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,771
Where should you record
the pig feed that you purchased?

996
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:17,981
Pig feed.

997
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,524
Pig feed…

998
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,317
Here. "Pig Feed Management."

999
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,277
Good.

1000
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,321
What about their medicine and injections?

1001
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,823
Medicine

1002
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,408
and injections…

1003
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,868
Here.

1004
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,036
Well done.

1005
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,912
You're so smart.

1006
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,208
You need to check
and record them every day, okay?

1007
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:38,918
Okay.

1008
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,588
What am I learning tomorrow?

1009
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,630
Tomorrow?

1010
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,050
COPIED DOCUMENTS

1011
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,136
-Are these all mine?
-Yes, they're all yours.

1012
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,890
Mom, this too?

1013
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,725
Yes.

1014
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,894
Awesome.

1015
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,146
I'm going to show it
to Seo-jin and Ye-jin.

1016
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,315
Found it.

1017
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,322
Kang-ho oppa!

1018
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,532
Hello, you cuties.

1019
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,994
You must be here
to hang out with Uncle Kang-ho.

1020
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,997
But we need to go into town.

1021
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,373
It's okay.

1022
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,710
Ye-jin only came to congratulate him
on walking again.

1023
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,170
She brought a flower.

1024
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,506
Go on.

1025
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:29,177
They said yellow was your lucky color.

1026
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,683
Thanks, Ye-jin. It's so pretty.

1027
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,978
But of course, you're prettier.

1028
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,411
We'll be back.

1029
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:02,585
I'm going to beat up anyone
who tells me to wash my hands.

1030
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,463
Did you see how we were
wearing matching colors?

1031
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,923
This is fate.

1032
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,050
I'm going to marry him.

1033
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,846
One, two, three.

1034
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,058
Okay, it's all done.

1035
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,478
Please wait in the waiting room
while it gets printed.

1036
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,646
-Okay.
-Okay.

1037
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:31,072
Excuse me, but could I take one alone?

1038
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,617
Sure. Please sit in the middle.

1039
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,203
Is it for your passport or ID?

1040
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,957
I need a photo much bigger than those.

1041
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,918
Those who come to pay
their condolences will see it,

1042
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,670
so please make sure to take it well.

1043
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,256
"Condolences"?

1044
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,215
Yes.

1045
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,594
Okay, ma'am.

1046
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,512
One minute please.

1047
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,364
All right. Let's try it again.

1048
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:16,993
Mom.

1049
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,579
Why are we doing this?

1050
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,206
Do it.

1051
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,834
Now.

1052
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,130
Goodness.

1053
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,091
Go on.

1054
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,594
I don't want to. I'm scared.

1055
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,765
There's nothing to be scared about.

1056
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,643
Kang-ho.

1057
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:45,772
I'm just teaching you
things you don't know.

1058
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:49,359
Just like teaching you how to cook
and what to do at the bank.

1059
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:52,987
I'm teaching you things that
you'll need to know in life.

1060
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,864
When will I need to do this?

1061
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,700
Later.

1062
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,911
Much later.

1063
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,871
So let's try it.

1064
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,880
Goodness.

1065
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,633
Goodness.

1066
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,971
Goodness.

1067
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:23,726
Goodness.

1068
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:29,857
Goodness.

1069
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,876
What did I tell you to do?

1070
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,152
You need to get up too.

1071
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,121
You must be heartbroken.

1072
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:31,127
You must be heartbroken.

1073
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,131
-Mom.
-You must be heartbroken.

1074
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:42,430
Thank you for coming here
and offering your condolences.

1075
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,227
Did she have an illness?

1076
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,274
"She had cancer."

1077
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,653
She had cancer.

1078
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,245
Well done, my son.

1079
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,841
-Done.
-Done.

1080
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,598
Let's put him in there too.

1081
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,266
What? Who?

1082
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:28,893
Dad.

1083
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,478
Dad?

1084
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:31,562
Yes.

1085
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,942
Just like that photo,
let's add him to the new photo too.

1086
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,735
Then we'll be together.

1087
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,906
Sure, let's do that.

1088
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,830
But I still live

1089
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:52,792
in the memories
I shared with you and Father.

1090
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:06,556
"In the memories."

1091
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,272
Inside?

1092
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:17,984
Mom, what's wrong?

1093
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:46,554
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1094
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,159
I want to find out the reason why

1095
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,912
I had to attend law school.

1096
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:13,831
Beg him, or you'll go to jail!

1097
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,542
Once you study hard
and become a prosecutor,

1098
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,003
no one will be able to
look down on you or bully you.

1099
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,588
That's true power.

1100
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:24,842
You want me to become a cowardly snob
who'd do anything to get my way.
