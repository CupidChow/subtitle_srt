00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,908
I told you. I'm not a churchgoer.

8
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,494
My son became a prosecutor
because I prayed

9
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,661
to a shaman.

10
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,206
Goodness. A shaman?

11
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,708
Ma'am, that's just superstition.

12
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,128
Your descendants will suffer
bad luck if you stand on a threshold.

13
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,132
But that's also a superstition, right?

14
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,384
In that case,

15
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,596
-I'll just leave a Sunday bulletin.
-Okay.

16
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,556
-I wish you well.
-Thank you.

00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,896

JOU-RI

22
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,790
Unbeknownst to me,
these articles are making headlines.

23
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:08,378
I wonder what
tomorrow's headline will bring.

24
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,256
I'll find out who's behind this.

25
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,091
No need for that. It's obvious.

26
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,969
What's the first thing politicians do

27
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,512
when they gain power?

28
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,764
They go after companies like mine.

29
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,726
What can I do?
The presidential election is coming up.

30
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,230
They have to create a distraction
if they want to save themselves.

31
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:31,192
Still, they crossed the line.
Don't you think?

32
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,029
Why did they use
such an unflattering photo of me?

33
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,030
Darn it.

34
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,949
Look at that double chin.

35
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:39,993
Jeez.

36
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,247
Don't worry, sir.

37
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,791
I'll take care of it.

38
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,085
Right. And…

39
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,175
This is my husband's old phone.

40
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,761
There's a recording of a call
he had with Woobyeok Construction.

41
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,847
Do you want to be my son?

42
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,358
Sorry?

43
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,279
I'd really love that.

44
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,783
How great would it be
if I had a reliable son like you?

45
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,204
Then I'd hand over my business to you,

46
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,375
move to a place like Hawaii,
and fish every day.

47
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,297
But my one and only grandson is a hellion.

48
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,424
Oh, right.

49
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,801
What do you mean
things will get troublesome?

50
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,762
Right. Well…

51
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,641
Due to the extreme public outrage,

52
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,435
I'm afraid Mr. Park won't be able
to get a reduced sentence.

53
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,937
That's what it was?

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,980
Don't worry about that.

55
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,650
I was going to get rid of him
after this stint.

56
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,361
Thank you for all your hard work.

57
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,239
Let me know if you need anything.

58
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,200
Do you want another new car?

59
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,953
Oh, that reminds me.

60
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,080
How's your new house? Do you like it?

61
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,165
It was a very generous gift.

62
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,378
Thank you so much.

63
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,838
I'll work even harder.

64
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,174
Forget it. Just keep up the good work.

65
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,803
Do better, and you'll make me go broke.

66
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,765
I'll get going then.

67
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,817
Hold on.

68
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,569
You seemed to have forgotten something.

69
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,244
Put that down.

70
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,920
People laugh when I tell them
I play baseball.

71
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,465
They think it's ridiculous
when I can't even run.

72
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,218
But it's simple.

73
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,554
If I hit a home run, I don't need to run.

74
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,725
Or I can strike out.

75
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,394
That's how I've lived my life.

76
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,937
Hit a home run or strikeout.

77
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,151
So that was the secret.

78
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,486
That was how you grew

79
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,448
Yongra Construction
into Woobyeok Group so quickly.

80
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,284
I'll keep that in mind.

81
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,203
"Hit a home run

82
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,122
or strikeout."

83
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,005
Gosh, that hurt.

84
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,760
Jeez, you've improved a lot.
You weren't so good not too long ago.

85
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,094
I practiced a lot.

86
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,931
To be honest, I've always liked baseball.

87
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,771
But I could neither play with my friends
nor watch them on TV.

88
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,189
Why not?

89
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,235
-Because I wanted to meet you.
-What?

90
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,155
How would I ever have met you
had I not become a prosecutor?

91
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,324
I feel the same way.

92
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:11,954
It'd be wonderful
if I had a reliable father like you.

93
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:19,921
All right.

94
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,466
You can address me
as your father from now on.

95
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,804
May I really do that?

96
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,305
Look at you.

97
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,809
I've never seen you smile
from ear to ear before.

98
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,148
Then could we go to a sauna together?

99
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:40,942
A sauna?

100
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,195
It was my lifelong dream
to scrub my father's back.

101
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,782
"Father"?

102
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,911
So this is how it feels.

103
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,037
I love it.

104
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,706
All right.

105
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,127
I'll let my son scrub my back!

106
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,093
"Hit a home run or a strikeout."

107
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,782
Hey!

108
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,173
Please identify the source

109
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,592
and look into the related articles,
organizations, and victims.

110
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,718
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,264
Sir.

112
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,599
This is truly unfair!

113
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,853
My son would never kill anyone!

114
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,189
That wealthy chairman's grandson

115
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,649
framed my son!

116
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,610
-You know that!
-Sir!

117
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,196
All you need to say

118
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,200
is that my son isn't the murderer!

119
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,368
-Please stop--
-Sir!

120
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,579
Please, I beg you!

121
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,831
-Please!
-Please let go, sir.

122
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,209
-Jeez.
-Goodness.

123
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,544
You impudent bastard!

124
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,214
Don't you have a father?

125
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,644
No, I don't.

126
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,811
But…

127
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,315
does having one change anything?

128
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,322
You can't even help your son.
You're powerless and incompetent.

129
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,199
What did you say?

130
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,786
Oh, dear…

131
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,124
JOU-RI

132
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,460
Goodness…

133
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,548
Your call could not be completed
and will be transferred to…

134
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,424
He must be busy.

135
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,179
Of course. You can't slack off
when you're doing important work.

136
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,276
Right. The ribs.

137
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,667
The seasoned vegetables,

138
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,253
stir-fried glass noodles, pancakes, and…

139
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,046
All done, right?

140
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,469
Gosh, I can't reach it.

141
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:21,329
How did you hurt your back?

142
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,957
Those pain relief patches only smell.

143
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,627
When you've hurt your back,

144
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,130
the best remedy is acupuncture.

145
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,883
No, I'm okay.

146
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,136
These pain relief patches
will work just fine.

147
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,557
A long time ago,
my uncle fell down the stairs once.

148
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,102
He thought he would be fine
just applying pain relief patches.

149
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,729
Then he became paralyzed and bedridden.

150
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,857
He developed bedsores
that made his flesh rot.

151
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,776
It was terrible.

152
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,072
Why would you say something like that?

153
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,366
I'm just saying.

154
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,535
How does your stomach feel?

155
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,037
Do you feel nauseous?

156
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,374
Or does it feel as if you've been stabbed?

157
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,045
How would she know
how it feels to be stabbed?

158
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,339
Wouldn't she know?

159
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,885
I think it's just indigestion
from tasting all the food while cooking.

160
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,845
This will do the trick.

161
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,472
A long time ago,

162
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,601
my aunt kept downing that drink
whenever she had indigestion.

163
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,020
She passed away
after getting a hole in her stomach.

164
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,899
They opened her up,
and her organs had all melted.

165
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,779
What the hell is the matter with you?

166
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,240
Why do you keep rambling nonsense?

167
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,909
I'm just saying.

168
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,911
Don't worry.

169
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,957
My baby.

170
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,335
Right.

171
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,505
I'm thinking of naming our puppy Kang-ho.

172
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,548
What?

173
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,924
Why that name?

174
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,301
If you think about it,

175
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,637
everyone with that name seems to prosper.

176
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,182
There's Song Kang-ho
and there's Choi Kang-ho.

177
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,726
I want our puppy to prosper too.

178
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:13,065
A prosperous dog will still be a dog.
It won't turn into a tiger.

179
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,609
A tiger?

180
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,111
Oh, my.

181
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,864
Let's name our dog Tiger.

182
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,658
Then it'll become a tiger, won't it?

183
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,203
Tiger, roar for me.

184
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,290
Roar for me.

185
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,666
Don't mind her.

186
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,297
So tell me. How's our prosecutor doing?

187
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:42,928
He's never visited
ever since moving to Seoul.

188
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,808
He actually called in the afternoon
and said he'd come visit.

189
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,977
But I dissuaded him.

190
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,563
He has trials lined up back to back,

191
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,608
so I told him to just rest on the weekend.

192
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,609
I see.

193
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,111
I tracked down the IP address of the posts

194
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,197
that were posted on the media sites.

195
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,657
This is footage from an internet cafe
in Sangdo-dong.

196
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,578
I believe they're exposing
Woobyeok Group's corruption to the press.

197
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,460
HA-YOUNG

198
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,089
Did he reject your call again?

199
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,299
Yes.

200
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,677
Should I call one more time?

201
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,887
Hey.

202
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,516
Forget it. Just end it.

203
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,645
I get that he's busy,
but he's been ignoring you for days.

204
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,941
I'm pretty sure he's seeing someone else.

205
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,108
Hey--

206
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,446
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

207
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,906
Hey, are you okay?

208
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,324
-Here--
-Oh, no.

209
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,327
Goodness, what's wrong?

210
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,828
My goodness!

211
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,747
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

212
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,040
I'm so sorry.

213
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,084
Hurry up and apologize.

214
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,585
I'm so sorry.

215
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,754
Do you not know what I do?

216
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,339
Sorry?

217
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,258
I'm a ballerina.

218
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,220
Is that the best apology
after almost cutting off my toe?

219
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,347
Right.

220
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,394
I'm really sorry.

221
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,106
This is so annoying.

222
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,650
Let's go.

223
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,407
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,327
Are you okay?

225
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,996
Wait.

226
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,129
It's your turn now.

227
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,798
What?

228
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,593
Please apologize for kicking me.

229
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,136
Mi-joo, what's with you?

230
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,763
If you're that sensitive about your feet,
you shouldn't have come here.

231
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,141
-Have you gone crazy?
-No, ma'am.

232
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,143
Not yet.

233
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,605
But I will go crazy
if you don't apologize.

234
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,410
I won't apologize.

235
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,913
There.

236
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,664
What'll you do now?

237
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,584
What?

238
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,210
What?

239
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,464
I see.

240
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,217
In that case, it can't be helped.

241
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,728
She didn't hit you.

242
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,443
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

243
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,493
The last time I felt this satisfied

244
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,162
was when I got my first Brazilian waxing.

245
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,414
She shouldn't have provoked me.

246
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,291
But what are you going to do now?

247
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,462
-I won't vote for him.
-What do you mean?

248
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,421
Vote for whom?

249
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,007
Her dad will be running for president.

250
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,342
He'll never get my vote.

251
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,763
Sure. That's the worst you could do.

252
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,564
I'm going to open a small salon

253
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,900
with the money I've saved up.

254
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,361
-A salon?
-Yes.

255
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,074
I wanted to save up for two more years
and open up a big one in Seoul.

256
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,618
But I should look outside the city
or a shop-in-shop.

257
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,286
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

258
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,247
Me too. I want in.

259
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,165
-I'll chip in.
-Seriously?

260
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,627
I'll chip in so we can look
for a place on the outskirts of Seoul.

261
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,670
What do you say?

262
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,717
Sun-young, I would love that!

263
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,093
-Really?
-Yes!

264
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,052
Okay!

265
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,888
Then you can be the owner.

266
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,808
-What?
-I'll be the CEO.

267
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,976
What?

268
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,561
That's ridiculous.

269
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,355
-All right then.
-Okay.

270
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,940
I look forward to it, ma'am.

271
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,900
I'll do my best, Ms. CEO.

272
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,652
-Let me.
-You can speak casually.

273
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
MOM

274
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,573
Please excuse me for a minute, Ms. CEO.

275
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,491
-Sure, go take the call.
-Thank you.

276
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,328
Hi, Mom.

277
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,873
I'm not your mom.

278
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,293
Who told you
you could use grandma's phone?

279
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,130
Grandma is dead.

280
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,967
What? What are you saying?

281
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,927
Why is she dead?

282
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,096
She ran out.

283
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,264
"Ran out"?

284
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,348
Yes.

285
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,517
Goodness.

286
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,811
She ran out of cards,

287
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,190
so she lost the match and all her money.

288
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,443
She's as good as dead for this round.

289
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,694
Hey!

290
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,987
You startled me!

291
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,074
-Who's that?
-Mom.

292
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,158
Mom?

293
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,868
Do you mean

294
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,036
Mi-joo?

295
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,830
Your youngest daughter who's in the US?

296
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,207
Give that to me.

297
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,249
Hello?

298
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,711
Mom, didn't I tell you
not to play cards with the kids around?

299
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,670
What?

300
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,090
You want to send me money?

301
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:15,177
Gosh, you don't need to send me
your hard-earned money.

302
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,723
Jeez, seems like Mi-joo is trying to
send you money. How lucky.

303
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,892
Her daughter sends her money

304
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,938
while we work like dogs
to buy food for our incarcerated son.

305
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,524
Why is my life so miserable?

306
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,025
I'm not sending you any money.

307
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,985
-Would you like me to read your fortune?
-And I won't be

308
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,196
sending you any money for the time being.

309
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,115
I'm opening a nail salon.

310
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,074
What?

311
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,201
Your husband is opening
a nail salon for you?

312
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,079
Goodness. That's great.

313
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,038
What?

314
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,498
Good job.

315
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,792
"Nail"? What's a "nail salon"?

316
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,460
Why did you call?

317
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,045
Ye-jin is the one who called.

318
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,090
I told you not to give them your phone.

319
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,509
Watching videos
will worsen their eyesight.

320
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,095
If you're that concerned,
you can raise them instead.

321
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,056
Right. What happened to that bastard?

322
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,433
What bastard?

323
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,894
The father of your children!

324
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,895
Goodness.

325
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,150
Have you found him?

326
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,528
Didn't we agree
not to talk about that anymore?

327
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,364
And I chose not to look for him.

328
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,824
It's over between us.

329
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,118
What are you talking about?

330
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,079
What will you say to the people here?

331
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,999
What will you tell your kids?

332
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,043
They think you're working hard in the US

333
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,628
and will send for them.

334
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,339
So why did you have to lie to them?

335
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,009
Whatever. Just say that I got divorced.

336
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,344
You want me to tell them that you,
alongside Jin-joo and Seon-joo,

337
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,471
are divorced as well?

338
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,016
Is our family cursed or something?

339
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,061
Goodness. Do you know
how embarrassing it is?

340
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,689
You're the one who started it all.

341
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,441
I never got a divorce.

342
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,401
But he left you for another woman.

343
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,195
At least I was married when I had kids!

344
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,280
-Hang up!
-Hang up!

345
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,284
This damned brat.

346
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,830
Why does her life
have to be so miserable like mine?

347
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,165
Goodness, you startled me.

348
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,792
Who had kids out of wedlock?

349
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,337
We were talking about a drama.

350
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,302
Sam-sik will be discharged soon, right?

351
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,638
What should I do?

352
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,433
Should we carry out a ritual
when he gets discharged?

353
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,060
Just pack up and leave.

354
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,520
There's absolutely no ritual
that could fix this.

355
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,774
There's no deity who can change his fate.

356
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,025
So just leave.

357
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,319
-Let me.
-It's okay.

358
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,071
Look who's here!

359
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,574
It's the woman
who's been blessed with everything.

360
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,953
Prosecutor Choi's mother is here!

361
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,246
-Goodness.
-Hello.

362
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,331
-Gosh, you didn't have to.
-Hello.

363
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,458
-Come on in.
-It's okay.

364
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,710
I have to leave for Seoul.

365
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,546
I made geotjeori
and a few side dishes. Enjoy.

366
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,133
-So that's why you're all dolled up.
-Goodness.

367
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,594
-You're going to see your son.
-Yes.

368
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,221
What's wrong with your arm?

369
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,306
You seemed to be limping too.

370
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,935
I fell in the kitchen yesterday,
but I'm okay.

371
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,479
You're such a doting mother.

372
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,773
A successful prosecutor like him

373
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,526
must have good
and expensive food all the time.

374
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,695
Still, it's his birthday.

375
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,240
-Is it? Then you should go.
-Yes.

376
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,950
-Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

377
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,369
Please enjoy the food.

378
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,121
Ye-jin and Seo-jin, eat lots.

379
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,998
-Okay, goodbye.
-Okay, goodbye.

380
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,749
-Goodbye.
-Have a safe trip.

381
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,042
-Bye.
-Gosh.

382
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,170
How can I enjoy her food
when it looks like that?

383
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,588
It's tasty.

384
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,424
Try some.

385
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,383
Here.

386
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,135
I'm on a diet.

387
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,303
Hold on.

388
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,559
If it's Kang-ho's birthday,
then it's Mi-joo's birthday too.

389
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,853
You're right.

390
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,189
Goodness.

391
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,235
You brat. You should've told me
it's your birthday today!

392
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,030
What's your bank account number?

393
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,575
So which building and unit is it?

394
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,535
I'm calling him right now.

395
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,454
Why isn't he picking up?

396
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,041
Sir, it's me.

397
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:18,003
I'm at the address you sent me.
But which building and unit is it?

398
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:20,922
Sorry?

399
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,591
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

400
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,968
What are you doing?

401
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,970
Pull up over there.

402
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,930
-Pull up.
-Okay.

403
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,265
One minute please.

404
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,274
You have a call from the lobby.

405
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,611
Yes?

406
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,405
Hello, sir. This is the security office.

407
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,408
Your mother is here.

408
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,035
Tell her I'm not home.

409
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:50,994
Sorry?

410
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,246
Tell her you're not home?

411
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,628
But she brought a bunch of food.

412
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,547
Hello?

413
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,055
You see, Mr. Choi is…

414
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,600
What is it? Is he not home yet?

415
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,729
I understand. He's one of
the top prosecutors in this country.

416
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,606
Of course he's busy.

417
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,650
I should've called in advance.

418
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,401
In that case,

419
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,405
could you please give him these for me?

420
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,741
Goodness.

421
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,160
-Thank you.
-No problem.

422
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,622
Sir.

423
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,083
Do you see him at times?

424
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,293
Yes, every now and then.

425
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,296
How is he? Does he look okay?

426
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,965
Does he look healthy?

427
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,927
Yes. He's such a handsome man

428
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,304
who takes great care of himself.

429
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,518
Has he ever gotten drunk
and looked depressed?

430
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,688
No, I don't think so.

431
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,191
That's good. Goodbye.

432
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,234
Goodbye.

433
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,153
One minute.

434
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,070
Sorry?

435
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,534
If anything seems off,

436
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,537
please give me a call.

437
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,080
-Okay.
-Thank you.

438
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,666
-No problem.
-Goodbye.

439
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,130
I wonder if she's eaten.

440
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,132
She seems to be in pain.

441
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,678
So what if he's a prosecutor?

442
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,513
He's so impudent.

443
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,021
CHOCO PIE

444
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,906
He's just busy. That's all.

445
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,046
With a 33% approval rate,

446
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,881
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo
defeated Park Gil-ung,

447
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,717
former chairman of Bareun Hanguk Party and
a leading candidate of the opposing camp,

448
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,220
and established himself
as the next presidential candidate.

449
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,723
Assemblyman Oh, who led
the ruling party to a landslide victory

450
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,559
as former committee chairman
of the Jeilmirae Party,

451
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,811
emerged as a leading
presidential candidate

452
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,813
through his election
and the party's victory.

453
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,690
BECOME A PASSIONATE JUDICIAL OFFICER

454
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,401
Do you know why people bad-mouth
judicial officers of this country?

455
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,112
Because all they know is to study.

456
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,867
But studying is merely a talent

457
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,744
just like singing or drawing.

458
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,080
It doesn't make you superior to others.

459
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:45,543
Perhaps, those who only know
how to study could be the most inferior.

460
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,503
Let's be honest.

461
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,296
You don't have friends.

462
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,006
Aren't you all outcasts?

463
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,803
But those idiots
act as if being a prosecutor or a judge

464
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:59,015
is the most powerful right
a human could have.

465
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:00,976
That's why people bash them.

466
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,896
A true judicial officer must be able
to both think and feel.

467
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,318
Those with no friends
or empathy toward others

468
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,154
studied hard to prosecute, defend,

469
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,739
and judge others?

470
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,242
No wonder the world
has turned out this way.

471
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,079
No wonder only the weak
and the innocent are victimized.

472
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,000
Let me ask you
future judicial officers for a favor

473
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,210
as an old, former judicial officer.

474
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,381
We've been overworking our brains
for far too long.

475
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,384
So from now on, let's stop doing that

476
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,846
and use our passionate hearts
to guide us instead.

477
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,307
OH TAE-SOO

478
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,686
That's enough. Get going now.

479
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:49,149
Tae-soo, this is Choi Kang-ho.

480
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,443
He entered the institute
at the top of his class.

481
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,571
He's a talent who's always
placed first in his class.

482
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,989
Is that so?

483
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,409
-Are we alumni?
-Yes.

484
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,119
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

485
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,789
With your grades, it'll only be
a matter of time until you become a judge.

486
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,959
I actually aspire to become a prosecutor.

487
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,836
You're his role model.

488
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,424
He's an avid fan of yours
who has memorized

489
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,259
all your books and theses.

490
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,302
Is that so?

491
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,137
I'm honored.

492
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,722
Not at all.

493
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,225
Goodbye, sir.

494
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,403
Have we met before?

495
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:36,946
You look familiar.

496
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,659
No, sir. We've never met.

497
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,328
But…

498
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,871
Actually,

499
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,332
-you've met my father--
-Dad.

500
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,502
We're late. Let's go.

501
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,878
Okay.

502
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,797
I need to go.

503
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,423
See you next time.

504
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,093
Yes, sir. I'll make sure we meet again.

505
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,183
She's so pretty.

506
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,143
You're so pretty.

507
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,254
I'm not interested, so get lost.

508
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,716
You'll be interested soon.

509
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,435
Have you gone insane?

510
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,854
I didn't do any drugs.

511
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,564
Do you have proof?

512
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,734
This is driving me crazy.

513
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,074
You're going to regret this.

514
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,326
I won't let this slide.

515
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,454
I'll get all of you sacked.

516
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,289
You can take your time with that.

517
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,582
What's this?

518
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,839
It's just medicine.

519
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,133
Exactly. What kind of medicine?

520
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,220
Please answer.

521
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,015
It's for my panic disorder.

522
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,142
You have panic disorder?

523
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,810
It's not serious.

524
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,191
Wait! What are you doing?

525
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,817
Hey! What are you doing?

526
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,985
-Hey!
-Stay still.

527
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,195
-You lunatic!
-Stay still.

528
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,613
Wait! No!

529
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,407
Do you know how expensive that is?

530
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,201
No! That's a limited edition!

531
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,994
-They don't sell it anymore.
-Stay still!

532
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,788
-Please!
-The urinalysis came out.

533
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,247
They all tested negative.

534
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,220
I believe there was a mistake
in the report we received.

535
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,262
I'm sorry.

536
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,263
You're sorry?

537
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,348
Are you?

538
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,811
That's all you can say after ruining this?

539
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,270
I'll compensate for that.

540
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,735
My dad was a former prosecutor
so I know how much you make.

541
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,656
Don't be ridiculous.

542
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,992
This is more expensive than your life.

543
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,415
Let's go.

544
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,461
Will it be okay?

545
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,340
It hurts, but I'm okay.

546
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,175
No, I'm talking about us.

547
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,888
It says here that she's the daughter
of Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo,

548
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,266
a former chief prosecutor.

549
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,225
What?

550
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,229
How may we help you?

551
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,986
I shouldn't have hit you.

552
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,821
That's okay.

553
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,074
It's all right. He deserved it.

554
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,371
But by any chance,
will my time here be recorded?

555
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,040
You won't call my parents, will you?

556
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,462
It was my first time clubbing.

557
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,426
Make that the second or third.

558
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,387
As for my panic disorder,

559
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,889
it's really not that bad.

560
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,931
I just…

561
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,058
have trouble sleeping.

562
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,394
I'm just taking it
to prevent it from worsening.

563
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,939
So let's pretend today never happened.

564
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,610
You don't need
to compensate for the bag either.

565
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,237
I'm sick of it,
so I was going to throw it away anyway.

566
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,865
Then I'll assume that you understand.

567
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,867
I'll go now.

568
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,993
Goodbye.

569
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,463
THE HOUSE OF LOVE SHARING, CULTURE DAY
WITH ASSEMBLYMAN OH TAE-SOO

570
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,131
You and me

571
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,133
We should be friends

572
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:11,095
And get along

573
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,391
Pinky promise

574
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:19,354
Promise me

575
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,314
Friends

576
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,149
Don't fight

577
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:26,569
Let's love each other

578
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,698
Pinky promise

579
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,953
Promise me

580
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,874
Come here. Hurry up.

581
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,379
Are you crazy?

582
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,714
How could you come here?

583
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,718
We agreed to forget about it.

584
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,179
I got you a new bag.

585
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,263
What?

586
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,267
What is this?

587
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,771
You actually got a new one?
It was a limited edition.

588
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,817
What?

589
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,860
Are you serious?

590
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,321
No way.

591
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,865
What's this?

592
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,743
Where's the bag? This is just a dust bag…

593
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,830
Sir.

594
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,500
You do know how well-respected
your father is, right?

595
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,714
The people trust and support him
due to his humility.

596
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,883
So should you carry such an expensive bag

597
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,469
and go clubbing with your wealthy friends?

598
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,849
Stop tainting his reputation
and carry that from now on.

599
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,184
Who are you to tell me what to do?

600
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,649
What is this?

601
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,656
Jujubes are said to be
natural tranquilizers.

602
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,576
You said your symptoms weren't severe,

603
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,661
so don't take any medication.

604
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,705
Just have some jujube tea before bed.

605
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,169
I went to the marketplace in the morning
to get them, so don't throw them away.

606
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,174
What the…

607
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,391
Dad.

608
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,646
-Happy birthday to you.
-Thanks.

609
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,565
I'm glad my daughter--

610
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,073
Who is he?

611
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,160
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho.

612
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,164
You must be surprised.

613
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,374
He's your birthday gift.

614
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,210
Your future son-in-law.

615
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,211
What?

616
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,226
You brat.

617
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,729
What took you so long
to introduce such a fine, young man?

618
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,567
All right. Have a seat.

619
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,320
That's right.

620
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,030
Judicial Research and Training Institute.

621
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,616
No wonder you seemed familiar.

622
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,995
It must've been hard

623
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,832
to grow up without a father.

624
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,085
But he grew up so well
and became a competent prosecutor.

625
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,379
Even I'm proud of you.

626
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,465
I still have a long way to go.
I hope to learn from you.

627
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,508
All right.

628
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,009
I hope we get along.

629
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,761
Yes, sir.

630
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,014
It's getting late.

631
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,433
How about you ladies give us some privacy?

632
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,227
Why?

633
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,563
What will you talk about without us?

634
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,191
Men have things
to talk about among themselves.

635
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,818
-Right?
-Yes, you're right.

636
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,986
Exactly.

637
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,865
Don't make him drink too much.

638
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,492
-It's okay.
-Look at that.

639
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,828
A daughter will always
put her boyfriend first.

640
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,371
Honey, take her.

641
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,374
-Call me when you get home.
-I will.

642
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,668
See you again, ma'am.

643
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,627
Bye, Dad.

644
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:12,962
Bye.

645
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,397
So what will it be?

646
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,232
Sorry?

647
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,026
The reason for your breakup.

648
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,111
Another woman?

649
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,406
Or do you want to be sent abroad for work?

650
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,118
Or I could make you a corrupt prosecutor
and send you to prison.

651
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,579
I can't suddenly kill you off.

652
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,046
You reek of something.

653
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,548
Ever since we first met.

654
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,592
What could it be?

655
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,719
Is it the smell of dirt

656
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,512
since you came from the bottom up?

657
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,767
-Father.
-"Father"?

658
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,731
You're funny.

659
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:21,822
Listen carefully.

660
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,367
You two will break up within a week.

661
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,205
And Ha-young will marry into Dosang Group
as I had planned.

662
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,377
"Father"?

663
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:39,006
Someone like you can never call me Father.

664
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,969
Though you must not understand
since you don't have a father.

665
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,236
Kang-ho.

666
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,238
What's all this?

667
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,866
Don't tell me you're seeing another woman.

668
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,204
Hold on! My foot.

669
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,207
I hurt my toe today.

670
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,251
Let me in for just a minute.

671
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,844
Kang-ho. It's not true, right?

672
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,973
Ta-da.

673
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,975
I even got you a birthday gift.

674
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,354
-Go home.
-How are you so heartless?

675
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,190
Are you really ending it with me?

676
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,984
I'm doing this not to do that.

677
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,945
But if you keep doing this,
it'll hinder my plan.

678
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,488
Your plan?

679
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,866
What is it?

680
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,080
DNA TEST RESULT

681
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,667
Corporate sales, which were to be reduced
to the global economic downturn,

682
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,670
have actually increased
by 21.5% compared to last year.

683
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,090
Here are the documents
I told you about on…

684
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,144
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY: 99.9%

685
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,188
Home run!

686
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,650
This is a true home run.

687
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,236
A walk-off grand slam with two outs.

688
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,239
So you're saying

689
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:32,036
that Hwang Soo-hyun gave birth
to Oh Tae-soo's baby?

690
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,079
Correct.

691
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,205
That idiot.

692
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,458
He had no idea what was coming

693
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,293
when he betrayed me for Dosang Group.

694
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,754
So what if he steals a base?

695
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,381
He just hit into a double play.

696
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,012
He doesn't know about the child yet.

697
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,767
She was afraid that he'd harm her
and the child if he found out.

698
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,270
So she quit and hid as soon as
she found out about her pregnancy.

699
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,690
A secret about him that
he doesn't even know exists.

700
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,655
This is…

701
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,408
very valuable information.

702
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,409
Right?

703
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,123
By the way, why are you giving me this?

704
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,460
Isn't that why you took me in?

705
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,880
If you have the future president
in your hands,

706
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,091
Woobyeok Group will be invincible.

707
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,301
However,

708
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,054
this isn't the original paper.

709
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,434
You must want a favor from me.

710
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,731
Please take me in as your real son.

711
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,734
What did you say?

712
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,822
I want to become your legal son.

713
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,783
Then as your son,

714
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,952
I will marry Oh Tae-soo's daughter.

715
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,580
You'll have Oh Tae-soo.

716
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,248
Oh Tae-soo will have me.

717
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,209
And I'll have a father.

718
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,797
None of us will be able
to betray one another.

719
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,132
We'll become a true family.

720
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,852
What if I refuse?

721
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,398
What can a son
who's been abandoned by his father do?

722
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,152
I'll have to find a new father.

723
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,247
A father never abandons his child.

724
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,671
She was a smart secretary of mine
who knew how the company worked.

725
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,048
I entrusted you with her

726
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,218
so you'd find a way to save my company.

727
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,846
But instead, you knocked her up.

728
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,431
Where's Hwang Soo-hyun?

729
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:03,145
How will you lead the country
if you're this slow?

730
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:08,192
Hwang Soo-hyun isn't
the one you should meet.

731
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,944
It's Choi Kang-ho.

732
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,322
If that kid takes this information

733
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,991
and sides with the Bareun Hanguk Party,

734
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,786
it'll be the end for both of us.

735
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:21,997
Let's be honest.

736
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:26,752
You and I have gotten our hands dirty
for the past 30 years.

737
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,170
Don't you agree?

738
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,006
Judging by

739
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,343
how he even found out about
Hwang Soo-hyun,

740
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:38,264
he must have many cards up his sleeve.

741
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,725
I heard you opposed his relationship
with your daughter.

742
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:46,355
It seems to have hurt his pride greatly.

743
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:52,611
I believe that's when he started
digging up dirt on you.

744
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,658
How about we let them
get back together first?

745
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,494
As for the parts you believe he lacks,

746
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,079
I'll fill them in.

747
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,622
What do you mean?

748
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm going to

749
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,627
adopt Choi Kang-ho as my son

750
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,463
who will have the right
to inherit my business.

751
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:18,887
Will you get rid of the original copy
of the DNA test result in front of me?

752
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,560
Come on. Getting rid of that paper
won't change anything.

753
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,519
Right?

754
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,315
He'll get rid of them
as if they never existed.

755
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,151
My son will do that.

756
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,155
Right?

757
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,127
You'll be safer there than in Korea.

758
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,511
No one will be able to find you.

759
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,017
Don't worry too much. It'll all work out.

760
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,144
Thank you for the drink.

761
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,657
I took care of it.

762
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,833
We finally have our own nail salon!

763
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,129
NAIL &amp; NAIL

764
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,089
Sun-young…

765
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,467
Why are you crying?

766
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:30,060
Why would you cry
on such a delightful day?

767
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,021
You're the one who cried first.

768
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,692
You know what?

769
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,653
I'm going to make a ton of money

770
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,490
and bring my kids back.

771
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,579
I'm going to buy them

772
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,456
whatever food they want

773
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,041
and dress them in all the pretty clothes.

774
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,169
I will.

775
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,385
It's not smelly, right?

776
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,471
It's thanks to our homemade doenjang.

777
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,223
Have some aged kimchi too. It's tasty.

778
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,105
It would've been perfect
if there was skate.

779
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,107
Skate and celebrations go hand in hand.

780
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,152
I'm sure someone will bring some.

781
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,864
Gosh, do you hear those two kids?

782
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,283
Kids these days learn so quickly.

783
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,578
They learn too quickly.

784
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,123
I suddenly miss my late mother.

785
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,670
-It'll be fun
-This is too salty.

786
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,964
to hit a ball with this.

787
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,133
This is too bland.

788
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,051
Do you want some?

789
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,846
Even a dog doesn't want it.

790
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,225
Goodness. Young-soon is so lucky.

791
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:57,356
She went through so much
to raise her son by herself.

792
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,902
And now, he's a prosecutor
and an assemblyman's son-in-law.

793
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,071
Things are looking up for her.

794
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,324
It's more than just that.

795
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,535
Her social status will change.

796
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,788
Social status, my foot.

797
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,750
And if that's the case,
she should've hired a catering service.

798
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,627
Look at this.

799
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,463
How will we feed
all those people with that much meat?

800
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:25,092
We can slaughter a pig if need be.

801
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:29,137
There's no need to worry about that
when she has a pig farm.

802
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,306
Nice one.

803
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,599
You must be tired.

804
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,518
-Hello.
-Let me do it.

805
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,686
Gosh, you reek.

806
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,437
Go wash up.

807
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,731
Yes, leave this up to us.

808
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,192
Go get dressed up.

809
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:46,154
Will you greet the assemblyman's daughter
while looking like that?

810
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,239
You little…

811
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,992
I told you not to tell anyone.

812
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,536
She also told me to keep it a secret.

813
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,704
Right.

814
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,832
Well, it's good news, so…

815
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,211
By the way, who's the assemblyman?

816
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:05,716
My son's colleague told me the news,

817
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,093
but I don't know who it is exactly.

818
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,639
Anyway, please don't say these things
in front of Kang-ho.

819
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,558
-Okay?
-Of course.

820
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,144
It's great that he's marrying
an assemblyman's daughter.

821
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,897
But honestly, it's not great news for us.

822
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,860
To be honest,
we didn't benefit from Kang-ho

823
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,988
going to law school
and becoming a prosecutor, did we?

824
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,074
Darn it.

825
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,535
We could've gotten that done at a mill.

826
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,956
Look at that old man overworking himself.

827
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,082
At that age, he…

828
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,835
Never mind. Keep going.

829
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:46,214
You weren't talking about me, were you?

830
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,550
Hey, Sung-ae!

831
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,178
-Go ahead and hit.
-She's bitter about

832
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,888
how Sam-sik was incarcerated for theft.

833
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,809
She begged Kang-ho
not to put her son behind bars,

834
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,062
but he refused to listen.

835
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,231
She's still bitter about that.

836
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,567
Just let her be.

837
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,610
Okay.

838
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,325
What's the big deal about marrying
an assemblyman's daughter?

839
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,581
I should go home.

840
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,877
My dog hasn't been eating much
due to her labor pains.

841
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,880
When's the date?

842
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,093
Seeing how she's spotting,
it'll be today or tomorrow.

843
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,220
No, I'm talking about Sam-sik.

844
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:39,351
I'm going to ask Kang-ho to help him
get a job when he comes today.

845
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,398
Where are the mung beans? There they are.

846
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,650
Move.

847
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,735
I know Kang-ho likes mung bean pancakes.

848
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,584
SILLIM FRESH RAW FISH

849
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,673
REJECT

850
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,600
My head hurts.

851
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,902
You didn't have to come.

852
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,988
I should meet her at least once.

853
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,532
After all, she's your mother.

854
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,661
And I can drive when you feel tired.

855
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,830
Oh, right.

856
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,250
I'm just going to get
a five-carat diamond ring.

857
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,544
Smaller ones are trendier nowadays.

858
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,257
Only those who want to come off as wealthy

859
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,801
go for big rings.

860
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,263
And my dad's presidential election
is coming up as well.

861
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,437
Darn it.

862
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:11,902
What?

863
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,737
You got 0.5 carats?

864
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,199
Only big department stores
in Seoul have them.

865
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,453
-There's a warranty in there too.
-A warranty?

866
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,330
In there. Underneath.

867
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,166
Come on. Stay still.

868
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,795
The gem sure looks huge.

869
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,506
Goodness. 0.5 carats?

870
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,674
Wait. Don't touch it.

871
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,843
-I wasn't going to.
-You look nice.

872
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:44,226
It would've been wonderful
had Kang-ho and Mi-joo ended up together.

873
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,604
Remember?

874
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,232
When they were kids,

875
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,944
we promised to become in-laws.

876
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,238
Your daughter
is happily married in the US.

877
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:57,864
What are you saying?

878
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,574
I'm just saying.

879
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,369
By the way,

880
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,373
why did you get this
when they haven't set a date yet?

881
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,668
I also got a ring before I got married.

882
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:15,048
He brought a pig with the ring
around its neck when he proposed.

883
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,261
Gosh.

884
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,347
He would've been delighted
had he been alive.

885
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,313
You're all done.

886
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:39,698
You look like Brooke Shields.

887
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:45,161
No wonder Sam-sik is dexterous.
He takes after his mother.

888
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,290
Why are you bringing up
his dexterity right now?

889
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,835
What is this?
Is it a backhanded compliment?

890
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,880
What are you talking about?

891
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,341
It's only natural for your child
to take after you.

892
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,887
Sure, but we're talking about Sam-sik.

893
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,930
What do you think?

894
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,891
This is a set.

895
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,690
Goodness, you look gorgeous.

896
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,235
You look like a forsythia.

897
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,113
-Do I look okay?
-Yes.

898
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:23,158
She has a good eye
for picking out the right colors.

899
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,284
Tell me about it.

900
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,828
How did you think of picking such a color?

901
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,831
Vivid colors are on trend nowadays.

902
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,584
I don't want her to think that

903
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,086
I'm a hillbilly with no fashion sense.

904
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,548
How dare a woman
look down on her mother-in-law?

905
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,050
Who cares who her father is?

906
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,885
Reject her if you don't like her.

907
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,471
-Goodness.
-She's right.

908
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,308
I'm telling you,
whoever and whatever it may be,

909
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,936
you need to show them
who's boss from the get-go.

910
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,105
That way, they won't cause problems.

911
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,150
Be confident. Okay?

912
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,193
Okay.

913
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,196
Young-soon, come out!

914
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,490
I can't seem to find the drinks.

915
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,658
Coming!

916
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,329
Doesn't she look like a pickled radish?

917
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,916
She's gone.

918
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,960
Her hair looks great though.

919
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,420
I think she'll be looked down on.

920
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,589
Right?

921
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:23,677
-Pickled radish!
-Pickled radish!

922
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,595
-Pickled radish!
-Pickled radish!

923
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,015
-Goodness. We have no pickled radish.
-Kids always tell the truth.

924
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,350
Drink slowly.

925
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,810
Young-soon.

926
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,604
Come and have a drink with us.

927
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,772
Come sit.

928
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:39,150
I'll eat after I meet Kang-ho's fiancée.

929
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:40,902
Right.

930
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,822
It's your first time meeting her, right?

931
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,699
-Yes.
-Gosh.

932
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,619
Kang-ho shouldn't
be like this to his mother.

933
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,454
It's understandable.

934
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,958
His mother worked so hard to raise him,

935
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:59,713
so how could he only now
introduce his fiancée to her?

936
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,382
-He's very busy.
-Right.

937
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:07,595
To be honest,
I'm elated that he's visiting us today.

938
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,722
Of course.

939
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,181
-Hold on.
-What?

940
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,685
Do you think he's coming here

941
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,937
to take Young-soon to Seoul?

942
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,064
Seoul?

943
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,525
Think about it. Jong-ho did that too.

944
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,611
He took his parents to Seoul
before getting married.

945
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,739
-You're right.
-You're right.

946
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,867
That could happen.
So she's going to Seoul?

947
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,951
It makes sense.

948
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,912
After all, his future father-in-law
is an assemblyman.

949
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,041
Kang-ho wouldn't let his mother
keep living here all by herself.

950
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,126
What now?

951
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,336
Is this goodbye for us?

952
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,423
This is great.

953
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,384
What will happen to your farm then?

954
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,678
Leave your potato farm to me.

955
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,472
Oh, dear. Hold on.

956
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,806
Goodness.

957
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:57,854
You'll still help Sam-sik
get a job, right?

958
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,397
You will, right?

959
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,982
-Young-soon.
-Sung-ae.

960
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:04,360
Oh, no. Is this farewell?

961
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,570
He's here!

962
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,489
Kang-ho has arrived from Seoul!

963
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,700
-He's here.
-Kang-ho? He's here!

964
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,951
-Kang-ho!
-Hurry up!

965
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,578
-Kang-ho!
-Kang-ho!

966
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,288
-Kang-ho!
-Kang-ho!

967
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,750
-Goodness. Kang-ho!
-Goodness.

968
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,709
Goodness.

969
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,461
-Oh, my!
-Goodness!

970
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,837
She's so pretty.

971
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,422
How pretty.

972
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,468
You're here.

973
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,138
I'm the village head.

974
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,307
Hello.

975
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,606
We sincerely welcome you two to Jou-ri,

976
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:45,401
a village with clear water

977
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,238
and good-hearted people.

978
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,491
There's no body of water here.

979
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,619
And why do you sound like an AI?

980
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,995
You're unbelievable.

981
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,250
Everyone, this is Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho

982
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,877
and her fiancée,
an assemblyman's daughter.

983
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,295
Let's all bow… No.

984
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,673
Give them a round of applause.

985
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,092
I told you not to mention her father.

986
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,137
It must've been a long trip.

987
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,555
Come on in.

988
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,348
-Come on.
-Go in.

989
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,308
-Goodness.
-Hello.

990
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:21,062
-She's pretty.
-Behave.

991
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,480
Come on.

992
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,815
You must be hungry.

993
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,234
Let's eat first.

994
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,570
-I have something to tell you.
-Gosh.

995
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,321
What's the rush?

996
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,283
Let's eat first and talk later.

997
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,618
-Come here.
-Ma'am.

998
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,829
You're so beautiful.

999
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,666
-How about you sing a song?
-That's a good idea.

1000
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,543
-Sing for us!
-Sing for us!

1001
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,503
-Sing for us!
-Sing for us!

1002
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,464
-Sing for us!
-Sing for us!

1003
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,132
-Sing for us!
-Sir.

1004
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:53,011
You can't get married if you can't sing

1005
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:56,473
-You're so mean
-Gosh, this is embarrassing.

1006
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,516
-So mean!
-If you can't get married

1007
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,642
-Kang-ho.
-You can't…

1008
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,019
I have something to say!

1009
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,689
-Goodness.
-Go inside.

1010
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,363
Come in. Goodness.

1011
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,366
Last night,

1012
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:19,370
your father visited me in my dreams.

1013
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,080
Have a seat.

1014
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:29,464
He was silent
and glared at me as if he was upset.

1015
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,968
I thought long and hard about
why he was sulking so much.

1016
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:38,097
He must've been jealous that
I would be the only one to witness this.

1017
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,893
Gosh, you're beautiful.

1018
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,103
How old are you?

1019
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,314
I'm 27.

1020
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,233
You have the perfect age gap.

1021
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,653
Hold on.

1022
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:03,331
I got this at the biggest
jewelry shop in town.

1023
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,295
They're diamonds.

1024
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,631
I see.

1025
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,553
Can you wait outside?

1026
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,762
Okay.

1027
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,514
Why?

1028
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,901
I know that brand.

1029
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,903
You know…

1030
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,071
Vutton!

1031
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,031
-It's a luxury handbag.
-I see.

1032
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,953
What are those boxes?

1033
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:45,456
It says "fur…"

1034
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,166
As in animal fur?

1035
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,670
Animal fur? Maybe it's a mink coat.

1036
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,838
It could be.

1037
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,215
I heard they skin minks alive.

1038
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:58,344
Don't say something so horrific.

1039
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,764
By the way, what are those boxes?

1040
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:05,768
Do you think they're for us?

1041
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,271
What are you doing there?

1042
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,076
Goodness.

1043
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:27,749
Come to think of it, your fiancée
was born in the Year of the Pig.

1044
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,959
It must be destiny.

1045
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,713
Who am I? I'm a pig farmer.

1046
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,884
She was destined to marry
into our family, right?

1047
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,393
What is this?

1048
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,028
"Adoption Agreement"?

1049
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,238
What is this?

1050
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,075
Are you going to adopt a child?

1051
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,411
Why?

1052
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,829
Can she not get pregnant?

1053
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,667
I will be adopted by Chairman Song
who has been raising me all along.

1054
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,628
Please stamp your seal there.

1055
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,677
-What?
-Be quiet.

1056
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,345
What…

1057
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,847
What are you saying?

1058
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:29,477
Who raised you? Who's adopting you?

1059
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,980
I'm your mom.

1060
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,649
I gave birth to you.

1061
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,735
What are you talking about?

1062
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,904
I'm going to become Chairman Song's son,

1063
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:43,116
inherit his business,
and become an assemblyman's son-in-law.

1064
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,119
Wait.

1065
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:51,874
Wait, Kang-ho. What are you talking about?

1066
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,044
I get that money and power are great.

1067
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,296
But you can't cut ties with your mom.

1068
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,340
Isn't this what you wanted?

1069
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,261
What…

1070
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,647
CONSENTING PARTY: JIN YOUNG-SOON
SIGNATURE OR SEAL

1071
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:53,644
All right.

1072
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:59,233
I'll always be your mom.

1073
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:05,281
This piece of paper won't matter.

1074
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,160
I'm happy as long as you are.

1075
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,423
Let me ask you one question.

1076
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,426
Did you propose the idea?

1077
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,386
You didn't, right?

1078
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,347
He did, right?

1079
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,558
You didn't want to, but he forced you
because he needs you, right?

1080
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,602
Am I right?

1081
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,631
Wait.

1082
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,842
Kang-ho.

1083
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,636
I can't let you go like this.

1084
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,349
Have some food before you go.

1085
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,646
Food?

1086
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,483
You're inviting me to eat

1087
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:27,029
when I've never been able
to enjoy a meal with you?

1088
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,622
Then take this.

1089
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,791
Take this with you.

1090
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,211
Why won't you take this?

1091
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:46,215
I get that you're embarrassed by me
since I'm a poor hillbilly.

1092
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,675
But why won't you take this?

1093
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,302
These are all brand new.

1094
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,263
They sell these
at big department stores in Seoul.

1095
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,140
There's a warranty too. Kang--

1096
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:55,933
Kang-ho…

1097
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,186
-Does this make sense?
-I don't know.

1098
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,693
Goodness.

1099
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,656
Wait. Kang-ho.

1100
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,159
Kang-ho.

1101
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:27,882
Kang-ho.

1102
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,842
Wait.

1103
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,844
They're mung bean pancakes, your favorite.

1104
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,429
Have some on your way, okay?

1105
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,812
Kang-ho!

1106
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,983
What an impudent punk!

1107
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,902
Goodness.

1108
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,989
Look at this handbag.

1109
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:56,285
She must have good taste
because she lives in Seoul.

1110
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,663
Goodness. This is very light.

1111
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,122
I can barely feel it.

1112
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,208
By the way,

1113
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,919
if Chairman Song adopts him,

1114
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:07,004
does that mean he'll be Song Kang-ho now?

1115
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,513
Don't worry about me.

1116
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:17,932
Gosh.

1117
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:22,103
I've been running on an empty stomach.
I'm hungry now.

1118
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,729
Why are you out here?

1119
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,774
We have lots of food inside. Go inside.

1120
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:27,942
Go inside.

1121
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,527
-Okay.
-Gosh.

1122
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,404
Go away, kids.

1123
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:34,490
Kids, go play.

1124
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:35,992
Go.

1125
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,588
The smell is making me carsick.

1126
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,971
Are we really taking that home?

1127
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,519
I hope my clothes won't reek of it.

1128
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,279
Kang-ho.

1129
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:14,989
Kang-ho.

1130
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:17,700
Kang-ho…

1131
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,015
Kang-ho.

1132
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,655
Should I drive instead?

1133
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,868
Okay. I'm sorry.

1134
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:11,879
Kang-ho.

1135
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,881
Are you okay?

1136
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,056
It still reeks.

1137
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,817
Kang-ho.

1138
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,194
No.

1139
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,113
Kang-ho, no…

1140
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,199
No!

1141
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,537
Kang-ho!

1142
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,874
Kang-ho!

1143
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,483
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1144
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:07,661
My son won't die.

1145
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,997
I won't let him die.

1146
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,874
What? Kang-ho?

1147
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,919
-I'm telling you.
-Then what will happen to Kang-ho?

1148
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,045
Just watch and see.

1149
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:19,715
Our son will walk out of that room.

1150
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:23,177
He'll stand here and look at you.

1151
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,471
I'll make sure he does.

1152
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,766
I hope you learn English quickly
so we can live together.

1153
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:30,643
That was the worst sin you could commit.

1154
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,019
Letting others use you.

1155
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:34,438
My son woke up!

1156
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:35,481
It's me, Mom.

1157
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,691
Do you recognize me?

1158
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:45,574
