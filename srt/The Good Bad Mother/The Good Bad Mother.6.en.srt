THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,182
What the hell is this?

3
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,142
Damn it.

4
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,814
-Hurry up and find it.
-Yes, sir.

5
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,492
Be quiet.

6
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,045
Lion.

7
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,509
Hide in there!

8
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,227
Lion.

9
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,062
I'm here!

10
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,567
Oh, no!

11
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,320
Lion…

12
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,989
Lion!

13
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,700
What have you…

14
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,790
How did you open that?

15
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,792
That's my mom's favorite…

16
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,297
Stop pooping,
or we'll both get kicked out!

17
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,632
Come here.

18
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,842
Come here, Choi Lion.

19
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,011
Come here.

20
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,387
All right.

21
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,598
My mom is going to get mad.

22
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,640
Wait.

23
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,350
Sit, Lion.

24
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,770
What's all this?

25
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,857
What did you eat so much, you idiot?

26
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,611
All right.

27
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,280
Should we go out now?

28
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,990
-What if his mother comes too?
-Stay still.

29
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,700
What did you have for dinner?

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,869
Skate.

31
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,872
Wait there. Gosh.

32
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,381
Don't come out.

33
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,767
I can't believe this.

34
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,151
Lion isn't that tall.

35
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,820
That was close.

36
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,575
I should put this…

37
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,495
in the closet.

38
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,917
I'm sure it was…

39
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,677
That can't be.

40
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,471
Come out.

41
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,348
I know you're in there.

42
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,316
I knew it.

43
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,986
It was Lion.

44
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,529
You're dead meat.

45
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,656
My mom is going to kill you.

46
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,159
This…

47
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:51,958
All right.

48
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,838
Done.

49
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,393
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

50
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,729
EPISODE 6

51
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,233
I'm relieved that Mom
is at Mr. Son's place.

52
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,488
Gosh, Lion. What are you going to do now?

53
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,074
You're going to get kicked out.

54
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,539
Mom.

55
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,583
Mom?

56
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,918
No!

57
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,673
No.

58
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,687
Who are you?

59
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,042
-Are you okay, sir?
-No, I'm not!

60
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,672
Get him!

61
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,300
Get him!

62
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,228
-Go get the car!
-Yes, sir.

63
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,383
Step on it!

64
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,222
Pass that car!

65
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,195
No, don't follow him. Go straight.

66
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,155
Go straight!

67
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,797
Turn now!

68
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,348
It's me, sir.

69
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,893
There were people hiding inside.

70
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,060
I'm sorry--

71
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,091
Damn it!

72
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,347
SONG WOO-BYEOK
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CANDIDACY

73
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,850
Mom…

74
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,102
-What's all this mess?
-It's…

75
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:46,734
Some scary men suddenly barged in
and made a mess.

76
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,153
At this hour? Who came from where?

77
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,780
I don't know either.

78
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,367
They were inside the closet.

79
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,578
And another guy came in from that door.

80
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,663
I saw it.

81
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,418
-So you're saying some scary men
-Yes.

82
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,295
-came out of the closet
-Yes.

83
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,464
and they made a mess

84
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,174
and pooped in here, right?

85
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,759
Yes. It's the truth.

86
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,718
He…

87
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,970
He even had a knife.

88
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,889
This guy had a knife,
and these guys suddenly came out.

89
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,142
He was going to stab me,
but these guys lunged at him.

90
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,477
Then he lunged back at them.

91
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,021
They crashed and everything.

92
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,690
They fought in this small room?

93
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,774
Yes.

94
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,194
Clean up right now.

95
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,988
Or I'll kick you and Lion out.

96
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,698
It's the truth, Mom!

97
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,199
Clean it up!

98
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,869
So what happened?

99
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,163
He disappeared at the hospital.

100
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,959
I wasn't asking about him.

101
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,920
We're still looking for it.

102
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:53,009
But it's such a small village,
and it's hard to avoid the neighbors.

103
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,094
It's difficult to be inconspicuous.

104
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,479
I'll find it at all costs!

105
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,606
That's right.

106
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,317
That's the right answer.

107
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,074
I told you that

108
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,577
Oh Tae-soo would betray me.

109
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,079
He'll get more desperate
as the election nears.

110
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,041
He'll get rid of everyone
who gets in his way!

111
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,002
Who do you think
will be next after Kang-ho?

112
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,589
Make sure Kang-ho is safe

113
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,884
until we find the original copy.

114
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,885
Understand?

115
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,303
Yes, sir.

116
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,768
Splash, splash

117
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,436
Throw the bottle

118
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,396
Throw the bottle

119
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,523
When the coastal guard isn't watching

120
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,484
Throw the bottle

121
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,902
Okay?

122
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,196
I'll throw this too.

123
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,280
And this net.

124
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,616
And I'll throw you too.

125
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,954
You shouldn't throw trash
into this beautiful sea.

126
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:10,086
I've calculated your wages, incentives,

127
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,922
and severance pay.

128
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:17,385
Minus the destruction of property,
the compensation I gave to the customers,

129
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,722
and the money I lost because I had to
close the business last night.

130
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,019
And you just need to pay me
100 million won.

131
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,231
-A hundred million?
-Why?

132
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,358
Do you not have the money?

133
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,903
I'm an idiot! I didn't think that far.

134
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,696
What do we do then?

135
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,448
In that case,

136
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,326
how about I give you a good beating first?

137
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,994
Sorry? No.

138
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,121
Beat him up.

139
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,665
Come here.

140
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:48,999
You bastard.

141
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,546
-Okay!
-What are you saying?

142
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,132
-What the…
-Come here!

143
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,133
-Come down.
-Come down.

144
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,676
-I'll call the cops!
-Come here.

145
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,261
-Let me go!
-You won't die.

146
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,804
-Don't worry.
-Don't touch me!

147
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,140
Come down.

148
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,644
What the…

149
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,770
Hey!

150
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,481
Sam-sik, it's cold out there!

151
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,902
Is he a seal or something?

152
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,988
All right.

153
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,699
See you again, Sam-sik!

154
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,352
Phone use is a violation

155
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,688
of Article 49, Paragraph 1,
Item 10 of the Road Traffic Act.

156
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,607
Neglect of a seatbelt is a violation

157
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,817
of Article 50, Paragraph 1
of the Road Traffic Act.

158
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,128
It's okay.

159
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,090
You can take your time.

160
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,719
But promise me

161
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,722
you'll come back.

162
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,569
Is anyone home?

163
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,154
Coming.

164
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,954
Who are you?

165
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,915
Gosh.

166
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,751
I told you not to go out like that.

167
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,587
Anyway, who are you?

168
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,214
I'm Baek Hoon-ah.

169
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,341
I'm from Seoul.

170
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,884
I see.

171
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,762
"Baek Hoon-ah"?

172
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,266
The name sounds familiar.

173
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,352
Hoon-ah?

174
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,521
Weren't you the Nightingale of Jou-ri?

175
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,147
Do you know me?

176
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,568
It's me, Son Yong-rak!

177
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,904
We went to the same elementary school.

178
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,826
Let's see. You were in second grade
when you moved to Seoul.

179
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,953
-You were probably nine.
-Right.

180
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,833
You were always good at singing.

181
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,793
No wonder you became a composer.

182
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,629
Shouldn't he have become a singer
if he was good at singing?

183
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,924
Perhaps his looks got in the way.

184
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,347
You can go rest if you're done with that.

185
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,849
I'm not done yet.

186
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,269
I'll eat the peel as well.

187
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,522
Okay.

188
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,325
If you're going to live in this village,

189
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,744
it's best not to listen to what she says.

190
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,079
Come on. I lived in Seoul for a long time.

191
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,415
I've been downright ignoring her.

192
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,838
Anyway, it's nice to see you again.

193
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,215
Are you here for good?

194
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,718
Well, you see…

195
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,097
Yong-rak.

196
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,183
Yong-rak.

197
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,938
The foot-and-mouth disease has spread
throughout North and South Jeolla Province

198
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,814
as well as South Chungcheong Province.

199
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,359
The Ministry of Agriculture,
Food and Rural Affairs has decided

200
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,904
to cull 3,000 pigs at the farm
where the disease was detected

201
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:52,117
and take preventive measures
at eight farms within a 3km radius--

202
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,080
Why are they tormenting the pigs?

203
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,625
They're not tormenting them.
It's because they're sick.

204
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,170
One sick pig could transmit disease
to the entire farm

205
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,255
and it could spread to other nearby farms.

206
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,174
So they must kill them.

207
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,717
Kill them?

208
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,845
Then will our pigs get killed too?

209
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,805
No.

210
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,808
Our pigs have been vaccinated,

211
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,518
and there are no farms nearby.

212
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,019
So you don't need to worry.

213
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,480
But

214
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,816
you need to keep Lion
on the farm from now on.

215
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,984
Okay?

216
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,986
It can't catch a disease.

217
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,404
Okay.

218
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,200
The market is opening today
so I'll be going into town.

219
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,868
I'll see you later then.

220
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,204
What's gotten into you?

221
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,206
You always begged me to take you with me.

222
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,749
Well…

223
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,794
The place will be crowded with people.

224
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,880
It won't be easy to get around
in my wheelchair, so I'll stay home.

225
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,757
I'll eat and exercise.

226
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,137
I know you just want to play
with Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

227
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,058
Promise me you won't
get into trouble like last time.

228
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,728
Okay. I won't.

229
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,688
I promise.

230
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,399
Promise.

231
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,485
Here.

232
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:13,490
Pick up herbicide for the garlic field.

233
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,534
Okay. Do you need anything else?

234
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,999
Use this to start your shop.

235
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,172
I saved up to give this to you
on your wedding day.

236
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,257
Make sure you look for a good place.

237
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,800
Mom…

238
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,471
This is the last time
I'll be helping you out. Got that?

239
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,389
-Gosh.
-Mom.

240
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,349
Thank you so much.

241
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,979
I'll work really hard
and pay you back handsomely. Okay?

242
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,900
Get it together, okay?

243
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,694
-Go.
-Okay.

244
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,321
I'll see you later.

245
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,698
Ye-jin. Seo-jin.

246
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,242
Hi, Juni.

247
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,912
Give me the bus schedule
for Jou-ri to Uri-myeon.

248
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,831
Okay. It is scheduled to arrive soon.

249
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,139
Gosh.

250
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,813
Mi-joo!

251
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,191
Oh, no.

252
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,583
Taxi.

253
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,585
Taxi!

254
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,504
Taxi!

255
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,755
Hello.

256
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,758
I wanted to ask you something.

257
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:59,680
About that old lady who's protesting
in front of the Prosecutors' Office…

258
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,057
Jung Jong-gu's mother.

259
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,894
What are the contents?

260
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,480
It's red chili powder, sesame seeds,

261
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,066
a few potatoes, sesame oil,
and perilla oil.

262
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,027
Please deliver them safely.

263
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,411
BANDO REAL ESTATE

264
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,251
-Hello.
-Come on in.

265
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,715
Please give me this pair in 275mm.

266
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,508
All right, one minute.

267
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,146
You have a keen eye.

268
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,231
Those shoes were newly released.

269
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,984
They're comfortable and don't smell.

270
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,654
There's this air cushion back here,

271
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,365
so they're great
for jogging or working out.

272
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,452
They lessen the stress
on your knees, calves, and cartilage.

273
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,995
I'm wearing them right now.

274
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,122
Do you want to see a pair in 275mm?

275
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,498
No, it's okay.

276
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,250
Then just this one.

277
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,376
Yes, please.

278
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,714
-How much is it?
-It's 15,000 won, but just give me 10,000.

279
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,010
-Thank you. Come again.
-Thank you.

280
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,097
But later…

281
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,683
Someday…

282
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,146
I'm going to come back for those shoes.

283
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,232
Just wait and see.

284
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,816
All right.

285
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,946
Baek Hoon-ah, the Nightingale of Jou-ri?

286
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,113
That's right.

287
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,408
Goodness. It's been ages.

288
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,368
Gum-ja.

289
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,828
So you still live here.

290
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:51,833
I was wondering who it was
that moved here from Seoul.

291
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,627
I'm so glad to see you.

292
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,004
Are you here for good?

293
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,095
Goodness.

294
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,471
What's wrong?

295
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,599
Goodness.

296
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,393
Goodness.

297
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,604
The rent is pretty high
despite it being a rural area.

298
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,231
This is the only town around here.

299
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,024
The land value has soared

300
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,568
because a semiconductor company
will be moving here.

301
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,529
I see.

302
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,157
Anyway, thank you. I'll call you later.

303
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,201
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,133
Are these supplements the best ones?

306
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,384
Of course.

307
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,470
-I'd like eight boxes.
-Okay.

308
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,973
And do you have any medicine

309
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,350
for indigestion or stomach cramps?

310
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,894
Do you want three days' worth?

311
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,438
A bit more than that please.

312
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,065
I'd like three months' worth.

313
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,359
Yes, ma'am.

00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,490
I like looking at these fish.

320
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,577
What's great about staring at fish
that are about to die?

321
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,703
Exactly.

322
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,457
They might die any moment now,

323
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,959
but no matter how painful or scary it is,

324
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,545
they're unable to cry or scream.

325
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,340
I think judicial officers
must be like that.

326
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,192
-We have eggs. Fresh eggs.
-Mi-joo.

327

-Eggs that we collected
-Mi-joo!

328
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:28,406
-before they even touched the nest.
-Mi-joo!

No, I have the bankbook.
I must've dropped my wallet somewhere.

334
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,937
Mom, I'll put him on the phone.
You talk to him.

335
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,397
-Here.
-Okay.

336
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,440
Hello?

337
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,903
I see. It's Ms. Jung from Jou-ri.

338
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,614
Herbicide for your garlic field?

339
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,450
All right. Bye.

340
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,369
-Okay.
-Right.

341
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,705
I'll go get it from the storage.

342
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,206
-Wait here.
-Okay.

343
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,166
All right.

344
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,549
Gosh, that hurts.

345
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,885
You're still in pain.

346
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,887
You should see a doctor.

347
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,722
Does your finger hurt?

348
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,224
Well…

349
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,061
I think it's irritation
from pesticides or grass.

350
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,440
Let me take a look. Hold on.

351
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,441
What?

352
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,194
Let me see.

353
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,743
One minute.

354
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,185
You have an ingrown nail.

355
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,855
Don't cut your nails too close or round.

356
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,651
But cut it so that it's a square shape.

357
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,028
Old people don't know about that.

358
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,073
We're not particular
about cutting our nails.

359
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,576
If it's too hard to do it,
you can go to a nail salon.

360
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,663
Isn't that where
you get your nails colored?

361
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,331
They do that,

362
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,000
but they also help fix problematic nails.

363
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,420
He's back with the herbicide.

364
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,130
Ma'am, how's your finger now?

365
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:53,301
Goodness, it feels much better.

366
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,221
Nail salon, was it?

367
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,599
Is there a nail salon in town?

368
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,560
There was one,
but it closed down a few months ago.

369
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,187
Goodness.

370
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,523
Living in a rural area is so inconvenient.

371
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,694
By the way, why don't you
open up a nail salon?

372
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,861
You'd be so good at it.

373
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,114
I've been looking into it,

374
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,241
but the rent is too high.

375
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,119
I can't find a decent shop-in-shop either.

376
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,163
What is a "shop-in-shop"?

377
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,375
It's opening up another small shop
inside a shop.

378
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,627
That's why it's called a shop-in-shop.

379
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,880
Then open one here.

380
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,425
Lots of people frequent this place
all year round.

381
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,428
Most of us need hand care

382
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:40,056
and often wait around
like this for the bus.

383
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,808
-That'd be great.
-Come on.

384
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,353
Who would open up a nail shop
in a place like this?

385
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,354
Jeez.

386
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,607
My wife would be glad
to hear that news though.

387
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,277
She's been sulking about
the nail salon closing down.

388
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,280
Can I really do that?

389
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,324
How much would the rent be?

390
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,409
What rent?

391
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,203
That corner has always been empty.

392
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,122
She's right.

393
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:08,293
We'll convince everyone to buy seeds,
fertilizer, and everything else here.

394
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,878
-So let her have it.
-Seriously?

395
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,588
I have a truck driver's license too.

396
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,299
I can fetch products from the storage
when you're busy

397
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,717
and deliver them too.

398
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,135
-Seriously?
-Yes.

399
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,804
In that case…

400
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,598
Then…

401
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,184
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

402
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,602
-A big welcome.
-Thank you.

403
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,020
-Gladly.
-Thank you.

404
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,897
-Thank you.
-Good for you.

405
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,842
Let's see.

406
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,973
That's Mi-joo's!

407
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,028
-That little…
-Darn it.

408
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,322
Move!

409
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,746
Out!

410
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,915
Hit a home run or strikeout.

411
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,547
Hit a home run…

412
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,714
Or strikeout.

413
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,841
…or strikeout.

414
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,848
Catch that thief!

415
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,225
You thief!

416
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,393
You punk.

417
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,396
-How dare you steal this?
-No, I didn't steal it.

418
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,856
This is from our shop.

419
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,066
-I didn't steal it.
-How dare you?

420
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,152
-Then why do you have our item?
-Sorry?

421
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,695
I saw it. Why do you have it?

422
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,364
I just tried it on.

423
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,032
-Don't lie.
-It's the truth.

424
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,951
-How dare you?
-Wait--

425
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,286
What's going on?

426
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,829
What's the matter?

427
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,581
It's Mi-joo!

428
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,167
-Do you know him?
-Yes, I do.

429
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,002
No, I…

430
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,253
No.

431
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,338
Anyway, he's unwell.

432
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,299
Please let go of him.

433
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,718
I'm telling you, he stole this.

434
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,636
-What?
-He stole our apple too.

435
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,554
Goodness.

436
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,890
We'll have to throw all of this away.
What'll you do?

437
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,433
I…

438
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,059
The thing is…

439
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,647
Someone stole this, so…

440
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,525
Why do you have that?

441
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,819
"Hi, Juni."

442
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,114
"Give me the bus schedule
for Jou-ri to Uri-myeon."

443
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,534
You dropped it while you said that.

444
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,790
I'm so sorry.

445
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,251
I'll compensate you for everything.
I'm sorry.

446
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,003
What do I do?

447
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,005
-I'm sorry.
-Kang-ho.

448
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,641
Goodness.

449
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,893
How did you come all the way here?

450
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,561
You don't even know the way.

451
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,689
You can't buy anything
if you don't have your wallet.

452
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,401
But still, there are many cars,
so it could've been dangerous.

453
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:25,031
If you pick up anything from now on,
give it to me or Mr. Son, okay?

454
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,324
Okay.

455
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,495
And no matter what,
you shouldn't touch someone else's stuff.

456
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,205
Why did you take the bag?

457
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,207
The owner must've been startled.

458
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,753
Bar Exam Meals.

459
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,797
What?

460
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,298
What did you say?

461
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,843
-Put him behind bars?
-What?

462
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,636
-No.
-You…

463
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,137
-You need to get scolded!
-No, I…

464
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,349
How dare you say that about an elder?

465
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,809
-Mi-joo.
-Gosh!

466
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:53,852
How dare you!

467
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,354
-You impudent brat!
-That hurts! Mi-joo!

468
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,774
-Bye, Mi-joo.
-Thank you for the ride.

469
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,152
Mi-joo, wait.

470
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,070
Yes?

471
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:14,163
These are supplements.
Give them to your mom.

472
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,084
And tell her I'm sorry that
Kang-ho ruined her field.

473
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,461
I'm the one who should be sorry.

474
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,630
Ye-jin just lost her grip on the pig.

475
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,011
You must've been surprised.

476
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,597
I was.

477
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,765
We could've lost the pig.

478
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,392
No.

479
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,811
I mean Kang-ho.

480
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,688
Sorry?

481
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,195
I couldn't talk to you
with him in the truck.

482
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,031
But you looked quite upset.

483
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,617
That's not why.

484
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,245
Mi-joo.

485
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,999
I treated you harshly back then,

486
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,419
blaming you for Kang-ho
not taking his CSAT.

487
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,130
I even refused
to tell you his contact information.

488
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,882
I'm really sorry about that.

489
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,845
I think I'm being punished right now

490
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,223
because of what I did to you back then.

491
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,435
I'm really sorry. Please forgive me.

492
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,938
Ms. Jin, don't be like this.

493
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,731
Don't apologize.

494
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,775
I'm happy

495
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,861
that I got to see him again.

496
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,613
But…

497
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,290
You know very well how strong he is.

498
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,751
Just wait.

499
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,795
He won't give up that easily.

500
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,338
He'll walk again.

501
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,924
Thanks.

502
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,426
Thanks, Mi-joo.

503
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,441
Hoon-ah.

504
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,360
Are you really

505
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,279
Hoon-ah?

506
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,700
Won-hyung, you bedwetter.
You've grown so much.

507
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,077
-Gosh.
-Hoon-ah.

508
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,246
Sing me a song.

509
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,124
-What song?
-The song you used to sing back then

510
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,333
about a magpie.

511
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,877
Should I?

512
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,755
Whom

513
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,674
Does the magpie

514
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:34,053
Play with?

515
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,891
They play among themselves

516
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,603
In the field

517
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,316
Whom does Won-hyung the Bedwetter

518
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,237
Play with?

519
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,408
Won-hyung the Bedwetter

520
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,786
Plays with Hoon-ah

521
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,375
Let's get rid of the pig farm.

522
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,793
But…

523
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,421
-Come on. That's absurd.
-What's he saying?

524
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,424
I love you with all my heart,

525
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,634
but I'm against that!

526
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,970
-Me too.
-Now, now.

527
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,430
Hear me out.

528
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,683
If you help me out,

529
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,311
I promise

530
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:27,023
to replace the pig farm
with the biggest trot concert hall

531
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,067
in this country.

532
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,860
-I will.
-A concert hall?

533
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,612
-A trot concert hall?
-A trot concert hall?

534
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,531
Look. Korea's in the grip
of trot music fever.

535
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:39,535
I'll bring Young-woong,
Young-tak, and Dong-won

536
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,996
and hold a concert every week.

537
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,081
Think about it.

538
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,708
People will swarm into this village.

539
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,876
Then…

540
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,669
Gosh, it'll be so noisy and chaotic.

541
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,963
Goodness. It'll be so hectic.

542
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:51,881
Right.

543
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:56,094
If the biggest trot concert hall
is built here,

544
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,805
we'll need security.

545
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,182
Who should be in charge?

546
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,935
-Me?
-No.

547
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,353
Sam-sik.

548
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,522
-Sam-sik?
-Not him.

549
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,775
Hold on. What will Sam-sik do again?

550
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,360
No one

551
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,697
is more well-versed in security than him.

552
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,199
That's true.

553
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,452
When it comes to security,

554
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,497
-he's like an FBI agent.
-That is true.

555
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,833
Was it when he was in fifth grade?

556
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,751
He went to a police station

557
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,712
-and stole a pair of handcuffs.
-Right.

558
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,423
Must we ignore such a hidden gem?

559
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,551
It'll be a waste of talent.

560
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,885
Goodness.

561
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,096
-I wouldn't say he's a hidden gem.
-On top of that,

562
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,473
the singers will need someone

563
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,017
to do their hair and makeup.

564
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,561
And as it happens,

565
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,481
we have a professional in this village.

566
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,900
-Who?
-Who?

567
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,236
Mi-joo?

568
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,239
What will all those people
want to do here? They'll want to eat.

569
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,741
We'll serve various cuisines.

570
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,869
What will they do
during their waiting time?

571
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,078
Coffee, right?

572
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,163
I'm talking about a cafe.

573
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,330
-A cafe?
-A cafe?

574
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,207
Someone will manage the parking space,

575
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,043
clean, and run a bed and breakfast.

576
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,881
-I have the biggest house around here.
-Right.

577
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,048
That's right!

578
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,550
And each room has a bathroom.

579
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,093
-Not every room.
-Do you still

580
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,762
not get the big picture?

581
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,724
Mr. Son Yong-rak,

582
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,975
the town head?

583
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,393
-Gosh.
-He's a village head.

584
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,020
I'm a village head.

585
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,313
People will gather here,

586
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,815
and the village will grow.

587
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,775
There will be more residents.

588
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,821
Then the village
will become a town in no time.

589
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,575
Better yet, should I call you
a governor instead?

590
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:46,037
I'd like to introduce you to our governor,

591
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,455
Mr. Son Yong-rak!

592
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,749
-A governor?
-He's a governor!

593
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,250
-That's great!
-You just got promoted!

594
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,793
A round of applause!

595
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,254
Hi, Juni. Show me the direction
to my house.

596
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,089
Starting navigation.

597
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,634
-It works. Look, Mom.
-Right.

598
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:04,013
If you ever lose your way home,
you can use that.

599
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,098
No.

600
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,770
You shouldn't be in a situation where you
lose your way home to begin with.

601
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,854
Got it?

602
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,439
Okay.

603
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,943
Mr. Son.

604
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,528
Mr. Son?

605
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,324
Mr. Son?

606
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,327
Mr. Son.

607
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,745
Mr. Son.

608
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,254
That's strange. Where's everyone?

609
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,215
Hi, Juni. Where's everyone?

610
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,968
I can't think of an answer.

611
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,141
Hey, Andrea.

612
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,562
Really? Okay, I'll be there soon.

613
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,233
Kang-ho, one of our pigs
is about to give birth.

614
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:04,991
Give this one to Mr. Kim
who runs the goat farm.

615
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,660
This is for the persimmon tree house,
this is for Ms. Choi.

616
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,162
And these two are for Ms. Park.

617
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,372
-Ms. Park.
-Yes.

618
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,416
Also,

619
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,128
I won't be home until tomorrow morning
because I have to be there for the birth.

620
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,339
So make sure you feed Lion.

621
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,218
There's rice in the rice cooker
and side dishes in the fridge for you.

622
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,304
Exercise for an hour

623
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,972
before going to bed.

624
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,307
Can you do that?

625
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:30,850
Yes.

626
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,103
But come home as soon as possible

627
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,440
because those scary men might come back.

628
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,570
Let's not call those scary men ever again.

629
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,113
Okay? Bye.

630
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,743
I didn't call them.

631
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,460
Hi, Juni. Find the goat farm for me.

632
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,504
I found 70 goat farms.

633
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,049
What?

634
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,761
JOU-RI CAFE

635
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,638
There they were.

636
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,935
I wrote up a petition.

637
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,148
Let's gather in front of
the pig farm tomorrow

638
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,359
and shout, "We're against it!"

639
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,110
We should protest.

640
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,615
The pig farm was kind of an inconvenience.
We can't deny that.

641
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,992
Right.

642
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,620
Especially in the summer,
more bugs gather there

643
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,789
and the smell worsens.

644
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,793
But most of all,
I'm worried about Young-soon.

645
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,336
I mean, she's unwell.

646
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,798
I don't think
she should be running the farm.

647
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,842
Darn it.

648
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,887
What's your take on this?

649
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:57,478
Let's fight for a clean

650
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,898
And fresh Jou-ri

651
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,527
Fight

652
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,072
Fight

653
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,782
Fight

654
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:13,369
Let's fight for it!

655
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,130
I know it hurts a lot.

656
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:29,385
But your piglets
will only stay strong if you do.

657
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,556
So hang in there
just a little longer, okay?

658
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,143
I'll do the same.

659
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,895
All right.

660
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,106
All done.

661
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,484
SAM-SIK'S MILL

662
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,564
This is the last time
I will help you as your senior colleague.

663
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,692
Just go there
and return with what they give you.

664
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,111
It's a cakewalk.

665
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,654
Okay?

666
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,991
Okay. I got it.

667
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:38,120
All right. Let's celebrate
Mr. Lee Jae-gyu's promotion

668
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,415
-to assistant chief prosecutor
-He's being so loud.

669
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,834
-and clink our glasses.
-What?

670
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,169
-All right.
-Choi Kang-ho?

671
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,253
Cheers to

672
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,463
Assistant Chief Prosecutor Lee!

673
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,173
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

674
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,426
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

675
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,678
Hey. It's you, isn't it?

676
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,181
Hello.

677
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,228
Jeez, you really became a prosecutor.

678
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,939
It's me, Sam-sik. Your childhood friend.

679
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,232
We're childhood friends.

680
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,319
Gosh, you look really good.

681
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,613
Goodness, you're even wearing cologne.

682
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:17,326
Remember how kids used to make fun of you
because you reeked like your pig farm?

683
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,246
Jeez, they'd bawl
if they had to sit next to you.

684
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,039
Those jerks.

685
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,624
Let's talk outside.

686
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,833
-Please excuse us.
-What?

687
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,794
-Let's talk outside.
-You punk.

688
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,380
You hated pigs,
but you're having pork rinds?

689
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,839
Hey.

690
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,008
My friend is a prosecutor now.

691
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:38,013
By the way, did you get plastic surgery?

692
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,391
You look even better than you used to.

693
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,976
I'm considering it too.

694
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,020
So how have you been?

695
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,235
What's this for?

696
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,449
Wait. What is this?

697
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,118
Isn't this why you approached me?

698
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,037
You little…

699
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,378
Thanks, my friend.

700
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,714
How much did you give me?

701
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,382
300,000 won?

702
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,967
Hey, thanks!

703
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,010
Thanks!

704
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,934
Kang-ho.

705
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,229
All I did was do as I was told

706
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,565
and sell what I got as my payment.

707
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:33,736
I had no idea they were stolen
from an assemblyman's house.

708
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,781
So could you talk to
the prosecutor in charge?

709
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,367
You have that power, don't you?

710
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,039
Kang-ho.

711
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,667
It's me, Sam-sik. Your friend.

712
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,964
-Sam-sik.
-Yes?

713
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,800
We're no longer friends.

714
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,017
All right.

715
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,561
I was wrong.

716
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,438
I sincerely apologize

717
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,857
for all the things

718
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,735
I did and said to you back then.

719
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,737
So please help me out this once.

720
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,198
If you do, I promise to start fresh.

721
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,157
Please?

722
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,993
It's over for me if I go to jail again.

723
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,372
Please help me this once
for my poor mother's sake.

724
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:32,336
No, wait. Please help me, sir.

725
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,880
Please help me.

726
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:35,881
Sam-sik.

727
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,425
I can't help you.

728
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,722
Kang-ho.

729
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,766
Please help me.

730
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,185
Please…

731
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,613
Can you please be quiet and leave?

732
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,335
Look who it is.

733
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,088
It's Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho.

734
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,467
Oh, dear. You must've hurt your legs.

735
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,177
Who are you?

736
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,263
Who am I?

737
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,808
Unbelievable.

738
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:32,104
Fine, I get it.
You don't want to associate with me.

739
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,314
But too bad

740
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,400
because I know you very well.

741
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,654
No matter how hard I tried to forget you,

742
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,698
I just couldn't.

743
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,575
So tell me.

744
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:48,078
How did it feel to keep me
behind bars for months,

745
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,246
my friend?

746
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,498
"Friend"?

747
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,584
Are we friends?

748
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,130
Sorry. Jeez, my bad.

749
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,715
How dare a petty thief

750
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,176
try to befriend a great prosecutor?

751
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:09,975
Be quiet.

752
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,562
What? "Be quiet"?

753
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,566
I see.

754
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,777
Shut up, you jerk.

755
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,072
"I didn't know they were stolen goods.
All I did was do as I was told."

756
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,741
"So please help me this once."

757
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,327
I begged on my knees, but you said,

758
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,204
"We're no longer friends."

759
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,748
"Can you please be quiet and leave?"

760
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,709
You haven't changed.

761
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,836
You haven't changed one bit.

762
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,841
How dare you have the audacity
to face me, you son of a bitch?

763
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,052
"Son of a bitch"?

764
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,053
Yes, you son of a bitch.

765
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,597
-"Son of a bitch"?!
-Yes, you son of a bitch!

766
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,974
You!

767
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,684
You just cursed.

768
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,811
I'm going to tell my mom.

769
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,440
Right. She's tending to the pigs.

770
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,609
Right. You!

771
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,945
I'm going to tell Ye-jin's dad.

772
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,113
You have no idea how scary he is.

773
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,282
He's a horrifying bastard!

774
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,870
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

775
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,333
Ye-jin!

776
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,253
Seo-jin!

777
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,046
Hi, Kang-ho.

778
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,548
I mean, Kang-ho oppa.

779
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,216
I mean, Uncle Kang-ho.

780
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,635
I need your dad's help.

781
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,054
You don't need him as much as we do.

782
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,681
But what for?

783
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:35,227
A stranger called me a son of a bitch.

784
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,980
What? How dare they
say that to our friend?

785
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,439
What are you doing?

786
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,275
I told you to wash your hands and--

787
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,069
Someone cursed at Kang-ho.

788
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,988
I won't let this slide.

789
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,364
All right, let's go!

790
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,700
You're not going anywhere. Come here.

791
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,745
It's almost dinnertime, so go home.
Your mom will be worried.

792
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,330
She's not home.

793
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,958
One of our pigs is giving birth,

794
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,377
so she won't be coming home tonight.

795
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,920
What? Then what about dinner?

796
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,589
I can have rice

797
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,384
with the side dishes in the fridge.

798
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,929
Why don't you just eat with us?

799
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,973
We already have the table set.

800
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,016
Ye-jin.

801
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,183
No, Mom.

802
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,019
-Seo-jin, what are you doing?
-No.

803
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,812
-But…
-What are you doing?

804
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,522
Let's go.

805
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,610
Goodness, he left them there.

806
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,738
SAM-SIK'S MILL

807
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,114
By the way,

808
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,868
I don't know if we should do this to her

809
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,120
as fellow parents.

810
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,457
As fellow parents,

811
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,628
let's do this for our Sam-sik.

812
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,505
He'll become head of security

813
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,343
at the biggest concert hall in Korea.

814
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,261
You're right.

815
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,806
Our son is struggling to land a job
as an ex-convict.

816
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,476
He should be our top priority.

817
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,311
-Exactly.
-Right.

818
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:05,108
Why is our gate open?

819
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,194
Beats me.

820
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,040
Could it be a thief?

821
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,502
A thief robbing a fellow thief's house?

822
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,130
In that case…

823
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,322
You darn thief!

824
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,324
You thief!

825
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,159
Mom!

826
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,744
It's me, Sam-sik!

827
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,037
-Sam-sik?
-What?

828
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:00,580
Goodness!

829
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,001
It really is you!

830
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,170
It really was a thief.

831
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,588
Goodness, Sam-sik.

832
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,966
-Goodness. Oh, no.
-Blood.

833
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,304
What?

834
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,556
It's true.

835
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,016
How is that possible?

836
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,519
I know it's unbelievable, but it's true.

837
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,062
Jeez.

838
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,066
I had no idea
and gave him an earful today.

839
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,446
Who knew such a smart kid
would end up like that?

840
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,657
I feel bad for Ms. Jin.

841
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,119
He's her one and only son.

842
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,621
She dedicated her entire life

843
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,292
to supporting him
by running that pig farm.

844
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:50,422
How dare you say that
after getting out of prison?

845
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,926
Do you think I didn't work hard
to support you?

846
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,553
You bastard.

847
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,722
Where's my discharge deposit?

848
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,307
How dare you

849
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,017
-scam your own mother?
-That hurts!

850
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,727
Dad, help me!

851
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,188
I was just about to help out.

852
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,522
Stop it! It hurts!

853
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,775
Where did you spend that money?

854
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,444
-Come here! Where's the money?
-It hurts!

855
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,820
-Get up!
-Gosh.

856
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,531
-Goodness. Let me see.
-What happened?

857
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,408
-It's nothing.
-Goodness!

858
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,663
Rice is a staple for Koreans,

859
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,583
but we're having bread for dinner?

860
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:31,171
The color reminds me of diarrhea.

861
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,216
It's called tomato stew.

862
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,094
She learned the recipe to cook it for us.

863
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,262
Just eat it.

864
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:42,516
Where did she learn
this ridiculous recipe?

865
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,732
Anyway, doesn't it
feel like we're a family

866
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,692
since we're eating together?

867
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,238
Dad.

868
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,865
Mom.

869
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,952
Seo-jin, stop that nonsense and eat.

870
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,704
I'm done.

871
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,122
You didn't eat the carrots.

872
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,415
I don't like carrots.

873
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,793
Eat them if you want to be healthy.

874
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,838
I want Kang-ho to be healthy.

875
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,174
Here.

876
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,426
Do you want me to scold you?

877
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,821
Why are you taking them back?

878
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:38,822
You don't eat carrots.

879
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,533
How did you know that?

880
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,246
Were we friends too?

881
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,005
We went to school together.

882
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,927
So that's why I kept thinking of you.

883
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,645
You're done eating, right?
Then you should go.

884
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,564
No, I'm not done yet.

885
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,579
I'm sorry.

886
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,085
For what?

887
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,504
I couldn't catch any fish.

888
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,632
Fish?

889
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,425
You like fish.

890
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,219
So I wanted to catch one for you.

891
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,389
But someone suddenly cursed at me.

892
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,478
Where's Ye-jin and Seo-jin's dad?

893
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,479
I want to meet him.

894
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,524
I heard he's a horrifying bastard.

895
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,244
I don't like fish,
so you don't need to catch any for me.

896
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,039
And don't come back here again.

897
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,208
Don't meet my kids again.

898
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,586
I don't want to see you anymore.

899
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,381
Are you done eating?

900
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,552
Was I…

901
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,847
a bad person to you too?

902
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,312
I hope I wasn't.

903
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,858
But I guess I was.

904
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,160
Goodness, I'm so late.

905
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,579
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

906
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,457
Hello.

907
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,836
Hi. What are you doing here?

908
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:03,049
He ate with us because Ms. Jin was tending
to her pig that was giving birth.

909
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,635
Right. Who's feeding Lion?

910
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,470
Right. Lion.

911
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,806
I need to go feed him.

912
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,435
Thanks, Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

913
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,937
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

914
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,565
And…

915
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,234
Mi-joo…

916
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,967
I feel bad for Young-soon.

917
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,387
She lost her husband,
and her son ended up like that.

918
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:56,519
And now, she'll be betrayed
by the villagers she trusted.

919
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,356
Don't put it that way.

920
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,986
She's not young anymore,
so we want her to have a comfortable life.

921
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:06,654
It may sound easy,

922
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:11,159
but running a farm singlehandedly
as a woman isn't easy at all.

923
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:14,621
So you all gathered together

924
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,290
and schemed to make her
close down the farm

925
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,210
so that she'd live a comfortable life?

926
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,503
My goodness.

927
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:26,800
You guys are really something.

928
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,926
Goodness.

929
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,148
-Check in there.
-Yes, sir.

930
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,288
All right.

931
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,835
Goodness. She gave birth to 13 piglets.

932
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,841
You displayed exceptional work

933
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,551
all night long.

934
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,220
Not at all.

935
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,222
She was the one who worked hard.

936
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,438
Well done.

937
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,985
-Good work, Andrea.
-Thank you.

938
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,695
I'll wrap up here.

939
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,821
You can go first.

940
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,406
That is not right.

941
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:35,452
It is only right for you to go home first.

942
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,746
I have to write up the daily record.

943
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,833
I need to do it, so go home first.

944
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,627
If that is what you want,

945
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,380
then I have no choice but to comply.

946
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,216
Go on.

947
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,565
Sir, the worker is headed your way.

948
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,566
Got it.

949
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,750
I want to go home

950
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,800
All right.

951
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,471
See you tomorrow

952
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,626
Sir.

953
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,336
It's me.

954
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:17,011
-Who's left?
-His mother probably went home

955
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,597
and the worker went home as well
so it's probably empty.

956
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:20,598
Good.

957
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,600
Let's go down there.

958
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,643
Yes, sir.

959
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,815
Let's fight for a clean

960
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,734
And fresh Jou-ri

961
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,446
Fight

962
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,241
Fight

963
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,034
"Fight"?

964
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,454
Gosh, he's so annoying.

965
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,500
I wish I could hit him in the head.

966
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:53,256
Let's fight for it!

967
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,721
-It's a manure facility.
-What about the other storage?

968
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,015
There's a smaller storage up there.

969
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,975
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

970
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,059
Gosh.

971
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,480
Goodness.

972
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,902
Who are you? What are you doing here?

973
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,614
-Well, we…
-We need some manure.

974
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,449
Manure?

975
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,159
So we're--

976
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,536
We're planning to start our own farm

977
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,039
and heard that pig manure
was better than fertilizers.

978
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,919
But you can't just
cover your field with it.

979
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:36,257
You need to add sawdust and probiotics
to turn it into an organic fertilizer.

980
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,718
I've used up what I already made.

981
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,764
I'll give you some when I make more.

982
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,184
I understand. Thank you.

983
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,813
It's really nice to hear
that young men like you want to farm.

984
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,816
This village is full of old people.

985
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,818
Where's your field?

986
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,904
It's over there.

987
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,117
That's ours.

988
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:08,414
We bought one behind the field
that's two fields down from that one.

989
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,291
You bought the field?

990
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,544
Ms. Park was worried
that the price was too high

991
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,922
since no one wanted it.

992
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,674
I guess she eventually sold it.

993
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:18,716
Yes.

994
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:22,553
Anyway, I'll let you know
once I get more manure.

995
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,263
Where do you live?

996
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,349
-We--
-We're about to build one.

997
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,560
I see.

998
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,689
I hope we see each other often.

999
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,233
And I'm sorry,

1000
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:38,236
but this is a restricted area.

1001
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,072
Especially with the disease going around.

1002
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,282
We're truly sorry. Goodbye then.

1003
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,661
Have you gone crazy?

1004
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:49,997
Now we might have to
buy a field, farm, and build a house.

1005
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,375
I was flustered
by her unexpected questions.

1006
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,626
Darn it.

1007
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:05,680
Mom.

1008
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,021
Mom.

1009
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:18,860
Mom?

1010
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,746
Was I a bad person to you too?

1011
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,374
I hope I wasn't.

1012
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,377
But I guess I was.

1013
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,535
You're probably worried

1014
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,746
about how you'll raise him, right?

1015
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:16,000
Don't worry and just follow my lead.

1016
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:19,086
I've done this before,
so I know a thing or two.

1017
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:38,022
You don't have to hold it in.

1018
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,111
I've done this before,
so I know a thing or two.

1019
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,739
Goodness.

1020
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,889
Young-soon, we're leaving.

1021
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:12,974
One minute!

1022
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,269
Mom, here.

1023
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,353
Goodness.

1024
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,146
What is this?

1025
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,023
It's Dad's first company picnic,

1026
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,692
so I made some gimbap.

1027
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,070
It'd be nice if you could come too.

1028
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:30,658
I know. I would go if it wasn't
for the practical test next week.

1029
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,326
Don't worry.

1030
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,704
You'll pass no matter what.

1031
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,289
I'll do my best.

1032
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,874
-Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

1033
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,376
-Let's go then.
-Bye.

1034
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,045
All right.

1035
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:46,799
I am happy

1036
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,301
-I am…
-Bye, Young-soon.

1037
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,696
Are you awake?

1038
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,073
Why am I here?

1039
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,950
You fainted at your farm,

1040
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,828
and two men carried you here.

1041
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,581
You need to go see the doctor now.

1042
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,166
Can you walk?

1043
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,084
Yes.

1044
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,548
She's not in the kitchen or the bathroom.

1045
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,676
And I can't go to the farm.

1046
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,097
Then I can call her, right?

1047
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,646
You just told me to, okay?

1048
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:46,192
MOM

1049
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,866
MY LOVELY SON

1050
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,535
Mic test. One, two, three.

1051
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,745
It's fine.

1052
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:02,667
But why are these hillbillies
running late?

1053
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,212
PIG FARM, OUT.
RETURN MY SENSE OF SMELL!

1054
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,129
Hey.

1055
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,382
Where in the world are you?

1056
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,050
As a fellow parent,

1057
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,387
I don't think this is right.

1058
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,974
-Goodness.
-Be gentle.

1059
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,101
You darn brat.

1060
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:23,938
Our hearts break even when our son
gets injured in the tiniest bit.

1061
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:26,524
So imagine how Young-soon must feel.

1062
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,652
Anyway, we won't be a part of it.

1063
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,571
I need to spray herbicide
on my garlic field. Okay?

1064
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,532
I need to thin out the cabbages.

1065
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,450
I have so much to do.

1066
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,619
I have no time to protest. Darn it.

1067
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,663
Hang up.

1068
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:43,958
Listen, you punk. I know you came here
after ending up dirt poor

1069
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,085
because of gambling and plagiarizing.

1070
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,004
And you're telling me
you're going to build

1071
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,630
the biggest concert hall in the country?

1072
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,424
How am I to believe that?

1073
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,384
I'm busy right now. Bye.

1074
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,682
Mr. Son!

1075
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:03,644
Mr. Son!

1076
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,273
Do you really not have a guardian?

1077
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,985
Husband, children,

1078
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,571
or siblings?

1079
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:15,072
No, I don't.

1080
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,867
Don't make me repeat myself.

1081
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,494
So just tell me.

1082
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:24,874
What's wrong? Is it serious?

1083
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,587
The biopsy results came out.

1084
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,798
It's stage 4 stomach cancer.

1085
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:37,636
We'll have to do more tests to confirm.

1086
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,057
But judging by this scan,

1087
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,143
it's metastasized to your peritoneum.

1088
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:50,941
What are you talking about?

1089
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,739
I only came here due to indigestion.

1090
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,326
The pain is usually unbearable
at this stage.

1091
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,577
Look.

1092
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:05,456
I'm really not in any pain.

1093
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,501
I just have indigestion
every now and then.

1094
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,921
But I feel better every time I tend to it.

1095
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,593
Anyway, I don't have cancer.

1096
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,886
Don't be absurd.

1097
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,014
Ma'am.

1098
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,266
Are you sure the result is correct?

1099
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,685
Is the patient's name Jin Young-soon?

1100
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,395
No.

1101
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,607
That's not important.

1102
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:38,614
To tell the truth,

1103
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:44,328
my son is quite unwell right now.

1104
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,542
So I…

1105
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,211
I…

1106
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:56,674
I…

1107
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,095
I can't…

1108
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,100
Doctor.

1109
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,271
Please save me.

1110
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,106
This is…

1111
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,235
This is curable
if I receive surgery, right?

1112
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:20,573
I recently saw on the news that

1113
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,869
they've developed medicine
to cure last-stage cancer.

1114
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,831
Doctor, I'll…

1115
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,376
I'll do as you say

1116
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,837
and receive treatment.

1117
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,089
I promise.

1118
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:39,925
Doctor.

1119
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,094
I can't…

1120
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,723
I can't die.

1121
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,517
My son…

1122
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,228
Kang-ho…

1123
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:00,738
Mom!

1124
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:10,873
Are you okay?

1125
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,293
Kang-ho.

1126
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,378
Get up.

1127
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,423
I…

1128
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:35,689
Mom.

1129
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,447
Get up.

1130
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,753
Kang-ho.

1131
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,564
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1132
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:33,831
My mom is acting weird.

1133
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,626
She's low on energy
and doesn't smile anymore.

1134
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:42,172
You can slowly regain your memory
and learn one thing at a time.

1135
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:44,675
Who are we to criticize one another?

1136
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,303
We both messed up.

1137
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:49,638
Why should I die?

1138
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,724
Why should I die?

1139
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,310
I feel so bad for Young-soon.

1140
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,687
What will happen to that family?

1141
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,356
Then after 25 nights,

1142
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,859
you wean them.

1143
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:06,447
I'll only end up
becoming a burden to my unwell son.

1144
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,074
Mom!

1145
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:16,373
