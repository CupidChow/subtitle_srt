1
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,146
-You punk.
-What the…

3
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,857
-You punk. How could you do that?
-What's wrong with you?

4
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,400
-How could you?
-What's with you?

5
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,902
-Calm down.
-I mean,

6
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,029
of all people,

7
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,865
how could you do that to Kang-ho,

8
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,991
that poor kid?

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,118
Why do you pity him?

10
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,287
-What?
-He got all the attention

11
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,956
for being smart and getting good grades.

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,667
And now he's getting all the attention
because he's become an idiot.

13
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,087
As if his mom's love isn't enough,

14
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,298
even the lady next door dotes on him.

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,136
You were always too busy with the mill
to make me a birthday meal,

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,763
but when Kang-ho got into SNU,

17
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,308
you even closed the mill
and threw him a feast!

18
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,185
Darn it, I'm your kid, not him.

19
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,479
Why do you think I did that?

20
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,357
I thought you'd benefit a little

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,985
if you were around a smart kid like him.

22
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,696
It was humiliating and frustrating,

23
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,658
but I still put up with everything.

24
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,743
That's…

25
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,621
That's how I held out.

26
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,336
Why are you crying?
You're breaking my heart. It's all right.

27
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,508
Hey, you punk.
Why are you making my woman cry?

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,386
I needed some money.

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,429
I wanted to work,

30
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,349
but I couldn't get a job anywhere
with my criminal record.

31
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,018
How much do you need?

32
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,478
Tell me!

33
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,277
-Two…
-What? Two million won?!

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,278
Two million won?!

35
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,947
You cursed punk! Two million won?!

36
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,746
Look who it is.

37
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,956
My love Mi-joo…

38
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,460
Mom, where are we going?

39
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,423
Where is she going this early?

40
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,098
Hello?

41
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,101
What?

42
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,144
Kang-ho.

43
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,064
Let's eat and get ready.

44
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,735
We'll be having a guest soon.

45
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,324
You're upsetting me right now.

46
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,161
Mom, where are we going?

47
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,838
This is Kang-ho oppa's place.

48
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,257
Ye-jin.

49
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,805
Seo-jin.

50
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,709
Mom?

51
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,129
Mom!

52
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,383
Mom?

53
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,051
Mom.

54
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,719
Mom!

55
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,762
Mom!

56
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,104
Excuse me.

57
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,731
Is this Mr. Choi Kang-ho's place?

58
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,441
Yes.

59
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,651
This is it.

60
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,821
Don't give out
his personal information to a stranger!

61
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,200
Who are you
and why are you looking for him?

62
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,120
My name is Hoang.

63
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,247
I'm supposed to meet him today,

64
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,332
but I couldn't get in touch.

65
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,794
Mom.

66
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,923
Mi-joo, my mom…

67
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,883
-What?
-Mom…

68
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,968
What's going on?

69
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,262
Mom.

70
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,807
Ms. Jin!

71
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,434
-Mom, please.
-Ms. Jin, wake up.

72
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,019
-Mom.
-Ms. Jin!

73
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,562
-Oh, no.
-No…

74
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,897
-Don't shake her like that. Please move.
-Sorry?

75
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,024
Okay.

76
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,617
She's in hypovolemic shock.

77
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,787
Hello? I'm calling from Jou-ri.

78
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,247
We have a medical emergency.

79
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,125
Kang-ho, bring me a thick blanket
and pillows.

80
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,960
Okay, a blanket and pillows.

81
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,879
-A blanket…
-How long will it take?

82
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,756
It's an emergency.

83
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,257
Please come quickly.

84
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,801
-Yes.
-Lift up her legs so the blood

85
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,470
-can get to her heart.
-Legs.

86
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,972
-Higher.
-Higher.

87
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,183
-Okay.
-You two go wait at home.

88
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,393
Is Ms. Jin dead?

89
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,645
No. Don't worry.

90
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,106
Seo-jin, go home with Ye-jin.

91
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,149
Okay?

92
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,735
Good. Get home safely.

93
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,446
Ms. Hoang.

94
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,491
-Can you stay with her for 20 minutes?
-Yes, of course.

95
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,577
Kang-ho, where's the car key?

96
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,578
The car key?

97
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,831
HAPPY FARM

98
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,173
License plate 6169, pink truck.

99
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,093
Pull over to the right. You're speeding.

100
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,887
License plate 6169, pull over!

101
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,139
-Pull up next to them.
-Yes, sir.

102
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,270
What are you doing?

103
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,772
-Pull over.
-Can't you hear me?

104
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,232
You're speeding!

105
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,317
Sir! Please help us!

106
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,611
-What?
-My mom just collapsed.

107
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,821
It's hy…

108
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,072
Hy…

109
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,740
Hypovolemic shock.

110
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,492
Hypovolemic… What?

111
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,035
-Hypovolemic shock.
-Hype?

112
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,495
What are you saying?

113
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,497
Hypovolemic shock!

114
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,041
-What?
-She's in hypovolemic shock!

115
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,501
-Hurry up and go.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,170
We're escorting an emergency patient.

117
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,172
Please make way.

118
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,137
-Put her on IV.
-What's wrong with my mom?

119
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,471
Why is she ill?

120
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,765
I'm sorry, but please wait outside.

121
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,392
No, I want to stay here.

122
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,351
Let's wait outside

123
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,978
so that she can get treated.

124
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,863
Thank you.

125
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,031
We arrived safely

126
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,450
thanks to your first aid.

127
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,785
I should thank you.

128
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,789
You drove her here
without waiting for the ambulance,

129
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,751
so my mother-in-law
could get treated quickly.

130
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,837
I see.

131
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,674
-Hey.
-Here.

132
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,926
You must be in shock.

133
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,473
We're at the hospital now,
so you can relax.

134
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,600
Thank you.

135
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,812
By the way, who are you?

136
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,651
I didn't get to introduce myself
in the midst of this chaos.

137
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:11,282
My name is Hoang,
and we were supposed to meet today.

138
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,953
Ms. Jin Young-soon's guardian?

139
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,246
-Yes?
-Yes?

140
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,708
You wanted to open
a clothing store, didn't you?

141
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,835
I'll open one for you,

142
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,005
but make a small space in a corner
for a nail salon.

143
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,798
It's not for you!

144
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,383
It's for Mi-joo!

145
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,261
I'll sell my garlic field
and whatever else to fund it,

146
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,182
so take Mi-joo and the twins
and look after them.

147
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,308
Your sister

148
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,228
will be ruined if she stays here.

149
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,812
Goodness.

150
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,611
Goodness, it smells rotten.

151
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,656
It smells like an old man.

152
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,033
Hoon-ah?

153
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,869
Are you here?

154
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,915
My goodness, this place reeks.

155
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,046
What's all this?

156
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,386
Baek Hoon-ah!

157
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,430
Goodness! What the hell are you doing?

158
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,474
Serves you right.

159
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,268
You're getting punished.

160
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,062
Right, that pig lady.

161
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,022
How's she doing these days?

162
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,942
The foot-and-mouth disease
took a toll on her,

163
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,777
but she's doing better now.

164
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,153
Not that.

165
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,572
Then what? Her son?

166
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,199
That woman.

167
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,159
Good grief, how frustrating!

168
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,327
What?

169
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,912
She hasn't told anybody?

170
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,872
She's still keeping it a secret?

171
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,000
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,377
A secret?

173
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,505
She's critically ill?

174
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,091
She has stage four stomach cancer.

175
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,761
The cancer cells have metastasized
to her peritoneum and lungs,

176
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,971
so there's…

177
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,931
Excuse me.

178
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,727
I'm sorry, Doctor,

179
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,645
but please speak with me.

180
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,026
It's tough for him to understand
what you're saying right now.

181
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,405
I'm a friend of his and--

182
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,906
No.

183
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,160
Please speak with me. I want to hear it.

184
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,120
I'm…

185
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,664
I'm my mom's guardian.

186
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,547
Kang-ho, wait.

187
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,762
Kang-ho!

188
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,065
Mom, get up.

189
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,985
Mom, get up. Come with me.

190
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,363
Mom, let's go home.

191
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,281
Kang-ho, don't do this.

192
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,493
Come home with me, Mom.

193
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,495
Mom, open your eyes!

194
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,792
Mom…

195
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,172
Mom, I'm sorry.

196
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,217
I'll do as you say from now on.

197
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,385
I won't…

198
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,136
I won't be a prosecutor anymore.

199
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,597
Mom, please get up.

200
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,015
-Kang-ho, stop it.
-Mom.

201
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,435
Mom, I won't like Mi-joo anymore,
just as you wanted.

202
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,522
I won't like Mi-joo anymore.

203
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,274
Mom, so please, wake up.

204
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,946
Wake up, Mom.

205
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,495
Hey, Andrea.

206
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,207
I think

207
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,293
you set me up with the wrong guy.

208
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,339
Is anybody…

209
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,219
up there?

210
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,597
Is anyone…

211
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,809
really up there?

212
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,522
I know you can be cruel,

213
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,608
but this is way too harsh.

214
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,653
Wasn't it enough

215
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,947
to take her husband

216
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,534
and make her son like that?

217
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,123
What did that good woman ever do?

218
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,749
Goodness.

219
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,462
How could you try to take her life too?

220
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,755
Grandma!

221
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,053
Grandma, where have you been?

222
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,806
We looked everywhere for you.

223
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,767
Ms. Jin collapsed!

224
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,019
She collapsed?

225
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,020
When?

226
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:51,979
This morning.

227
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,983
Mom and Kang-ho oppa
took her to the hospital.

228
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,239
YOUNGEST DAUGHTER MI-JOO

229
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,369
Gimbap with no carrots.

230
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,579
Eat some.

231
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,751
Everyone Mom made gimbap for

232
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,962
never returned home.

233
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,966
Grandma, Grandpa,

234
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,511
and Dad too.

235
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,598
That's why she never let me go
on a school picnic.

236
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,851
She was afraid I wouldn't return.

237
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,942
So my mom isn't a bad person.

238
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,610
You're right.

239
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,530
She's not a bad person.

240
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,491
Then why is she ill?

241
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,665
I'm getting punished
because I'm a bad person.

242
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,252
But why is my mom being punished?

243
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,964
No, Kang-ho.

244
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,008
Neither of you

245
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,095
is getting punished.

246
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,722
This is…

247
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,810
something that nobody wants,

248
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,438
but something that can happen to anybody.

249
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,192
Just as Ms. Jin was there for you

250
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,404
when you were unwell,

251
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,489
it's your turn

252
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,992
to stay strong by her side.

253
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,161
Okay?

254
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,174
She's going to be fine.

255
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,052
She'll be okay.

256
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,053
Hey!

257
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,389
Hey, get away from him!

258
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,059
What are you two doing in broad daylight?

259
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,185
Mom.

260
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,770
Hello.

261
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,689
I'm afraid I don't have time
to exchange greetings.

262
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,108
Where's your mom?

263
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,864
I'll stay here.

264
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,450
You should go home
and look after your kids.

265
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,659
Listen, Mom.

266
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,123
Go home.

267
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,208
You darn brat.

268
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,127
You crazy bitch.

269
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,671
I ought to…

270
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,174
Lead the way.

271
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,935
Ma'am, what are you doing?

272
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,771
You can't do this.

273
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,982
Let go of me!

274
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,610
Doctor.

275
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,404
Will I live if I get this IV shot?

276
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,990
Will I live if I stay in bed?

277
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,743
If not, let me go.

278
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,662
Help me make the best use

279
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,123
of the time I have left.

280
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,875
I have…

281
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,044
I have no time to be here.

282
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,506
I was supposed to meet
my son's future bride today.

283
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,133
What time is it right now?

284
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,718
Goodness.

285
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,928
Oh, no.

286
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,639
My goodness.

287
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,349
Goodness.

288
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,851
My goodness, why is this happening?

289
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,812
My goodness.

290
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,398
My goodness.

291
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,441
My goodness. Oh, no.

292
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,735
My goodness.

293
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,364
Things were finally beginning to
look up for you.

294
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,327
Do you see the tear here?

295
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,955
And you dare sell this
as an authentic item?

296
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,041
I thought of reporting you
but decided to refrain.

297
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,876
I want a refund.

298
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,546
I'm so sorry,

299
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,133
but how do I know if there was
something wrong with the stitch work

300
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,551
because of what I did

301
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,927
-or what you--
-I'll report it.

302
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,847
I'm not looking to nitpick over that.

303
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,476
I need cash to give you a refund,

304
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,272
but as you can see, I don't have…

305
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,732
You have exactly two million.

306
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,941
Sorry?

307
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,901
BALANCE 2,000,000 WON

308
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,280
PARK SUNG-AE

309
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,868
I'm busy. What do you want?

310
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,579
Why did you deposit money
without my permission?

311
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,665
-Pay it back.
-Okay.

312
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,253
Mom, while you're at it,
can you lend me some more?

313
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,718
Gosh, my mom can be so cool.

314
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,475
It looks brand new.

315
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,310
Who did this to the bag?

316
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,773
What is this?

317
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,692
What the…

318
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,529
What is this?

319
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,914
"DNA Test Result"?

320
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,030
Hello, Ms. Hoang.

321
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,199
It's me, Kang-ho's mom.

322
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,661
I didn't have my phone with me
so I couldn't call you.

323
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,498
I'm so sorry about this morning.

324
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,794
I heard from my son
that you came to the hospital with him.

325
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,088
Sorry?

326
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,756
What do you mean?

327
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,634
Nonsense.

328
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,303
It's a misunderstanding.

329
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,432
Mi-joo is just a childhood friend.

330
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,143
Don't be like that. Let's meet.

331
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,103
Let's talk in person.

332
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,688
Ms. Hoang?

333
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,439
Ms. Hoang?

334
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,203
Mom, where are you going?

335
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,831
Stay here.

336
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,875
No, Mom. You're very ill right now.

337
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,086
Yes.

338
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,089
You heard it from the doctor, right?

339
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,175
I'm very ill right now.

340
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,968
So please,

341
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,720
just stay here.

342
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,399
Did you tell him?

343
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,318
What?

344
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,071
Didn't you go to tell him
that he's Ye-jin and Seo-jin's father?

345
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,156
I did.

346
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,952
At the very least,
I thought Ms. Jin should know.

347
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,662
Goodness.

348
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,747
This is bad.

349
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,874
But…

350
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,377
I couldn't tell her

351
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,087
because she collapsed.

352
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,173
You couldn't?

353
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,883
Wait.

354
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,509
You didn't tell her?

355
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,596
Goodness gracious.

356
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,973
Thank you, deities of heaven and earth.

357
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,351
What a relief.

358
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,727
You should

359
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,064
take the kids
and go live with your eldest sister.

360
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,900
I talked to her, and she agreed.

361
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,195
You can open up a nail salon there.

362
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,240
Listen.

363
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,952
It's not just Kang-ho anymore.
His mom is unwell too.

364
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,955
Do you want to waste your life
looking after people?

365
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,790
-Mom, come on!
-Yes.

366
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,084
I'm your mom.

367
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,630
And my daughter is about to ruin her life,
so what wouldn't I say to stop you?

368
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,673
Mom.

369
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,384
You must be mistaken.

370
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,302
Listen carefully.

371
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,304
I'm

372
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,390
never getting back with him.

373
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,893
What you're imagining right now
will never happen.

374
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:10,852
Yes.

375
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,773
I plan to live happily with my kids.

376
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,816
Right?

377
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,526
You will, right?

378
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,568
But…

379
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,071
I won't run away either.

380
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,407
Why should I?

381
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,575
Why should Ye-jin and Seo-jin do that?

382
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,077
Mi-joo.

383
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,957
Mi-joo, are you there?

384
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,252
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

385
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,547
Do you remember that young lady
who came to the hospital?

386
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,716
Yes. Ms. Hoang, right?

387
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
Yes, that's her.

388
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,386
She's going to

389
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,556
marry Kang-ho.

390
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,225
Yes, I know.

391
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,644
You do?

392
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,980
You already knew?

393
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,690
Then why did you do that?

394
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,985
Sorry? What did I do?

395
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,278
I mean,

396
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,198
what did you do to make her say

397
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,035
she won't marry him because of you?

398
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,120
Mi-joo.

399
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,997
I asked you to help me.

400
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,458
I told you about my situation

401
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,376
and asked you to help me.

402
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,463
Then you shouldn't have ruined this.

403
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,923
Why do you

404
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,761
always ruin Kang-ho's future?

405
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,807
Who's ruining whose future?

406
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,850
Mom.

407
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,935
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

408
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,274
How could you torment my kid
for the sake of your kid?

409
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,193
Mom, stop it.

410
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,360
You also did that

411
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,738
when she got into that accident!

412
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,448
How was it her fault

413
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,325
that Kang-ho didn't take the exam?

414
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,951
She was hurt badly!

415
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,329
Why do you blame everything on my child?

416
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,499
But I still put up with you

417
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,377
because I knew
what you went through raising him.

418
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,463
Yet you're going this far?

419
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,091
Do you have any idea

420
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,343
-who ruined whose future?
-Mom! Stop!

421
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,929
Go back inside. Please!

422
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,764
-Darn it.
-Go inside.

423
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,766
Go.

424
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,646
Go inside.

425
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,774
Take a good look.
Don't you remember this bag?

426
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,025
I don't know.

427
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,611
Hey, sit back down.

428
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:28,115
Don't be so half-hearted again. Goodness.

429
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,826
You gave this bag to your mom

430
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,411
on the day you brought
your fiancée to introduce to her.

431
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,704
Assemblyman Oh's daughter.

432
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,415
Why do you have the bag
I bought for my mom?

433
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,875
Did you steal this too?

434
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,794
Of course not.

435
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,005
Your mom gave it to my mom.

436
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,799
I'm serious!

437
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,968
You don't trust me?

438
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,887
-Should I call my mom?
-So what is it that you want to say?

439
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,264
Yes, right.

440
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,683
What I wanted to say was…

441
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,936
Do you know what this is?

442
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,564
Take a good look.

443
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,066
I do.

444
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,193
-Do you know whose this is?
-No.

445
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,028
Right, you don't.

446
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,032
Well, while we're on the subject…

447
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,742
Ta-da!

448
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,162
We're about to look at this together.

449
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,372
Why should I do that with you?

450
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,668
Well, because…

451
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,839
Kang-ho, you said
you wanted to be a prosecutor.

452
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,799
Take a look.

453
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,634
"DNA Test Result."

454
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,845
It's a test result.

455
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,557
It's a test that shows if you have the DNA

456
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,017
to be a prosecutor.

457
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,644
And the result is right in here. Got it?

458
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,479
I'm not going to be a prosecutor anymore.

459
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,149
-My mom doesn't approve.
-Darn it.

460
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,776
Yes, right.

461
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,736
You won't, right?

462
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,364
So let's find out if your DNA says
you don't have to be a prosecutor.

463
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,033
Please just do the damn thing.

464
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,619
When I click this file here,

465
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,121
I have to type in a password.

466
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,165
-Do you know it?
-Zero, nine, zero, seven.

467
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,374
Zero, nine, zero, seven?

468
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,629
I didn't expect it'd go so smoothly…

469
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,422
I knew it, you punk.

470
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,883
-That's not it.
-Zero, three, one, two.

471
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,552
Zero, three… Okay, zero, three, one, two.

472
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,553
I have a good feeling…

473
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,471
ENTER PASSWORD

474
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,056
…about nothing.

475
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,016
Damn it, that's not it either.

476
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,142
Get it together!

477
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,478
Think again. Hurry.

478
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,856
CAPTAIN BAE

479
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,571
Keep trying.

480
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,242
Goodness, sir.

481
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,954
I was about to give you a call just now.

482
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,538
I'll let you talk alone then.

483
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,395
ENTER PASSWORD:
DKQJWL

484
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,944
Darn it, what the heck?

485
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,571
Move aside.

486
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,949
Sam-sik, look.

487
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,033
What?

488
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,202
-No way! You opened it?
-I…

489
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,788
My gosh, Kang-ho! My dear Kang-ho!

490
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,373
My smart fiancée.

491
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,333
Good.

492
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,544
All right, let's take a look.

493
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,005
Before we do that,

494
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,590
we should get rid of everything

495
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,925
-that can hurt us.
-What?

496
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,760
It's a voice recording, not a video.

497
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:40,140
Will you get rid of the original
DNA test result in front of me?

498
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,101
-Come on. Getting rid of that paper
-This guy.

499
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,811
-won't change anything.
-Who's this?

500
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,104
This guy.

501
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,732
He'll get rid of them
as if they never existed.

502
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,567
My son will do that.

503
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,193
Right?

504
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,779
I'll take care of it.

505
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,282
That's your voice, Kang-ho. Right?

506
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,826
I'll let you talk alone then.

507
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,920
Is that all?

508
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,132
Are you suggesting that
we kill Hwang Soo-hyun?

509
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,051
We can't just get rid of the mother.

510
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,428
The kid must go too.

511
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,597
This won't cause trouble, right?

512
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,894
The mighty Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo
is scared of something like this?

513
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,437
Don't worry.

514
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,439
Even if it does cause trouble later,

515
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,733
Kang-ho will take the fall.

516
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,402
That's why I keep him around.

517
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,530
Then I'll be counting on you,
Chairman Song.

518
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,115
Sure.

519
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,952
What are they talking about?

520
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,083
So this

521
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,585
belongs to Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo?

522
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,630
Yes!

523
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,924
This is it.

524
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,175
Sam-sik.

525
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,844
What is this?

526
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,764
Who are they? Why am I talking about
this stuff with them?

527
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,766
I already told you.

528
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,893
You were going to marry

529
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,978
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo's daughter.

530
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:15,193
Then who's Hwang Soo-hyun?

531
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,112
Did I do something to her?

532
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,073
You said you'd take care of her.

533
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,201
So what did you do to her?

534
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,203
You didn't

535
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,122
kill her or anything, right?

536
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,586
Hey.

537
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,712
What are you doing?

538
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,714
-This is mine.
-So what will you do?

539
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,344
I don't know.

540
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,639
But I feel like
I need to find out what this is.

541
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,434
-My mom might know.
-No.

542
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,436
Hey, you idiot. Are you stupid?

543
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,272
If your mom knew about this,

544
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,734
would she have given this bag to my mom?

545
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,195
I understand how you feel.

546
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,906
Of course, you'd want to know.

547
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,867
Okay.

548
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,494
Let's do this.

549
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,912
I'll find out for you.

550
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,165
-You will?
-Yes.

551
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,668
I'll meet and ask them myself.

552
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,545
Think about it.

553
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:19,048
There's a possibility
that you really did something very bad.

554
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:23,011
And if you did and your mom finds out,
she'll be greatly shocked.

555
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,137
Don't you think so?

556
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,769
-What are you doing?
-Listen up.

557
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,772
I have to know what this is.

558
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,608
So if you deceive me
and do something weird again,

559
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,110
I won't let it slide, okay?

560
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,321
Okay.

561
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,162
Here's the password.

562
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,622
Okay.

563
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,626
D, K, Q…

564
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,838
That spells "father."

565
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,724
Mom is ill.

566
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,727
By the way, Dad,

567
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,564
who are you?

568
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,696
Why was I reminded of you

569
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,617
when I heard those scary words?

570
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,789
I've never even met you.

571
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,421
So why do I miss you?

572
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,803
Why does my heart…

573
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,392
ache so much?

574
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,288
Who are you, Dad?

575
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,127
And who am I?

576
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,550
What do I have to do?

577
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,197
There you were, Kang-ho.

578
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,542
How are you?

579
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,669
Are you happy?

580
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,178
Your dad was really in love with me.

581
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,847
What? It's true.

582
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,352
He used to follow me around

583
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,520
asking me to hug and kiss him.

584
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,272
Gosh, it was so bothersome.

585
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,984
He'd never spend a second away from me.

586
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,905
Just like you, Kang-ho.

587
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,912
Come to think about it,
you take after your dad a lot.

588
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,665
Your stubbornness

589
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,167
and strong determination
all come from him.

590
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,379
But your dad

591
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,799
wasn't always that strong.

592
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,593
He cried very easily.

593
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,136
He'd always

594
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,140
rub my big belly while you were in my womb

595
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,268
and cry saying he missed you,

596
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,770
that he loved you,

597
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,647
and that he was sorry.

598
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,404
Then you'd begin to kick in there.

599
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,408
"Mom, Dad, I'm here."

600
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,160
"I can see everything from here!"

601
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,579
It was as if you were answering.

602
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,589
I wanted to

603
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,551
grow old together with him.

604
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,974
But our time was cut very short.

605
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,645
Kang-ho.

606
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,731
Later on,

607
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,402
when I die, please bury me
next to your dad.

608
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:55,033
I want to be with him for a long time.

609
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,702
-Mom.
-Kang-ho.

610
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:01,497
When you get married and have kids,
will you visit us with them?

611
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,459
I'm sure they'll be adorable.

612
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:10,006
Your child will grow up,
go to school, and get married.

613
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:18,181
And you'll grow older
and become a dad, and then a grandpa.

614
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,600
Mom and Dad

615
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,560
will watch over you

616
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,229
from this round mound.

617
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,233
No, we'll protect you.

618
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,364
So Kang-ho,

619
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,701
don't feel lonely even when I'm gone.

620
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,080
You aren't alone.

621
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,831
Okay?

622
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,001
Mom, why are you so mean?

623
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,466
I know, Mom.

624
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,136
I know everything.

625
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,475
But do you have to say that?

626
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,185
Just say,

627
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,438
"It's all right. This is nothing."

628
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,234
"I can fight this and win.
I'll get better."

629
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,736
Why can't you just say that?

630
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,615
Why do you always…

631
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,618
Why…

632
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,996
Why do you always say things
that hurt me right here?

633
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,417
Why do you always make me do tough things?

634
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,006
Why do you always do everything your way?

635
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,595
Cooking, doing the laundry,

636
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,181
farming, and banking.

637
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,600
After you teach me everything
like a mother pig,

638
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,353
you'll go somewhere nice without me.

639
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,524
I don't want that!

640
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,652
No!

641
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,030
Then I won't do anything.

642
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,617
No, I'd rather not know
how to do anything.

643
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,454
I'm just going to
live my life like an idiot.

644
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,958
So Mom, you can't leave me!

645
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,006
Mom, please.

646
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,885
Please don't leave me, Mom.

647
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,890
Mom.

648
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,350
Mom, just…

649
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,188
Just a little…

650
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,148
Just stay a little longer.

651
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,531
Mom…

652
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,992
Okay.

653
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,746
I'll take my time.

654
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,040
I will leave…

655
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,293
very, very slowly.

656
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,047
So let's not be sad

657
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,091
and let's not cry.

658
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,761
Let's not be like that.

659
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,183
I want to spend
every minute and second I have left

660
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,062
being happy with you.

661
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,688
Okay?

662
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,993
Who is it?

663
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:44,929
Gum-ja.

664
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,014
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,519
I felt sorry for Kang-ho
for growing up without a dad.

666
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,356
I didn't want him
to feel his dad's absence,

667
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,109
so I've been selfish.

668
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,028
After he became the way he is,

669
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:05,157
I finally realized
my love for him was misguided.

670
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,786
But I haven't really changed.

671
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,622
You were right.

672
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,167
Your child is as precious as mine.

673
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,838
I've hurt Mi-joo…

674
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,466
very deeply.

675
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,637
Even after everything you've done for me.

676
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,516
I'm sorry for hurting you.

677
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,476
Please forgive me.

678
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,355
Goodness.

679
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,569
There's no need to kneel.

680
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,697
You aren't even well.

681
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,325
Get up.

682
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,951
Stand up.

683
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,245
Stand up already.

684
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,371
Get up.

685
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,582
Gum-ja.

686
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,251
Am I really going to die?

687
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,755
I'm scared.

688
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,674
What do I do?

689
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,760
What do I do, Gum-ja?

690
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,220
Please let me live.

691
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,973
Please let me live.

692
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,476
Please help me live.

693
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,603
Goodness, you poor thing.

694
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,570
Please let me live.

695
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,490
Please let me live.

696
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,538
One day, you're going to die by my hands.

697
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,084
I'll probably die of anxiety before then.

698
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,544
-Goodness!
-Hey!

699
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,338
-This is amazing!
-Excuse me.

700
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,090
Please give the brewery

701
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,342
-a lot of time on air.
-Are you wearing makeup?

702
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,469
I heard you need to put on makeup
to be on TV.

703
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,849
We've never had
such a joyous occasion before.

704
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,268
I can't believe our village will be on TV!

705
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,313
I'm sorry to say this,

706
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,441
but I don't think we can be seen on TV.

707
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,442
See?

708
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,404
I knew it. I was right, wasn't I?

709
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,490
I was suspicious of you
from the moment we met.

710
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,951
They're here to hide
because they did something bad.

711
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,453
What the hell is wrong with you?

712
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,456
Don't say something so dreadful
about these wonderful men

713
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,833
who brought honor to Jou-ri.

714
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,544
Look at them.

715
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,963
Does he look like someone
who's up to no good?

716
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:27,758
His eyes are so kind, just like cow eyes.

717
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,386
And his last name also means cow.

718
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,347
See? He's just like a cow.

719
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:38,769
Anyway, we don't have a particular secret.

720
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,896
All we ever did was water them.

721
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,106
Right?

722
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,024
We didn't…

723
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,444
just water them.

724
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,738
"As makgeolli ferments,
the soil becomes aerobic

725
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,450
and grows many beneficial bacteria
and prevents diseases."

726
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,037
You were so cool.
How did you come up with that?

727
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,247
Just pack up.

728
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,792
We have to beg the chairman
for forgiveness

729
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,336
before the program goes on air.

730
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,505
Otherwise, we'll become manure
for the lettuce.

731
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,007
Let's go

732
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,845
Let's go to Seoul

733
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,723
Just go.

734
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,143
Just drive by.

735
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,729
Just go.

736
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,731
Just go.

737
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,983
Just go!

738
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,861
Mr. Cha!

739
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,447
We'll look suspicious if we just go.

740
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,865
Let's say bye before we go.

741
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,661
Hello.

742
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,872
So and Cha, where are you going?

743
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,416
We have to go to Seoul for business.

744
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,627
-Seoul?
-Yes.

745
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,295
Should I play some music?

746
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,923
Sorry, sir.

747
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,676
I was on my way to Seoul too.

748
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,054
Isn't this great?

749
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,098
Do you know where Seongbuk-dong is?

750
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,768
I know it rather well.
Are you headed there?

751
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,353
Yes, to Assemblyman Oh's place.

752
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,399
What's wrong with you?

753
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,526
You scared me.

754
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,653
Why are you going there?

755
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,906
I'm a huge fan and supporter,

756
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,075
so I wanted to show him my support.

757
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,245
Right here. This is where I'm going.

758
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,262
Hey, fiancée.

759
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,055
What happened? Did you meet him?

760
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,432
Yes, I just met him.

761
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,102
I'll call you once I'm done.

762
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,103
Sam-sik.

763
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,105
You better not screw it up.

764
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,064
I won't.

765
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,999
Congratulations on your wedding tomorrow.

766
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,521
Help!

767
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,483
Are you all right?

768
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,860
-I'm sorry.
-Help!

769
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,445
-Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
-Goodness.

770
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,946
Should I call an ambulance?

771
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,240
DNA TEST RESULT

772
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,412
This is going to scar.

773
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,290
My mom never let
anything like this happen to me.

774
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,543
What's this?

775
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,170
It says it right there.

776
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:54,632
"DNA Test Result."

777
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,092
Even an idiot can read it.

778
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,846
Exactly.

779
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,223
So what is this?

780
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:07,144
I'm about to let you listen to
what this is all about.

781
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:15,778
Will you get rid of the original
DNA test result in front of me?

782
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,076
She's using earphones,
so I cannot confirm the content.

783
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:29,375
I was torn
between giving this to your father

784
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,503
and handing it over to Bareun Hanguk Party

785
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,963
who's dying to take him down.

786
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,007
I pondered it deeply.

787
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,759
But I decided to give you

788
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,054
a chance to be a good daughter
right before your wedding.

789
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,517
Hey.

790
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,727
What are you trying to pull?

791
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:53,816
What are you doing? That's mine!

792
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,819
You just said it was my dad's.

793
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,785
Choi Kang-ho had this.

794
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:09,373
A prosecutor like him
wouldn't keep a fake, would he?

795
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,503
What the hell do you want?

796
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,176
So I had to mention him
to get your attention.

797
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,597
I want 200 million.

798
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,308
Right, I have to pay Mom back.

799
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:29,852
And two million.

800
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,646
I want 202 million won in cash.

801
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,446
You know what will happen
if you have another copy, right?

802
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,823
I'll probably be found dead

803
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,033
in some mountains.

804
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,124
I'll see you here in an hour.

805
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,892
Hey, fiancée.

806
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,435
I just talked to her.

807
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,020
She was taken aback at your name.

808
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,521
There's definitely something going on.

809
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,940
I'll look more into this and call…

810
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,525
Damn it.

811
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,860
Okay, Sam-sik.

812
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,738
Okay, bye.

813
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,241
What are you doing?

814
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,494
Sam-sik.

815
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,411
Sam-sik?

816
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,248
Mom. I'll do it.

817
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,541
Let me.

818
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,584
Okay.

819
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,129
Mom, I'll do it.

820
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,762
Mom!

821
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,680
Mom, I'll do it.

822
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,766
What's the number?

823
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,808
All right.

824
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,353
You said you wouldn't do anything.

825
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,146
But you're unwell.

826
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,524
Don't worry. I'm fine.

827
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,442
Ms. Jin!

828
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,861
Ms. Jin!

829
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,406
You're here. I was about to call you.

830
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,866
What did the vet say?

831
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,160
Those are signs of MMA.

832
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,371
Give them these anti-inflammatory shots,

833
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,874
and the prospects are that
they will get well in a couple of days.

834
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,043
-That's a relief.
-Mom.

835
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,753
Give it to me. I'll do it.

836
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,381
But you're afraid of giving shots.

837
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,467
I'll just grit my teeth
and stick it in at once.

838
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,844
I'll go with you.

839
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,771
Excuse me.

840
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,483
Have you seen the man
who was sitting there?

841
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,985
No, I haven't.

842
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,825
Please don't hit me!

843
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,952
RECENTS
FIANCÉE

844
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,370
I didn't hit you.

845
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,205
Oh, you didn't?

846
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,332
I'm…

847
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,375
I'm sorry.

848
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,548
So Choi Kang-ho had this?

849
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,882
Yes.

850
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,469
That idiot wouldn't have sent you here.

851
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,555
Who was it?

852
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,348
Who sent you here?

853
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,436
You must be Woobyeok.

854
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,521
No, sir.

855
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,689
I'm Sam-sik.

856
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,982
Samsik?

857
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,318
Hey, what's Samsik?

858
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,777
Look it up.

859
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,115
No, sir.

860
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,784
My name is Sam-sik.

861
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,910
Bang Sam-sik.

862
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,124
So you will keep your mouth shut?

863
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,796
Okay, take it to the grave.

864
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,549
-Sir.
-Get rid of him.

865
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,676
I just opened my mouth! What do I…

866
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,803
Knife!

867
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,865
So…

868
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:12,949
So and Cha?

869
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,297
What the hell?

870
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,468
What the…

871
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:37,891
Darn it!

872
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,987
So and Cha?

873
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,659
Damn it.

874
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,382
Drop the weapons.

875
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,717
Drop the weapons!

876
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,451
Damn it.

877
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,543
Are you okay?

878
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,669
Damn it.

879
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,504
Damn it.

880
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,224
Damn it!

881
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,021
My goodness.

882
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,190
I'm sorry you're hurt because of me.

883
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:12,569
Why did those damned bastards
have to use knives?

884
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,404
I was scared to death.

885
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,698
I almost wet myself.

886
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,285
Goodness, speaking of which,
let me go take a leak.

887
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,373
Kang-ho will take the fall.

888
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,168
That's why I keep him around.

889
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,054
Are you sure it was Song Woo-byeok?

890
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,013
Yes, sir.

891
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,807
I saw Mr. So.

892
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,561
That wicked old snake.

893
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,816
Where's Ha-young?

894
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,668
What's that?

895
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,887
I won't make excuses.

896
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,849
It was a mistake.

897
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,309
Killing an innocent woman
and her baby was a mistake?

898
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,435
Choi Kang-ho did that.

899
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,521
You put him up to it.

900
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,816
You're a terrifying person.

901
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,444
You kill and get rid of everyone
who gets in your way.

902
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,404
And Kang-ho…

903
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,575
He ended up like that
after being used by you.

904
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,541
Ha-young, you must be quite scared.

905
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,961
Yes, of course, you are.

906
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,923
Since you slipped Kang-ho sleeping pills
and tried to kill him.

907
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,595
-That was--
-Are you going to say

908
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,138
that I put you up to that too?

909
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,140
No.

910
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,308
You took

911
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,768
revenge on him because you felt betrayed

912
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,521
when you found out
he was using you to take me down.

913
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,315
It was your decision

914
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,483
to do it.

915
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,286
But Ha-young,

916
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,372
it's all in the past.

917
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,791
Besides,

918
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,003
the evidence that could be used against me
is now in my hands.

919
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,047
With Kang-ho in that state,

920
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,215
no one can prove it

921
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,844
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

922
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,181
Do you understand?

923
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,605
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

924
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,898
You came.

925
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,610
Thank you for coming.

926
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,695
Goodness, congratulations.

927
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,787
You came. I didn't invite you
thinking it'd be uncomfortable for you.

928
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,038
Right?

929
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,249
If you texted me the wedding invitation,

930
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,169
I would've just wired you
the congratulatory money.

931
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:20,465
I didn't know how else to give it to you,
so I brought it here myself.

932
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:26,638
The husband is quite
tall and handsome, isn't he?

933
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,809
So do you like
your future son-in-law this time?

934
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:32,936
Yes.

935
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,813
Good, you should.

936
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,357
That way they can live happily

937
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,276
without getting into
an unexpected accident, right?

938
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,365
I'll be heading inside now.

939
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,117
The steak here is amazing.

940
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,785
You must know that.

941
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,874
-Hello.
-Hello.

942
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,042
Thank you for coming.

943
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,671
The bride looks so stiff.

944
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,923
Please relax and smile a little.

945
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,174
Come on, smile.

946
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,053
Here comes the groom.

947
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,348
-Congrats!
-Looking good!

948
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,766
Congrats!

949
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,851
Next,

950
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,478
please welcome the beautiful bride.

951
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,564
Here comes the bride!

952
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,703
Excuse me!

953
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,872
When will you serve the steak?

954
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,416
Goodness gracious.

955
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,765
Ha-young, here.

956
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,849
Oh my, Ji-u.

957
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,809
Is this for me?

958
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,227
Thank you so much.

959
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,230
It's not from me. It's from that man over…

960
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,150
What? Where did he go?

961
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,074
The bride is gone.

962
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,659
I'll look for her once again.

963
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:26,883
Are you ready?

964
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,052
I just need to get dressed.

965
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,513
By the way, where are we going?

966
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,556
On a date.

967
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,391
-A date?
-Yes.

968
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,727
So you need to look your best.

969
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,313
-My best.
-Yes.

970
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,078
Ma'am?

971
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,664
-Yes?
-Your payment went through.

972
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,791
-Okay.
-Thank you.

973
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,803
Please leave your message after the beep

974
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,722
and press the asterisk once you're done.

975
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,975
Sam-sik, why aren't you picking up?

976
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,935
Is something going on?

977
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,482
Give me a call, okay? I'll be waiting.

978
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:25,960
What's this?

979
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:42,936
Kang-ho.

980
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,314
Mom, you look…

981
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,107
What do you think? Don't I look pretty?

982
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,777
Yes.

983
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,403
Very pretty.

984
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,698
It's cold.

985
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,284
-I'm fine.
-It's not fine.

986
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,453
You have to keep warm.

987
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,622
Like this.

988
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,126
All set. Let's go.

989
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,344
Did you want to go on a date with me?

990
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,516
I realized

991
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,478
I never had a chance to eat out with you.

992
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,439
We've never been to the movies,

993
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,567
a karaoke room,

994
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,151
or on a trip.

995
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,029
So we're going to do everything now.

996
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,449
Look.

997
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,326
I made a list

998
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,745
of everything I want to do.

999
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,000
THINGS TO DO WITH MY SON

1000
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,084
What do you think?

1001
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,794
Will you do them with me?

1002
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,338
Yes, I'll do everything.

1003
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,506
Okay.

1004
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,091
Excuse me!

1005
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,553
Give us two more servings

1006
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,138
of your best ribeye please.

1007
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,932
And also a bottle of makgeolli please.

1008
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:03,891
What?

1009
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,226
Come on, Mom.

1010
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,687
I'm an adult.

1011
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,939
I'm your guardian.

1012
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,358
But you can't drink.

1013
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,359
Never.

1014
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,695
Okay.

1015
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,864
Yes, you're my guardian

1016
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,866
and an adult.

1017
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,784
-Yes.
-Gosh.

1018
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,703
We'll take a large bottle of makgeolli.

1019
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:29,250
Then just one glass
with the large bottle please.

1020
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,212
-I want some too.
-No, just have the meat.

1021
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,132
Kim Min-jeong reports.

1022
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,551
The body discovered by Lee,
who was fishing at night

1023
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,596
on Jemyeon Island on the 8th,
was highly decomposed and…

1024
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,722
Honey!

1025
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,807
Honey, wait!

1026
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,647
You damn brat.

1027
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,485
Stop it!

1028
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,405
Stop it!

1029
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,075
-Have you gone insane?
-That bitch is the insane one!

1030
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:06,079
How dare you tarnish my reputation?

1031
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,415
Get in here!

1032
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,919
Lock her up in a hospital

1033
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,046
and keep her there
until the election is over!

1034
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,172
Yes, sir.

1035
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,804
-Sir.
-Yes?

1036
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,264
We checked,

1037
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,517
and it was Hwang Soo-hyun.

1038
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,353
The police began the investigation

1039
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,729
as a possible murder case.

1040
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,566
Damn it!

1041
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,667
-Hey.
-Yes.

1042
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,047
We need to do something.

1043
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,049
FIANCÉE

1044
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,392
Your call could not be completed
and will be transferred to…

1045
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,977
I was a fool to trust him.

1046
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,895
Darn it.

1047
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,149
Mom?

1048
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,402
I want to sleep here tonight.

1049
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,987
I have to protect you.

1050
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,030
I'd love that.

1051
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,492
Come on in, Mr. Guardian.

1052
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,207
Mr. Guardian.

1053
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,043
Yes?

1054
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:41,841
Thank you for our date today.

1055
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,219
It made me very happy.

1056
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,806
Your wish is my command.

1057
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,309
I'll do everything for you.

1058
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:52,852
Really?

1059
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,395
Yes.

1060
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:58,191
In that case,

1061
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,403
sing for me.

1062
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:03,988
Sing?

1063
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,406
Yes.

1064
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,329
But I can't sing.

1065
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,040
I can't.

1066
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,543
What? You said you'd do anything for me.

1067
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,423
It was always my wish to hear my son sing.

1068
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,260
Sing for me.

1069
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:31,432
Please sing for me.

1070
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,975
-Okay.
-Please.

1071
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,101
Okay.

1072
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:46,906
A tiring day passed by

1073
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,327
Two are under the moonlight

1074
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,540
As one shadow

1075
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,085
That distant happiness is

1076
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:04,799
Still there seemingly within my reach

1077
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,552
When I

1078
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,472
Close my eyes

1079
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,812
-My wounded heart…
-My wounded heart

1080
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,774
May cast a shadow

1081
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:26,821
Upon your dream

1082
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,282
Please remember…

1083
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,037
Why are you singing
such a heartbreaking song?

1084
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,456
You're not asleep?

1085
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,209
Let me check your fever.

1086
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,421
What a relief. It went down a little.

1087
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,424
I'm sorry.

1088
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:49,176
It must be because
I brought you out in the cold

1089
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,262
before I dried your hair properly.

1090
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,931
-Mom.
-Yes?

1091
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,058
I already know.

1092
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:57,935
About what?

1093
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,396
About Dad.

1094
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,858
-Dad?
-Yes.

1095
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:07,737
So you can be honest with me.

1096
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,241
Did you hear something?

1097
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,454
I don't have to hear it to know.
It's obvious to me.

1098
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,664
Ye-jin.

1099
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,918
Well, the thing is…

1100
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,252
Dad

1101
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,630
had an affair, right?

1102
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,214
What?

1103
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,967
This is why a married couple
shouldn't live apart.

1104
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,470
What are you talking about?

1105
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,639
It's nothing like that.

1106
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,975
It is.

1107
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,894
He's never called us once

1108
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:41,479
since that brief visit.

1109
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:44,231
Doesn't he miss us at all?

1110
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:45,816
Ye-jin.

1111
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,193
That's because…

1112
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,278
But you know,

1113
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,698
I don't miss him that much either.

1114
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,241
What?

1115
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,619
Maybe it's because
we've been apart for so long.

1116
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,498
He feels like a stranger.

1117
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,959
I don't feel attached to him.

1118
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,253
So I wanted you to know that

1119
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,508
you don't have to put up with him
because of us.

1120
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,677
Just get a divorce.

1121
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,180
Being divorced is not a big deal nowadays.

1122
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,350
There are three divorced families

1123
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,477
in my kindergarten.

1124
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,897
At first, they threw a fit
and even refused to eat,

1125
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,150
but now they run about happier than ever.

1126
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,111
It's such a mess.

1127
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:33,030
So,

1128
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,201
stop worrying about us

1129
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,787
and start living your own life.

1130
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,001
If there's one thing
I learned in all my years,

1131
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,670
it's that there isn't much to life.

1132
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,423
You just have to live happily

1133
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,718
with the people you love, right?

1134
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,846
You love us.

1135
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,932
And we love you too.

1136
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:02,309
So please,

1137
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,564
let's just live happily by ourselves.

1138
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,693
I'll marry Kang-ho oppa in the future

1139
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,320
and take good care of you.

1140
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,661
Come here, my baby.

1141
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,580
Goodness, come here.

1142
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,500
You little thing.

1143
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,295
You must've been worried sick.

1144
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,131
It must've been so hard for you.

1145
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:34,884
I'm sorry.

1146
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,636
I'm…

1147
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,264
such a bad mom.

1148
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,185
I'm such a bad mom.

1149
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,438
You're crying again.

1150
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,814
-What?
-You haven't smiled once

1151
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,192
since you've come back here.

1152
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,654
I want to see you smile.

1153
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:59,408
Because you're not a bad mom,

1154
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,285
but a pretty mom.

1155
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,638
Hello?

1156
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,599
What?

1157
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,520
There's smoke coming from the farm?

1158
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,814
Yes, okay.

1159
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,066
Yes, I'll check now.

1160
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:37,655
Kang-ho.

1161
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,865
Kang-ho, wake up.

1162
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,575
There's smoke coming from the farm.

1163
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,381
Mom.

1164
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,216
Oh, no!

1165
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,636
-Mom.
-Our pigs!

1166
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:02,930
Guys, wake up!

1167
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:05,266
We need to leave.

1168
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:06,976
-We have to get out.
-No.

1169
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,310
We have to get out!

1170
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,564
-Mom, no.
-Our pigs.

1171
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,982
-Mom, we have to go!
-Let go!

1172
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,316
-We have to go!
-Let go!

1173
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,695
-No!
-We have to go now!

1174
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,197
No!

1175
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,042
Mom.

1176
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:38,174
-No!
-It won't open.

1177
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:39,341
Why won't it open?

1178
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,359
Mom.

1179
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,487
Mom, come here. This way.

1180
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:03,032
Mom, we have to get out of here.

1181
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,576
-Mom, get out of here. Now.
-No.

1182
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:07,620
-Mom, we have to leave now!
-No.

1183
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,205
Come on.

1184
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,206
Mom!

1185
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,917
Kang-ho, you go first.

1186
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,501
-You go…
-No, Mom.

1187
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,379
You have to get out first. Mom!

1188
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:21,800
You have to leave first.
I'll follow you out, okay?

1189
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,052
Come on.

1190
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:25,137
Hurry.

1191
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,431
Mom.

1192
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:31,769
Mom.

1193
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:03,175
Yong-yong, have you been well?

1194
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:05,761
Yong-yong.

1195
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:07,638
Do you copy, Yong-yong?

1196
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:09,265
Do you remember Daddy's voice?

1197
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,809
What are you up to?

1198
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:13,686
Are you still asleep?

1199
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,272
It's time to get up.

1200
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,357
Wake up and play with me.

1201
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:20,651
My dear son,

1202
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,696
it's time to wake up.

1203
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:46,677
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1204
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,906
Fire!

1205
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,993
Are you saying Kang-ho is in there?

1206
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:14,580
Was it you? Were you the girl
he wrote about in his journal?

1207
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:18,292
Sam-sik, you know something, don't you?

1208
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,002
I really need to see Ha-young.

1209
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,421
Did you have that much fun with her?

1210
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:28,260
Mr. Choi, you're under arrest on suspicion
of murdering Ms. Hwang Soo-hyun.

1211
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,055
I'm going to protect Kang-ho.

1212
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,351
Kang-ho was only able to endure
those lonely and painful years

1213
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,019
because of you.

1214
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:38,854
Do you think she's really here?

1215
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:41,273
She has to be. For Kang-ho's sake.

1216
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:47,571
