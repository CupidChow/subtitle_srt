00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,562
-Find anything?
-Bring the cutter!

3
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,938
-Bring the cutter!
-Hurry!

4
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,190
-Hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

5
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,068
-Did you…
-Bring it up.

6
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,277
Hey, come on.

7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,362
-Here.
-Is it burnt there?

8
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,822
Push it.

9
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,159
-Done?
-Yes.

10
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,276
Kang-ho.

11
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,320
Wake…

12
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,614
Wake up, Kang-ho.

13
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,158
Kang-ho…

14
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,959
No!

15
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,962
No!

16
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,922
No, Kang-ho!

17
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,841
-Ma'am, calm down.
-Kang-ho!

18
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,842
Kang-ho!

19
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,012
Please save him!

20
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,430
My son!

21
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,765
My baby!

22
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,143
My baby! Please save him!

23
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,394
Please!

24
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,563
First of all,

25
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,399
we successfully stopped the hemorrhaging.

26
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,319
But his brain and body remain swollen.

27
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,072
His cervical spine was fractured

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,158
and he suffered
an injury to his spinal cord.

29
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,909
Even if he gains consciousness,

30
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,080
I'm afraid he won't be able to return
to his normal life for some time.

31
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,666
Food?

32
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,002
You're inviting me to eat

33
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,214
when I've never been able
to enjoy a meal with you?

34
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,852
You're dozing off
because you're full and it's warm.

35
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,148
Study.

36
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,196
You got it wrong again.

37
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,784
Learning Chinese characters
is mandatory for the bar exam.

38
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,079
Rewrite the ones you got wrong 100 times
and memorize them again.

39
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,418
Run!

40
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,711
Darn it.

41
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,463
What is he…

42
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:35,924
Mom…

43
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,933
You'll doze off on a full stomach.

44
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,976
I told you a million times.

45
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,811
Okay.

46
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,532
DOWON HOSPITAL

47
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,708
You should go eat.

48
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:15,046
How could she have an appetite
when her child is dying?

49
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,965
Dying?

50
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,426
Who's dying?

51
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,137
He's still breathing.

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,435
Both his pulse
and blood pressure are stable.

53
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,313
His hands and feet are warm.

54
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,066
His body is still functioning.

55
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,320
My son won't die.

56
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,906
No.

57
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,409
I won't…

58
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,871
I won't let him die.

59
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,793
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

60
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,045
Short! A double play!

61
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,172
Good play!

62
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,257
Yes!

63
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,509
Good throw. Nice play!

64
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,595
-Well done.
-It's all thanks to you.

65
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,892
This is how our team
made it to the Korean Series

66
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,854
after only two years in the league.

67
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,565
You were terrific today! Applause!

68
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,525
You were incredible!

69
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,901
Goodness. Yes?

70
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,196
Prosecutor Choi was in an accident.

71
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,574
He's in the ICU at Dowon Hospital.

72
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,076
What?

73
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,385
What a mess.

74
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,888
He could've just forged the document.

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,225
Yet he went all the way there
just to get that seal?

76
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,646
What about the other driver?

77
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,565
They haven't been identified yet.

78
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,860
The roads are blanketed
with CCTV cameras nowadays,

79
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,612
yet they can't find the guy?

80
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,739
The truck was a burner vehicle.

81
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,658
Also, it was found
after it had been set on fire

82
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,661
and no fingerprints were recovered.

83
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,621
What?

84
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,039
A burner vehicle?

85
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,291
It was a burner vehicle?

86
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,336
Unbelievable.

87
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,838
Right. Hold on.

88
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,341
What happened to Oh Tae-soo's daughter?

89
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,831
It's okay.

90
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,339
What happened?

91
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,053
He most likely won't make it.

92
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,979
Well done.

93
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,900
Kang-ho.

94
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,137
Hold on.

95
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,972
That means…

96
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,018
he's still alive.

97
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,520
What do we do?

98
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:00,938
What if…

99
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,983
they find out?

100
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,529
CHAIRMAN SONG

101
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,330
I'll take care of that, so don't worry.

102
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,165
Just rest up for a few days.

103
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,894
Hello, Chairman Song.

104
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,396
Goodness. Thank God.

105
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,900
I heard your daughter
wasn't in the car when it happened.

106
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,611
What a relief.

107
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,031
My heart is still heavy
when I think of Prosecutor Choi.

108
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,282
Tell me about it.

109
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,328
I just saw him, and it broke my heart.

110
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,999
Anyway, both you and your daughter
must be shocked.

111
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,668
Take care of yourselves.

112
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:08,339
Let's catch up in person soon.

113
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,423
Goodbye.

114
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,219
He has a heavy heart?

115
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,888
Find that hit-and-run driver this instant.

116
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,602
Damn it! Everything's ruined!

117
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,900
Of course.

118
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,946
Everything else is fine.

119
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,782
But he hurt his leg,

120
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,077
so it'll take some time
for him to recover.

121
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,039
I asked them to find
an experienced farmhand.

122
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,543
But it's hard to hire anyone
since it's farming season.

123
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,088
Thank you in advance, Mr. Son.

124
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,133
Don't worry about the pigs,

125
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,718
and just focus on Kang-ho.

126
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,388
Yes. All right, bye.

127
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,267
What did she say?

128
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,435
How's Kang-ho?

129
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,729
He must've broken his leg.

130
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,856
-Oh, dear.
-Goodness.

131
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,191
He broke his mom's heart when he left.

132
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,985
He's being punished for it.

133
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,196
Gosh, don't say something like that
about our neighbor.

134
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,407
That's exactly why I'm saying this.

135
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,284
She's a fool.

136
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,829
She was always fixated on his studies.

137
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,082
All her hard work only made him
into such an impudent son.

138
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,084
As a parent,

139
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,296
you shouldn't bad-mouth
another parent's child.

140
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,425
To be honest,
Sam-sik is the most impudent one of all.

141
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,389
What do you mean?

142
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,767
Why are you bringing him up right now?

143
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,686
I mean, it's not like
he did anything serious.

144
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,358
Are you serious right now?

145
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,234
Let's be frank.

146
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,197
Raise your hand
if you've never been robbed by him.

147
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,908
From watermelons
and red peppers to rice wine…

148
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,412
I still don't get why he stole that
talisman from Mr. Son's gate.

149
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,207
-Jeez.
-Even a talisman?

150
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,501
Have you gone insane?

151
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,505
I'm going to kill you
with my own hands today!

152
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,215
-Stop it.
-Goodness!

153
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,591
-Gosh!
-What are you doing?

154
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,842
Gosh, that's enough!

155
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,636
-That's enough!
-Hello.

156
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,806
Why did you bring that dog
when we're eating?

157
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,849
-Goodness.
-Jeez.

158
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,434
Is the food ready?

159
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,438
You're having the awful spicy noodles.

160
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,690
-What?
-What did you just say?

161
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,734
The food is what?

162
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,277
Awful.

163
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,948
What? You said the same thing.

164
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,951
You said Sung-ae couldn't cook
to save her life.

165
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,412
Don't eat it.

166
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,163
-Don't eat it.
-What?

167
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,206
Don't eat it!

168
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,207
-Come on.
-Sung-ae.

169
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,792
-Bring it back!
-Bring it back!

170
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,128
Why are they always fighting?

171
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,297
They're setting an awful example for us.

172
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,675
At least we'll learn how to fight well.

173
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,843
Goodness me.

174
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,471
Excuse me.

175
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,932
Hello?

176
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,979
We're fully booked for the next two days.

177
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,355
One minute.

178
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,692
There's an opening this Friday at 8 p.m.

179
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,987
Okay. I'll reserve it for you.

180
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,780
Thank you. Goodbye.

181
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,991
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,536
You're raking in all the money
in this neighborhood.

183
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,415
I wish Bo-bae would quit her studies

184
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,375
and learn some useful skills like this.

185
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,751
She's always hanging out

186
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,087
with her friends at night,
saying she's studying.

187
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,714
She needs to be more careful.

188
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,177
A rape and murder case occurred
in the next neighborhood.

189
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,137
Right. I heard.

190
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,973
He followed her knowing she lives alone

191
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,225
and attacked her
as soon as she opened the door.

192
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,978
Really? So did they catch him?

193
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,855
No. That's why everyone is panicking.

194
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,482
You guys live alone too, right?

195
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,233
You should be careful.

196
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,236
They ought to catch and ground him up.

197
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,284
That's pretty.

198
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,165
It's a miracle
that he can breathe on his own.

199
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,710
Let's move him to a general ward
and monitor him.

200
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,548
In the general ward, you're responsible
for taking care of his waste.

201
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,592
The drainage bag is connected here.

202
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,302
This is the suppository.

203
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,597
He could get an infection
without proper care,

204
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,182
so please pay close attention.

205
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,767
Okay.

206
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:44,073
The number you have called does not exist.
Please check…

207
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,872
Excuse me.

208
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,333
Can I confirm her number again?

209
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,669
You've already done so three times, ma'am.

210
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,548
Then why does it say
that the number doesn't exist?

211
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,715
Maybe it doesn't.

212
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,884
Or maybe she changed her number.

213
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,765
Then could you give me
her home number or address?

214
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,561
Ma'am, we're not allowed to disclose
such information to strangers.

215
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,479
I'm not a stranger.

216
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,024
She's my son's fiancée
and my daughter-in-law.

217
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,609
Ma'am.

218
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,738
Mothers don't usually ask
a hospital's administration office

219
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,324
for their daughter-in-law's number.

220
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,204
-Mom!
-Mom!

221
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,499
Really?

222
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,710
Ms. Jo taught you English?

223
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,878
What did you learn?

224
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,307
Why did that woman
teach them such terrifying words?

225
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,018
Guys, don't meet her from now on.

226
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,102
No.

227
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,939
We need to learn English
if we want to see you soon.

228
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,650
I love the US.

229
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,199
All right.

230
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,662
I hope you learn English quickly
so we can live together.

231
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,293
By the way, who's that guy behind you?

232
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,378
What?

233
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,763
Stop pranking me and go to bed, okay?

234
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,974
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

235
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,856
A rape and murder case occurred

236
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,109
in the next neighborhood.

237
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,372
Mi-joo.

238
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,170
What are you doing?

239
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,716
Mi-joo!

240
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,513
Bang Sam-sik?

241
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:56,974
Darn it.

242
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,564
You have all those normal clothes,
and you gave me this?

243
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,524
What? Do I?

244
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,154
You should've just gone home
after you got discharged.

245
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,864
Why did you come here?

246
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,699
Goodness.

247
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,161
I'm seriously regretting it myself.

248
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,375
Right. I'm supposed to give you tofu
since you're discharged.

249
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,377
-You already gave me something.
-What?

250
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,628
A good beating.

251
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,173
A painful one.

252
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,011
By the way, how did you know I lived here?

253
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,014
Well…

254
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,392
A long time ago,

255
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,478
you said that it was your dream

256
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,105
to open up your own nail salon.

257
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,065
Right.

258
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,942
You said the name would be Nail &amp; Nail

259
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,944
and how brilliant the idea was.

260
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,655
So I looked up the name just in case.

261
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,657
And guess what? I found it.

262
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,243
You're incredible. You remembered that?

263
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,995
Of course, I did.

264
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,832
I remember watching you being born
while I was being carried

265
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,793
on my mom's back.

266
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,588
I'm the first guy who saw you naked.

267
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,048
-You lunatic.
-Goodness.

268
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,007
You were pretty.

269
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,175
Jeez.

270
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,516
I never visited you
while you were incarcerated.

271
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,519
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,729
Why would you visit me

273
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,232
when I was incarcerated
for committing a crime?

274
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,234
You didn't commit a crime.

275
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,486
You were used by those bad guys.

276
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,655
You were merely a victim.

277
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,365
Mi-joo.

278
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,407
Yes?

279
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,035
I realized being like that

280
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,871
was the worst sin you could commit.

281
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,414
What?

282
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,000
Letting others use you.

283
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,087
And

284
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,049
not being able to do anything about it
because you have no power,

285
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,509
money, or connections.

286
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,974
Just take it.

287
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,642
It's free.

288
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,689
From what I heard,

289
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,191
working on fishing vessels is hard work.

290
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,235
Take care of yourself.

291
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,279
And don't get caught
stealing things again.

292
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,740
If I ever steal anything again,

293
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,451
it's going to be your heart.

294
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,706
-Bye.
-Do you still like Kang-ho?

295
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,917
-What are you talking about? Go.
-Do you?

296
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,003
What's with you? Go!

297
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,088
Just go. Go home safely.

298
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,175
Let's be honest,
I'm way more handsome than him.

299
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,468
Yes, you're right.

300
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,095
You're more handsome.

301
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,472
Thanks for today and this gift. Go now.

302
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,057
-You're handsome.
-But--

303
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,142
Bye.

304
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,320
DISCHARGE

305
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,864
Goodness.

306
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,660
Goodness. Look at the size of this gem.

307
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,746
Goodness.

308
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,916
This is bigger than Mr. Son's tomatoes.

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,754
You're supposed to buy your parents
long johns with your first paycheck.

310
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,089
But you can't flaunt that,

311
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,217
and you like to show off.

312
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,052
I also felt bad

313
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,847
that you lost your wedding ring ages ago.

314
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,807
I never lost it.

315
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,644
I hid it in the doenjang crock

316
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,520
so you wouldn't steal it.

317
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,482
But you still found it and sold it.

318
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,653
I felt so happy back then.

319
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,821
-What?
-Because

320
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,533
I truly despised the ring
your dad had gotten for me.

321
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,538
The gem was so tiny
that it was barely visible.

322
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,748
What?

323
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,418
You had gained a lot of weight back then,

324
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,295
so the fat was covering the gem.

325
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,047
Thank you so much, Sam-sik.

326
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,132
Goodness, Sam-sik.

327
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,634
-My baby.
-What are you doing?

328
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,635
-Come here.
-What--

329
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,553
Goodness, my baby.

330
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,014
I can't believe you got me a ring.

331
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,351
-Gosh, you precious thing.
-Goodness!

332
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,396
It's nothing.

333
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,731
Just live a long life.

334
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,651
I'll make tons of money
so you can live comfortably.

335
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,778
-Gosh, my baby.
-Anyone home?

336
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,904
Let me go!

337
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,157
I didn't steal it!
I got it as my paycheck!

338
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,951
All right. Let's talk at the station.

339
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,744
Can you please just hear him out?

340
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,080
He said they gave it to him!

341
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,541
Was he going to steal things

342
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,501
to make our lives comfortable?

343
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,086
Was that it?

344
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,772
Bye.

345
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,691
-Bye.
-Dad.

346
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,276
-Hey.
-Gosh.

347
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,527
Goodness.

348
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,117
Excuse me!

349
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,620
Our son hasn't come out yet.

350
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,581
-What's his name?
-Bang Sam-sik.

351
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,918
He's…

352
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,420
not on the list.

353
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,381
-What?
-That can't be.

354
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,344
He said he needed money
for a discharge deposit,

355
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,430
so I wired it to him yesterday.

356
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,724
A discharge deposit?

357
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,642
You know,

358
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,146
it's to guarantee that
he'll behave once he's out.

359
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,232
There's no such thing.

360
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,945
Discharge deposits don't exist!

361
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,948
My goodness!

362
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,451
Do you know a Bang Sam-sik?

363
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,411
Of course, I do.

364
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,330
-He was discharged a week ago.
-What?

365
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,290
-A week ago?
-Yes.

366
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,167
I was totally speechless.

367
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,462
He stole the penitentiary's towels,
soap, and toothpaste.

368
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,546
Let's go.

369
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,050
-Darn it!
-Wait.

370
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,928
How much did you wire him?

371
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,263
Five million…

372
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:20,440
You son of a gun!

373
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:27,572
Then is it Ms. Jung's fault for laying out
the pesticide bottles by the road?

374
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:33,495
Or is it Mr. Son's fault
for running over them on his bike?

375
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:46,550
My son is a prosecutor at Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

376
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,886
He got the top score on the bar exam.

377
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,304
Goodness.

378
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,687
Look. My eyes aren't even.

379
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,941
Can I retrieve the land
even if it's under my brother's name?

380
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,776
-This is about your land?
-Correct.

381
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,820
She had taken out a dozen insurances.

382
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,906
-He turned out to be married.
-Oh, dear.

383
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,534
Please put in a good word for me
once he wakes up.

384
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,119
-Please.
-Okay.

385
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,787
-Thanks.
-Goodness.

386
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,205
No, I'm sorry.

387
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,707
-That's it for today.
-But--

388
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,666
Come again tomorrow.

389
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,042
What about just me?

390
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,002
Gosh.

391
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,461
She's done for the day.

392
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,969
Kang-ho.

393
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,596
Look at this.

394
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,349
They're all waiting for you to wake up.

395
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,103
So,

396
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,023
wake up soon, okay?

397
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,536
Your fingernails have grown so much.

398
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,134
Nurse.

399
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,512
Nurse!

400
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,224
Nurse!

401
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,018
Kang-ho woke up!

402
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,437
My son woke up!

403
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,064
Kang-ho!

404
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,235
Kang-ho. It's me, Mom.

405
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,320
Do you recognize me?

406
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,323
Kang-ho! It's me.

407
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,408
Your mom.

408
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,663
What's wrong?

409
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,332
It's me, Kang-ho.

410
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,298
As of now, we've given him
all the immediate treatments.

411
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,465
From now on,

412
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,884
the rehabilitation department
will take over

413
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,095
and monitor him.

414
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,179
Doctor.

415
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,017
He'll be able to walk again, right?

416
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,519
As long as we keep up with the treatment.

417
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,104
Right?

418
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:50,150
Let's hope for the best
as he receives his treatment.

419
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,445
I've seen many patients walk again
after rehabilitation.

420
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,155
-I see.
-However,

421
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,826
you need to understand
that he will be very different

422
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,078
from the person he used to be.

423
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,289
When you injure your head,

424
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,792
you sometimes lose most of the memories
prior to the accident.

425
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,296
And as for your son, he only has memories

426
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,340
of his childhood.

427
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,343
So it's like
he's become a child once again.

428
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,846
He also lacks cognitive ability right now.

429
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,766
We call that retrograde amnesia.

430
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,351
He's like…

431
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,270
a seven-year-old right now.

432
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,231
A seven-year-old?

433
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,610
Simply put, he is…

434
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,778
-Stupid?
-…stupid.

435
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,657
Well, maybe not to that extent, but…

436
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,993
Anyway, let's keep an eye on him.

437
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:43,995
Okay.

438
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,459
Thank you.

439
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,795
-You should go now.
-Yes, ma'am.

440
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,131
And could you keep the siren off?

441
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,299
Okay.

442
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,502
Ms. Jin?

443
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,170
Yes.

444
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,381
Hey, you're back.

445
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,425
You're back.

446
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,844
-I'm sorry for the trouble.
-Not at all.

447
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,722
Pour our guest a drink first.

448
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,725
I refuse to drink alcohol.

449
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,436
Goodness.

450
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,980
He flew in from Canada six months ago.

451
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,775
He understands Korean but can't speak it.

452
00:28:56,276 --> 00:29:00,071
You're majoring in Korean
at Chungjin University, right?

453
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,781
You are correct.

454
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,867
-Right.
-You said

455
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,327
you needed help with your farm.

456
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:10,665
His father runs a pig farm back in Canada.

457
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,585
He wanted to learn about Korean pig farms

458
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:17,422
and the language itself,
so he's working part-time here.

459
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,507
Your name is Andrea, right?

460
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,633
Yes.

461
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,135
That's his name.

462
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,762
I don't know what your name means,

463
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,806
but if I had to guess, I'd say
it means something like "impolite."

464
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,517
Because you're not pouring me a drink!

465
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,853
-Pour him some.
-Pour me some.

466
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,231
It must be so tough for you all.

467
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,695
Don't regard it as a hardship.

468
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:46,826
What kind of bastard is teaching you
such difficult words?

469
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,453
This bastard.

470
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,747
KOREAN: DON'T REGARD IT AS A HARDSHIP

471
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,374
Jeez.

472
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,626
By the way,

473
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,379
has Kang-ho been discharged
from the hospital?

474
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,839
Yes.

475
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,091
Goodness.

476
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:06,137
It must've bothered him
to have treated you so harshly.

477
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,516
That's why he drove recklessly
and got into an accident.

478
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,311
I can't tell you when it'll be,

479
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,941
but when they set their date again,
make sure you're there at the wedding.

480
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,570
You must do that as his mom.

481
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,615
Okay.

482
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,326
Why did she plant so many?

483
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,371
This saves her money from buying pig feed.

484
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,875
She's always been hardworking.

485
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,170
What good is that
when she has an impudent son?

486
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,965
Jeez. There you go again.

487
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,594
But then again,
I'm in no position to bad-mouth her son.

488
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,266
-When is Sam-sik getting discharged?
-When is Mi-joo coming?

489
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,479
Let's get back to work.

490
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,773
Let's do that.

491
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,237
-I'm sorry.
-What?

492
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,072
-Goodness.
-Don't be.

493
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,783
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

494
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,494
-Long time no see.
-This is killing me.

495
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,621
-Goodness.
-Thank you.

496
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,915
Gosh, I guess it was strenuous.

497
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,834
I'm sore all over.

498
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,043
Of course.

499
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,296
-Gosh, I'm exhausted.
-Gum-ja, here.

500
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,172
Goodness. What are you doing?

501
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,549
I don't need that.

502
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,718
I'm doing this for my sake.

503
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,261
You must be insane.

504
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,972
You're making us feel bad.

505
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,435
Jeez, you're making me feel bad.

506
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,521
We didn't even visit Kang-ho
at the hospital.

507
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,690
Right. Where is he?

508
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,108
Is he here with you?

509
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,776
Well…

510
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,819
No.

511
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,196
Why would he be here?

512
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,198
He's probably back at his own home.

513
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,075
He's a successful prosecutor.

514
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,120
He must have work piled up
after months of being at the hospital.

515
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,496
Thank goodness.

516
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,249
I was worried sick.

517
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,251
Is he all better now?

518
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,378
Yes.

519
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,264
Kang-ho, aren't you hungry?

520
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,183
Let's eat.

521
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,283
Do you remember this?

522
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,619
This was your first birthday.

523
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,205
You're holding a gavel.

524
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,833
You were destined to become a prosecutor.

525
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,793
Don't you agree?

526
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,422
And this was
your elementary school graduation.

527
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,510
We had our first heavy snow in 30 years,
so the graduation took place in the gym.

528
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,429
And this was
your middle school graduation.

529
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,974
You received an award
in front of the entire school.

530
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,101
I was on cloud nine.

531
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,354
And this was your high school graduation.

532
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:05,233
And this was taken at the institute
after you passed the bar exam.

533
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,779
After the ceremony,
we ate at the cafeteria there.

534
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:14,534
We had seasoned deodeok, bulgogi,
and winter cabbage doenjang soup.

535
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,204
You really enjoyed them.

536
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,463
Ta-da.

537
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:36,931
Here.

538
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,891
Open up.

539
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,355
What's the matter?

540
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,774
You're off the IV fluids,
so you need to eat.

541
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,609
Come on. Just one spoon.

542
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,153
Here.

543
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,155
What…

544
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,283
What's the matter with you?

545
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,703
Kang-ho, just one spoon.

546
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,376
Young-soon.

547
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,545
Hey.

548
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,464
You were home.

549
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,175
What brings you here?

550
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,968
You've been away for months.

551
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,137
Your kimchi must've gone bad,

552
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,473
so I brought some geotjeori.

553
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,768
This is beef bone soup.

554
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:26,439
You must've been sick of eating
hospital food.

555
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,025
So enjoy this hot meal.

556
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,610
Gosh.

557
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,278
You didn't have to.

558
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,407
Is someone here?

559
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,408
Sorry?

560
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,202
What do you mean?

561
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,828
There are two sets of utensils.

562
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,331
-Well…
-You're right.

563
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,334
What's going on?
Are you hiding someone in there?

564
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,544
No.

565
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,754
This smells fishy.

566
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,006
Don't tell me

567
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,092
you seduced a young doctor.

568
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,676
Of course not.

569
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,015
Wait! Hold on!

570
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,767
Who's there?

571
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,977
What? It's Kang-ho.

572
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,022
People will say that it's punishment.

573
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,524
Young-soon.

574
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,609
They'll say that it would've been better

575
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,738
had he died instead of living like that.

576
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,365
Who would say such a thing?

577
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,449
I did.

578
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,703
I thought that way when I saw
others in similar situations.

579
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,372
But you know what?

580
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,040
I was wrong.

581
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,459
Now that I'm going through it,

582
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,004
I know I was wrong.

583
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,423
I'm just…

584
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,678
so grateful that he's still alive.

585
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,930
My Kang-ho.

586
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,183
My one and only child.

587
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,854
I'm just

588
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,356
truly thankful that he survived…

589
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,026
the accident.

590
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,991
I really am.

591
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,708
What? Kang-ho?

592
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,126
I'm telling you.

593
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,132
She used to always gloat

594
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,467
that her son was a prosecutor.

595
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:22,889
You really never know
what can happen to you.

596
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:26,100
You should watch what you say.

597
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,811
When did she ever gloat?

598
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:33,065
It may not have been obvious, but she did.

599
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,403
I can't believe you.
What's the matter with you?

600
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,614
Whatever.

601
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,117
I'm just upset about it.

602
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,420
Jeez.

603
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,924
Either stop dieting or stop eating meat.

604
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,717
Choose one!

605
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,927
Be quiet!

606
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,097
You better not

607
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,434
run your mouth at the mill.

608
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,936
What? Run my mouth?

609
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,146
Unbelievable.

610
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,024
What do you take me for?

611
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,235
I'm not like you.

612
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,154
You have no idea how tight-lipped I am.

613
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,533
If I were born
during the Japanese colonization,

614
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:29,121
I would've been someone like Mr. Kim Gu.

615
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:34,502
Mr. Kim Gu once said this.

616
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:41,133
"In the end,
everything stems from yourself."

617
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,095
So you better not run your…

618
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,889
I mean, you better not
tell a soul about this.

619
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,974
Got it?

620
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,143
Anyway, this is a secret.

621
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,104
So you can't tell anyone.

622
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:57,233
Kang-ho is stupid

623
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,402
It's a secret

624
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,572
So you can't tell anyone

625
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,159
Kang-ho is stupid

626
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,456
What?

627
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,127
I thought he just injured his leg.

628
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,088
Did you take your evening medication
before you heard that?

629
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,423
Of course.

630
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,425
If I misheard them,

631
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,594
you can chop off my ears with a chainsaw.

632
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,180
What are you talking about?

633
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,558
And why would I do that?

634
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,727
I'd just burst your eardrums.

635
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,314
Hold on. That's not important right now.

636
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,525
Then what will happen to Kang-ho?

637
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,652
Nothing more will happen to him.

638
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,612
He's already stupid.

639
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,214
I'm sorry for keeping you out here
by yourself.

640
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,551
I just don't want you…

641
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,888
to see him

642
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,099
in that condition.

643
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,686
But…

644
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,814
you know me, right?

645
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,275
I'll never give up.

646
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,989
Everyone had lost hope.
They said he would never wake up.

647
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,533
But look.

648
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,244
He survived.

649
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,623
And since he survived,

650
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,501
I'm going to make him live.

651
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,880
He'll get up, walk, and even run.

652
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,216
He's seven now.

653
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,763
He'll be eight next year
and nine the year after.

654
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,434
I'll raise him all over again.

655
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,523
Just watch and see.

656
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,733
Our son

657
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,069
will walk out of that room.

658
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,279
He'll stand here

659
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,241
and look at you.

660
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,035
I'll make sure he does.

661
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,913
No matter what.

662
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,596
CLEAN AND ODOR-FREE
KOREAN SMART PIGGERY

663
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,936
You're so handsome.

664
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,105
Did you sleep well?

665
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,578
Doesn't this look tasty?

666
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,371
Here.

667
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,623
It's tasty.

668
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,916
Cluck, cluck.

669
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,835
Knock, knock.

670
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,823
Lord!

671
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,033
I pray

672
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,077
-My Kang-ho…
-My son started his own business.

673
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,330
I pray that it will flourish.

674
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,081
Can you hear me?

675
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,419
-I pray to you, Lord.
-Please save my son!

676
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,005
You're a mother too.

677
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,467
So I'm sure you can empathize with me.

678
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,931
Please.

679
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,934
I pray

680
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,353
that he'll at least eat.

681
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,524
Ta-da.

682
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,108
Here.

683
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,109
Just one bite.

684
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,368
They made pumpkin porridge for you.

685
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,287
Just one bite.

686
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,042
It's so tasty.

687
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,712
It's a fish.

688
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,635
Come on.

689
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,981
You need to eat this.

690
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,676
What is all this?

691
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,012
There's sesame oil,

692
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,097
rice cakes, red chili powder…

693
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,266
Where's the rice?

694
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,851
Hold this for me.

695
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,728
What is this?

696
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,074
It's dead.

697
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,411
Is it?

698
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,249
Goodness me.

699
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,877
Damn it.

700
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,672
What kind of a lunatic
put an eel in a rice bowl

701
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,257
and put it out here?

702
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,216
It was me.

703
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,052
What?

704
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,054
Your wife caught it

705
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,724
by the stream while taking a walk.

706
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,102
She told me to bring it here
because it was a wild eel.

707
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,022
She scared me to death a few days ago
when she brought home

708
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,398
a wild rattlesnake.

709
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,778
Since we're here,

710
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,530
shouldn't we go inside and check on them?

711
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,616
Right, we should.

712
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,077
Gosh.

713
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,665
Young-soon.

714
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,833
Young-soon?

715
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,045
What are you doing there?

716
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,048
Goodness. There you were.

717
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,759
Come here.

718
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,386
We just came…

719
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,222
to give you this.

720
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,975
This tea is made with mulberry branches.
He should try it.

721
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,061
-Mulberry branches?
-Yes.

722
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:54,233
Apparently, this is helpful
for people who suffer from paralysis.

723
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,070
We all suffer from paralysis
at least once in our lifetime.

724
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,072
Don't you agree?

725
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,199
Right. I may not catch the flu,

726
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,743
but I get paralyzed every now and then.

727
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:07,996
What is that?

728
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,750
I was at a bookstore in town today.

729
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:15,254
This was recommended as a bestseller,

730
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,673
so I bought one.

731
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,508
You like to read.

732
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,137
I also got these.

733
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,016
You can watch them
when you're alone and lonely.

734
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,978
Make sure you watch them by yourself.

735
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,980
BAREFOOT KI-BONG

736
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,484
MARATHON

737
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,324
Don't do this.

738
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,162
If you keep doing this,

739
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,956
I'll become weak.

740
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,418
I'll want to rely on others.

741
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,628
But…

742
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,298
But I can't do that.

743
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,384
I need to stay strong.

744
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,427
So please…

745
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,277
There's a saying.

746
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,031
"A mother…

747
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,869
can replace anything in this world."

748
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,997
"But nothing…

749
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,793
can replace a mother."

750
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,344
We're not asking you to rely on us.

751
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,722
Yes, you should stay strong.

752
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,184
You're a mom, after all, right?

753
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,988
CHOI KANG-HO

754
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,762
YONG-YONG

755
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,014
"Mom"?

756
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,100
"Mom"?

757
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,561
Well done. "Mom."

758
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,735
Walk.

759
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,821
That's it.

760
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,489
Come here.

761
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,033
My Kang-ho. Good boy.

762
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,379
-Is this me?
-Yes.

763
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,715
Gosh, I look pretty. Thank you.

764
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,263
This is you.

765
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,723
And this is me.

766
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,523
KOREAN
MATHEMATICS

767
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,449
Well done.

768
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,879
This is a slingshot.

769
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,173
This is a ddakji.

770
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,841
This is a top.

771
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:52,638
Your dad bought this robot for you
before you were born.

772
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,515
You were always playing with it.

773
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,435
It was your favorite robot.

774
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,645
Do you remember?

775
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,191
Come on.

776
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,817
Are you sleeping again?

777
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,780
Kang-ho, you should eat something.

778
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,324
You haven't eaten anything for days.

779
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,286
Kang-ho.

780
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,831
Kang-ho?

781
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,043
What's wrong with you?

782
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,670
Kang-ho.

783
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,588
Kang-ho!

784
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,008
It's common for patients
who are paralyzed from the neck down.

785
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,969
They suddenly lost the ability to move.

786
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,390
They lose the will to live
because of the sense of loss.

787
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,851
Do your best to take care of him.

788
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,938
If he still doesn't improve,

789
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:46,525
you should consider
admitting him to a facility.

790
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,652
Can a seven-year-old

791
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,530
feel suicidal?

792
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,198
Sorry?

793
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,367
What do you mean?

794
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,453
Can a seven-year-old

795
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,374
lose the will to live
because of a sense of loss?

796
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,336
Eat.

797
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,173
Eat!

798
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:11,883
Eat.

799
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,637
Eat!

800
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,806
Eat! Why won't you eat?

801
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,725
Do you seriously want to die?

802
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,117
You get sleepy

803
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,244
when you're full.

804
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,123
And if you get sleepy,

805
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,001
you won't be able to study.

806
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,713
What?

807
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,134
You get sleepy

808
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:56,928
when you're full.

809
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,182
And if you get sleepy,
you won't be able to study.

810
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,980
You get sleepy

811
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,274
when you're full.

812
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,029
And if you get sleepy,
you won't be able to study.

813
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:35,675
Is that why…

814
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,265
Is that why you haven't been eating?

815
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,688
You get sleepy when you're full.

816
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,900
And if you get sleepy,

817
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,444
you won't be able to study.

818
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,616
No.

819
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,285
No, Kang-ho.

820
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,454
You can eat.

821
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,456
You can eat now.

822
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:09,793
Look.

823
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,336
Look.

824
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,839
I'm eating too, right?

825
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,134
So you can eat too.

826
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,971
You can sleep if you're sleepy.

827
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,223
You don't have to study.

828
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,025
So please eat.

829
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,279
I…

830
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,574
love you so much, Kang-ho.

831
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,661
I did that because I loved you so much.

832
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,540
I wanted you to be happy.

833
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,627
I didn't want you
to end up like me and Dad.

834
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,174
Please forgive me.

835
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,983
Thank you.

836
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,112
Thank you.

837
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:33,585
Look. I understand that Chairman Song
ordered you to do this.

838
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,337
But I'm on duty right now.

839
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,671
I'm also on duty.

840
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,427
Mr. Yang Gu-man.

841
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,680
Mr. Yang Gu-man.

842
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,934
Of course, he won't open it.

843
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,769
-Open it.
-Yes, sir.

844
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,524
You can't do that. That's breaking in.

845
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,652
Move.

846
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,326
Mr. Yang.

847
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,453
Mr. Yang.

848
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,834
Damn it. Open it.

849
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,169
Hurry. Damn it.

850
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,296
Mr. Yang!

851
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,923
Mr. Yang.

852
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,883
Damn it.

853
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,811
What? He committed suicide?

854
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:33,728
Yes, sir.

855
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:47,742
He crippled Kang-ho
who had his fate in his hands.

856
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,454
Then he killed the sole witness
and disguised it as suicide?

857
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,040
Jeez, Oh Tae-soo.

858
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,418
He must really despise joining
together as a family.

859
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,460
Oh Tae-soo?

860
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,011
DIAPER

861
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:11,975
The truck driver's family
lives in Yanbian, right?

862
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,184
Yes, sir.

863
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,272
Find out when and where
I should announce my presidential bid

864
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,565
to make it most effective.

865
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,984
Before you do that,

866
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,530
get rid of all businesses or people

867
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,907
who are related to Woobyeok Group.

868
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,992
Yes, sir.

869
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,287
Also, about Yang Gu-man…

870
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,248
"Yang Gu-man"?

871
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,332
Who's that?

872
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,543
The truck…

873
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:41,880
I'm sorry, sir.

874
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,805
What's the matter?

875
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,848
That…

876
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,309
Why is that here?

877
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,852
Why is that here?!

878
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:59,522
I found it in the trash can.

879
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,983
I washed it and put it here.

880
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,777
It's your favorite scarf.

881
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,738
Who? Who said it was my favorite?

882
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,198
Who said that?

883
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,205
Goodness, ma'am!

884
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,918
What's the matter with you?

885
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:23,254
Get rid of it this instant.

886
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,757
-Yes, ma'am.
-Ha-young!

887
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,425
Snap out of it!

888
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,013
Why aren't you taking proper care
of your traumatized daughter?

889
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,349
Throw away all her old belongings.

890
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:38,394
Replace everything single thing
with new ones.

891
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,562
Understand?

892
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,480
Okay.

893
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,440
Let's go out.

894
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,326
You're okay.

895
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,286
You're okay, my daughter.

896
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,289
Nothing will happen

897
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,667
to you

898
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,128
or me.

899
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,715
Kang-ho, look.

900
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,594
That man used to be paralyzed as well.

901
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,848
But he received rehabilitation
and exercised.

902
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,893
And now, he's healthy like that.
Isn't that incredible?

903
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,896
You can do it too.

904
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,607
Let's receive treatment and exercise

905
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,402
until you can move your fingers again.

906
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,319
Okay?

907
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,783
Jeez, your eyes are going to be sore.

908
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,003
Here.

909
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,929
Hello?

910
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,390
Yes.

911
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,185
Hello, this is
Hannuri Rehabilitation Center.

912
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:03,438
Did you submit an application
for Mr. Choi Kang-ho?

913
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,481
Yes, I did.

914
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,317
But we're completely full,

915
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,694
so I'm afraid
we can't admit him right now.

916
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,989
What would you like to do?
Would you like to wait?

917
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,993
How long will I have to wait?

918
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,912
I was told

919
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,915
that he should start rehab
before his bones become stiff.

920
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:26,419
I'm afraid I can't give you an exact date.

921
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,297
We need to wait until a spot opens up.

922
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:34,260
Then could you please give me a call
when there's an opening?

923
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,470
Please.

924
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,806
Thank you. Goodbye.

925
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,160
Kang-ho, your dinner is here.

926
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,682
I can't do it.

927
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,142
Why?

928
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,226
Why not?

929
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,478
Kang-ho, just once more.

930
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,647
Okay? Let's give it one last try.

931
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,785
-I can't do it.
-You can!

932
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:24,912
You did it earlier.

933
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,289
You did it.

934
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,207
All by yourself.

935
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,753
You can do it.

936
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,672
Okay. Here's the robot.

937
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,716
Push it over again.

938
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,094
-I can do it.
-That's right.

939
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,893
See? You're doing it!

940
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:47,852
Flex!

941
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,062
Flex!

942
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,482
Feed me!

943
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,109
Your call will be charged after the beep.

944
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,363
Why aren't you picking up?

945
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,406
Are you still unwell?

946
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,117
I made abalone porridge for you.

947
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,370
Anyway, give me a call.

948
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:07,413
SUN-YOUNG

949
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,299
BAR EXAM MEAL

950
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,435
-I see some light.
-Really?

951
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,770
-Where?
-There.

952
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,522
-Is no one here?
-What's going on?

953
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,065
Those brats must have run away.

954
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,858
They took our membership money.

955
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,652
I heard the owner changed.

956
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,612
-What do we do?
-Me?

957
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,905
There you are!

958
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:43,199
Yes. It's you.

959
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:46,285
You should pay us back
before selling the shop.

960
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,204
This is so ridiculous!

961
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,665
This isn't right. Give us our money back!

962
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:52,083
Give me back my money.

963
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,001
-Give it back!
-Please explain.

964
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,379
I have no idea what you're talking about.

965
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,755
I heard you sold your nail salon.

966
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,633
-That woman says she's the new owner.
-What?

967
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,136
I see. Did you run this place with her?

968
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,097
You were supposed to clean out
the shop yesterday.

969
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,475
The interior contractors
will be here soon. Open the door now.

970
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,519
Hurry up.

971
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:14,105
-Please wait a minute.
-Wait for what?

972
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,648
This can't be. No.

973
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,108
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

974
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,318
-I need to make a call.
-Don't go far.

975
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,862
-Okay.
-We're watching you.

976
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:24,031
The number you have called does not exist.

977
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,075
Please check and call…

978
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:28,911
No way.

979
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,371
TOTAL EARNINGS: 2,370,000 WON

980
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,499
Sun-young, I think we'll become rich.

981
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,544
Should we have some soju
to celebrate this?

982
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,215
You drink when it's raining.

983
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,509
You drink when you feel lonely.

984
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,971
You'll soon become an alcoholic
and get the shakes.

985
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,806
Then you won't be able to work.

986
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,142
-Come on. Don't be like that.
-But…

987
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:53,936
Fine.

988
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,147
I'll let you go today.

989
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,483
-Really?
-Really.

990
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,196
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

991
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,574
Then can I go home first?

992
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,951
You better go straight home.

993
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,036
All right.

994
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,413
I'll wire you this money later.

995
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,458
Bye.

996
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,259
Hey, little one.

997
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,303
Goodness.

998
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,513
Goodness.

999
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,516
What was the incident that just occurred?

1000
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,686
It must've been very hungry

1001
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,272
to jump over that.

1002
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,442
This is what I think.

1003
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:45,404
The piglet was extremely famished.

1004
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,200
You're right.

1005
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,953
It must've been very hungry. Goodness.

1006
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,708
All right.

1007
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,335
Here you go.

1008
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,092
-Kang-ho, aren't you hungry?
-Yes.

1009
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,301
Let's eat.

1010
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:14,976
Mom?

1011
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,771
-This is good.
-Mom.

1012
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,232
Mom, I…

1013
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:23,860
Mom.

1014
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:28,739
Mom.

1015
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:39,750
Why didn't you eat?

1016
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:42,670
You must not be hungry.

1017
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,005
No, Mom.

1018
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,007
Mom, I'm hungry.

1019
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,717
I'm hungry!

1020
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,843
Mom, I'm hungry!

1021
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:50,720
Mom!

1022
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:52,013
Goodness.

1023
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,390
Mom, I want to eat!

1024
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,313
Mom!

1025
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,399
Mom!

1026
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:04,984
I'm sorry, Kang-ho.

1027
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,237
Just once more.

1028
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,908
Let me become a bad mom just once more.

1029
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:22,919
No.

1030
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,254
Mom, I can do it.

1031
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,048
-What a shame.
-Mom, I moved my hand.

1032
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,550
Mom, my hand… Mom.

1033
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:41,729
I moved it.

1034
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:43,773
Mom, I moved it.

1035
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,399
I almost did it.

1036
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,359
Mom…

1037
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,995
Sesame seeds…

1038
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:02,959
7 BEST MEDICINES FOR PARALYSIS

1039
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:15,888
Mom.

1040
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,683
Let me do it once more. I almost did it.

1041
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,059
Mom!

1042
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,651
Like this.

1043
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,738
-Like this.
-Like--

1044
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,533
Mom!

1045
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,662
-Again.
-Again.

1046
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:40,663
One…

1047
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,590
I'm a genius.

1048
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,593
Come here.

1049
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,892
Mom, wait.

1050
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,978
Mom!

1051
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,982
You're so mean!

1052
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,735
You're eating so well.

1053
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,196
Your mom must be so happy
to see you eating so well.

1054
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,622
Yes?

1055
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,166
This is Hannuri Rehabilitation Center.

1056
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:28,002
A spot has opened up so your son
can be admitted next week.

1057
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:29,962
Really?

1058
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:33,257
Does that mean he can receive
rehabilitation starting next week?

1059
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:35,426
Thank you.

1060
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,970
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

1061
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,684
Kang-ho.

1062
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,355
Kang-ho, you can finally…

1063
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:06,665
You did it.

1064
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:25,601
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1065
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,409
I'm not an idiot.

1066
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,078
-Butterfly.
-Wrong.

1067
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,080
I just returned to my childhood.

1068
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:48,040
This is a chance given from above.

1069
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:51,001
She didn't say I couldn't go out.

1070
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:51,919
Right?

1071
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:53,337
Kang-ho!

1072
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,297
Choi Kang-ho!

1073
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,843
What did my son do so wrong
for you to do this here?

1074
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,428
Because his hands are now also dirty.

1075
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,348
I can't believe you've never called.

1076
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,310
Where have you been, you jerk?

1077
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,897
I'll earn a lot of money
and pay off all of your debt.

1078
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,693
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!
