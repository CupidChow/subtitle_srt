00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,230
Pull yourself together.

3
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,483
You need to be strong.

4
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,526
Get up.

5
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,403
You're a mom.

6
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,910
Your piglets are all looking for you.

7
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:21,539
You need to get up, feed them,
and look after them.

8
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,008
So is Young-soon doing better?

9
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,469
You didn't have to…

10
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,721
get in my way.

11
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,556
These darn flies.

12
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:43,895
She worked through the night
to deliver those piglets.

13
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,397
It's fortunate that
someone was there to help out.

14
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,316
It would've been really tough.

15
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:53,363
By the way, who were they
and what were they doing at the pig farm?

16
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,366
They came to buy your field.

17
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,700
What?

18
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,744
They bought our cornfield?

19
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,787
SIGNED BY PARK SUNG-AE

20
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,875
Goodness.

21
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,091
You're paying for it with cash?

22
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,135
Oh, my.

23
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,846
My goodness!

24
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,308
Something smells good.

25
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,518
Hi, Sam-sik.

26
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,395
-Hello.
-Hey.

27
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,272
Who are they?

28
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,107
These men?

29
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,400
Well, they are…

30
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,194
You know, they're here

31
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,238
because they're moving

32
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,657
to our village soon.

33
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,993
They came to order rice cakes
to present as gifts.

34
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:40,910
I see.

35
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,996
How many mals would you like?

36
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,831
Well, I'm not sure.

37
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,667
About three maris will do.

38
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,295
Three "maris"?

39
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:52,964
Oh, right.

40
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,051
-There are more people than that.
-Right?

41
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,345
-Exactly.
-Then I'll go big.

42
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,472
Thirty maris will do.

43
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,018
-Goodness.
-Thirty…

44
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,773
-Well, that's quite a lot of rice cakes.
-What is this?

45
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,694
Something seems odd.

46
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,615
Are you sure you came for rice cake?

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,534
Yes, of course.

48
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,078
-Let's make it three.
-Okay.

49
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:24,996
By the way,

50
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,374
your seated height
seems taller than normal today.

51
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,668
-What?
-What do you mean?

52
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,504
Hey, I heard we sold our cornfield!

53
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,298
What?

54
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,635
Damn it, you…

00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:44,641

56
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,320
What a pretty face you have

57
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,657
It's just like an apple

58
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,991
Your eyes shine

59
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,534
Your nose shines

60
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,579
And this knife shines too

61
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:07,997
Grab him.

62
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,332
Come here.

63
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,587
You're eating so well.

64
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,841
-If you choose to, surgery is possible.
-Paw.

65
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,803
-However, with the aggressive metastases,
-Paw. Good job.

66
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,680
-it may not be very effective.
-Good job.

67
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,473
Great job.

68
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,517
You'll want to get your affairs in order.

69
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,620
That's hot!

70
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,418
Mom, are you okay?

71
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,753
Yes.

72
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,422
I'm fine.

73
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,302
I'm all right.

74
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,761
You must be hungry.

75
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,306
It's almost ready. Just a moment.

76
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,643

When you're hungry…

83
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,931
I…

84
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,063
I can't die.

85
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,651
You wish to leave the farm to your son?

86
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,363
And if anything happens to me,

87
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,533
he'll have to make a living by himself.

88
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,785
You don't need to
worry about that already.

89
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,788
You never know what will happen in life.

90
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,499
But as you know,

91
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,711
my son isn't well,
so I wonder if he'll manage.

92
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,422
In that case,

93
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,218
you should hire
a trustworthy farm manager.

94
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,555
And I can help him
with medicines and vaccinations,

95
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,431
so don't worry about that.

96
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,767
Thank you so much.

97
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,644
-Thank you.
-Goodness.

98
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,895
I'm counting on you.

99
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,815
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

100
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,443
I haven't even retired yet.

101
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,403
My mom is acting weird.

102
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,030
All moms are weird.

103
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,365
They're always getting angry.

104
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,492
That's because you bought

105
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,871
200,000 won worth of items
for a game on her phone.

106
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,499
Kids can sometimes make mistakes.

107
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,462
What about Ms. Jin?

108
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,713
How is she weird?

109
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,926
Hey! How is she weird?

110
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,596
Don't you hear me?

111
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,974
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

112
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,851
Goodness.

113
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,271
You can't do this.

114
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,356
Mi-joo doesn't like us hanging out.

115
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,233
How is this hanging out?

116
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,776
We just met by chance.

117
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,986
Isn't that right?

118
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,908
It happens pretty often
in a tiny village like this one.

119
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,367
But…

120
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,411
Don't worry.

121
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,705
Mom went into town.

122
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,831
Town?

123
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,750
When? Did she take her wallet?

124
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,293
That's not what's important.

125
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,545
So how is Ms. Jin weird?

126
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,342
She doesn't talk as much.

127
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,469
She doesn't talk as much?

128
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,890
Shouldn't you be glad then?
She won't nag at you as much.

129
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,935
She's low on energy
and doesn't smile anymore.

130
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,437
Kang-ho!

131
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,688
Kang-ho!

132
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:47,235
Kang-ho, there you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

133
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,654
Hi, Ye-jin and Seo-jin. You're here too.

134
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,197
What's this?

135
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,740
Your new toy?

136
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,785
Good for you. It must be from your mom.

137
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,454
Is your grandma well too?
Please say hi to her for me.

138
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,416
Uncle Kang-ho has an appointment.
We'll be going now.

139
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,627
All right, let's go!

140
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,801
Didn't he say she's not talking as much?

141
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,222
You're back.

142
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,557
You said you'd return.

143
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,600
I didn't sell these just in case.

144
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,852
I'm actually looking for boots today.

145
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,229
Oh, not those?

146
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,940
These are a bit short.

147
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,275
Is there anything higher?

148
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,443
I have ones that go to the waist.
One second.

149
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,153
They don't need to be that high.

150
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,615
WOMEN'S SHOES 15,000 WON
DRESS SHOES 15,000 WON

151
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,537
It's Tiger.

152
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,122
Tiger.

153
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,873
Tiger!

154
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,252
Tiger.

155
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,671
Uri!

156
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,051
Excuse me.

157
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,678
Isn't this Tiger?

158
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,346
What?

159
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,389
Tiger?

160
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,060
It looked just like Tiger,
so I thought it was him.

161
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,396
-Hi.
-What's with him?

162
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,067
Goodness, it's all right.

163
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,656
Where did he go?

164
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,450
Kang-ho…

165
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:18,951
Kang-ho.

166
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,412
Kang-ho!

167
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,497
-Not bad, right?
-Are you selling it?

168
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,833
I barely managed to get it.

169
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,504
This was the last pack.

170
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,924
It's in here.

171
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,179
No, I put it in here.

172
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,096
There it is.

173
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,807
You punks.

174
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,768
What the hell?

175
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,311
You're too young to smoke.

176
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,272
Here.

177
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,443
Don't smoke, okay?

178
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,324
Hey, wait.

179
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,202
I gave you 50,000 won.

180
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,372
You gave me 5,000 won.

181
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,958
That's bullshit.
I definitely gave you 50,000 won.

182
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,043
That's bullshit.

183
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,128
Give him back his money, you idiot.

184
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,129
-Seriously.
-Darn it.

185
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,964
I'm not an idiot.

186
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,841
I just went back to my childhood.

187
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,510
This is a chance given from above.

188
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,014
That's one hell of a stupid chance.

189
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,849
You're not going to give me my money?

190
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,142
You leave us no choice then.

191
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,644
-Search him.
-No, stop it.

192
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,187
-Pull them down.
-Come on.

193
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,188
You're dead.

194
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,523
I'm telling my mom.

195
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,024
Wait, is that a gift?

196
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,401
Give it to me.

197
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,027
It's not a gift. It's a phone, idiot.

198
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,821
I know that, idiot.

199
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,156
-You're the idiot, idiot.
-Give it to me, you…

200
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,493
You damned bastards!

201
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,453
-What the…
-Darn it.

202
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,705
Hey, run!

203
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,706
You…

204
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,333
-Run!
-Stop right there!

205
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,085
You son of a bitch!

206
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,338
You son of a bitch!

207
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,841
Repeat after me!

208
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,218
You son of a bitch.

209
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,805
You son of a bitch.

210
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,973
Louder!

211
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,892
You son of a bitch!

212
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,893
That's it.

213
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,061
Good.

214
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,315
If anyone calls you an idiot or a cripple,

215
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,152
tell them, "You son of a bitch!" Got it?

216
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,988
-But I'm not allowed to--
-You are!

217
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,415
Here.

218
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,585
From now on, these are all yours.

219
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,211
Mine?

220
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,630
These are all very important,

221
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,049
so don't show them to anyone, okay?

222
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,803
"Kang-ho, let's exchange this for that."

223
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,597
"Kang-ho, stamp your seal here."

224
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,349
"Kang-ho, can you stand surety for me?"

225
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,560
"Kang-ho, let me borrow your house deed."

226
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,769
What do you say then?

227
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,398
-What should you say?
-You son of a bitch!

228
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,150
Good.

229
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,027
Very good.

230
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,238
Also,

231
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,202
this is a bank account
your dad set up for you

232
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,955
and I've been saving up
to give to you when you get married.

233
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,750
This is very important,

234
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,544
so I'll hide it here.

235
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,214
Don't tell or show anybody, okay?

236
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,131
Okay.

237
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,799
Like my lunch money.

238
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,259
What?

239
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,553
You hid it in my bag.

240
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,014
"Don't lose your lunch money."

241
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,391
This is your lunch money.

242
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,561
You could lose it or get it stolen,

243
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,147
so keep it safe
until you give it to your teacher.

244
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,148
Okay.

245
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,489
Yes, you're right.

246
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,909
I hid it in the bottom of your bag, right?

247
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,952
Yes.

248
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,287
What a smart boy.

249
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,373
Yes.

250
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,917
You're doing well.

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,379
You can slowly regain your memory
and learn one thing at a time.

252
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,548
-Okay?
-Okay.

253
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,468
You must be hungry.

254
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,136
Let's go eat.

255
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,221
Okay.

256
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,976
Aren't we going to eat?

257
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,269
We will.

258
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,022
But if we want to eat, we need rice.

259
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,318
To buy rice, we need money.
And for money, we raise pigs.

260
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,239
And now, I'll teach you how to do that.

261
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,744
Twice a day, morning and night.

262
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,497
When you're hungry,

263
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,791
come to the farm before you eat

264
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,336
and check if the pigs are eating well.

265
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,089
If the feed gets wet

266
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,757
or freezes in cold weather,

267
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,093
it clumps and clogs the feed tube.

268
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,470
When that happens,

269
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,472
tap here a few times.

270
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,308
Bang, bang, bang.

271
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,853
You must always keep it
neat and disinfected

272
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,939
so our pigs don't get sick, okay?

273
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,901
Make sure

274
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,737
the pigs are happy at our farm.

275
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,031
Yes, Happy Farm.

276
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,410
You can take pig manure

277
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,370
and use it as fertilizer
for the potato field.

278
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,789
Okay.

279
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,170
First, spread the manure over the field,

280
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,924
then cover it with plastic
to block weeds from growing.

281
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,883
And then,

282
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,844
make holes in the plastic
to plant seed potatoes.

283
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,762
Like this.

284
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,033
Nice shot.

285
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,371
Choi Kang-ho! Focus.

286
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:03,379
When the humidity reads over 60,
it means it's too humid.

287
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,463
Use this app

288
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,216
to turn the fans on.

289
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,804
If the pigs

290
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,307
develop a cough, get diarrhea,

291
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,226
or collapse for no reason…

292
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,312
"Hello, I'm calling
from Happy Farm in Jou-ri."

293
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,856
"My pigs are coughing or having diarrhea,

294
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,358
so please come quickly."

295
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,404
But if the vet can't come because
of an outbreak of infectious disease?

296
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,201
Then you need to buy
the medicine yourself and inject them.

297
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,288
If you don't, the contagion will spread.

298
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,417
I don't want to. Shots are scary.

299
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,252
-I can't do this.
-No.

300
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,712
It's easy.

301
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,964
Just stab it like this.

302
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,053
Mom, you're the best. That's so cool.

303
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,558
When mother pigs have piglets,

304
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,352
she feeds them and licks them.

305
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,898
She teaches them everything,
where to eat and poop,

306
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,609
how to scratch an itch,

307
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,571
and how to grunt when they're angry.

308
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:16,702
Then after 25 nights, you wean them.

309
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,414
I'd like the newly released
knit gel polishes,

310
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,416
a set of semicircular pearls in all sizes,

311
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,209
and a box of nail tinctures.

312
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,504
And ten bottles of
moisturizing cream as well.

313
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,672
Yes.

314
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:33,343
Tomorrow's the grand opening
so I need them by 9 a.m.

315
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,554
Yes, okay. That would be great.

316
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,139
Thank you. Bye.

317
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,395
The charms came off.

318
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,442
You're going to open a nail salon
in the agricultural chemicals shop?

319
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,443
Yes.

320
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,903
The rent is cheap,

321
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,614
and there's lots of foot traffic
so I think it'll be great.

322
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,282
That's not a bad idea.

323
00:17:55,783 --> 00:18:00,079
People may come to buy pesticides
to take their own life,

324
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,041
then get their nails done and feel better.

325
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,919
What if they come to get their nails done

326
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,671
and see pesticides
and want to take their own life?

327
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,969
I was just joking. Don't mind me.

328
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,890
A nail salon in a shop
that sells agricultural chemicals.

329
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,183
That's kind of novel.

330
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,896
So from now on,

331
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,690
don't come here
and ask her to do this for free.

332
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,109
Go to her nail salon.

333
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,696
Where's Sung-ae?

334
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,699
She left in a hurry to go to the bank.

335
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,826
The bank?

336
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,244
Wait.

337
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,705
Is she borrowing money
to settle Sam-sik's trouble again?

338
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:50,337
It's time for us to say goodbye

339
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,132
Until we meet again

340
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,842
Get 100 million won ready.

341
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,010
If you fail to do that,

342
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,263
you will end up…

343
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,559
donating your organs…

344
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,977
WAIVER OF PHYSICAL RIGHTS

345
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,521
…to many who are about to die.

346
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,189
Okay?

347
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,914
MI-JOO

348
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,750
Hello…

349
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,460
honey?

350
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,379
Where are you?

351
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,214
What do you mean, where am I?

352
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,133
I'm obviously out in the Pacific.

353
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,176
Right?

354
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,179
You haven't returned
and gotten in trouble, have you?

355
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,848
Don't say that to someone
who's turned over a fresh leaf

356
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,808
and working hard catching fish.

357
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,020
Hey, Mr. Kim!

358
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,355
Can you pull on the nets?

359
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,067
I'm practically made for this job.

360
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,404
I even caught a mermaid yesterday.

361
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,823
Where are you?

362
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,826
You aren't drinking alone
after getting fired, right?

363
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,203
Fired?

364
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,496
I'm opening up my own nail salon.

365
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,749
I finished decorating the place today.

366
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,083
Really?

367
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,252
I knew it, Mi-joo.

368
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,172
You got back on your feet
after that tough ordeal.

369
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,344
I felt really bad
when you said you wanted to give up

370
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,596
and go back to our hometown.

371
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,225
You're too talented
to lurk in the countryside.

372
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,310
You should do nails for rich ladies in…

373
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,232
Hello?

374
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,485
Let me call you back.

375
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,861
Okay, sure.

376
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,447
What was that?

377
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,911
Lee Mi-joo?

378
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,080
Wait.

379
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,542
Sam-sik!

380
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,378
Hey, Bang Sam-sik!

381
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,921
Is that you?

382
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,132
When did you get back?

383
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,677
When did you come back?

384
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,055
You said you'd surprise me
when we met again,

385
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,723
and you were right.

386
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,270
Did you get beaten up
by the mermaid you caught?

387
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,774
You see, out there in the Pacific,

388
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,944
there's a world of men that
you don't know about.

389
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,781
-Jeez.
-What do you know

390
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,992
About a man's heart?

391
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,411
-What's with you?
-Sorry.

392
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,745
You must be insane.

393
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:33,625
What about you? You're doing nails
for country ladies, not rich ladies?

394
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,503
What do you know

395
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,463
About a woman's heart?

396
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,259
What are you doing?

397
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,721
Right.

398
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,931
Since we both ended up here,

399
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,268
let's try not to judge each other.

400
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,770
Who are we to criticize one another?

401
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,856
We both messed up.

402
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,445
But still, we're better off than Kang-ho.

403
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,947
He used to be so haughty
like he owned the world.

404
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,532
Did you see? He became an idiot.

405
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,909
-Hey!
-Goodness, you startled me.

406
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,372
How could you say such a thing about
someone who's unwell?

407
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,542
The anger is bringing out your dialect.

408
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,296
That's my Mi-joo.
You're so cute, as always.

409
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,173
Gosh, you idiot.

410
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,884
All right.

411
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,469
I'm sorry.

412
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,096
You didn't have to get so worked up.

413
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,682
Hold on.

414
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,770
Do you still like Kang-ho?

415
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,439
-You're insane.
-Do you?

416
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,815
Gosh, move!

417
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,361
You're suddenly dodging my question.

418
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,362
You do.

419
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:45,947
You still do.

420
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,825
People avoid poop

421
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,577
not because it's dirty

422
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,621
but because it's scary.

423
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,796
You're scared of poop?

424
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,089
Mi-joo, why?

425
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,466
Why are you scared of it?

426
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,519
Seo-jin, what's wrong?

427
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,229
What is it? Why are you crying?

428
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,730
Did you hit him again?

429
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,816
-Come here.
-I didn't hit him.

430
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,402
He's crying because he doesn't want to
go to the public bath.

431
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,446
-What?
-Mom.

432
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,408
Do I have to go to the public bath?

433
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:35,789
I really hate going to the women's bath

434
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,166
with Grandma and Ye-jin.

435
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,882
Last week, he ran into Yun-ji and Da-hyeon
from kindergarten.

436
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,261
Stop crying! It's not your fault.

437
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,681
You're allowed in the women's bath
until you turn four years old.

438
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,224
Mom.

439
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,560
-Yes?
-I want to go to the men's bath

440
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,813
with my dad like other boys.

441
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,232
Can you tell him to come back?

442
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,067
Can you?

443
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,360
Please.

444
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,905
Seo-jin, come here. Stop crying.

445
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,449
There, there. Is that why you're upset?

446
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,685
Mom.

447
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,984
Mom.

448
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,695
Mom, let's go.

449
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,114
What?

450
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,783
-Where?
-I'm hungry.

451
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,619
When I'm hungry,

452
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,704
I should feed the pigs
before I eat, right?

453
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,622
Yes.

454
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,249
-I'll be outside.
-Okay.

455
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,632
Ultimately, it's better for us.

456
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,844
Now that we own that cornfield,
we won't look out of place here.

457
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,097
The problem is our house.

458
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,140
Do you really think

459
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,644
our problem is getting a house?

460
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,104
Oh, right.

461
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,649
Come to your senses!

462
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,986
If we don't find anything
by the end of the election,

463
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,447
we're both doomed.

464
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,448
Yes, sir.

465
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,827
It's not in the farm.

466
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,538
It must be somewhere in her house.

467
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,167
Let's first find out if anybody is inside.

468
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,002
Okay.

469
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,004
Hey.

470
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,223
A couple of guys who don't even know
the measurement unit for rice

471
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,892
suddenly turn up at a country village

472
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,145
and pay twice the price for land,
in cash, to start farming.

473
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,647
There are only two reasons for that.

474
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,108
One, because you're severely ill.

475
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,485
Two, because you're mentally ill.

476
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:14,489
Or you could be running away from trouble
or planning to cause trouble.

477
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,615
Excuse me.

478
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,952
You said there are only two reasons,
but you listed four.

479
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,620
Right.

480
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,747
There must be a misunderstanding.

481
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,458
We just want to farm, that's all.

482
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,919
Okay then. Let's do this.

483
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,046
I'll help you find a house,

484
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,674
and provide consulting services

485
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,135
from choosing crops
to learning farming techniques.

486
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,053
-No, you don't have to--
-All right.

487
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,265
In that case, why don't we discuss this

488
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,184
over a glass of makgeolli?

489
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,854
There's a brewery nearby
that's been around for 35 years,

490
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,105
and it's amazing.

491
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,064
Really?

492
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,566
You must like makgeolli.

493
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,276
-Yes.
-Let's go.

494
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,737
-Wait, sir. Hey!
-It's really good.

495
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,825
Hey.

496
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,037
Let's say one mother pig
costs 300,000 won.

497
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,038
Okay.

498
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,456
But a buyer comes and says,

499
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,124
"Goodness, sir."

500
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,585
"Only summer pigs cost that much."

501
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,713
"There's an increase in supply now,
so the price has dropped a lot."

502
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,424
"I'll give you 250,000 won."

503
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,633
What should you do?

504
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,178
Hey, you thief! I'm not selling it to you!

505
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,181
Yes, good job.

506
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,558
-Next, the sawdust distributor.
-Okay.

507
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,353
The sawdust distributor

508
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,981
wants 220 won per kilogram
when it used to be 190 won per kilogram.

509
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,694
Then he says, "This was made
with red pine tree from Russia,

510
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,363
so it's much better quality."

511
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,199
"If you make compost out of this
and use it to grow potatoes,

512
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,910
they'll grow as big as watermelons."

513
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,119
Then what should you do?

514
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,669
A shameless beast like you must leave!

515
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,088
My goodness.

516
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,508
Where did you learn such words?

517
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,093
Over there.

518
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:04,432
HAPPY FARM MUST BE DEMOLISHED!
CAN'T STAND THE SMELL

519
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,944
PIG FECES IN OUR CLEAN JOU-RI
PIG FARM OUT!

520
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,753
-Andrea.
-Yes?

521
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,256
Please put Kang-ho in working clothes.

522
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,424
Sure.

523
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,428
I will manipulate your movements now.

524
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,638
You must put up with the inconvenience.

525
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,272
What's wrong?

526
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,190
Why are you barking so much?

527
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,234
Is there a rat?

528
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,196
What are you doing here

529
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,448
like a rat?

530
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:06,161
The people in this village
won't believe a word I say.

531
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,330
I took a video of wastewater leaking out

532
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,040
from the back.

533
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,876
That's not wastewater.

534
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,628
It's just water
dripping from the water tank.

535
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,755
As if.

536
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,048
You did this too, didn't you?

537
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,383
Yes, I did it. So what?

538
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:24,637
I presented the idea to the villagers
to close down this place.

539
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,725
Everyone agreed with me,
but no one showed up.

540
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,893
They're the worst!

541
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,730
Damn it.

542
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,482
Do you want to die?

543
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,568
Do I want to die?

544
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,403
Do I want to die?

545
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,865
Nobody in this world
wants to die, you bastard!

546
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,285
Why should I die?

547
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,912
Why should I die?

548
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,497
Why?

549
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,290
-Why should I die?
-Mom!

550
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,666
-Let go!
-No, Ms. Jin!

551
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,876
-Ms. Jin!
-Hey!

552
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,295
-This behavior is improper.
-Mom.

553
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,714
-Stay away!
-You.

554
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,716
Listen carefully.

555
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,676
This farm

556
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,971
cost my husband his life.

557
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,808
No matter how much you try
to shut it down,

558
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,518
I'll never give it up.

559
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,605
If I die, my son will run it.

560
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,941
Then his son and grandson!

561
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,401
It's going to get passed on
through generations.

562
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,112
If you do something like this again,

563
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,658
then I'll kill you
no matter the consequences. Got it?

564
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,326
Darn it!

565
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,246
Ms. Jin!

566
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,747
Ms. Jin!

567
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,499
Ms. Jin!

568
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,959
This is bad.

569
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,710
We're in trouble!

570
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,922
EMERGENCY QUARANTINE
ACCESS CONTROL

571
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,133
EMERGENCY QUARANTINE
DO NOT ENTER

572
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,718
-Goodness.
-My gosh!

573
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,512
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

574
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,264
-Goodness.
-How can this happen?

575
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,682
What is all this?

576
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,684
PREVENTIVE CULLING OF POTENTIAL
LIVESTOCK WITH FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE

577
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,477
What on earth is happening?

578
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,104
Foot-and-mouth disease?

579
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,815
I heard Mr. Kim's goat farm
had an outbreak.

580
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,986
Why are the civil servants
headed to the pig farm?

581
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:07,448
If foot-and-mouth disease breaks out,
cows and pigs within a 3km radius

582
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,826
must be culled by law.

583
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,827
What?

584
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,706
Then Young-soon's pigs will be culled
even though they aren't sick?

585
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,500
That's the law.

586
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,461
Thankfully, Tiger isn't affected.

587
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,255
Damn it!

588
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,424
Who cares about the damn dog right now?

589
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,050
Then…

590
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,803
What will happen to that family?

591
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,638
For now,

592
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,558
they have to shut down the farm.

593
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:37,812
Those damn goats have been going around
doing all kinds of goat things

594
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,898
all around the village,

595
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,483
and they finally ended up causing trouble.

596
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,361
Goodness.

597
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,781
I feel so bad for Young-soon.

598
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,456
Sir, please don't.
Please don't kill our pigs!

599
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,083
Mom, do something.

600
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,252
Go stop them!

601
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,338
Andrea, please.

602
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,506
Andrea, do something.

603
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,017
Leave her alone!

604
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,311
She's feeding her piglets!

605
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,647
Just leave her there.

606
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,045
-Spread out.
-This way.

607
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,839
Be careful.

608
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,591
This way.

609
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,346
Why?

610
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,520
Why?!

611
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,650
No.

612
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,778
No!

613
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,279
No!

614
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,156
No!

615
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,533
-Mom.
-Ms. Jin.

616
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,702
-No, stop it, Mom.
-Ms. Jin.

617
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,828
No, Mom.

618
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,788
No.

619
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:22,750
-You can't do this to them.
-Ms. Jin.

620
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,005
They don't deserve to die like this!

621
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,798
You can't do this to them!

622
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,509
You can't!

623
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,635
No.

624
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,930
Those poor things.

625
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,391
Those poor things!

626
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,979
Those poor things!

627
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,356
No!

628
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,527
Those poor things!

629
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,195
-No!
-Don't do that!

630
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,782
-Those pigs aren't sick!
-Goodness.

631
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,244
-I can't watch.
-I'm sorry!

632
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,080
Isn't this too harsh?

633
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,957
Please be reborn as humans

634
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,084
in your next life.

635
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,212
-Goodness.
-Human? Life will be tougher.

636
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,131
-My goodness!
-Hey, Mr. Choi.

637
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,259
I'm glad you called.

638
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,554
Hello. It's me, Sam-sik.

639
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,559
No.

640
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,270
I don't have the money yet.

641
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,438
FAIRY BREWERY

642
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,483
But if you give me more time,

643
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,778
I'll pay back 200 million won
including interest.

644
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,614
Just one month. I promise you.

645
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:41,037
I promise, I do

646
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,205
I do

647
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,664
FAIRY BREWERY, FAIRY REAL ESTATE,
FAIRY FORTUNE TELLING

648
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,626
Darn it.

649
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,046
Who the hell drank my alcohol?

650
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,131
I got you, you punk.

651
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,592
What? It's you, Sam-sik.

652
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,553
Goodness, Mr. Yang.

653
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,848
Your security system
is still cutting-edge technology.

654
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,558
I can never steal from your place.

655
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,601
Goodness.

656
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,437
I took a few bottles of makgeolli
to drink with my friends.

657
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,564
You can put it under my dad's tab.

658
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,567
Hey, go tell him to pay his tab.

659
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,819
-Okay.
-Hey.

660
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:17,657
And I put aside those bottles
to use for my ritual tomorrow.

661
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,325
How could you take them?

662
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,953
-All right. Where were we?
-Goodness, that punk.

663
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,996
Yes, farming funds.

664
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,252
Call the agricultural technology center
to apply for the fund.

665
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,879
-Once you call--
-And listen.

666
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,674
Do you know
Kang-ho's family is in big trouble?

667
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,134
It's worse than big trouble.

668
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,845
That genius became an idiot overnight.

669
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:39,762
You punk.

670
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,682
Not Kang-ho. I'm talking about the farm.

671
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,143
The poor pigs were all culled

672
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:49,230
because of the outbreak
of the foot-and-mouth disease.

673
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,232
-What?
-Foot-and-mouth disease?

674
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,693
They sacrificed all those pigs

675
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,862
who were squealing
and struggling to survive.

676
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,616
It was painful for me to watch.

677
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,743
Imagine how she felt.

678
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,746
She fed and raised them
like they were her own.

679
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,707
She must be heartbroken.

680
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,500
What about Lion?

681
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,627
Is Lion dead too?

682
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,838
Kang-ho's house

683
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,091
is over 3km away from the goat farm,

684
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,384
so Lion is still alive.

685
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,970
-What a relief.
-What a relief.

686
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,472
What's a relief?

687
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,183
This is absurd.

688
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,602
Some had to die

689
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,478
while others lived

690
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,898
by a matter of a few meters.

691
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,608
Goodness.

692
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,987
Thankfully, this one must've survived.

693
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,575
But what's the point?
She lost all the other pigs.

694
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,911
She must be very shocked.

695
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,788
She hasn't returned from the farm.

696
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,582
Shut up.

697
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,213
And start searching.

698
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,631
Yes, sir.

699
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,095
I don't think it's in here.

700
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,224
I don't see any files.
There are just clothes and shoes.

701
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,687
Look, more clothes and shoes.

702
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,361
Mr. So.

703
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,789
Thank you for coming to the family meeting

704
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,709
for our children's wedding
despite your busy schedule.

705
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,964
It's to prepare my dearest daughter
and a great man like him

706
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,883
for their new journey together.

707
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,136
I'd rather miss out on a campaign.

708
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:51,936
Thank you for considering
my humble son a great man.

709
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,854
I'm very grateful.

710
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,315
We can tell a lot about a person
by their parents.

711
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,150
Think of who you are, sir.

712
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,529
You were born into a poor farm,
then later founded Dosang Group,

713
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,782
the top corporation that is
the backbone of our country's economy.

714
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,077
People often tease me,
calling me a rags-to-riches story.

715
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,747
Sir.

716
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,583
That is why I wish
to become the president.

717
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,295
A world where one can rise
from the bottom up.

718
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,381
Nowadays, social injustice
seems permanent,

719
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,508
and wealth and poverty are inherited.

720
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,510
Hence, no one can rise from the bottom up.

721
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:29,890
That's why the disadvantaged
do not make an effort to grow

722
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,352
and continue to just live
in this hopeless society.

723
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:34,854
I will

724
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:40,443
make Korea a place where one can rise.

725
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,237
And

726
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,281
the future of my politics

727
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,409
is you, sir.

728
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,678
Mom.

729
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,723
We should go now.

730
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,729
Yes.

731
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,860
We should go.

732
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,197
UNGRYEOL AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS

733
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,075
WHEN NAILS COME

734
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,659
Have you heard the news?

735
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,661
About Jou-ri.

736
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,914
I heard it's a huge mess
after the disease outbreak.

737
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,540
Goodness, I heard.

738
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,709
I can feel her pain.

739
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,087
We're not talking just one or two pigs.

740
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,506
Where did they bury all those pigs?

741
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,925
The goats were buried
in the yard of the farm,

742
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,720
and the pigs were buried
in the potato field.

743
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,347
The potato field?

744
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,307
Then she can't grow potatoes either.

745
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,267
Goodness.

746
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,685
Potatoes?

747
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,354
Wait.

748
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,107
Then why did she buy herbicide?

749
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,108
What?

750
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,818
Herbicide?

751
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,819
Yes.

752
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,071
When did she come by to buy it?

753
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,281
As soon as I opened today.

754
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,662
You haven't finished my nails yet!

755
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,871
What…

756
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,624
UNGRYEOL AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS

757
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,263
Kang-ho.

758
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,432
Say hi to your dad.

759
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,145
Dad…

760
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,232
Hello.

761
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,408
Honey.

762
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,620
I brought Kang-ho with me.

763
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,331
I wanted to bring him to you

764
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,585
after he starts walking again, but…

765
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,797
I'm sorry.

766
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,758
I'm sorry.

767
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,849
HERE RESTS CHOI HAE-SIK

768
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,312
Mom.

769
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,106
Have we picnicked here in the past?

770
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,108
I don't remember.

771
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,820
This is a picnic, right?

772
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,450
No, it's not. We need gimbap for a picnic.

773
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,585
My son, this bad mother of yours

774
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,255
never let you go on a picnic
like everyone else.

775
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,594
Long ago,

776
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,640
my mom and dad…

777
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,684
I mean,

778
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,480
your grandma, grandpa,

779
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,024
and uncle…

780
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,030
went on a picnic
with gimbap I made for them

781
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,033
and passed away.

782
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,745
And your dad

783
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,666
also went out with the gimbap I made

784
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,794
and never came back.

785
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,506
I was scared of that.

786
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,342
That's why I never let you go.

787
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,264
I was scared by the thought…

788
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,892
of becoming alone again.

789
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,325
Mom.

790
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,335
I'll open it for you.

791
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,844
In return, after we drink this,
we have to go down and eat.

792
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,345
I'm hungry.

793
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,931
And what do we do before we eat?

794
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,766
Feed the pigs first.

795
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,269
We have to feed Lion.

796
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,896
Lion will grow up,

797
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,107
have piglets, more piglets,

798
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,483
and more.

799
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,778
Then we'll be able to run
our pig farm again, right?

800
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,741
I'll help you out a lot, Mom.

801
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,916
Ms. Jin!

802
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,209
Kang-ho!

803
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,170
Are you home?

804
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,714
Ms. Jin!

805
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,008
Look at this. I knew it.

806
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,135
You're here to see Kang-ho because
you heard about the outbreak, right?

807
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,803
Have you seen Ms. Jin and Kang-ho?

808
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,846
They aren't home?

809
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,807
Their farm is closed off now.
Where did they go?

810
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,019
Ms. Jin!

811
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,187
-Kang-ho!
-Hey.

812
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,730
-There they are.
-What?

813
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,692
Hello, Ms. Jin.

814
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,570
I was worried after hearing the news.

815
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,198
You must be heartbroken.

816
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,408
UNGRYEOL AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS

817
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,125
This.

818
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,130
I should take the herbicide
to my mom at the garlic field, right?

819
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,175
Right?

820
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,762
Yes.

821
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,556
Goodbye then.

822
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,271
Kang-ho.

823
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,315
Yes?

824
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,026
Can you go to the public bath
with Seo-jin tomorrow?

825
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,653
Sam-sik will go too.

826
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,072
Me?

827
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,490
Why would I…

828
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,951
I should go, right? Of course.

829
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,203
Sounds great. I'd love to.

830
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,455
Okay. See you tomorrow then.

831
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,583
Goodbye, ma'am.

832
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,755
I'll get going too then.

833
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,345
What's going on?

834
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:29,393
Tell me. What is it?
Why do I have to go bathe with Seo-jin?

835
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,983
Wait. Are you crying?

836
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,528
Something serious must be going on.

837
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,363
What is it?

838
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,323
Tell me now!

839
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,200
Nothing's going on.

840
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,785
It's just a bath.

841
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,537
Everyone should bathe!

842
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,497
Don't you wash up?

843
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,837
I'll wash up!

844
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,046
I will.

845
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,091
Her son

846
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,886
must have told her
that he wants to bathe with his dad,

847
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,471
and it must've broken her heart.

848
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,431
Goodness.

849
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,308
I see she was too shy to tell me,

850
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,436
so she dragged that idiot in
to make me go.

851
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,688
At any rate,

852
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,149
you were cute today, as always, Mi-joo!

853
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,128
Young-soon.

854
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,839
Young-soon, are you home?

855
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,384
It's heartbreaking.

856
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,888
What are those?

857
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,557
Please take this.

858
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,809
What is this?

859
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,187
Wait, this is from that time.

860
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,023
-You're right.
-Why are you giving these to us?

861
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,400
Thanks to you two,

862
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,738
I was able to get through
some difficult times.

863
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:10,536
I know this is nowhere enough
to show my gratitude,

864
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,038
but please take it.

865
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,707
What are you doing?

866
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,584
-Are you crazy?
-You must be.

867
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,587
This is wrong. Don't do this.

868
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,798
I mean, Kang-ho's fiancée brought--

869
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:23,924
Hey.

870
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,676
Oh, no. Never mind.

871
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,219
You're right.

872
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,597
That's why I feel awful

873
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,141
whenever I see these.

874
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,769
But

875
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,480
if you don't want them,
I'll throw them out--

876
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:42,526
It'd be such a waste to throw them out.

877
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,948
Seo-jin! Ye-jin!

878
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,075
-Kang-ho!
-Kang-ho!

879
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,204
Let's go to the bath.

880
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,333
Over here!

881
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,170
Hey, didn't you bring any toiletries?

882
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,547
They have everything there.

883
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,631
What do you know

884
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,008
About men's baths?

885
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,050
Good grief.

886
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,345
You must be the famous twins.

887
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,722
Nice to meet you.

888
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,557
I'll be your father…

889
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,101
That hurts!

890
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,811
That hurts.

891
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:20,105
He really is in pain.

892
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,189
He is.

893
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,610
I don't know who he is,
but he's quite a guy.

894
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,362
He's my friend, Sam-sik.

895
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,697
Sam-sik?

896
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,741
The famous thief?

897
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,992
No, let's go.

898
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,785
We'll return safely.

899
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,995
Okay.

900
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,248
Go get yourself washed up
and have a good time.

901
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,625
Okay.

902
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,460
Okay, time to go!

903
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,587
-You don't want to end up like him.
-Let's go.

904
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,130
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

905
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,050
-That punk.
-Sorry, Sam-sik!

906
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,801
His memories must have come back.

907
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,262
Goodbye.

908
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,015
Wait up!

909
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,853
CERTIFIED COPY OF REGISTRY

910
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,939
My health will worsen by the day,

911
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,318
and I might die any day.

912
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,531
I'll only end up
becoming a burden to my unwell son.

913
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,035
Have you found
a rehabilitation center for your son?

914
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,161
Yes.

915
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:22,000
The fee will be deducted
from this bank account every month.

916
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,089
If my son ever returns to normal,

917
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,133
please grant him the rest.

918
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:35,097
If that never happens,

919
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,017
please handle everything
according to my will.

920
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,527
So are you saying Choi Kang-ho was the one

921
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,278
who's been exposing Woobyeok?

922
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,532
Look how pretty the wig is.

923
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,785
And those shoes are so cute.

924
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,578
Do these fit him?

925
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,915
Why don't we just get rid of Choi Kang-ho?

926
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,333
What do you mean?

927
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,420
If he returns to normal,
he may pose a threat to you.

928
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,631
Threat?

929
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,300
Hey, look.

930
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,012
Kang-ho exposed everything himself,

931
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,973
then went around patching it up.

932
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,100
Why do you think he did that?

933
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,769
That poor kid without any connections

934
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,440
worked desperately
to make some kind of a tie.

935
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:30,360
In a wig like this, no less.

936
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:35,532
This is what a man should be like
when he has ambition in his heart.

937
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,289
Mr. So, you just pitched

938
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:46,418
a four-seam fastball.

939
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:49,254
But something's not right.

940
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,173
Don't you think so?

941
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,302
Don't bring something on me

942
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,762
but on him.

943
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,805
Okay?

944
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,808
Kim Ju-hui reports.

945
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,895
Candidate Oh gave his first speech
in the most heated election battleground,

946
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:09,065
insisting he's the best candidate
who can bring about change.

947
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,365
Move aside. How dare you?

948
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,619
Come this way.

949
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,954
That's my job.

950
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,456
Let me do it.

951
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,252
Yes, I'll keep it short.

952
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,172
A world where one can rise
from the bottom up.

953
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,509
And rise to the very top!

954
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,760
I, Oh Tae-soo,

955
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,638
-"You reek of something."
-will create that world!

956
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,431
-What?
-I, Oh Tae-soo,

957
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,975
-I do? Of what?
-will make it happen!

958
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,686
Your hair is sparkling clean.

959
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,940
-I'll turn Korea into a place
-No?

960
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,610
where everyone can dream!

961
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,946
I will do it!

962
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,697
-"Is it the smell of dirt
-Thank you!

963
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,616
since you came from the bottom up?"

964
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,204
Thank you, everyone!

965
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,081
ASSEMBLYMAN OH, "A WORLD WHERE
ONE CAN RISE FROM THE BOTTOM UP"

966
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,958
Please give me your trust!

967
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,459
Give me your trust!

968
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,755
Ye-jin, did you have a good bath?
Seo-jin, what about you?

969
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,465
It's Mom!

970
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,217
-Hello, Ms. Jin.
-Seo-jin, come here.

971
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,469
-Mom.
-Give me your hand.

972
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,265
It must've been tough to help
both Seo-jin and Kang-ho bathe.

973
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,059
No, it's no trouble at all.

974
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:27,936
What do you know?
I'm the one who helped them.

975
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,064
You're right. Thank you, Sam-sik.

976
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:36,194
Kang-ho and I have an appointment.
We'll be on our way.

977
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,487
Kang-ho, say bye.

978
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,282
Thanks.

979
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,535
Thank you.

980
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,122
Bye, Ye-jin and Seo-jin.

981
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:50,625
Let's come together next week too!

982
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,419
Okay, let's do that.

983
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,588
Bye.

984
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,256
-Goodbye.
-Bye!

985
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,217
GEUMJA PUBLIC BATH

986
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,931
Guys, say goodbye.

987
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,434
-Bye!
-Bye!

988
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,603
-Bye!
-Bye!

989
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,354
Let's come again!

990
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,606
Okay!

991
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,149
-Bye!
-Bye!

992
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,319
-Bye!
-Bye!

993
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,243
Okay, the paperwork is all complete.

994
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,245
We'll take care of your son from now on.

995
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,955
Please don't worry.

996
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,417
It's close to your home too.
Isn't this great?

997
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,503
Please come by often.

998
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,671
Okay.

999
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:46,556
Kang-ho.

1000
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,017
Yes?

1001
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,569
You will

1002
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,406
live here and receive treatment
from now on.

1003
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:07,369
There are great doctors here

1004
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,288
as well as wonderful
rehabilitation equipment.

1005
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,334
So they'll help you walk again

1006
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,378
very soon.

1007
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,053
I have to live here now?

1008
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,429
Yes.

1009
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,392
With you?

1010
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,061
No.

1011
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,648
I can't live with you.

1012
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,275
You can't?

1013
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,236
Why not?

1014
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,655
Because…

1015
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,748
You know what?

1016
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:57,877
If you listen to the doctors

1017
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,797
and become healthy enough to walk again,

1018
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,052
I'll come back for…

1019
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,811
I'll come back…

1020
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,231
Mom.

1021
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:19,441
Yes?

1022
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,570
Are you going somewhere nice?

1023
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,531
What?

1024
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,158
Are you?

1025
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,496
Are you going somewhere nice by yourself?

1026
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:38,918
Mom…

1027
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,547
Mom.

1028
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,427
Mom, I'm sorry.

1029
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:51,056
I'll never do anything bad again.

1030
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,057
Mom.

1031
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,100
I'll listen to everything you say,

1032
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,185
and…

1033
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,688
I'll stay put, I'll exercise a lot,

1034
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,107
and I won't ask for a dog again.

1035
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,902
Mom, please don't go.

1036
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,157
Take me with you.

1037
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,076
Mom, take me with you.

1038
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,787
Take me with you.

1039
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,916
Mom!

1040
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,421
Mom.

1041
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,516
ONSOMANG REHABILITATION CARE CENTER

1042
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,562
ONSOMANG REHABILITATION CARE CENTER

1043
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,939
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be transferred to…

1044
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,776
She must have turned her phone off.
What should we do?

1045
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,944
Why didn't you watch him?

1046
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,405
This is his first day!

1047
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,992
-Call the police first.
-Okay.

1048
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,397
Hi, Juni, directions to home.

1049
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,192
Starting navigation.

1050
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,074
TO MY DEAR KANG-HO

1051
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,534
TO EVERYONE IN JOU-RI VILLAGE

1052
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,141
HYOEUM-RO 573

1053
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,954
It's not an easy job to bathe a kid.

1054
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,999
It must've been tough for Sam-sik.

1055
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,501
It was Kang-ho.

1056
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,712
What? Kang-ho?

1057
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:36,674
Yes, he scrubbed me and washed my hair.

1058
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,301
He's really good.

1059
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,053
He was like Dad.

1060
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,349
Hey! You take that back right now!

1061
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,643
That hurts! Let go of me!

1062
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,312
How dare you compare Kang-ho with Dad?

1063
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,481
How can that idiot be our dad?

1064
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,815
Lee Ye-jin!

1065
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,234
Get over here.

1066
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,028
You brat.

1067
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:59,155
How dare you pull out your brother's hair?

1068
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,323
That's enough!

1069
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,867
Our dad is really cool,

1070
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,704
really rich, and really smart.

1071
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,082
He has to be!

1072
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,459
You don't know anything.

1073
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,086
I hate you, Mom!

1074
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,840
TO MY DEAR KANG-HO
TO EVERYONE IN JOU-RI VILLAGE

1075
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:31,998
Mom!

1076
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,251
Mom!

1077
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,547
Mom!

1078
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:48,931
Mom!

1079
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:50,975
Mom!

1080
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:52,894
Mom!

1081
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,524
Mom.

1082
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,818
Mom.

1083
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:04,572
Mom, no.

1084
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:10,870
Mom.

1085
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,086
Mom, no.

1086
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,466
Mom.

1087
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,387
Mom.

1088
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,017
Mom.

1089
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,020
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1090
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,371
My mom abandoned me.

1091
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,123
Can't I just live with you?

1092
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,583
Was I a burden to you…

1093
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,210
because I'm unwell?

1094
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,878
So get up.

1095
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,839
Get up and walk!

1096
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,633
I also really want to know

1097
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,927
why I was abandoned.

1098
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,221
Mom, Dad is here.

1099
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,765
Mi-joo, let's get married.

1100
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,268
I'm going to marry Kang-ho oppa.

1101
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,937
-Okay?
-Are you home?

1102
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,858
Please keep my illness
a secret from the villagers.

1103
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,193
It's here. The evidence.

1104
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,486
To my mother whom I miss dearly.

1105
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,697
Are you healthy and well?

1106
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:33,619
