00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,976
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

2
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,314
-Goodbye, piggies.
-Goodness.

3
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,318
You still feel sad every time
you send them away, don't you?

4
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,986
Of course, I do.

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,864
I lived with them and fed them
longer than my husband and kid.

6
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,743
Goodbye.

7
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,704
I'll take good care of your piglets.

8
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,247
Don't worry about a thing.

9
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,333
I'll get going then.

10
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,334
-One second.
-Yes?

11
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,089
These potatoes are plump and delicious.
Eat them with your kids.

12
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,675
Goodness, you're always so kind.

13
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,721
By the way, how's your son doing?

14
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,988
-Ready or not!
-Ready or not!

15
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,074
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

16
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,700
-Shoot!
-Shoot!

17
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,830
All right! I won!

18
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,082
Okay!

19
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,216
Here we go!

20
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,766
Mom!

21
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,564
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

22
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,985
Are you done?

23
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,612
Yes, it's good as new.

24
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,364
-Goodness.
-It's perfect.

25
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,951
My gosh, you're such a crafty handyman.

26
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,538
Your family is skilled with your hands.

27
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,331
You know,

28
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,544
I'm feeling sort of offended to hear that.

29
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,505
Is it because I have a delinquent son?

30
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,383
Don't take things that far.

31
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,137
Anyway, I'm relieved that nobody got hurt.

32
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,598
-Yes.
-This could've been much worse.

33
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,224
Push me.

34
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,393
-Here I go.
-It's smooth.

35
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,978
-This is nice.
-Yes.

36
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,441
They said you'd love it

37
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,401
if I exercised.

38
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,569
Who did?

39
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,822
Goodness.

40
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:22,911
Goodness, Mommy's little boy
wanted to make her happy.

41
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,204
What a wonderful son.

42
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,082
Of course, he is.

43
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,753
And those clever twins
went after his weakness.

44
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,171
Kids.

45
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,257
How many times do I have to tell you
this is dangerous?

46
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,511
That's not a toy. That's his legs.

47
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,847
That's not my legs. It's a wheelchair.

48
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:48,645
Anyway, don't ever play
around with it again, okay?

49
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,941
It's not for muddy roads, icy roads,
bumpy stony paths, waterways,

50
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,442
rice paddy ridges, banks,

51
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,527
and especially anywhere up high.

52
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,737
Okay?

53
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,530
And it's not for
three people to ride, right?

54
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,823
Of course not!

55
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,908
See?

56
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,996
What about using the rubber
tube as a hula hoop?

57
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,456
What?

58
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,499
Kang-ho.

59
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,251
Goodness, Kang-ho…

60
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,543
Goodness. Hey!

61
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,212
You darned…

62
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,672
little twins!

63
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,340
You rascals!

64
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,591
-Goodness.
-Stop.

65
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,842
Don't do that.

66
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,135
I already talked to them.

67
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,056
Why did you drag him out and bully him?

68
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,599
We didn't bully him!

69
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,810
We helped him exercise!

70
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,645
How are you going to help him do that?

71
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,106
Look at him!

72
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,234
And you can't treat him like that!

73
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,610
He's not your friend!

74
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,696
What? We weren't friends?

75
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,947
I thought we were friends.

76
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,282
You said you were seven!

77
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,449
I am!

78
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,159
The doctor said I'm seven!

79
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,411
Right, Mom?

80
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,392
Beans will grow from your tummy.

81
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,880
Thirty-five.

82
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,256
Repeat after me.

83
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,799
Thirty-five.

84
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,842
That's right.

85
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,179
Kang-ho, you're 35 years old.

86
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,349
But you became a little ill.

87
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,729
So you became seven for a short while.

88
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,565
I know what that means.

89
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,566
What?

90
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,401
I'm stupid, right?

91
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,489
No! Who said that?

92
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,240
-Who said that to you?
-You did!

93
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,201
What?

94
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,745
You and the doctor said that.

95
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,246
"Simply put, he is…

96
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,082
Simply put, he is…

97
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,333
Stupid?

98
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,709
…stupid."

99
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,468
No, Kang-ho.

100
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,638
I said that
because I didn't know any better.

101
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,765
So here's the thing.

102
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,350
Yes.

103
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,811
Kang-ho,

104
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,938
you went back to your childhood.

105
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,442
Everyone wants to be young again.

106
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,862
I do too. I want to go back too.

107
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,658
Because if I could,
I'd be able to change many things.

108
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:54,205
But nobody in this world
can turn back time.

109
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,375
Yet you did, Kang-ho.

110
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,460
This is

111
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,796
a chance given from above.

112
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,383
A chance to start all over again.

113
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,637
"A chance given from above"?

114
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,182
Yes, that's right.

115
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,813
So you should be happy.

116
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,941
Don't be sad or devastated.

117
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,026
Be happy.

118
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,737
-Happy?
-Yes.

119
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,823
Your return

120
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,784
makes me feel…

121
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,038
happy.

122
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,626
Happy.

123
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,300
That's right.

124
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,482
Hello.

125
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,694
Squid and mackerel are extra fresh today.

126
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,654
-What would you like?
-Well…

127
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,824
Are you Sun-young's mother?

128
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,367
-I…
-What is it?

129
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,662
Did that bitch
run off with your money too?

130
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,625
-Sorry?
-That crazy bitch!

131
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,630
I can't live like this!

132
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,923
Good grief!

133
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:32,720
She met this gigolo somewhere

134
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,057
and gave him every single penny she had.

135
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,478
Then she even took out a private loan
to pay back his gambling debt.

136
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,562
Good grief.

137
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,023
She put up her home, salon,

138
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,235
and even her father's fishing boat
as collateral.

139
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,612
Goodness me.

140
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,031
That darned brat

141
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,700
never even called me once after that,

142
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,411
then texted me saying
she was going to Los Angeles

143
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,455
or whatever to make money.

144
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,831
Good grief.

145
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,710
All she left was that one message
before she disappeared.

146
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,343
-What do I do?
-I raised her wrong.

147
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,971
Who else is to blame?

148
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,098
You can just take me.

149
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,183
Just take me away!

150
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,103
No.

151
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,732
It must've been so tough for you.

152
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,319
You're much better than my daughter.

153
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,447
Just be my daughter!

154
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,950
Mom!

155
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,088
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WILL BE INITIATED
DUE TO LONG OVERDUE PAYMENTS.

156
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,465
LANDLADY

157
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,136
Hello, ma'am.

158
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,679
Are you really going to be like this?

159
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,349
I even gave you back
your deposit in advance.

160
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,436
Your rent payments have been long overdue.

161
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,396
I can't wait any longer.

162
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,149
I'm going to vacate the place
if you don't transfer the money by today.

163
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,442
Well, I…

164
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,166
SEO-JIN, YE-JIN
I MADE THIS BANKBOOK FOR YOU

165
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,378
I WANT TO LET YOU DO
EVERYTHING YOU WANT

166
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,633
YE-JIN, SEO-JIN
GIVE MOM THE POWER TO GO ON

167
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,285
Stay there.

168
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,123
A warm welcome
to Petit Nail, Sillim Branch!

169
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,002
How many years of experience do you have?

170
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,380
I got certified in school

171
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,465
and worked at the Ewha Branch
for three and a half years.

172
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,385
And I'm joining this branch
because I moved to Sillim-dong.

173
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,636
Welcome.

174
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,179
Your manager told us

175
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:24,141
you were popular among college girls
for your quick hands and nail arts.

176
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,851
I look forward to working with you.

177
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,144
Yes, I'll do my best.

178
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,772
-My gosh.
-It's here.

179
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,232
The raw fish here is delicious.

180
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,443
The owner catches the fish himself.

181
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,946
So this is caught in the wild?

182
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,450
Kang-ho?

183
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,119
No, not kelpfish. It's rockfish.

184
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,537
Wild rockfish.

185
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,122
A bottle of soju, please.

186
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,164
Mi-joo?

187
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,707
No, not Mi-joo. Soju.

188
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,684
Where have you been, you jerk?

189
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,615
I can't believe you've never called
after moving to Seoul.

190
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,535
I waited for so long.

191
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,705
Why didn't you call first?

192
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,707
I didn't have your number.

193
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,001
Your mom wouldn't tell me either.

194
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,253
You knew the school I was attending.

195
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,130
I wanted to look for you.

196
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,133
But I couldn't.

197
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,511
You ruined your exam because of me.

198
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,638
I couldn't ruin anything more.

199
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,560
Wait.

200
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,982
Did you give up on the bar exam?

201
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,694
I took the first test yesterday.

202
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,447
Isn't it a little too early to give up?

203
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,282
I see.

204
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,161
Then what are you doing here?

205
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:08,913
Working a part-time job.

206
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,457
Shouldn't you be studying every second?

207
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,626
I'm doing this to survive.

208
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,711
I have to make a living too.

209
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,589
What do you mean?
Doesn't your mom help you?

210
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,385
I'm old enough to look after myself.

211
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,262
But every second counts for you.

212
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,349
If I fail the exam
because of a part-time job,

213
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,434
it means I'm just not good enough.

214
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,145
Don't worry.

215
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,397
It's a restaurant, so I get free food,

216
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,525
the lady here sometimes
helps with my laundry,

217
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,569
and on weekends, I get to go fishing too.

218
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,863
Above all,

219
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,034
I like looking at these fish.

220
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,121
What's great about staring at fish
that are about to die?

221
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,373
Exactly.

222
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,876
They might die any moment now,

223
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,379
but no matter how painful or scary it is,

224
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,673
they're unable to cry or scream.

225
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,635
I think judicial officers
must be like that.

226
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,473
You hated how your fate was decided
the moment you were born.

227
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,060
I guess you've changed your mind.

228
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,271
No.

229
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,773
Nothing's changed.

230
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,193
I still hate it,
and it's still a heavy burden.

231
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,739
But I hate this heavy burden so much that
I'll make sure I make it.

232
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,327
That's the revenge for my fate,
which was already decided

233
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,121
the moment I was born.

234
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,883
So, Mi-joo, how are you doing?
How's your job?

235
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,100
Things have never gone well for me,

236
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,311
and I never had a reason to be successful.

237
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,855
But from now, I'm going to do well.

238
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,525
I just found something I want to do.

239
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,945
You just focus on your studies.

240
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,616
You might be able to pass it
with the top score if you don't work.

241
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,618
Let me invest in you.

242
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,914
I don't have much right now,
so I'll start with myself.

243
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,293
Let me help you get your revenge.

244
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,760
Thank you for everything.

245
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,471
We never had any kids,

246
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,015
so you were like a son to us.

247
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,183
This is so sad.

248
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,727
Don't be so sad.

249
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,813
He'll study hard
and become a judicial officer.

250
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,900
Come and visit me

251
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,485
when you need to blow off steam.

252
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,527
I'll give you a ride.

253
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,489
Yes, I'll do that. Thank you.

254
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,240
Future judicial officer, Kang-ho!

255
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,242
You got this!

256
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,166
Did you talk to them?

257
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,752
Yes, it went well.

258
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,254
-Wait, they'll see us.
-What?

259
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,800
Wait for me!

260
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,109
Focus!

261
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,820
Mi-joo.

262
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,499
Kang-ho, I'll wash these too.

263
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,379
-No! It's okay.
-Let me.

264
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,589
-No!
-There's another one.

265
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,677
PETIT NAIL

266
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,594
Mi-joo.

267
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,554
Yes?

268
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,602
YOU HAVE PASSED THE 1ST TEST

269
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,438
Really?

270
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,189
My gosh!

271
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,571
BAR EXAM MEAL

272
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,867
Hey. What is that?

273
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,161
YOU HAVE PASSED THE 2ND TEST

274
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,581
Really?

275
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,917
Gosh, look at those two.

276
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,754
-Oh, my.
-My gosh.

277
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,049
Don't forget your bar exam meal.

278
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,341
-Bye.
-Okay.

279
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,637
-Have a great day.
-Okay!

280
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,141
That looks good.

281
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,278
BAR EXAM MEAL REVIEW
FOUR STARS

282
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,616
THIS PLACE IS GREAT!
ONE LESS STAR FOR ONLY ONE KISS

283
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,673
YOU HAVE PASSED THE BAR EXAM

284
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,229
You know what?

285
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,731
You saved me twice already.

286
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,902
Once when I choked on candy,

287
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,403
and…

288
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,156
when I got into a motorcycle accident.

289
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,620
If you save me one more time,

290
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,915
then I'll let you marry me.

291
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,173
-That's weird.
-What?

292
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,218
Why am I punished
for doing something nice?

293
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:58,846
Punished?

294
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,808
-Come here. What did you say?
-I was joking.

295
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,893
-I'll teach you a lesson!
-No, it was a joke.

296
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,979
-Okay?
-It was a joke.

297
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,524
-Mi-joo.
-Yes?

298
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,152
You should be grateful

299
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,238
to someone who makes you want to live,

300
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,991
not someone who saved you.

301
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,748
I want to live

302
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,501
a very long time with you.

303
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,464
All right.

304
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,673
I got him.

305
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,934
Okay, you're all set.

306
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,852
I'm sorry for the trouble every time.

307
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm sorry for the trouble every time.

308
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,774
Goodness, do you feel bad?

309
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,567
Then get well soon.

310
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,028
That'll comfort your mom,
you, and all of us.

311
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:43,242
It's a relief he can go back and forth
instead of staying at the rehab center.

312
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,118
-He's much better, right?
-Yes.

313
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,870
-Here.
-Goodness.

314
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,914
You like abalone porridge, so I made some.

315
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,707
I also packed water kimchi,

316
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,168
so have a bite while he exercises.

317
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,253
Don't skip your meals.

318
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,587
You didn't have to.

319
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,422
You didn't have to.

320
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,550
You feel sick in your stomach
because of stress.

321
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,804
You have so much to look after every day.

322
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,598
And you always eat in a hurry
in the kitchen.

323
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,517
That's why you feel sick!

324
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,518
She's right.

325
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,853
Kang-ho has gotten much better now,

326
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,772
so you need to relax a little.

327
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,607
You need to relax a little.

328
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,653
-See you later.
-Okay, go on.

329
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,530
Wait!

330
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,574
-Oh, my.
-Wait!

331
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,742
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

332
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,785
Wait.

333
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,289
I was worried that
you might have left already.

334
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,748
Kang-ho, give me your hand.

335
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,750
Here.

336
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,544
Goodness, what's that for?

337
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,715
You'll find a homemade
snack store for pets

338
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,467
near the back exit of the hospital.

339
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,429
Can you pick up an Alaskan salmon tart,

340
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,432
ricotta cheese cookies,
and oatmeal dog chews?

341
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,642
-Please get me--
-I knew it.

342
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,019
Go.

343
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,146
Mom, go.

344
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,230
Go on.

345
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,316
Go!

346
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,775
Go.

347
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,110
Just go.

348
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,028
Go!

349
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,243
That's it.

350
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,372
Next, left foot.

351
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,086
Two more steps. One, two, three.

352
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,505
That's it.

353
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,840
Good.

354
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,551
One more time.

355
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,429
Last one.

356
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,014
-Excuse me.
-Last one.

357
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,474
Excuse me.

358
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,685
Where can I get some digestive medicine?

359
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,228
-Please follow me.
-Okay.

360
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,731
PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

361
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,275
-Bye, Kang-ho.
-Goodbye.

362
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,401
Get some rest.

363
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,740
Mom?

364
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,167
Mom.

365
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,508
Mom.

366
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,260
Mom!

367
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,268
Mom…

368
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,269
Mom.

369
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,646
Mom.

370
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,314
Mom.

371
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,066
Mom!

372
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,025
Kang-ho.

373
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,529
-Mom!
-Kang-ho.

374
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,239
Mom!

375
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,908
-What's wrong?
-Mom!

376
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,410
Kang-ho, look at me.

377
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,788
-Mom!
-Look at me!

378
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,498
Look at me!

379
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,000
When you don't see me,

380
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,669
where did I say you could find me?

381
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,338
Pig farm.

382
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,841
Potato field.

383
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,384
And?

384
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,718
Bathroom.

385
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,804
Kitchen.

386
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,140
And? If you don't see me there?

387
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,725
I should call you.

388
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,687
You're right.

389
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,106
I will

390
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,359
never go anywhere without you, okay?

391
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,945
-Never.
-Okay.

392
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,282
Okay?

393
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:17,080
The results of the presidential
preference poll this month showed

394
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:21,543
Assemblyman Oh Tae-soo
as the leading candidate by 42.5%.

395
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,503
-Yes.
-This shows

396
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:27,465
many people are showing
their support for your candidacy.

397
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,342
If you do declare your candidacy,

398
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,804
is there a pledge you'd like to make?

399
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,307
If I run for the presidential election,

400
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,893
I will only abide by one principle.

401
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,729
"Come empty, return empty."

402
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,232
I, Oh Tae-soo, will come empty-handed…

403
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,400
ENCOUNTERING A NEW ERA, A NEW PERSON

404
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,860
…and leave empty-handed.

405
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,528
I see.

406
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,573
That was Assemblyman Oh's principle
when it comes to politics.

407
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,908
If he declares candidacy, that is.

408
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:58,246
Let's look forward to seeing
the rise of a new political leader.

409
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,625
This time, I'd like to ask
a casual question.

410
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,712
Who gives you
the most strength when you need…

411
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,756
What did you just say?

412
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,967
You want the money back?

413
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,555
The term was for him to leave Korea
right after the accident.

414
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,392
But Mr. Yang Gu-man
suddenly took his own life,

415
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,311
which led to a police investigation

416
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,521
and ended up putting us in danger.

417
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,566
This is a breach of contract.

418
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,445
I already know the hit-and-run accident
and suicide were in the contract.

419
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,573
As soon as I received
a huge amount of money in the bank,

420
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,575
I got a call about my husband's death.

421
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,912
And the day after that,
I received his suicide note.

422
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,248
It was all written there.

423
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,460
Where he got the money,
who made him do it,

424
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,088
and why he had to take his own life.

425
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,423
Where is

426
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,801
Mr. Yang's suicide note?

427
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,887
If you lay a finger on me or my child,

428
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,557
that note will be sent to the police.

429
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,394
I must save myself too.

430
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,733
All right.

431
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,195
Would you like to continue watching?

432
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,741
It took me a lot of effort

433
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,160
to find all these.

434
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,245
Do you know that?

435
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,332
Apparently, at the time of the accident,

436
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,128
Kang-ho was asleep in the car.

437
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,547
How does that make any sense?

438
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,424
He had just cut ties with his mother,

439
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,092
but managed to sleep peacefully afterward?

440
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:38,888
Does this mean
Kang-ho is the worst bastard in history?

441
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,642
Or did someone slip him

442
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,811
sleeping pills or something?

443
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,313
Oh, right.

444
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:51,234
The day before the accident, your daughter

445
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,030
got a prescription for sleeping pills.

446
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,114
Mr. Song!

447
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,616
Right, I enjoyed your show.

448
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,327
You were eloquent.

449
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,163
"I will come empty-handed
and leave empty-handed."

450
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,873
How wonderful.

451
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,960
Who would watch that and imagine that

452
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,714
you had your future son-in-law murdered?

453
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,609
Do you remember

454
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,611
Choi Hae-sik?

455
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,613
Choi… Who?

456
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,073
Back in 1987,

457
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,574
during the urban improvement,

458
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,577
the man who was running
a pig farm in Bongu-dong.

459
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,330
That Choi Hae-sik.

460
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,208
Goodness, I don't even remember
someone I met yesterday.

461
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,502
A man from 30 years ago?
Anyway, what about him?

462
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,755
Do you know how my daughter
came to meet Choi Kang-ho?

463
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,509
My daughter was arrested by him

464
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,636
for carrying illegal drugs.

465
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,679
It was odd, so I checked.

466
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,641
But they didn't receive
any order or report

467
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,393
regarding illegal drugs.

468
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,353
That's right.

469
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,564
He approached her on purpose.

470
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,526
I'm sure

471
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,570
it was to use my daughter

472
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,157
to eventually approach me.

473
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,078
Choi Kang-ho already knew everything.

474
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:30,291
He knew who killed his father

475
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,919
thirty years ago.

476
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,049
Who killed his father?

477
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,343
He's Choi Hae-sik's son.

478
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,719
Choi Kang-ho.

479
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,804
Exactly.

480
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,892
Who killed Choi Kang-ho's father,
Choi Hae-sik?

481
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,145
Did you kill him?

482
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,897
You did.

483
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,899
Oh, my.

484
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,985
Did I kill him?

485
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,028
Really?

486
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,657
I didn't know
because there was no evidence.

487
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,162
But isn't this odd?

488
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,290
A kid who wanted to
take revenge on his father's killer

489
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,918
came to work for me without hiding that
he is Choi Hae-sik's son?

490
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,464
That's crazy.

491
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,673
Are you saying

492
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,509
you already knew who Choi Kang-ho was?

493
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,638
Look, Mr. Oh.

494
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,766
Do you really think

495
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,727
I wouldn't have checked
before I took him in

496
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,104
to do the dirtiest of jobs for me?

497
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,862
She said she'd give me drugs,
but it was a lie!

498
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,282
So…

499
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,619
I killed her.

500
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,336
No, Chairman Song.

501
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,255
I didn't hear anything.
Please, sir. Don't kill me!

502
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,842
Jung Jong-gu, the defendant and owner
of a street tteokbokki stall,

503
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,512
went to an alley nearby
to return a lipstick

504
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,971
Woo Mi-jeong had left behind,

505
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,098
where he found her dead.

506
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,519
The defendant checked to see
if she was conscious,

507
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,687
then a passerby saw it and made a report.

508
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,107
He was soon arrested on the scene
by nearby officers.

509
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,862
LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY PERMIT
JIN YOUNG-SOON, CHOI HAE-SIK

510
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,282
This is Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho,
who took charge of the trial.

511
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,325
It's a pleasure.

512
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,118
Hello, I'm Choi Kang-ho

513
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,829
with the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

514
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,460
Your grandson's name will not be mentioned
during the course of this trial.

515
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:41,256
Prosecutor Choi
will ensure discretion throughout it.

516
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,895
I'm really curious

517
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:00,191
about your parents who brought you up
to be such a promising prosecutor.

518
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,777
What are your parents like?

519
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,446
So,

520
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,825
what does your father do?

521
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,328
He passed away.

522
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,874
Goodness.

523
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,334
I shouldn't have asked.

524
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,378
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,088
It's all right.

526
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,549
He passed away before I was born.

527
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,593
I don't have any memories of him.

528
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,969
He passed away…

529
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,221
even before you were born?

530
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,683
He must have passed away
at a very young age.

531
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,851
What happened?

532
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,356
I heard he took his own life.

533
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,441
Suicide?

534
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,693
Why did he do that?

535
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,195
His farm went under after a fire,

536
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,532
and he was apparently
under a lot of stress.

537
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,910
I don't know anything more.

538
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,121
Well…

539
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,459
To be frank, I don't want to know.

540
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,004
To me, my father

541
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,715
is just an irresponsible man

542
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,259
who abandoned his wife and unborn child.

543
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:15,350
Anyhow, I'm sorry.

544
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,186
Have a drink with me.

545
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,701
Prosecutor Choi, let me ask you something.

546
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,203
What's the reason?

547
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,831
-Sorry?
-This trial, I mean.

548
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,043
Are you after money or power?

549
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,338
If I want it,

550
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,882
can you give it to me?

551
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,594
You just saved my grandson.

552
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,137
So why not?

553
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,935
In that case, both.

554
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,814
Man.

555
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,024
You're a man, aren't you?

556
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,110
Mr. So.

557
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,073
Go on.

558
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,418
In return, from now on,

559
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,420
you'll be a part of my family.

560
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,632
Thank you.

561
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,594
Thank you.

562
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,637
Thank you very much.

563
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,681
That's enough.

564
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,268
I'll do my best, Mr. Song. Thank you!

565
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,731
I don't care what Kang-ho had on his mind

566
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,274
when he approached me.

567
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,068
I don't care if it's ambition or wrath.

568
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,655
Because his hands are now also dirty.

569
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,534
All I want to do is use his talent

570
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,455
and then I'll abandon him.

571
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,094
Goodness, Mr. Son.

572
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,931
What on earth are you doing?
It's been an hour.

573
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:24,103
It's because my breathing rhythm is off.

574
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,063
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,940
This time, I'll really insert it.

576
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,498
Damn it.

577
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,209
Even fish don't breathe like that.

578
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,419
Mr. Son.

579
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,507
Are you really a licensed doctor?

580
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,217
I'm getting a bit anxious.

581
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,635
Goodness.

582
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,181
-Oh, my! What are you doing?
-Kang-ho.

583
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,682
My mom feels anxious.

584
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,560
No, Kang-ho.
That's dangerous. Give it to me.

585
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,729
Are you really licensed?

586
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,607
I really am! What's with you?

587
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,568
Honey, tell him.

588
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,569
He is.

589
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,031
He would never forge a license.

590
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,284
Although he has forged
his resident registration card before.

591
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,328
-What?
-What?

592
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,081
I did it because I love you!

593
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,709
I thought that was how I could have you!

594
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,836
You're my woman!

595
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,422
I thought you might not like me
because of our age gap.

596
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,467
Oh, my. Is that really why?

597
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,262
Did you want me that badly?

598
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,307
Good grief.

599
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,767
How is that relevant right now?

600
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,603
He'll bleed if you stab him.

601
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,815
That'll make me sad.
Do you want me to be sad?

602
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,531
Good boy.

603
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,241
-Good boy.
-Good, Kang-ho.

604
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,451
-Good boy.
-You must've been startled.

605
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,662
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

606
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,289
No, it's fine.

607
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,667
You can feel that way
if he doesn't seem very trustworthy.

608
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,632
By any chance, do you know

609
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,886
a man named Choi Mun-sik,
who owns a carp farm in Negi-ri?

610
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,269
Hello?

611
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,646
The realtor?

612
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,774
Yes, one second.

613
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,902
Was it Choi Mun-sik?

614
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,862
-Isn't it Yoo Mun-sik?
-Not Lee?

615
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,363
No, he's Choi Mun-sik.

616
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,283
Yes, that huge carp farm in Negi-ri.
Of course, I know.

617
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,826
I've heard of him too.

618
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,621
We know. Go on.

619
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,331
What's with him?

620
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,211
Mr. Son, go on and talk.

621
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,129
Go on and talk, Mr. Son.

622
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,756
Mr. Son…

623
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,299
What's with him?

624
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,385
So that Choi Mun-sik--

625
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,346
I have to go to Seoul tomorrow.

626
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,933
Seoul? What for?

627
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,271
I'm sorry I keep asking you guys
for favors like this.

628
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,067
Don't say that. We're neighbors.

629
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,401
Don't worry.

630
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,196
We'll give the pigs their meals
and Kang-ho his feed…

631
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,455
We'll make sure Kang-ho has his meal
and the pigs their feed.

632
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,123
Don't worry about a thing.

633
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,710
Okay. Andrea's got the farm covered,

634
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,462
so please just look after Kang-ho.

635
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,047
I'll get going then.

636
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,425
Right.

637
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,512
Kang-ho, I'll come back soon

638
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,931
after I get your stuff.

639
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,017
I'll go with you and come back with you.

640
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,435
Kang-ho.

641
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,064
I told you, didn't I?

642
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:58,567
The place is really dusty
because people are moving things.

643
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,154
If dust gets into your body,
you'll get sick.

644
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,865
And that'll make me really sad.

645
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,951
Do you want me to be sad?

646
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,536
No.

647
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,418
How soon will you come back?

648
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,463
Around five o'clock.

649
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,632
-Five o'clock.
-Yes.

650
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,012
So be good and do as they say, okay?

651
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,888
Make sure you study and exercise.

652
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,599
-Okay.
-Good.

653
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,436
WE'RE ALL JOU-RI FAMILY

654
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,038
I told you, didn't I?

655
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,248
I told you he'd be doing something stupid.

656
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,500
Why are you here?

657
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,587
I heard Ms. Jin
is coming back at five o'clock.

658
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,505
Yes.

659
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,134
So what time is five o'clock?

660
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,263
We're only seven,
so we can't read the clock,

661
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,434
but I do know that we have
a lot of time to play with him.

662
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,269
-Yes!
-Yes!

663
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,521
No, I can't play today.

664
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,691
I have to study and exercise.

665
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,443
Study? We'll help you.

666
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,111
Exercise?

667
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,614
You know we're experts at that.

668
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,699
-Let's play!
-No! I can't!

669
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,035
-Let's play!
-No! I can't play right now!

670
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,453
No!

671
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,580
No!

672
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,232
I left everything as is
because I thought you would return soon.

673
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,070
But the realtor called and said
your lease has expired.

674
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,655
CHOI KANG-HO
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

675
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,240
I'm sorry, Kang-ho.

676
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,292
I've always wanted to visit this place.

677
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,713
And I'm finally here.

678
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,601
Are you taking this painting?

679
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,354
This is…

680
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,731
-Sure.
-Okay.

681
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,998
He had some things here too.

682
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,295
MY SON, JUNG JONG-GU, IS INNOCENT!

683
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,338
I DENOUNCE PROSECUTOR CHOI KANG-HO!

684
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,264
He doesn't have a lot here.

685
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:20,019
I put his personal belongings in here.

686
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,228
And… Right.

687
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,230
That plant pot is his too.

688
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,486
It looks dead, so you can leave it.
We'll throw it out.

689
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,653
No.

690
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,199
It's not dead.

691
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,117
The stem looks perfectly fine.

692
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,286
I'll take it.

693
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,039
Why didn't anyone water this?

694
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,418
You can't go in there.
Ma'am, please leave.

695
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,461
Please.

696
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,881
Where's Choi Kang-ho? Where is he?

697
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,883
Woobyeok Group bought him off, right?

698
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,927
That's why the case was acquitted!

699
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,386
My daughter is the evidence!

700
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,097
So how is it that the case is dismissed
for lack of evidence?

701
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,807
Ma'am, you can't do this here!

702
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,727
If you don't stop, we'll arrest you
for obstruction of justice.

703
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,853
Come on.

704
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,396
Where is Choi Kang-ho?

705
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,689
Please leave.

706
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,691
Where is he?

707
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,817
Please leave.

708
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,031
What was that woman talking about?

709
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,871
MY SON, JUNG JONG-GU, IS INNOCENT!

710
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,623
I DENOUNCE PROSECUTOR CHOI KANG-HO!

711
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,050
Excuse me.

712
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,761
Why are you doing this?

713
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,640
What did my son do so wrong
for you to do this here?

714
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,519
Are you Prosecutor Choi Kang-ho's mother?

715
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,396
Yes, I'm his mother.

716
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,690
If you feel something is unfair,

717
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,609
you should go through the legal process
and get a retrial.

718
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,904
Why on earth are you
condemning my son so harshly?

719
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,617
What's wrong with you? Give it back!

720
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,202
Give it back!

721
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,458
My son

722
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,961
has a physical disability.

723
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,507
He couldn't even hurt a fly.

724
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:18,971
Your son knew that,
but he took a bribe from a rich man

725
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,432
and turned my son into a murderer.

726
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,435
When my husband asked to hear him out,

727
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,313
he said such harsh things
and made him collapse.

728
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,898
Your son is such a horrible person.

729
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,402
Why did you give birth to such scum?

730
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,445
Darn it!

731
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,864
I will make your son pay for it!

732
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,451
I may forget to eat,

733
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:45,331
but I will not forget to pray that

734
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,667
your son gets punished and dies!

735
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,420
You got that?

736
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,505
Why should my son get punished?

737
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,717
Your son should be punished for his crime.

738
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,844
He was bribed?

739
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,597
Why would he? What more could he want?

740
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,433
Did you see him take it?

741
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,187
If you say anything of this sort again,

742
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,065
I will make you pay for it.

743
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,149
Understand?

744
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,108
All right.

745
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,985
Kill me.

746
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,195
Just kill me.

747
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,489
Kill me!

748
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,409
My poor son…

749
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,287
Now, the next one is a science question.

750
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,164
This insect lives in a flower.

751
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,291
Butterfly.

752
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,334
Wrong.

753
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,711
-Bee.
-Wrong.

754
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,629
What?

755
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,758
Silverfish, cabbage caterpillars,
fleas, and aphids.

756
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,301
Correct!

757
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,553
I was actually talking
about napa cabbage flowers.

758
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,430
Okay, ten points to Lee Seo-jin.

759
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,393
Hey, Ye-jin, that's not right.

760
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,937
He mentioned four.
That means he gets forty points.

761
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,359
Okay. He can get 40 points.

762
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,945
That could've been bad, right?

763
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,322
Right, sure.

764
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,368
Okay, the next one is a math question.

765
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,413
Seo-jin had five apples.

766
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:11,208
But Ye-jin stole three. How many are left?

767
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,544
Kang-ho was faster.

768
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,382
Simple larceny shall be punished
for up to six years

769
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:22,928
or by a fine under ten million won
under Article 329 of the Criminal Act.

770
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,684
What's simple larceny?

771
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,270
What?

772
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,689
What's simple larceny?

773
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,819
Catch it!

774
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,822
Oh, no. She's mad.

775
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,244
You should have caught it.

776
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,080
My mom sent it to us from the US.

777
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,999
You almost lost it!

778
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,585
-The US?
-Yes, the US.

779
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,502
Look.

780
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,753
It's written in English.

781
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,547
"From the US."

782
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:00,883
Sorry.

783
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:04,803
Anyway, I'll get really mad
if you miss the ball again.

784
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,763
-Okay.
-All right.

785
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,931
Play ball!

786
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,106
Strike!

787
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,191
Hey, Ye-jin.

788
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,443
-That's a strike?
-Yes.

789
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,738
You're really good at baseball.

790
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,490
Did your dad teach you?

791
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,454
Don't ever mention my dad again,

792
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,080
especially before my grandma.

793
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,916
Why not?

794
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,834
This is a huge secret.

795
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,504
Actually, my dad is…

796
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,052
What? Your dad is a horrifying bastard?

797
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,472
I'm sure of it.

798
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:52,226
My grandma said that countless times.

799
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,811
But what's a horrifying bastard?

800
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,235
Tell him.

801
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,823
Do you know what horrifying means?

802
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,577
It means scary in other words.

803
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:16,500
So it means our dad
is someone who's really scary.

804
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,377
-I see.
-He's so scary that

805
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,837
my grandma shudders

806
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,757
whenever she mentions him.

807
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,678
I even saw her eyes turn white.

808
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,471
He must be really scary.

809
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,849
So you better behave.

810
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,686
If you don't, we'll tell on you

811
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,854
to our horrible bastard dad!

812
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,648
Understood?

813
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:40,607
Yes, ma'am.

814
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,694
Come on. You don't have to be so polite.

815
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,362
Okay.

816
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,323
All right, let's get back to baseball.

817
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,616
All right.

818
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:02,713
No!

819
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,974
-All safe?
-Yes, I'm fine.

820
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,684
I'm talking about the ball!

821
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,020
Is my bouncy ball safe?

822
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:18,937
No way.

823
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,774
Choi Kang-ho!

824
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,528
How dare you lose my bouncy ball?

825
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,030
My…

826
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,823
My dad

827
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:32,701
will come and teach you a lesson!

828
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,870
Ye-jin, wait!

829
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,996
Seo-jin!

830
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:40,125
Kang-ho would never do
something like that.

831
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,545
Things like that happen from time to time
when a trial doesn't go well.

832
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,671
Don't worry about it.

833
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,762
No.

834
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,485
Goodness.

835
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,364
Are you all right?

836
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,032
Of course not. How can I be fine?

837
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,455
What are you doing?

838
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,416
Lady, what do you think?

839
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,543
I'm taking a photo of the assailant.

840
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,253
What do you mean?

841
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:29,591
Look how much damage
your beat-up truck caused

842
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,010
to my expensive foreign car.

843
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,388
You hit me from the back.

844
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,890
I don't want to hear it.

845
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,184
I'll settle for 50 million won.

846
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,937
If anything, I should be saying that!

847
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,563
Forget it. I'll call the police.

848
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,107
The police? Listen, lady.

849
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,317
Do you really want to go to prison?

850
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,403
Why would I go to prison?

851
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,905
You should keep
a safe distance when you drive!

852
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:54,324
Safe distance, my foot.

853
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:58,286
If you can't drive, you should
just cook for your kids at home

854
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:03,792
and just online shop
with your husband's money.

855
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,379
Why the heck do these women
have to drive on the road

856
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:11,258
and get in the way of a great man?

857
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,514
I don't have a husband who makes money,

858
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,684
but I still need to feed my kid.

859
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,978
So I drive this smelly truck

860
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,439
-to make money--
-Oh, I see.

861
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,274
So you don't have a husband.

862
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,191
Lady.

863
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:33,029
I knew it as soon as I saw you.

864
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,574
The way you talk back to me

865
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:39,035
shows just how tough your life must be.

866
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,579
My gosh.

867
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,123
How could you be so brazen and yell at me?

868
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,833
I can't believe this.

869
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,211
Goodness.

870
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,964
Goodness, look at you.

871
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:55,135
I told her she didn't have to
worry about a thing.

872
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,638
But look at him now. What do I do?

873
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,432
Goodness.

874
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,685
Darn it!

875
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,813
Those darned twins.

876
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,649
My gosh.

877
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,526
Goodness.

878
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,653
Wait.

879
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,781
Shouldn't he

880
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,408
wash his lower body too?

881
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,035
Right.

882
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,039
Just strip him naked and wash him.

883
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,541
Just pretend he's a seven-year-old.

884
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,295
But still, his body
isn't that of a seven-year-old.

885
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:34,716
Then what do we do?
Do we just leave him covered up in mud?

886
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,011
Then you do it. Think of him as Sam-sik.

887
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,848
Why would I bathe that damned kid?

888
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,185
Then I'll do it.

889
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,814
I bathe my husband too.

890
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,358
-Oh, my.
-Sparkling clean.

891
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,236
He gets sulky and refuses to eat

892
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,987
if I don't bathe him.

893
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,615
He's such a whiny baby.

894
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,661
All right. Here we go.

895
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,704
Oh, my.

896
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,583
-It's all right. I'll be gentle.
-Well…

897
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,169
-Hey, she's back.
-Mom!

898
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,504
Mom!

899
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:13,505
Mom!

900
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,616
Mom.

901
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,912
May I go out for a moment?

902
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:53,169
I lost Ye-jin's bouncy ball
while we were playing.

903
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,505
No.

904
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,299
We weren't playing.

905
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,758
We were exercising.

906
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,260
I studied too, Mom.

907
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,471
Silverfish, cabbage caterpillars, fleas,

908
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,765
and aphids live in a flower.

909
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,268
This flower is actually
a napa cabbage flower.

910
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,938
But I didn't know that.

911
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,945
I have to find that bouncy ball.

912
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,367
She's going to tell her dad.

913
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:28,496
And their dad is a horrifying bastard,
so he's really scary.

914
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,082
Mom, please, just once.

915
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,460
It'll only be a moment. I'll be quick.

916
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,962
Right, why don't we go together?

917
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,800
Why did you live like that?

918
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,510
Why did you live like that?

919
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,096
What's all this?

920
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,433
Did you take money and bribes
and do bad things?

921
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,519
No, right? Say you didn't.

922
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,355
Say you didn't!

923
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,732
Say you didn't!

924
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,446
You brought tears and pain

925
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,990
into other people's lives!

926
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,910
Did you think you'd live a good life?

927
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,913
Did you think you'd be fine?

928
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,457
Look.

929
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,544
Look how you've been punished
for what you've done!

930
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,921
Look!

931
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,215
Look, you punk.

932
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,314
It's all my fault.

933
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,194
I told you to help those in need.

934
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:45,198
I told you to save
those who have been wronged.

935
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,451
But I ended up raising you like this.

936
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,457
I locked you up in a pigsty
and didn't even let you breathe,

937
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,626
telling you to only study!

938
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,471
I wanted to make you rich and powerful,

939
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:13,351
but instead, I made you
into a cold-hearted monster!

940
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,607
It's my fault.

941
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,069
-It's my fault!
-Mom.

942
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,907
Mom.

943
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,493
Mom, I'm sorry.

944
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,038
Mom, I was wrong. I won't do that again.

945
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,166
Mom…

946
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,505
But I really don't remember, Mom.

947
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:49,721
Am I a bad person, Mom?

948
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,974
Is that why I was punished?

949
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,144
Was this a punishment from above

950
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,064
and not a chance?

951
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,984
No.

952
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,070
No.

953
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,030
No.

954
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,199
Mom.

955
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,203
Mom, I'm sorry.

956
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,829
No.

957
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,332
No.

958
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:28,927
All done.

959
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,137
Come over here.

960
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,264
It stinks.

961
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,810
You're right.

962
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:41,272
That's why you hated this place so much.

963
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:45,485
And I also didn't want to bring you

964
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,779
to such a smelly, dirty place.

965
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,533
But…

966
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:56,871
there's something
I really want to show you now.

967
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:10,301
There are two animals
that are useful from their head to toe.

968
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,345
Do you know what they are?

969
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,431
Humans…

970
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,767
and pigs.

971
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:23,523
Everyone thinks pigs are dirty and smelly,

972
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,024
but that's not the case.

973
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:29,112
They not only
do their business in one place,

974
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,822
but they also only sleep where it's clean.

975
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,868
They bathe often in mud to cool themselves

976
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,828
and get rid of bugs.

977
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,539
But humans

978
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:43,251
started to lock them up in tiny pigsties.

979
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,840
The pigs couldn't bathe in mud anymore,

980
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:52,260
so they began to rub their bodies
on their own excrement.

981
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,973
That's how they grew dirtier
and more aggressive.

982
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,394
Isn't that so sad?

983
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,605
It is.

984
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,900
However, what's really sad is this.

985
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,903
Pigs are unable to lift their heads,

986
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,614
so they live their entire life
staring at the ground.

987
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:18,203
There is only one way for a pig
to look up at the sky.

988
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,623
It's…

989
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,875
to fall down.

990
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,003
Fall down?

991
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:27,921
Yes.

992
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,255
That's right.

993
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,841
Falling down

994
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,303
is a way for you to see another world,
a world you have never seen before,

995
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,972
both for pigs

996
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,183
and people.

997
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,987
We have fallen over right now.

998
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,823
Both Mom and you, Kang-ho.

999
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,118
That's how we got to see this new world.

1000
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,540
A world we've never seen
and we couldn't see before.

1001
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,709
A precious world

1002
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,754
that we were meant to see.

1003
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,675
A precious world.

1004
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,400
I'm sorry.

1005
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,861
-Hello?
-Hey!

1006
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:35,863
Where are you?

1007
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,824
When will you pay me back…

1008
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,828
I'm sorry. Goodness.

1009
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,790
Is this it?

1010
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,875
-I'm sure of it.
-It's here.

1011
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,087
Excuse me.

1012
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,047
Lee Mi-joo is here, right? Where is she?

1013
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,800
-Where's Lee Mi-joo?
-What are you doing?

1014
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:56,884
Are you the owner?

1015
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,596
-Yes. What's the matter?
-Where's Lee Mi-joo?

1016
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,598
That bitch ran off
with our membership fees.

1017
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,892
And that bitch Baek Sun-young
took two million won from me!

1018
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,020
She's not here, so please leave.

1019
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,646
-Leave.
-Call the police!

1020
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,189
-Look around!
-Okay.

1021
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,608
-Stop this.
-I'm not leaving!

1022
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,900
-Start looking!
-Stop it!

1023
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,319
-Stop it!
-Move aside!

1024
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,820
-Move!
-Hey!

1025
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,530
There she is.

1026
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,740
It's her.

1027
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,450
Please give me some more time.

1028
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,994
I'll pay you back soon.

1029
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,707
So Mi-joo, are you drinking soju?

1030
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,209
It's too early to be drinking.

1031
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,045
You must not know.

1032
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,131
Soju tastes best after you get fired.

1033
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,549
Right.

1034
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,926
I got fired again.

1035
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,638
I got fired because I was too old.

1036
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,848
I got fired because of my bad credit.

1037
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,100
I got fired because of my creditors.

1038
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,400
Should I just go back to my kids
and start farming?

1039
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,943
Do you think farming's a joke?

1040
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,529
Do you know how hard it is?

1041
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,574
Do you know what the adequate distance
between rice plants is?

1042
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,785
When do you spray sterilizers,

1043
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,953
pesticides, and nutrients for peppers?

1044
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,247
Why don't you

1045
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,083
just go to the US with me?

1046
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,503
Let's go find Sun-young

1047
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:16,255
and that asshole who abandoned you
and left for the US.

1048
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:20,385
You should find him and get alimony.

1049
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,636
What do you say?

1050
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,888
Do you think we can get a visa?

1051
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:28,393
I have bad credit,
and you're an ex-convict.

1052
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,894
You're smart.

1053
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,485
How are you?
How's working on a fishing vessel?

1054
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,195
Where are you?

1055
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,447
Me?

1056
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:46,494
I'm, well, somewhere in the Pacific.

1057
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,039
Goodness, look at the dolphins jumping.

1058
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,421
Can you hear the dolphins?

1059
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,672
Yes.

1060
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:00,341
You're far away,
but you have great reception.

1061
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,719
It's because my heart
is always by your side.

1062
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:10,435
Anyway, I'm glad
you got your act together.

1063
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,311
Do you know why I did that?

1064
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,230
Just hang in there.

1065
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,732
I'll earn a lot of money

1066
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,151
and pay off all of your debt.

1067
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,738
But until then,

1068
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,907
please remain the Lee Mi-joo
I've always known.

1069
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,536
The Mi-joo who never loses to anybody,

1070
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,372
whether it be to a boy,
your dad, or your sisters.

1071
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,752
Thanks, Sam-sik.

1072
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,712
Take care.

1073
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:38,880
Okay.

1074
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,715
I'll call you again.

1075
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:41,883
Bye.

1076
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,845
FISHING UNION
COMMUNAL WORKSHOP

1077
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,223
Let me know if you need anything.

1078
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,933
-Hurry.
-I need beer.

1079
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,560
Sure, coming.

1080
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,104
Two large beers.

1081
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,607
-A pack of cigarettes.
-Cigarettes.

1082
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,152
Blow.

1083
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,821
How gross.

1084
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:04,906
Mom.

1085
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,078
Mom.

1086
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,538
Mom.

1087
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,169
I'm going to go feed the pigs.

1088
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,671
Have some snacks and watch TV, okay?

1089
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,382
And if anything happens…

1090
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,301
"Remember to call, okay?"

1091
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,094
Yes.

1092
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,596
I'll be quick.

1093
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,991
She didn't say I couldn't go out.

1094
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,286
Right?

1095
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,421
What do you mean, plagiarized?

1096
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:06,467
Similar lyrics isn't plagiarism.

1097
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,135
Hey, look.

1098
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,638
What Na Hoon-a's mother loved
was ripe persimmon,

1099
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:13,850
but what my mother loved
was firm persimmon.

1100
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,017
Listen to this.

1101
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,229
Gingers grow

1102
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,107
Na Hoon-a sang about thinking,
but I'm singing about ginger.

1103
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,318
When firm persimmons grow

1104
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,403
Hello?

1105
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:27,446
Damn it!

1106
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,498
What is that?

1107
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,419
Hey.

1108
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,462
Who are you?

1109
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,257
Hello. I'm Choi Kang-ho.

1110
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,217
What is Choi Kang-ho doing here?

1111
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,469
Right, well…

1112
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,889
I'm looking for Ye-jin's bouncy ball.

1113
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,515
Have you seen it?

1114
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:55,433
It's pink…

1115
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,020
and it's this big.

1116
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,355
This is so ridiculous.

1117
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:04,233
This is intrusion upon habitation.

1118
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,069
Leave before I report you!

1119
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,780
"Criminal Act, Article 319,
Intrusion upon Habitation."

1120
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,658
"A person who intrudes upon
one’s residence, guarded building,

1121
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,077
structure, ship, or occupied room,
shall be punished

1122
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,122
for up to three years
or by a fine under five million won."

1123
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,127
But what is an intrusion upon habitation?

1124
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,050
You're just a village idiot, aren't you?

1125
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:30,217
Get out of here!

1126
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:39,018
Goodbye, then!

1127
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,815
But you know,

1128
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,817
I'm not an idiot.

1129
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,320
I just returned to my childhood.

1130
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,365
This is a chance given from above.

1131
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,158
I'll also give you a chance.

1132
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,077
You get three seconds

1133
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:57,995
to get lost!

1134
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,622
One.

1135
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:01,666
Two.

1136
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,002
Wait, darn it.

1137
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,797
Three! I challenge you to a duel!

1138
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,177
Where did he…

1139
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,596
Did he fall?

1140
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,561
Hi, Kang-ho.

1141
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:24,647
Are you looking for something?

1142
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,169
Kang-ho!

1143
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,531
Kang-ho!

1144
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:58,908
Kang-ho!

1145
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:32,858
I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.

1146
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,222
Choi Kang-ho!

1147
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,665
I'm dead.

1148
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:41,886
Found it.

1149
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,681
I found it!

1150
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:51,020
Ye-jin, Seo-jin! I found it!

1151
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,146
I found it!

1152
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,326
One, two, three.

1153
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:07,786
I found it.

1154
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,082
I can do it. I can take it down.

1155
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,095
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

1156
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,398
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

1157
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,736
Ye-jin! Seo-jin!

1158
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,159
Who is it?

1159
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:15,312
THE GOOD BAD MOTHER

1160
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,037
Someone I don't know.

1161
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,540
But it hurts right here.

1162
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,624
And it's something…

1163
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,876
you need to do on your own.

1164
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:42,131
If you ever get in my way,

1165
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,590
I will not condone it.

1166
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,593
I rotted in prison for months
because of you!

1167
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,430
Violation of Article 49, Paragraph 1,
Item 10 of the Road Traffic Act.

1168
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,099
-He was never my friend.
-Mi-joo?

1169
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:55,019
Mi-joo.

1170
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:56,186
Do you remember her?

1171
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,856
Seeing how you came back
with all your stuff,

1172
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:01,400
it looks like you've come to stay.

1173
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,695
I know it wasn't easy for you to come.
Let's live together.

1174
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:05,654
Don't call him.

1175
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,699
Don't ever meet him
or play with him again.

1176
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:14,538
