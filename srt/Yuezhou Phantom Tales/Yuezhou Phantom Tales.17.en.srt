1
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,320
Miss

2
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,439
Miss

3
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,439
Please have mercy

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,759
Give me something to eat

5
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,880
Here

6
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,240
Thank you, Miss

7
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,520
Thank you, Miss

8
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,159
A Xian told me

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,960
Liu Zhaodi often goes to a temple in Shangshan Lane

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,599
So one night

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,439
I followed her

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,319
Children

13
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,319
I brought you something tasty

14
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,519
That's great

15
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,599
Come

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,640
It smells so good

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,879
Go ahead and take some to eat

18
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:17,879
Okay

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,640
Okay

20
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,519
Old Yu

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,959
This is for you.

22
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,400
No, no, no.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,640
Old Yu

24
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,840
Since I became the top courtesan,

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,280
it's been easier to save money.

26
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:37,439
This

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,760
you should keep for the children to buy some treats.

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,000
By the way,

29
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,680
last time,

30
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,680
I asked you to look into the constable who joined Yuezhou Prefecture.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,480
Si Wen

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,120
This time,

33
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,359
I'd like to ask you to deliver this letter to him.

34
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,599
Si Wen, the one you asked me to look into,

35
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,000
I've found out about him.

36
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,840
He's now an official in Yuezhou Prefecture.

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,599
There's someone named Zheng Yuenü by his side.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,799
She's from the Ministry of Justice,

39
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,760
the daughter of Lord Zheng.

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,159
She follows him every day.

41
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,080
It's only been half a year,

42
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,960
and he's already entered Yuezhou Prefecture.

43
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,680
That's great.

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
The Lantern Festival is in a few days.

45
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,960
I want to ask him out for a walk.

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,879
A thief?

47
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,360
Give me that letter.

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,199
The letter

49
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,719
has already been taken

50
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
away by a friend.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,879
Why?

52
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,000
Without me?

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,159
She's just a lowly prostitute.

54
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,439
Just a lowly government courtesan.

55
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,240
Wasn't I good enough to her?

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,120
What more does she want?

57
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,000
It's nothing.

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,120
Just bury it.

59
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,199
Bad guy

60
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,439
Run!

61
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,759
Run!

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,680
Kids,

63
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,720
come out.

64
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,920
I'm not a bad person.

65
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,720
You're a bad person.

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,519
He's a bad person.

67
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,199
We mustn't believe what he says.

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Open the door.

69
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,319
I'm scared.

70
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,040
Don't be afraid.

71
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,879
Don't be afraid.

72
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,199
So,

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,000
I set a fire.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,879
I burned down the house.

75
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,879
These children have suffered too much.

76
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,360
Their suffering is meaningless.

77
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,360
It was me.

78
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I was the one who ended their pain.

79
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,199
You hurt Zhaodi.

80
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,480
You harmed children.

81
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,959
You're nothing short of a demon.

82
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,720
You're insane.

83
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm a great general.

84
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,920
Aren't you afraid of death?

85
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,199
The poison has already seeped into your lungs.

86
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,399
You'd better take care of yourself.

87
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,079
Wait.

88
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,600
General Zhao said he stabbed

89
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,040
Liu Zhaodi's collarbone with a dagger.

90
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,040
But during the examination of the remains,

91
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,000
no marks were found on her collarbone.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,879
The skeleton was intact.

93
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,519
There were no internal injuries.

94
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,240
The skeleton was intact.

95
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,879
There were no internal injuries.

96
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,720
That body wasn't Liu Zhaodi.

97
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Then who was it?

98
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,439
The foot measured six inches and nine tenths.

99
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,600
That body had bound feet.

100
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,879
The foot measured six inches and nine tenths.

101
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,600
And Zhao Tianming said Axian had bound feet.

102
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,439
General!

103
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,120
Catch him!

104
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,560
Catch him!

105
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Yes!

106
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,600
Military doctor

107
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,519
Military doctor

108
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,120
Hurry

109
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,279
Help me stop the bleeding

110
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,079
Why do we always see hallucinations?

111
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,959
It's dawn

112
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,519
I've finally survived these seven days

113
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,879
It shows that superstition

114
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,279
can't be trusted

115
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,079
Deputy Magistrate Si

116
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,639
Why are you here?

117
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,360
Zhaodi

118
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,519
It's been a while, hope you've been well

119
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,159
Now you look like a proper deputy magistrate

120
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,879
Ready to solve the case

121
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,759
You killed Axian

122
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,120
Old Tang changed your face

123
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,519
Is that so?

124
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,039
Since we parted at the Lantern Festival

125
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,480
It's been eight whole years

126
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,360
Time really flies

127
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,240
So

128
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,000
Little shaman

129
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Xu Tian

130
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,519
Yuwen Xian

131
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,879
Who are they really?

132
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,919
Come have some tea

133
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
And I'll tell you

134
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,879
The night Zhao Tianming followed you

135
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
Luckily, I noticed it later

136
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,559
Miss

137
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,000
Let me remind you

138
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,000
When you passed by here just now

139
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,919
someone

140
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,159
was following you

141
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,519
In the end

142
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I found them in the cabin behind the mountain

143
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,039
But at that time

144
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,759
the cabin was engulfed in flames

145
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,960
I am Liu Zhaodi

146
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,639
Xiao Wu

147
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,000
Xiao Xu

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,600
Xiao Xian

149
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,679
You must protect them

150
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,519
Stay away from the door

151
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,679
Cover your mouth and nose

152
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,879
But little Fan has died.

153
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,720
And Uncle Yu as well.

154
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,639
You all must live well.

155
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,919
Don't think about avenging them.

156
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,679
Alright?

157
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,279
Children,

158
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm going to take you somewhere.

159
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,240
It's Shanyin County.

160
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,559
A paradise away from the world.

161
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,240
You'll stay there for now.

162
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,039
Okay?

163
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,639
Sister Zhaodi,

164
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,000
Are you coming with us?

165
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,000
If I go, I might expose you.

166
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,399
I'll hide in Chengxi District for a while.

167
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,480
I'll visit you often.

168
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,720
Alright?

169
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,799
That's enough.

170
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,559
Don't cry anymore.

171
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,120
No more tears.

172
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
The Lantern Festival is in a few days.

173
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,440
I've also made plans with a friend.
