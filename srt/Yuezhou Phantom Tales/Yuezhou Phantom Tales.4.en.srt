1
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,280
Remember this.

2
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,320
Not a single character of the scripture on your body can be erased.

3
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,200
Master.

4
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,319
Master, wake up.

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,840
He's dead.

6
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,599
Amitabha.

7
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,280
Master, wake up! Master!

8
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:35,239
What kind of method was used to kill him?

9
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,439
Could there really be ghosts or spirits in this world?

10
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,200
Because a new murder has occurred,

11
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,719
last night I sent a message by carrier pigeon overnight

12
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,519
back to Yuezhou Prefecture.

13
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,439
I reported the situation in Shanyin County.

14
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,439
This is the reply I received this morning.

15
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,439
I was in a hurry to get here just now.

16
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,519
I didn't have time to give it to you.

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm taking you back to claim the body.

18
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,319
You don't need to worry about anything else.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Lord Pei said

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,759
that yesterday, the prefecture

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,759
found the Daoist priest Feng who exorcised evil for Yuwen Xian.

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,080
He is the same priest who, when Liu Zhaodi was seven,

23
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,680
tricked Liu Qingsong into burying his daughter alive.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,360
It seems that Priest Feng's death was not an accident either.

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,360
This matter is getting stranger and stranger.

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,560
What was that sound?

27
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,639
What's wrong?

28
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,960
Listen.

29
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,280
Why?

30
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,840
Why do crows appear every time?

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,960
Why does something strange happen

32
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,919
every time a crow caws?

33
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,240
Could it be...

34
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,840
He's here.

35
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,080
Who's here?

36
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,719
Sir Si

37
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,639
What's going on?

38
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,919
Sir Si, help!

39
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,280
Help!

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
It's karma!

41
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,439
There are no ghosts or gods in this world.

42
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,759
Are you okay?

43
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,159
Hurry!

44
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,560
That was too dangerous.

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,120
When I get back, I'm telling Lord Pei.

46
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,439
I'm never going out on fieldwork again.

47
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,719
Stop talking and help!

48
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,199
Slow down.

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,919
As long as you're okay.

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,599
What are you looking at?

51
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
That's not far from Doctor Tang's place.

52
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,439
Doctor Tang

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,639
Was it many years ago

54
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,720
when I asked Zhaodi

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,399
to get a prescription from Doctor Tang for me?

56
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,199
Let's go take a look.

57
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,639
Let's go.

58
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,279
Go.

59
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,959
Is anyone here?

60
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,279
Someone still lives here.

61
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,120
You know, Doctor Tang

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,000
was already in his seventies or eighties over ten years ago.

63
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,120
He must be nearly a hundred by now.

64
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,959
I should ask him for his secret to longevity.

65
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,279
Why are you called Zhaodi?

66
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,120
It means my family wanted to have a younger brother.

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,439
Sir Si

68
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,079
Come over here, quick!

69
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,759
Old Tang has already passed away.

70
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,759
Who could be living here now?

71
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,040
The owner isn't home.

72
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
We're touching other people's things without permission.

73
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,759
Isn't that bad?

74
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,959
It's fine to just have a little water if we're thirsty.

75
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,439
At worst, we can come back and pay him.

76
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,759
Old Tang had a strange personality.

77
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,959
He never cared about money when he was alive.

78
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,959
Sir Si

79
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,040
Do you know this person?

80
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,360
Yes, I do.

81
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,879
Zhaodi and I have been here before.

82
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,920
The flowers were in full bloom then.

83
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,319
Siwen

84
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,240
Tomorrow

85
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,600
is my birthday.

86
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,800
How about you spend it with me?

87
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,839
Okay.

88
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:57,600
I've never felt this way before.

89
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:58,839
Excuse me.

90
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,639
Excuse me.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Excuse me.

92
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,000
Siwen

93
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,199
I'm here.

94
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,399
Slow down.

95
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,959
Zhaodi, give me your hand.

96
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,800
Why did you come so early?

97
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,519
I wanted to see you sooner.

98
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
You really are something.

99
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,399
You're a flirt.

100
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,360
I'm not.

101
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,639
How could I be?

102
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,040
Excuse me.

103
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,000
Be careful.

104
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:45,800
We

105
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,199
Let's go watch the opera first.

106
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,399
Otherwise, there won't be any seats left.

107
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,240
Yeah.

108
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
Your parents won't blame you for coming out so late, will they?

109
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,279
My maid Xiaoju told them I was already asleep.

110
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,800
Why is there still an opera going on?

111
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,079
You don't know about this, do you?

112
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,720
In our Shanyin County,

113
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
Old Wang's family had a son.

114
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,360
That's having a child late in life, right?

115
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,360
They were so happy, they invited the opera troupe next door.

116
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,920
They'll perform for three days straight.

117
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,240
There's such a tradition?

118
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
When I was born,

119
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,040
they say there wasn't even a single red egg.

120
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,480
Seems so.

121
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,079
Because it was a daughter.

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
The family was too embarrassed to talk about it.

123
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,960
This mindset

124
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,360
is really ignorant.

125
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,159
Oh, right.

126
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,679
Look what I brought.

127
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,519
Yellow wine.

128
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,799
Twenty-year-old yellow wine.

129
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,879
Where did you get the money?

130
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,559
I traded two wolf-hair brushes for it.

131
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,960
Just for your brush?

132
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,080
Your two wolf-hair brushes.

133
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,159
Cheers.

134
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:02,840
Drink.

135
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,000
Keep your voice down.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
You really don't know how to keep your voice down.

137
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,480
Stop.

138
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,879
You secretly meet with strange men.

139
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,279
You ruin the reputation of the Liu family.

140
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,440
Your father doesn't have time to discipline you.

141
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,799
As your mother, I must take charge.

142
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,799
Letting me marry early

143
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,639
isn't that a good thing?

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,320
Since when does the Liu family let you decide for yourself?

145
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,799
You are a member of the Liu family.

146
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,000
Who you marry

147
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,440
is up to the Liu family.

148
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,519
So I'm just the Liu family's property?

149
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,799
You still dare to talk back.

150
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,799
Is this how you raised your daughter?

151
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,399
Even the concubines raise their daughters better than you.

152
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,519
You're still being stubborn.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,960
Keep hitting her.

154
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,960
Zhaodi.

155
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,960
Zhaodi, hurry and make a vow.

156
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Say you won't see that man again.

157
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,720
Otherwise, your father won't let you off.

158
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,639
I won't.

159
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,559
Lift your head.

160
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
Just scare her a little.

161
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,519
Are you really going to beat her to death?

162
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Since you can't teach her,

163
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,639
then get out of my way.

164
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,440
Raise your head.

165
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,279
Beat me to death.

166
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,039
I'll beat you to death.

167
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,279
Zhaodi.

168
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,600
Disobedient thing.

169
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,799
I'll beat you to death.

170
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,200
Zhaodi.

171
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,320
Zhaodi.

172
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,000
What happened to your face?

173
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,080
You shouldn't have come.

174
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,480
You should hurry back.

175
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,679
I came to give you a birthday present.

176
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,120
I didn't have a chance to give it to you last time.

177
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,279
Your birthday present.

178
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,559
I'll go talk to your parents.

179
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,799
I don't believe they won't listen to reason.

180
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,679
It's no use.

181
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,480
Unless you take me away.

182
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,679
Take you away?

183
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,240
If they report it to the authorities,

184
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,919
I'll be guilty of a serious crime like abduction.

185
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,240
I'd have to be on the run for the rest of my life.

186
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,480
I was just joking earlier.

187
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,840
You still have to take the autumn exam for your official title.

188
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,960
Just kidding.

189
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,360
Later on,

190
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,919
I went to Yuezhou City to take the autumn exam.

191
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,960
I just wanted to earn a minor official position.

192
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,559
Then I would go back to find her.

193
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Who are you people?

194
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,440
Miss,

195
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,120
our carriage broke down nearby.

196
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,799
He also knows the previous owner, Doctor Tang.

197
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,120
So...

198
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Hello.

199
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,279
My name is Axian.

200
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,279
Please, have a seat.

201
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,320
Miss Axian

202
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,759
I am Lu Wenzhao, the clerk of the Yuezhou Governor's Office.

203
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,360
This is the Deputy Magistrate of Yuezhou.

204
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,120
Si Wen

205
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,120
This is a family member of the deceased from one of our cases.

206
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,759
Are you Liu Zhaodi's mother?

207
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,519
I've heard a bit about what happened in Yuezhou.

208
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,759
You don't need to be surprised.

209
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,600
I met Zhaodi at the Yihong Brothel.

210
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,080
We are friends.

211
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
Back then, she danced while I played the pipa.

212
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,039
No wonder.

213
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,159
I used to have a stubborn illness.

214
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,960
Zhaodi told me to come here to see Master Tang for treatment.

215
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,159
After coming here many times,

216
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,399
I ended up taking Master Tang as my teacher.

217
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,600
After my teacher passed away,

218
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,159
I stayed here.

219
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,679
I also learned some medicine preparation.

220
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Can you tell us about Zhaodi?

221
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes.

222
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,240
I don't know much about her.

223
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,799
I only met her at Yihong Brothel.

224
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,600
She was a good person.

225
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,279
That's all.

226
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,039
There was nothing special.

227
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,480
Thank you for helping us find a good horse.

228
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,960
It was no trouble.

229
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,399
I hope you solve the case soon.

230
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,279
Miss Axian

231
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,600
Until we meet again.

232
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,200
Let's go.

233
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,879
It's better if we never meet again.
