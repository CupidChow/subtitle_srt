1
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,600
On the road to the underworld

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,880
It's your fault for talking too much

3
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,240
Run!

4
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,920
Brother, run!

5
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,359
Are you okay?

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm fine

7
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,200
Hey, you

8
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,719
Don't die on me

9
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,599
Siwen

10
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,240
That's rare.

11
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,240
Miss, you still remember my name.

12
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,360
Does your wound not hurt anymore?

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
It's not fatal.

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,599
Where is this?

15
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,719
My home.

16
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,199
You must be hungry.

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,719
I prepared beef and yellow wine for you.

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,479
You want to eat, right?

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,360
Then I'll eat.

20
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,319
Beef.

21
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,439
I slept all day.

22
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,599
I'm starving.

23
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,000
Eat slowly.

24
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
What are your father and the others talking about?

25
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,159
My father.

26
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,639
Where is my father?

27
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,639
He's discussing with his colleagues from the Yue Prefecture.

28
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:28,120
How to officially recommend you to the prefecture.

29
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,280
Really?

30
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
I can enter the prefecture?

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,319
You saved me.

32
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,240
And I'm Lord Zheng's daughter.

33
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,199
You...

34
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,680
What is it?

35
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,000
You don't want to go?

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,960
I want to go.

37
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,719
Of course I want to go.

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,199
Sorry.

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
I got a little excited.

40
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,520
This...

41
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,159
This Yue Sword is my family's heirloom.

42
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,599
I want to give it to you.

43
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,040
This really is a fine sword.

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,759
But I...

45
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,399
My father said

46
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,319
it can't be given to outsiders.

47
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,000
At that time, I felt

48
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,160
I had already lost Liu Zhaodi.

49
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,959
So

50
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,199
this time, I don't want to lose Zheng Yuenü again.

51
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,879
When did it start between you two?

52
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
It's been a year.

53
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,399
Why?

54
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,360
Does the answer matter?

55
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,279
It doesn't matter.

56
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,399
Because in your heart, Siwen,

57
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,759
whether it's me,

58
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,839
Xin'er,

59
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
the girl,

60
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,199
or this family,

61
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,360
none of us are as important as that woman.

62
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,000
Siwen,

63
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,240
I once thought that even if you didn't love me,

64
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,519
I could still move you with my sincerity,

65
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,480
little by little.

66
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,600
But I realized I was wrong.

67
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,000
Since we got married,

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,079
I haven't had a single happy day.

69
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,160
Not a single day of happiness.

70
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,279
Every day, I endure loneliness,

71
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,759
endure solitude,

72
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,959
and endure jealousy.

73
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,120
But you never noticed any of it.

74
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,639
All of this is thanks to you.

75
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,360
All of this is thanks to you.

76
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,720
Yuenü,

77
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,000
Enough.

78
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,160
Let's go.

79
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,920
All of this is thanks to you.

80
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,240
Siwen.

81
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,439
Yue Nu

82
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,560
I thought we could live happily together.

83
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,920
But now I finally understand.

84
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,120
In a lifetime,

85
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,759
love is useless.

86
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,759
Even loving deeply is useless.

87
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Only mutual love matters.

88
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,720
But we spend our whole lives

89
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,160
unable to achieve mutual love.

90
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Maybe I'm about to die.

91
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,160
The only one I can't stop worrying about now is the girl.

92
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,319
Fortunately, I spoke to Prefect Pei.

93
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,160
If something really happens to me,

94
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,160
he will help take good care of her.

95
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,600
Yue Nu

96
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,680
You go first.

97
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,240
Yue Nu

98
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,480
Hurry, go!

99
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,000
Let go of me!

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,519
Yue Nu

101
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,040
Let go of me!

102
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,240
What are you doing?

103
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,240
Don't move.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,639
Behave yourself.

105
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,839
What are you doing? Let go of me!

106
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Ask this world,

107
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,879
why lovesick men and resentful women

108
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,680
rarely have a happy ending.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,319
Little girl,

110
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,279
from now on, you'll stay with me.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,199
I will raise you as my own daughter.

112
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,279
Today is the eighth day since this strange murder happened.

113
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,639
I only hope that in the future, the girl can become

114
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,800
a woman who can control her own fate.

115
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,799
I always wonder

116
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,440
what would have happened if you had taken me away when I was eighteen.

117
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,519
How would things have turned out?

118
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,159
Mr. Tang

119
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,639
Zhaodi

120
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,879
I brought you some yellow wine.

121
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,799
Great!

122
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,000
By the way, Zhaodi,

123
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,600
I'm going to make osmanthus cake for you with these flowers.

124
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,120
You should try it later.

125
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,840
Where's Siwen?

126
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,080
Siwen

127
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,960
I'm here.

128
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,120
Is your injury better?

129
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,120
I'm much better now.

130
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,320
I heard

131
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,399
you're leaving today.

132
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,679
You've been staying at Mr. Tang's for several days now.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,759
It's time to go.

134
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,120
Then take me with you.

135
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,559
I have money.

136
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,639
Take you with me?

137
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,399
I've already talked to my parents.

138
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,799
They both agreed.

139
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,519
Really?

140
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,440
Really.

141
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,799
I've never been to Yuezhou City.

142
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,720
Okay.

143
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Then let's go together.

144
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,360
Really?

145
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,279
Really.

146
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,320
That's wonderful!

147
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,919
I'm going to Yuezhou City!

148
00:09:59,279 --> 00:09:59,840
Mr. Tang

149
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,960
I'm going to Yuezhou City!

150
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,759
That's great, that's great!

151
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,799
Zhaodi, slow down!

152
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,039
This Yuezhou city is so bustling.

153
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,720
Young master,

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,320
guess what I have in my hand.

155
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,519
Flowers.

156
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,919
What do you think about me opening a shop here?

157
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:37,159
Sure, once I pass the exam.

158
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,840
I'll pay you a deposit.
