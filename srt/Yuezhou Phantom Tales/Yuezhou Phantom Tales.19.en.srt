1
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,520
That's all.

2
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,719
I understand.

3
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,359
The mark on my hand

4
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,439
means you want to kill me.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,960
Is that right?

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,120
A life for a life.

7
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,959
I should be arrested.

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,840
Leaving you the mark

9
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,959
was because I wanted you to catch me.

10
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,359
I knew you could solve the case.

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,640
Why?

12
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,480
Because I was waiting

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,239
to see you again.

14
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,280
As for those children,

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,840
they were misled by me.

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,079
They are accomplices.

17
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,719
I hope the authorities will show them leniency.

18
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,599
Don't worry.

19
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,840
Once I settle things for Huahua today,

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,480
I will turn myself in to the authorities.

21
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,319
Give it a name.

22
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,840
Call it

23
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,079
Huahua.

24
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,599
How about that?

25
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,879
Huahua.

26
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,240
Okay.

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,240
We'll call you Huahua.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,400
Siwen,

29
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,319
do you know?

30
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,879
The first half of my life was bleak and miserable.

31
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,879
It was on the verge of collapse.

32
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,000
Until you appeared in my world like a ray of light.

33
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,479
I hope

34
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,039
to spend my remaining years in peace here.

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,000
There were times

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,520
when I truly thought I was heading toward a happy ending.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,479
But later I understood

38
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,199
that love

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,199
was just a longing in my heart,

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,439
and a stubbornness I blindly held onto all my life.

41
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,759
Siwen

42
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,039
Goodbye

43
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,960
Zhaodi

44
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,000
Goodbye

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,800
Sigong

46
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,520
Thank you for your hard work

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,319
Wenzhao

48
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,039
Siwen

49
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,479
Now everyone knows you've been tainted by spirits

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,840
You'll die within seven days

51
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,560
Today is the perfect day for you to die

52
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,039
So it was you

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,360
To Yuezhou City and its people

54
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,759
You spread the rumor that I was haunted by spirits

55
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,759
Let me tell you

56
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,120
The information I know

57
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,000
The mark on the girl's chest

58
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,480
was drawn by you on purpose.

59
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,800
You've been lying all along.

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,439
Maybe it's karma.

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,959
Zheng Yuenü

62
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,519
My wife

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,199
I once deceived her.

64
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,480
I've never told anyone this secret.

65
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,240
The tavern

66
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,560
Young lady

67
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,639
The tavern is full of all sorts of people.

68
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,439
It's not a place you should go.

69
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,079
I'll go wherever I want.

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,120
It's none of your business.

71
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,279
You are Lord Zheng's daughter.

72
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,759
There are rumors at court

73
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,519
that your father will be promoted next month.

74
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,120
There are several people gambling and drinking in the tavern right now.

75
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,560
If you go in,

76
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
and something happens,

77
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,639
it won't look good if word gets to the court.

78
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,319
Go.

79
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,879
You two are just low-ranking officers.

80
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,600
To put it bluntly, you're just temporary workers.

81
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,439
You haven't even entered the prefecture and you're already bossing me around.

82
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,199
Let her go.

83
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,439
We can't stop her anyway.

84
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,319
Go ahead.

85
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,519
We'll wait for you here.

86
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,040
You think I don't dare?

87
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,079
Place your bets, place your bets!

88
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,480
Reveal, reveal, reveal!

89
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,439
Reveal!

90
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,439
Count me in!

91
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,879
Come on, place your bets!

92
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,639
Count me in!

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
Place your bets!

94
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,839
Place your bets!

95
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,079
The young lady is bold!

96
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,000
Of course I am.

97
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,720
Reveal!

98
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,879
They're all mine!

99
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,879
Keep going, keep going!

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,920
This is a robbery!

101
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,639
Put all your money on the table!

102
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,680
No one put anything in your pockets!

103
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,360
Hurry up!

104
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,439
Looking for trouble?

105
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,399
Put all the money on the table!

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,800
How dare you!

107
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,959
You dare commit a crime in Yuezhou City?

108
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,199
I didn't expect this.

109
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,040
A woman with a sword gambling in a tavern.

110
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,279
Who are you?

111
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,000
Then listen up, all of you.

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,399
I am the daughter of Lord Zheng from the Ministry of Justice.

113
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,120
I advise you to surrender now.

114
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,000
Otherwise,

115
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,959
my father will not let you off.

116
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,360
Do you know who we three brothers are?

117
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,800
We're fugitives from Yue Prefecture.

118
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,279
Big brother.

119
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,759
Kill her.

120
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,199
Teach those rotten officials a lesson.

121
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,439
Big brother.

122
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,439
Kill her.

123
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,120
On your way to the underworld,

124
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,160
blame your own loose tongue.
