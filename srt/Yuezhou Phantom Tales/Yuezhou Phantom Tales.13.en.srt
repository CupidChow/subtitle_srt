1
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,439
Don't be afraid.

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,399
I'm just here to take a look.

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,880
Are you the one living in this room now?

4
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,880
Yes.

5
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,920
Previously, this room

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,439
was occupied by someone named Liu Zhaodi.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,799
I know.

8
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,719
What else do you know?

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,760
When Sister Zhaodi left,

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,239
I hadn't arrived yet.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,040
There's a seven or eight year age gap between us.

12
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,680
So aside from her name,

13
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,319
I don't know anything else.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,159
Judging by your attire, you must be from the prefecture.

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,599
Yes.

16
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,200
Then why not ask

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,159
the owner of Yihong House?

18
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,280
He surely knows everything.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,480
All they do is speak in official jargon.

20
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,120
They won't say anything else.

21
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:31,959
Then I also

22
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,239
can't help you.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,799
Sorry to bother you.

24
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,719
Minister Zhang, Xiaoling isn't here.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,159
Don't lie to me.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,359
Xiaoling must be in the room.

27
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,879
Xiaoling.

28
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,359
I'm here.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,560
Xiaoling.

30
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,640
I watched you perform yesterday.

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
I said I'd come see you today.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,959
Why didn't you come out to greet me?

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,040
Minister Zhang.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,519
I'm just a pipa player.

35
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,480
I wouldn't dare aim so high.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,079
So I took your words as a joke.

37
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,920
Yi Hong Lou

38
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,000
They say it's modeled after Shendu.

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,039
Created by the Music and Dance Bureau.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,240
But

41
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,280
it's really no different from a brothel.

42
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,360
I'm a fourth-rank official.

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,639
If I take a liking to you,

44
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,439
it's your good fortune.

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,639
Minister Zhang, I'm begging you.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,319
Let me give you a kiss.

47
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,199
Attacking a court official

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,639
is a capital offense.

49
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,199
When he wakes up,

50
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,120
just tell him

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,639
it was the Military Governor of the Eastern Garrison

52
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,360
Zhao Tianming who attacked him.

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,759
He'll leave on his own.

54
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,719
He won't ask any questions.

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,960
Why?

56
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,639
The Ministry of War is on assignment here.

57
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,199
They wouldn't dare offend the Military Governor.

58
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,120
He won't get involved.

59
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,599
Thank you for saving me.

60
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,080
It's nothing.

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,879
You're a good person.

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,840
Staying in Zhaodi's room,

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,599
I saw many of her belongings.

64
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,520
Naturally, I learned a lot about her.

65
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,199
She was a very strong-willed woman.

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,520
I admire her a lot.

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,719
I know a bit about her situation.

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,919
What do you want to ask?

69
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,000
I want to know about her and Zhao Tianming.

70
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,000
I heard

71
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
At that time,

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,360
General Zhao would often go to see Liu Zhaodi.

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,680
He never did anything.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,479
He would just quietly watch her.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,439
General Zhao,

76
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,439
every time, he wouldn't even drink tea.

77
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,360
He would just sit there in a daze.

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,919
Isn't that boring?

79
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,800
If you feel uncomfortable,

80
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,639
just pretend I'm not here.

81
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,520
General Zhao, you must be joking.

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,400
You're sitting there, alive and well.

83
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,039
How could I pretend you don't exist?

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,159
I'm the Deputy General of the Eastern Garrison.

85
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,719
I might become the military governor in the future.

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,879
If I come here,

87
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,680
I believe

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,879
no one would dare bully you anymore.

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm just a lowly courtesan at Yihong Brothel.

90
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,360
I don't understand music.

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,639
I can't play any instruments.

92
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,920
All I know is how to act coquettishly in front of men.

93
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,160
Put on a dance.

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,639
Why bother

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,000
making the General worry about me?

96
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,279
What kind of tea is this?

97
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,959
Sparrow Tongue.

98
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,319
Yesterday, the Eastern Garrison was handling a case.

99
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,959
My best friend died.

100
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,839
He loved Sparrow Tongue tea.

101
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,319
So,

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,399
this is the taste.

103
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,240
Thank you.

104
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,879
This is medicine I got from the imperial physician in Shendu.

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,439
Drink it every day.

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,519
The poison from Wushi Powder

107
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,279
can be cured in a month or two.

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,839
Their relationship like this lasted for about a year.

109
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,959
Until one day later,

110
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,439
Alright.

111
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,480
General Zanzhuo, this way please.

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,639
This woman

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,079
What is her name?

114
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,360
Liu Zhaodi.

115
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,279
Just a dancer.

116
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,439
Have her come over.

117
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,759
Let her dance for me.

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,639
Go on.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,639
Yes.

120
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,439
Zhaodi, the general wants you to go over and dance for him.

121
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,240
Just tell him I’m feeling a bit under the weather.

122
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:20,879
Alright.

123
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,519
She says she’s feeling a bit under the weather today.

124
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,720
She’s afraid she might pass it on to the honored guest.

125
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,720
Alright.

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Is she looking down on me?

127
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,079
General Zanzhuo.

128
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,399
You are an honored guest from Tubo.

129
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,319
The governor has been waiting for you at the banquet for some time.

130
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,040
Don’t keep him waiting.

131
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,360
Let’s go.

132
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,600
This way, please.

133
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,439
Boss, two bowls of cherry juice.

134
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,240
Alright.

135
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,040
Sit down, quickly.

136
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,000
Zhaodi.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,040
The cherry juice here is especially delicious.

138
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,079
You have to try it.

139
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,240
Sir/Madam.

140
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,879
Please enjoy.

141
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,720
There are actually real cherries in this.

142
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,279
It’s delicious.

143
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,160
Thank you, Axian.

144
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,319
No need to thank me.

145
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,680
We’re good sisters.

146
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
Right now, we seem like two free people.

147
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,639
Zhaodi.

148
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,600
You really are beautiful.

149
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,159
Axian.

150
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,320
You're beautiful too.

151
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,879
Zhaodi.

152
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,000
You should be dancing for those high officials and nobles.

153
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,519
When that time comes,

154
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,960
there will surely be many princes and lords who fall in love with you.

155
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,039
They'll redeem your status for you.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Once you're of low status,

157
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,240
you can never escape others' prejudice for life.

158
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,799
Axian.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,480
I didn't mean you.

160
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,440
What I mean is,

161
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,799
your dream will definitely come true.

162
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,440
Really?

163
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,799
Of course.

164
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,720
You

165
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,720
are different.

166
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,759
I'm the best pipa player at Yihonglou.

167
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,159
I believe that one day,

168
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,159
I'll become famous all over Yuezhou.

169
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,000
When that time comes,

170
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,720
there will surely be many royals and nobles

171
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,039
lining up at my door.

172
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,840
They'll redeem my status for me.

173
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,559
By the way, Zhaodi,

174
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,799
yesterday I saw a man asking about you.

175
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,000
He seemed to be a constable.

176
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,080
I'm about to become a constable myself.

177
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,919
I could die at any time.

178
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
There's no official rank.

179
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,360
What's his name?

180
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,399
I don't know.

181
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,440
Why?

182
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,039
Do you know him?

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,320
Maybe he's an old acquaintance.

184
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,559
Or maybe

185
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,600
it's just a coincidence.

186
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,039
Wretch.

187
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
Why did you offend General Zanzhuo?

188
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,399
Master Zhu,

189
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,679
Yihong Brothel only manages musicians and dancers.

190
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,240
It never said anything about prostitutes.

191
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,600
In my opinion,

192
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,799
there’s no difference.

193
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,360
That’s truly the greatest mockery of our dynasty’s rituals and music.

194
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,399
Being stubborn

195
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,720
isn’t always a good thing.

196
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,240
What are you doing?

197
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,600
I greet you, sir.

198
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
General Zanzhuo.

199
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,240
Get out.

200
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,840
You filthy woman.

201
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,159
How dare you lie to me.

202
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,120
Filthy woman.

203
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,639
Tonight,

204
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,840
if you please me, I’ll let you live.

205
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,919
Master Zhu,

206
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,519
I’ll take my leave.

207
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,639
General, please go ahead.

208
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,279
General Zanzhuo,

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
we can talk things over.

210
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,759
Don’t block my way.

211
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Are you alright?

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,799
I’m fine.

213
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,679
Greetings, General Zhao.

214
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,039
Minister Zhu.

215
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,360
Here.

216
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,840
I come to see this woman often.

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,159
You know that.

218
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,080
General Zhao,

219
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,200
she's just a lowly woman.

220
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,679
Tonight, General Zanzhuo

221
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,360
has invited her to accompany him.

222
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,159
This is a bit tricky, so how about this—

223
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,320
Axian,

224
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,519
later, you keep General Zhao company.

225
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,399
Play your pipa for him.

226
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,879
Get lost.

227
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,480
Yes.

228
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,360
Get lost.

229
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,679
Stay away.

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,159
You might get hurt otherwise.

231
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,559
Alright.

232
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,480
Tonight, this woman is mine.

233
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,720
No one try to take her from me.

234
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,080
Then try it.

235
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,360
Zhaodi,

236
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,879
go.

237
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:21,919
Not as skilled as you.

238
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,519
Retreat.

239
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,120
Are you alright?

240
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:32,799
General Zhao,

241
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,080
I understand your feelings,

242
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,840
General.

243
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,039
But I hope you,

244
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,080
won't just treat me as a plaything.

245
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,080
Remember what I said.

246
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,480
Other men come here

247
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,320
just for fun.

248
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,240
But I, Zhao Tianming,

249
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,759
am serious about you.

250
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,240
Thank you.

251
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,759
See you another day.
