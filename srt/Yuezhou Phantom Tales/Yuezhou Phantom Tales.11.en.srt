1
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,719
Guan Yu has descended upon me.

2
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,799
Liu Zhaodi

3
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,280
I am the Martial Saint.

4
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Today, I will only kill, not save.

5
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,920
I will behead you and scatter your soul.

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,760
I'll strangle you.

7
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:37,920
Strangle you.

8
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,079
Strangle you.

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,719
Go check over there.

10
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,760
I'll look over here.

11
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,680
Su Lang

12
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,879
Mother

13
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,199
The road at night after curfew

14
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,879
is pretty creepy.

15
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,479
It feels like spirits are out

16
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,120
and the living should stay away.

17
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,599
Do you think she can really do it?

18
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,599
From what I see, you and your family

19
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,439
do seem to be haunted by spirits.

20
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,719
The little shaman is very skilled.

21
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,680
Let's meet her and see.

22
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,159
Little shaman

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,479
Are you asleep?

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,560
If you're asleep, never mind.

25
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,479
Don't say that.

26
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,840
We're already here.

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,240
Little shaman

28
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,800
Who is it?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,199
It's me.

30
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,319
Lu Wenzhao

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,319
You did a reading for my family.

32
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,120
Do you remember?

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,240
I remember you.

34
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,719
I remember him too.

35
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,960
Right here.

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,479
We've met before.

37
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,560
Yes.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,240
We've met before.

39
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,199
What are you doing?

40
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,439
What is this?

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,919
The mountain god of Ying Mountain.

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,840
I told you about it.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,719
I'm asking you,

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,840
why do you worship something like this?

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,639
Sir, calm down.

46
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,879
Calm down.

47
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,599
This god

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,159
is very effective.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,560
Besides, she's very close to Yuezhou.

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,080
Why can't we worship her?

51
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,280
That's right, sir.

52
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
In our Yuezhou,

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,800
many people worship her.

54
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,560
Write down your birth date and time.

55
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Birth date and time?

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,719
You shouldn't give that to just anyone.

57
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,319
Don't you not believe in spirits and gods?

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,319
Why do you believe in this then?

59
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,319
Of course I don't believe.

60
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,120
Then what are you afraid of?

61
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,560
Besides,

62
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,680
when dawn comes,

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,719
it will be your seventh day.

64
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,280
Ridiculous.

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,599
I really don't know

66
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,279
why I'm wasting my time here with you.

67
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,519
Why did you leave?

68
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,480
It's fake. All of it is fake.

69
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,199
Zhaodi.

70
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,920
Why did you write this letter?

71
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,240
You were already married at that time.

72
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,480
I didn't want to be entangled with you anymore.

73
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,680
You...

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
Can you marry me?

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,920
I...

76
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,680
A man...

77
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,199
Is it you?

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,839
Is it you, Zhaodi?

79
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,639
I know it's you.

80
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,079
I know you've come back.

81
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,439
Zhaodi.

82
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,319
Sir.

83
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,079
I know you've come back.

84
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,759
What's wrong with you?

85
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,560
Support him.

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Zhaodi.

87
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,920
Zhaodi.

88
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Come.

89
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,560
How is he?

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Is he feeling better?

91
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,519
Sir.

92
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,079
You scared me to death just now.

93
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,879
Luckily, this little shaman saved you.

94
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,680
What did you give me to drink?

95
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,600
It's a blessing to the spirits.

96
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,680
It's consecrated talisman water for protection.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
Thank you.

98
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
How do you feel?

99
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,120
Do you believe it now?

100
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,519
She really does have some skills.

101
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,279
Then...

102
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,839
Can you help me save my daughter?

103
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,600
Do you care a lot about your daughter?

104
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,120
Of course I care.

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,399
I'd even be willing to die for her.

106
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,519
Yes.

107
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
Overcome your fear

108
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,639
Maybe

109
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,839
there's still a glimmer of hope

110
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,319
How do you overcome fear?

111
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,600
Wherever your fear is

112
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,879
that's where you should go

113
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
Go to Ying Mountain?

114
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,000
Alright

115
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
Then I'll go to Ying Mountain tonight

116
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,879
to meet the mountain god

117
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,639
Mountain god, I've come to find you

118
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
I don't want the girl to end up like Xin'er

119
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,519
I don't want the girl to end up like Xin'er

120
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I don't want the girl to end up like Xin'er

121
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,519
I don't want the girl to end up like Xin'er

122
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,560
What does Xin'er's early death have to do with the mountain god?

123
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,920
Xin'er

124
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,399
Mother can't watch you grow up anymore

125
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Mother will take you to see the mountain god

126
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,919
Yue Nu

127
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,279
Xin'er

128
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,960
Yue Nu

129
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,039
Yue Nu

130
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,840
Xin'er

131
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,679
Xin'er

132
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,480
Could it be

133
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,559
this is Yue Nu from five years ago

134
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,759
the Yue Nu from when I was on a business trip in Chang'an

135
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,240
So that's it

136
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,159
After Xin'er died young that year

137
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,440
Yue Nu brought Xin'er's remains to Ying Mountain

138
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,320
Xin'er

139
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,639
Are you hungry?

140
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,519
Mother really wants to feed you

141
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,559
I wonder if you're cold here

142
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,399
Yue Nu

143
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,879
I shouldn't have left you five years ago

144
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,679
I didn't know you faced so much on your own

145
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,200
Xin'er

146
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,120
Why are you so cold?

147
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,879
Let me warm you up.

148
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,919
Let me make you warm.

149
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
I'm sorry, my child.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,799
Xin'er

151
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,360
Father

152
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,759
Your father gave you your name.

153
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,840
Do you like it?

154
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,639
You miss your father.

155
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,639
I miss your father too.

156
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,840
Xin'er wants to find other children to play with.

157
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,360
Alright.

158
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,480
I'll take you to find other children to play with.

159
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,480
I'll take you.

160
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,240
Yue Nu

161
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,360
I'm sorry, Yue Nu.

162
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,679
Xin'er

163
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
Mother will take you to find some children.

164
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,399
Mother will take you to find some children to play with.
