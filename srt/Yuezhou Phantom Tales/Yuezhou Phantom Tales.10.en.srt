1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,079
You came back late.

2
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,560
Will he blame you?

3
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,000
These days,

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,880
other than coming to my room to drink,

5
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,000
he hasn't come to me for anything else.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,960
Maybe he's just tired.

7
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,920
Have you ever thought about leaving him?

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,719
I have.

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,359
But where could I go?

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,280
What's wrong?

11
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,000
It's nothing.

12
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,760
I'm just a little cold.

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,359
As long as you're okay.

14
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,439
Or maybe I...

15
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,560
Don't say it.

16
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,280
We

17
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,719
all have our own fate.

18
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,599
At that time, I didn't know when she said she was cold

19
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,960
it was because of the Wushisan.

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,639
Thinking back now, I feel very guilty.

21
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,000
So it was you.

22
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,560
When Zhaodi was living in the temple,

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,479
during those few months,

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,360
she often asked about someone named Siwen.

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,039
What else do you know?

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,400
At that time,

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,319
the Su family was already on the verge of bankruptcy.

28
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,800
And Zhaodi was sold to Yihonglou by Su Heng.

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,319
At first, she swore she would never give in.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,400
But as time went on, she realized she couldn't change it.

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,479
So she began to accept this fate.

32
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,240
That's Yi Hong Lou.

33
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,599
The new maiko.

34
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,400
She's really beautiful.

35
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,520
She has a certain

36
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,879
sorrowful, captivating aura that makes people feel compassion.

37
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,000
Interesting, very interesting.

38
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,280
Miss, may I get to know you?

39
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm the top scholar of this year's imperial exam.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
I'm from the wealthy Ma family in Jiangnan.

41
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,639
My family is in Yuezhou.

42
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,159
We own over a hundred properties.

43
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,520
Maybe she has thought about dying too.

44
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,719
But I think, compared to chastity, reputation, and self-respect,

45
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,159
she chose to live.

46
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,759
Isn't that even more admirable?

47
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,479
Even though she became a maiko at Yi Hong Lou,

48
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,759
she still

49
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,280
often visits Shangshan Temple

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,120
to bring food for the children.

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,479
In her heart,

52
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,280
it seems there's always sunshine.

53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
At that time,

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,080
didn't you know about this?

55
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,879
Back then,

56
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,040
I was already an outlaw.

57
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,319
That year,

58
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,480
I went to Yangzhou with the Yuezhou authorities.

59
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,839
That trip

60
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,040
lasted nearly two years.

61
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,079
Are you trying to avoid her?

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,720
The Su family is powerful and influential.

63
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,879
I don't want to disturb her.

64
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,319
I'm afraid I'll bring her trouble.

65
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,879
What else do you know?

66
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,199
What happened to her afterwards?

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,399
Later on,

68
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,600
I heard she met a general named Zhao Tianming.

69
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,399
I don't know much about what happened between them.

70
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,839
After that, she suddenly disappeared.

71
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,199
The next time I heard about her,

72
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,839
was when you told me she had died.

73
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,160
Hope you enjoyed your meal, sir.

74
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Come again next time!

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,959
Let's have this too.

76
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,000
Gentlemen,

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
what would you like to eat?

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,839
Two bowls of noodles, please.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Alright!

80
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,600
And a fish as well.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,839
Got it!

82
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,839
Su Lang,

83
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,600
The money we got from pawning the gold

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,600
we need to spend it carefully.

85
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,879
I remember you love the grilled fish from this place the most.

86
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,000
Once we move out of the city,

87
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,920
we won't get to eat it often.

88
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,160
This Yuezhou Prefecture...

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,519
Taking a statement

90
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,439
has been repeated so many times.

91
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,879
Let's eat quickly in a bit.

92
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,920
Huan'er is still waiting for us at home.

93
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,680
Alright.

94
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,759
But I want to stroll around West Street.

95
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,079
Buy some clothes for Huan'er.

96
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,000
And get some meat.

97
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,639
I'll cook something delicious for you two.

98
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,439
Sounds good!

99
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,920
Am I tasty?

100
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,639
Is my meat delicious?

101
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,399
What's wrong with you?

102
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
When you reach the underworld,

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
I'll have a taste of your flesh too.

104
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,519
Su Lang, what's wrong with you?

105
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,120
That fish

106
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,399
is talking.

107
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,040
How could that be?

108
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,879
It's just an ordinary fish.

109
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,920
It must be Liu Zhaodi.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,519
She told the people performing at the temple fair

111
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,240
to have them help me

112
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,639
by dressing up as Guan Gong on Tian Street

113
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,040
and singing all the way to Liu Zhaodi's house.

114
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,720
Curfew at the hour of the pig.

115
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,120
Do not go outside.

116
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,879
Mother, I'm sleepy.

117
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,399
Huan'er, be good.

118
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,160
Father...

119
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,920
He's playing the God of War here.

120
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,120
There are so many crows over there.

121
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,240
Master, there are so many crows here.

122
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
Keep moving forward.

123
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,240
Don't look back.

124
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,680
They're swooping down!

125
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,120
Don't be afraid.

126
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,240
Everyone, follow me.

127
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,800
This guy is out of options now.

128
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,360
Mother, I'm scared.

129
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,000
Saint Guan is passing by.

130
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,959
No gods or ghosts shall block the way.

131
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,800
Where are the torches? Hurry, the torches!

132
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,080
Who are you?

133
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,480
State your name!

134
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,799
Official.

135
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,240
Liu Zhaodi.

136
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,080
You restless spirit!

137
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,559
I'll cut you down!

138
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Everyone, move forward.

139
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,799
Let's get out of this hellhole.

140
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,600
The crows have already been driven away by the fire.

141
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,519
They won't come back.

142
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,559
Alright, alright.

143
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,600
Where is Guan Gong?

144
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,279
Su Lang.

145
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,120
Where is he?

146
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,879
Where is my husband?

147
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,759
Where is he?

148
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,799
What is this godforsaken place?
