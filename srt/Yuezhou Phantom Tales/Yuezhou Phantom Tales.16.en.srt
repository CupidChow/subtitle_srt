1
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,359
General, General

2
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,760
If he doesn't wake up

3
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,040
your plot will succeed.

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,079
The mountain spirit has already invaded his dreams

5
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,480
and become a demon in his heart.

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,439
There is no mountain spirit.

7
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,719
It was you

8
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,239
who poisoned the ox tears.

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
As for the last time I saw hallucinations,

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,920
you saved me with talisman water.

11
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,280
That's because you soaked the talisman in the antidote.

12
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,239
So it temporarily suppressed the poison in me.

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,760
Isn't that right?

14
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,200
Here.

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,719
How do you feel?

16
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,920
Any better?

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,760
Si Shaoyin

18
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
After the poison enters a person's body,

20
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,640
you use words to manipulate them,

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,560
making them develop inner demons,

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,680
and instilling fear.

23
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,680
Isn't that so?

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,319
Si Shaoyin

25
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,719
You need evidence to make such claims.

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,879
From the very beginning,

27
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:06,599
Lu Wenzhao told me the story of Ying Mountain.

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,360
Twenty li north of Yuezhou City,

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,520
there is a mountain rarely visited by people.

30
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,240
It's called Ying Mountain.

31
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,800
It's because a year ago,

32
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,199
you deliberately got to know Lu Wenzhao

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,280
and told him this story.

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,960
As for

35
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,159
Liu Qingsong,

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,080
Su Heng,

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,280
Zhao Tianming,

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,319
it was the same with them.

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,000
So many people saw spirits and ghosts.

40
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,520
Are you saying I poisoned all of them?

41
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,080
Crows are your way of spreading poison.

42
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,639
The crows you keep

43
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,159
are covered in poisonous powder.

44
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,759
When they attack people,

45
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,960
the victims get poisoned.

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,919
You really are

47
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
quite imaginative.

48
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,360
No need to argue.

49
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,639
We'll check your "ox tears."

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,159
The crows you keep,

51
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,120
your residence,

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,199
whether they're poisoned or not,

53
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,360
will prove if I'm right.

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
It's been years since I

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,520
had to work this late at night.

56
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400
You owe me a treat later.

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,400
You must have accomplices.

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,280
After Master Feng died,

59
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,599
I went to Liu Zhaodi's room.

60
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,319
According to the testimony,

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,800
the landlord went crazy in the room

62
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,800
and even floated into the air.

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,599
That was just done with fine wire from the Western Regions.

64
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,599
Who else would put on a show

65
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,319
and pretend to be possessed?

66
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,439
It must have been Yuwen Xian himself.

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,840
You want to get rid of me.

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,800
As for Su Heng,

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,560
exorcising ghosts and driving out evil spirits

70
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,919
is even easier.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,479
Xu Tian is one of yours.

72
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,199
Old Xu was also hired by you.

73
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,120
Isn't that right?

74
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,159
You even pretended to be blind.

75
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,199
I did it all.

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,800
I confess.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,360
What was your motive?

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,759
Who put you up to this?

79
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,279
Take him back first.

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,800
Quick, wake up General Zhao.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
If anyone else dies,

82
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,199
I'm going home to farm.

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,800
Yes.

84
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,560
I will get to the bottom of this as soon as possible.

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,759
You're awake.

86
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,839
It seems Imperial Physician Zhang's antidote really works.

87
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,800
Who are you?

88
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,639
Deputy Magistrate of Yuezhou Prefecture.

89
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,439
Si Wen.

90
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,199
You've been poisoned.

91
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,439
The one who poisoned you

92
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,439
besides those crows circling above your house,

93
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,680
there's also the little shamaness from tonight.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,560
You've solved the case?

95
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,240
Almost.

96
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,360
But I need you to tell me

97
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,639
what happened when Liu Zhaodi was twenty-five

98
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,439
between you, her, and Axian.

99
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,560
Then hurry up and solve the case.

100
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,519
Why are you still asking?

101
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,439
Just go.

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,120
This antidote can only temporarily suppress the poison.

103
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,920
If the case isn't solved,

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,360
you'll still start hallucinating.

105
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,000
You'll die all the same.

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,040
Wait.

107
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,240
We're colleagues, after all.

108
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,879
I can tell you.

109
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,680
Help you solve the case.

110
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,319
But these things

111
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,879
shouldn't be spread around.

112
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,600
Go ahead.

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,839
That Liu Zhaodi was a lowly prostitute to begin with.

114
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,600
I already helped her buy her freedom.

115
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,480
But she doesn't know how to be grateful.

116
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
Lately,

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,519
why doesn't she want to see me?

118
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,439
This Yihong Brothel is quite famous in eastern Zhejiang.

119
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,519
It seems respectable on the surface.

120
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,800
But everyone in Yuezhou knows

121
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,839
they're just government prostitutes.

122
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,839
What nonsense are you talking about?

123
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
Thank you for the general's kindness.

124
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,879
You've protected me well this past year.

125
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,720
But rumors are frightening.

126
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,759
I hope the general will visit me less in the future.

127
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,959
So you've heard, haven't you?

128
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,959
A Xian gave it to me.

129
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,199
His Majesty has arranged a marriage for the general.

130
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,079
The seventh princess.

131
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,680
You two are quite a good match.

132
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,279
I've already redeemed your registration.

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,879
You're free now.

134
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,959
Come home with me.

135
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,000
Being a concubine is better than staying here.

136
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,920
The general is making decisions for women again.

137
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,120
But I'm doing well now.

138
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,399
I don't want to leave.

139
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,160
I was the one who cured you of the Five-Stone Powder poison.

140
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,360
When you were bullied,

141
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,120
I stood up for you.

142
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,600
You were a lowly courtesan.

143
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,959
And I redeemed your registration.

144
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,279
Aren't you grateful for any of this?

145
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,039
Thank you, General.

146
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,320
But I don't want to leave.

147
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,720
Please, General, leave.

148
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,039
Aren't you afraid of dying?

149
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,120
It seems the general resorts to such low tactics as well.

150
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,519
I wish the general

151
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,360
a long and happy life together.

152
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,159
What is it?

153
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,159
Want to drink?

154
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,759
I'm not in the mood.

155
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,200
I thought I would become famous at Yihong Brothel.

156
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,840
But no one ever noticed my efforts.

157
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,240
I thought someone would redeem me.

158
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
But it never happened.

159
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,240
Zhaodi always gets what I long for so easily.

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
The things I dream of.

161
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,279
It's not fair.

162
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,440
Have a drink with me.

163
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,519
Let me tell you about Zhaodi.

164
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,759
There's nothing to say.

165
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,399
Isn't it sad to be driven away like this?

166
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
I'll take it as an unintentional offense.

167
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,639
That's why you said that.

168
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,440
Right now,

169
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,159
compared to when you're with Zhaodi,

170
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,080
you seem more like a man.

171
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,320
Do you know

172
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,279
that Liu Zhaodi still has someone in her heart?

173
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,799
She often goes to a temple in Shangshan Lane.

174
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,159
She once said

175
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,480
that she can speak her true feelings there.

176
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,759
You should go and ask.

177
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,759
That wretched woman,

178
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,000
her bound feet are only six point nine inches.

179
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,080
But they're quite soft.
