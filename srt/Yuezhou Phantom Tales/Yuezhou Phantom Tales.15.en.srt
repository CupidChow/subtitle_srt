1
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,560
General

2
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,039
Maybe

3
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,000
They might not even be human

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,359
General

5
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,920
How about I go and kill them?

6
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,400
Just pretend we don't know anything

7
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,920
Look

8
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:15,879
Gave birth to seven

9
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,920
Seven children

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,760
This is just too strange

11
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:20,920
Military doctor

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,280
It's nothing

13
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,760
You go back and rest first

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,840
Once they're sent away, it'll be fine

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,799
General

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,640
General

17
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,319
Thank you, General Zhao

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,480
My wife and I

19
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,719
came down from Ying Mountain

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,560
to express our gratitude

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,680
When I get home

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,560
I'll bring you a gift

23
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,359
Thank you, General Zhao

24
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,359
I will remember this

25
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,879
Thank you, General

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,000
General Zhao

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,120
Clerk Lu

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,319
Why are you here?

29
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,719
Isn't it because I found out

30
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,039
that you have a close relationship with Liu Zhaodi?

31
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,639
I came here specifically to tell you

32
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,039
that you must be careful of the crows

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,879
and some strange happenings.

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,919
General Zhao

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,439
This is the little shaman from West City District.

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,680
Don't be fooled by her young age.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,759
She's actually very skilled.

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,639
Last time, she helped Young Master Sigong

39
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,360
escape a calamity caused by the mountain god.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,280
General Zhao

41
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,080
You're in trouble.

42
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,159
These things

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,840
are not human.

44
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,759
Wipe your eyes with ox tears

45
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,159
and you'll be able to see

46
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,560
what they really are.

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,120
General Zhao

48
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,120
May I take a look at something?

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,360
What is it?

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm sure you also know

51
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,240
Liu Zhaodi

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
about that ghostly suicide case.

53
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,319
It brought the curse of the Ying Mountain god.

54
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,719
The death of Liu Qingsong from Shanyin County,

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,159
and the death of Su Heng outside the city,

56
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,680
both had this kind of mark on their bodies.

57
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,360
So,

58
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,840
you

59
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,280
are the next one.

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,360
General

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,439
We don't know who put it here either.

62
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,000
It wasn't here when we patrolled earlier.

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,199
This...

64
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,599
This must be the "gift" they mentioned.

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,680
I am the proud General of the Eastern Garrison,

66
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,479
why would I be afraid of this?

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,479
Maybe...

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,319
the mountain spirit

69
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,879
has already arrived.

70
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,639
What can we do?

71
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,399
Did you hear?

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,839
Tonight, the Eastern Garrison is on high alert.

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,839
Is it related to the courtesan's murder?

74
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,160
I heard the investigating deputy magistrate has also been tainted by evil spirits.

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
They say he won't survive the night.

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,399
Husband

77
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,399
Yue Nu

78
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,600
Are you coming home tonight

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,879
or going to investigate the case?

80
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,879
Investigate the case.

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,040
Alright.

82
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,360
Then be careful.

83
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,879
The mark on the girl's body—

84
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,279
is it really like the rumors say,

85
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,439
that it attracts evil spirits?

86
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,720
There are no ghosts or gods in this world.

87
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,600
I will definitely figure out their methods.

88
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,480
I will solve the case tonight.

89
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,399
Don't worry.

90
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,720
Once all this is over,

91
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,839
I'll take a break,

92
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,040
and take you and the girl to Luoyang

93
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,560
to visit her grandparents.

94
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,160
I had a dream during the day today.

95
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,680
Guess what kind of dream it was.

96
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,439
What kind of dream?

97
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,519
I dreamed about when we first met.

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,279
Do you still remember?

99
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,439
I remember.

100
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,399
Back then, you were still a troublemaker.

101
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,319
It left a deep impression on me.

102
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,240
At that time...

103
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,959
Is something wrong?

104
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's talk about it at home.

105
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,639
Hurry up.

106
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,720
Okay.

107
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,319
Then come home early.

108
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,720
Okay.

109
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,560
This lousy coffin is way too short.

110
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I can't even stretch my legs.

111
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,480
Somebody, help!

112
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,720
Anyone there?

113
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,319
Where is everyone?

114
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,800
Where did they all go?

115
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,079
Sir, you're here.

116
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,879
Zhao Tianming is in trouble too.

117
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,759
That's right.

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,439
But you don't need to worry.

119
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,759
That little shaman who helped you last time is here.

120
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,000
Could it be her?

121
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,240
Stop overthinking.

122
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,920
Have a seat.

123
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,720
Sit down and have a drink.

124
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
Do you remember the yellow wine?

125
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,079
Now,

126
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,600
I like to add some brown sugar to it.

127
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,319
Drinking it this way

128
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,839
gives it a unique flavor.

129
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,079
Come, have a taste.

130
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,639
Here.

131
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,639
Wine with added sugar

132
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,759
That night, I drank the talisman-infused water given by the little priestess.

133
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,959
And I recovered.

134
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,319
There's something wrong with that talisman.

135
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
What?

136
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,720
I went to Yi Hong Lou today.

137
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,319
Before going to Yi Hong Lou,

138
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,399
I also went to the prefecture office.

139
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,639
Prefect Pei invited Imperial Physician Zhang from the capital.

140
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,000
He re-examined the crow corpses.

141
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,519
Those crows

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,039
were raised with a substance that causes confusion.

143
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,799
A poison from the Eastern lands.

144
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,600
They were raised with it.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,200
I once suspected

146
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,559
the culprit would appear at the scene of the crime.

147
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,519
That little priestess

148
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,080
is suspicious.
