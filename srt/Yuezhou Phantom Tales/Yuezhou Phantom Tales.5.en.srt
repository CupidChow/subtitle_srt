1
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,600
Daughter

2
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,320
It's your mother who has let you down.

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
The body of Liu Zhaodi's father, Liu Qingsong

4
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,520
was sent over from Shanyin County.

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,759
The cases have already been merged.

6
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,920
After Liu Zhaodi,

7
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,560
there were two more victims: Daoist Feng

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,760
and Liu Qingsong.

9
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,920
Is it possible that the mountain god really killed them?

10
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,359
There's another clue.

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,719
Liu Zhaodi

12
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:16,120
married a wealthy merchant's son years ago.

13
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,400
Su Heng

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,239
In the name of the Yuezhou Governor's Office,

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,879
contact all the prefectural offices and regional authorities.

16
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,239
Check the household registrations.

17
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,200
Find this Su Heng.

18
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,239
Yes.

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Huan'er

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,680
Come inside for dinner.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,079
Time to eat.

22
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,680
Mother

23
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,400
Let's go.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
Eat.

25
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,120
Huan'er, eat a bit more.

26
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,879
Here.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
How much rice do we have left at home?

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,319
About

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,239
enough for three or four more days.

30
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,560
Got it.

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's eat first.

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,599
Who is it?

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,360
Who is it?

34
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,439
Is this Su Heng's residence?

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,719
Why are you looking for me?

36
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,800
We’re your new neighbors.

37
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,759
We’d like to invite you to perform an opera tonight.

38
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,800
Carrying a black umbrella in broad daylight—

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Are you a ghost or something?

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,080
You just said

41
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,000
to perform at night.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,319
That’s a ghost opera.

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,919
I won’t do it.

44
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,599
To be honest with you,

45
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,520
our family just moved into this village a couple of days ago.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,840
After we moved in,

47
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,520
my son has been acting as if

48
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,039
he’s possessed by something.

49
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,319
There’s no feng shui master in the village.

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,120
But I heard

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,800
you’ve performed as Lord Guan at the temple fair.

52
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,520
We’d like you to sing a piece

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,159
to scare away the spirits.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,080
This custom has existed since the time of the former emperor.

55
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,719
Dressing as Guan Gong and performing at temple fairs to drive away evil spirits.

56
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,319
But the fee—

57
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,879
But I’m afraid of the dark.

58
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,159
How about this:

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,479
bring your son here to this courtyard,

60
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,479
and we’ll perform here.

61
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,800
Alright.

62
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,520
Let’s do it your way.

63
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,080
I’ll bring my son over after dark.

64
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,160
Husband,

65
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,360
you didn’t even say you’d be back for dinner.

66
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,120
Is there any food left?

67
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,240
Yes.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,920
Xiaocui,

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,639
go to the kitchen and bring the food.

70
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,279
Yes.

71
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,680
Eat slowly.

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,079
We still have to work on the case after eating.

73
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,079
Even so, we should eat well.

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,439
I asked Xiaocui to make a fish for you.

75
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,360
I'll go take a look.

76
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,160
Okay.

77
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,800
That gold

78
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,240
Is it real?

79
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,439
I used to deal with gold a lot.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,160
I wouldn't mistake it.

81
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,480
Su Lang

82
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,480
Every time you put on that costume,

83
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,680
I always remember the day I was harassed by those thugs.

84
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,480
You happened to be passing by, dressed as Guan Gong for the temple fair.

85
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,240
And you chased them away.

86
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,079
That day, I didn't mean anything by it.

87
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,120
But I always feel

88
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,800
that Lord Guan was watching over me on purpose.

89
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,120
What was that sound?

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Go take a look.

91
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,120
What is it?

92
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,560
A crow.

93
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,680
It flew into the window and died.

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
How unlucky.

95
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,519
Just throw it away.

96
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,319
Get lost.

97
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,000
Su Lang

98
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,720
Go tell Third and Fourth Brother

99
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,480
to perform the opera about Impermanence in the courtyard.

100
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,399
Alright.

101
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,360
Wait.

102
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,319
About the gold,

103
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,519
don't tell them yet.

104
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,439
If they ask,

105
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,120
just say each gets fifty coins.

106
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,920
Okay.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
According to what the registrar indicated,

108
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
Su Heng should be just ahead.

109
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,879
Let's go ahead and see if there are any houses.

110
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,839
Yes.

111
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,560
I didn't expect this.

112
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,360
The Su family, once a household of merchants,

113
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
has actually fallen to living in such a rundown place.

114
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,279
Thirty years on the east bank,

115
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,279
thirty years on the west bank.

116
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,480
That's how life goes.

117
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,600
Sir Si,

118
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,279
you and Su Heng are old rivals, aren't you?

119
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,240
You won't get into a fight later, will you?

120
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,839
Maybe I'll deal with you first.

121
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,160
As long as you don't start anything, I'm relieved.

122
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,120
There's a house up ahead with people living in it.

123
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,279
Let's go.

124
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,840
Third and Fourth Brother,

125
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,200
Sister Huang,

126
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,679
What brings you here?

127
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,320
Third Brother, call Fourth Brother too.

128
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,919
Come to my house in half an hour.

129
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,720
Sing the song of the Martial Sage.

130
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,000
Fifty coins per person, is that alright?

131
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,399
Alright, we'll get ready right away.

132
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,279
Deal.

133
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,600
Huan'er,

134
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
why did you come out?

135
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,639
Your father has earned some money.

136
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,679
Now we have food to eat.

137
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,639
Come here.

138
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,799
Sirs,

139
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,759
visiting so late at night,

140
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
what brings you here?

141
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,159
We're looking for Su Heng.

142
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,360
That's me.

143
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,639
We're from the Yuezhou Governor's Office.

144
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,000
Let me ask you,

145
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,120
have there been any strange occurrences lately?

146
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,840
For example,

147
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,519
crows,

148
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,759
strange dreams,

149
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,879
or someone in a wedding dress acting oddly.

150
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,399
Su Lang,

151
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,519
Huan'er,

152
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,320
Where is Huan'er?

153
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,279
Huan'er is sleeping inside.

154
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,759
What's wrong?

155
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,120
Sirs,

156
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
That was my wife just now, please forgive her.

157
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,600
We are officials from the prefectural government.

158
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,080
What happened?

159
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,399
What's wrong with you?

160
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,559
Say something!

161
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,600
On my way back,

162
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,480
I think I saw a ghost.

163
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

164
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,879
Please forgive her, sirs.

165
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,960
My wife is a bit out of her mind.

166
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,039
No need to pay attention to her.

167
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,120
Su Heng.

168
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,120
Liu Zhaodi is dead.

169
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,279
We are here because of her murder.

170
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,080
Liu Zhaodi?

171
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I...

172
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,240
I don't know this person.

173
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,039
She was once your first wife.

174
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,960
You dare say you don't know her?

175
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,320
Sir.

176
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,039
I know her.

177
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,919
I know her.

178
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,399
I know her.

179
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,559
Sir.

180
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,480
Sir.

181
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,600
Liu Zhaodi is dead.

182
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,960
But it has nothing to do with me.

183
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
I haven't seen her in many years.

184
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,919
She married you when she was twenty.

185
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,600
You tell the rest yourself.
