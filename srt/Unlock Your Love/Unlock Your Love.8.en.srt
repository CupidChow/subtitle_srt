(Previously)
Can I toast with you?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,400
Sure.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,440
Aw, the heaven's teasing you.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,880
Did you guys make a vow somewhere?

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,040
Did you do it?

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,520
Do what?

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,467
You were crying here, feeling heartbroken,

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,308
so I told you to pray at the shrine for a lover.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,480
Love!

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,400
I knew it. I didn't ask for a lover.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,520
That's me.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,360
Why do you have photos of me?

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,760
'Cause you're my lover.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,800
We'll get through everything together.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,589
Can you not leave?

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,840
Please stay.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Auntie!

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
Love, your mom's here!

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,040
Mom!

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,400
Mom, wake up!

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
How would I live without you?!

42

Mom!

Will my mom be alright?

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,158
She'll be alright. Love, calm down.

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,160
Mom...

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,787

Do you hear me? It's me.

61
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,520
Why are there so many people in our house?

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,297
You fainted.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,676
- Get up.
- Be careful.

64
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Careful.

65
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,345
Slowly... Are you alright?

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,408
- Huh?
- It...

67
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
It doesn't hurt...

68
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,600
How is she?

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,903
She's not in danger. She just fainted.

70
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:32,760
- Maybe, not having enough rest.
- Wanna get some rest?

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,158
Thank you so much.

Thank you.

- Get up. I'll help you.

75
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,960
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

76
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't forget to bring the patient
to the hospital for a checkup.

77
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,164
- Okay. I'll send you off.
- Sure.

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,053
Here, your inhaler.

79
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:54,500
Don't rush.

80
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,646
I'm feeling better now.

81
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:01,199
I was in shock.

82
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,553
You're okay now? All good? Let me see.

83
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:05,682
I'm fine now.

84
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,253
You flared your nose again.

85
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,257
I was shocked to see you lie down there!

86
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,440
- I'm okay now.
- Who wasn't?

87
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,540
I'm better now.

88
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,880
Go wash your face.

89
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,417
- You're okay to be alone, huh?
- I am.

90
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:25,560
- Are you sure?
- Your face's a mess now.

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,753
Go wash it.

92
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,947
Alright.

93
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,830
- Have some rest, okay?
- Umm.

94
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,564
- Thank you so much.
- It's okay.

95
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,053
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

96
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,253
Are you really okay?

97
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,151
Let me check!

98
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,360
Huh?

99
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,297
I'm okay...

100
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,068
I was just asleep.

101
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,945
- Asleep?
- Umm.

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,999
I've not had much sleep. I'm stressed.

103
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,280
I'm into series...

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,560
What series?

105
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,673
Unlock Your Love! It's so cute!

106
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:06,280
I'll cut off your Wi-Fi this midnight!

107
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,728
No more series!

108
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:10,520
- Then I'll cut off our ties!
- Mom!

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,316
You're being stubborn!

110
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,903
- I'll hit you!
- Just a little.

111
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,680
Have some water.

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,295
Thank you!

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,920
Who is this beautiful lady, by the way?

114
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,920
Did I just wake up having 2 daughters?

115
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,341
Hello. I'm...

116
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,937
She's my girlfriend!

117
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,612
Pretty, huh?

118
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,320
Yes, she is.

119
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,033
Prettier than my real daughter!

120
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:35,484
Oh, Mom!

121
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:37,880
- I'm your daughter!
- Why did you keep saying that?

122
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,553
You're afraid to forget it, or what?

123
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:42,160
Well, then I should call you Wannee.

124
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,335
Oh...

125
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
Mrs. Wannee...

126
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,499
Stop it, young lady!

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,073
Stop making fun of me.

128
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:51,400
And that is my former name!

129
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,172
Hello, Mrs. Wannee!

130
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,801
Oops, sorry.

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,280
I just thought that was lovely.

132
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,753
Then you should come here often

133
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:04,701
and be my daughter.

134
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,320
I'm so sick of Love!

135
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,733
- Hey.
- Me too.

136
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,572
Thought she already is.

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,418
Not your daughter, but your daughter-in-law...

138
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,360
Well, well. Have you asked if she agrees to?

139
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,212
You've not thought for a sec!

140
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,440
She's in love with me!

141
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,480
How come?

142
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,000
You gave her a love voodoo doll?

143
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Yes,

144
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,160
she did give it to me.

145
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,428
Love!

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
I almost fell for that one!

147
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,400
I believed that!

148
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
I was just kidding!

149
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,800
Why serious?

150
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,760
So you two are seeing each other?

151
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,040
Am I right this time?

152
00:06:58,087 --> 00:06:58,760
Yes.

153
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,028
And what advice do you need from me?

154
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,833
Well...

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,589
It's about...

156
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
- About...
- About what?

157
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,383
- About...
- About...

158
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
What is it?

159
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,520
- About...
- About...

160
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,120
Then it's up to both of you!

161
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,960
- I'm leaving.
- Wait a sec, mom.

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
Sit down, please.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well...

164
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,487
We...

165
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,120
We can't just do that thing.

166
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,774
Huh?

167
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,240
We can't do that thing.

168
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,480
Can't do what?

169
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,640
And why are you whispering?

170
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,080
Mom! We can't have sex!

171
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,720
I don't know what to do now!

172
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,480
Every time we try, I get hurt.

173
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,800
Take a look,

174
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,703
I also got a wound on my leg.

175
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Why did you laugh?

176
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,240
Hold on.

177
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,760
Maybe, Rain doesn't give you consent on that.

178
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
Are you forced or anything?

179
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,320
No, I always give her full consent!

180
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,328
I've never declined any of that!

181
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,064
I'm not lying.

182
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,303
Okay, I undoubtedly believed you.

183
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,268
Mom! Don't tease her!

184
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,120
Mom, help me, please.

185
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
What can I help you with?

186
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,668
You want me to be
in your room and watch you...?

187
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,680
That's not gonna be
as romantic as in the series then!

188
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,409
- I don't want to do it.
- No, that's not it!

189
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,124
I mean...

190
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,615
I want your help

191
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,086
on how to withdraw a vow.

192
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:37,322
Shit.

193
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:38,960
My life's sh*t.

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,658
Even love's sh*t.

195
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,640
Just you watch,

196
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,480
I will never be in love again!

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thunder?

198
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
And strong wind?

199
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
That means the heaven heard my plea!

200
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,819
May those who want to be a part of my life

201
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,600
be unfitting.

202
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,840
May whatever happens to us

203
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,600
cause us to sever all the ties!

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,824
Oh, I thought you needed me as a witness!

205
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,960
- No.
- Then I think I can help.

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,413
I got you.

207
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,395
I used to be an expert in spiritual things.

208
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,663
But for the determination award,

209
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,520
I'd announce both of you!

210
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,168
Mom, that's too much!

211
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,030
Thought it was about something else.

212
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,074
What was that?

213
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,382
Ouch!

214
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,360
Why did you stop?

215
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,040
I wanna walk with my girlfriend.

216
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,494
Who's your girlfriend? Huh?

217
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,458
Oh...

218
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,456
I'll call you my future girlfriend!

219
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,430
Let's go.

220
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,960
Is it hot?

221
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Yes.

222
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
I'll hold the bag for you.

223
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,400
Hi.

224
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,640
Welcome to Tiger Jimjoom.

225
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,000
How many of you?

226
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,240
- Two.
- Alright.

227
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,880
Okay, please follow me.

228
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,130
What's wrong?

229
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,920
Why do you look so confused?

230
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,609
'Cause I'm literally confused!

231
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,200
Why are you taking me out for a meal?

232
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,169
You never leave your shop.

233
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,560
Well... I wanna make some changes.

234
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
Changes?

235
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,308
Yes.

236
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,197
I'll change to be wherever you go.

237
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Deane!

238
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,160
Is this flirting?

239
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Yes, it is.

240
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,960
- You'll fail.
- Oh?

241
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,680
I'm just confused.

242
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,240
Why are you trying to win a girl's heart
at a Thai hotpot place?

243
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,160
Well... That girl loves Isan food, doesn't she?

244
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,773
Here it is!

245
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,773
Thank you.

246
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Som tam.

247
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,800
Good?

248
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,400
It looks delicious!

249
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,430
Thank you.

250
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,811
You're welcome.

251
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,516
Wow!

252
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,322
- Here you are.
- Looks delicious!

253
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,560
How is that now?

254
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,400
You love som tam as much as you love me?

255
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,000
How come you know that?

256
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,433
Well... I'm smart!

257
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,528
I pay attention, that's all.

258
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,928
Love definitely told you this!

259
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,360
I can't deny I have some spies.

260
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,407
I caught you!

261
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Does it look good?

262
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,289
Yes.

263
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Here are your drinks.

264
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,800
- Mok Nor Mai.
- Oh!

265
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,107
Deane!

266
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,458
Why did you order this much?

267
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,305
I just ordered everything you liked!

268
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,400
Now, we got beef hotpot,

269
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,001
grilled beef,

270
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,960
som tam,

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Mok Nor Mai,

272
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,920
and grilled prawns.

273
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,404
Look at the fat! A lot, right?

274
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,922
Eh! There's a dish missing.

275
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,516
There's still another dish?

276
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,356
Yes.

277
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,200
The missing dish is me!

278
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,080
When will you stop this?

279
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,760
If you mean stop with you,

280
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,388
I already did.

281
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,440
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

282
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,120
It's grilled fish with eggplant dip.

283
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,718
- Wow!
- This is another signature dish of ours.

284
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:21,394
You eat the fish with the eggplant dip.

285
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,680
Hope you enjoy the meal.

286
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,321
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

287
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,960
Let's dig in!

288
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,320
Cheers!

289
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,240
Eat!

290
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,568
Good?

291
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,680
It's good.

292
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,600
- Is it spicy?
- It is.

293
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,840
Really?

294
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,320
What about this?

295
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,280
So delicious!

296
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,622
I'm so full that my stomach hurts!

297
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,440
I can't walk anymore!

298
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,800
Really?

299
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,744
- Umm.
- Well.

300
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,358
You want me to carry you?

301
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,640
Nah! No way!

302
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,360
Where are you going?

303
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,560
Come on!

304
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,160
Come on. I wanna carry you!

305
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,579
No way!

306
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,230
Thanks for today.

307
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,582
You're welcome!

308
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,886
I'd like to thank you for coming with me.

309
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,652
Let me take care of you, please.

310
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,280
Happy birthday, princess.

311
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,400
I have an urgent at work.

312
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,640
I left money on your desk.

313
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,600
I love you, my daughter.

314
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,320
We should leave.

315
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
I wanna go home now.

316
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,800
What's going on?

317
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,845
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

318
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
We should leave.

319
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,200
We should leave.

320
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
I wanna go home now.

321
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
What's going on?

322
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

323
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
We should leave.

324
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,354
You didn't even lock your door.

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,118
I think I need to punish this naughty girl.

326
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,031
Not even turning on lights?

327
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,480
You need to have me
with you all the time, right?

328
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,960
Pat!

329
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,120
Pat, what's wrong?

330
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,558
Pat!

331
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,512
Tell me who did this to you!

332
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,930
Pat!

333
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,280
Why didn't you say anything?

334
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,720
Tell me!

335
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,456
What's wrong? Tell me now!

336
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,280
What happened? Who did this to you?

337
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,305
Pat, please.

338
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,638
Pat!

339
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,156
Don't keep quiet like this.

340
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,880
Tell me what happened.

341
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,397
Why are you crying?

342
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,043
Your package is here.

343
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,610
- From who?
- Mr. Wuttichai.

344
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,280
Oh... Okay.

345
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,400
Happy birthday.

346
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Thank you.

347
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,523
Maybe, it should've been my birthday today.

348
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,256
Happy birthday, princess.

349
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,080
Dad can't even remember
his daughter's birthday!

350
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,767
Pat...

351
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,302
You can cry.

352
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
You have me.

353
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,830
I'll carry the pain for you.

354
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,200
You're not alone anymore.

355
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,739
Deane...

356
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,615
Huh?

357
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,805
Can you take me to a place?

358
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,018
Sure, I can.

359
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,240
Anywhere you want.

360
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,906
Just tell me.

361
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,421
Why did you ask me to take you here?

362
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,054
Tattoo me.

363
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,003
Huh?

364
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,179
It's said that excessive mental pain

365
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,685
can be transferred to the physique.

366
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Well...

367
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
If so,

368
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,729
won't you feel bad

369
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,517
seeing that tattoo?

370
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,528
Maybe, I feel good that
I've gone through that bad time.

371
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,274
You did a very good job.

372
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
You know that?

373
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,399
Don't get more pain.

374
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,712
Is this an encouragement?

375
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,604
Can I have more?

376
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,719
I need a lot of that!

377
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,635
I'm sorry

378
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,795
for leaving the bad past.

379
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,689
Can...

380
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,530
Can I take care of you?

381
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
I love you, Deane.

382
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,572
Rain!

383
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
What?

384
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,248
I miss you so much!

385
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,123
Miss who? We've been here together!

386
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,175
Just a bathroom break. I miss you.

387
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,152
Exaggerating!

388
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,803
I'm not. I really miss you.

389
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,133
You always look so lively.

390
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,145
Never known you're also clingy!

391
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,620
Who?

392
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Not me!

393
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,457
You were, this morning!

394
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,517
I just saw that side of you, seriously.

395
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,920
You always look bubbly

396
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,440
as if there's no tough thing in your life.

397
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,278
Of course, everyone has that side.

398
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,860
I think...

399
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,978
everything will pass, eventually.

400
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,277
But when it's something to do
with my beloved people...

401
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,545
I... can't let it pass easily.

402
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,588
I only have my mom.

403
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,022
If something bad happens to her,

404
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,382
I don't know how to live the rest of my life.

405
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,160
Kiddo!

406
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,840
Kiddo who?

407
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,997
I'm not a kid anymore.

408
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,541
I'm a grown person!

409
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Wanna see the proof?!

410
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
What proof?

411
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Me.

412
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
What are you doing?

413
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,257
What do you think, Rain?

414
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,198
You know it's not happening!

415
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,882
I just want to arouse you...

416
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,679
just a little bit!

417
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,580
Rain, what's wrong?

418
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:32,471
If we follow what Mom says, will it work?

419
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Definitely!

420
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,050
She's the expert!

421
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,626
Well, if...

422
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,932
If it doesn't work,
there's another way that could work!

423
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,205
I won't break up with you.

424
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,880
What if we can't really do it...

425
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,240
Then what?

426
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,160
Will you break up with me?

427
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,262
Rain!

428
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,971
I'm not with you for that thing.

429
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,320
I just want to be by your side

430
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,241
in every phase of your life,

431
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,172
whether ups or downs.

432
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,403
You can always turn around and see me.

433
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,123
This is what true love looks like!

434
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Like what?

435
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,402
Like this?

436
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,520
This?

437
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,360
Or this!?

438
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,640
Like this!

439
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,390
Rain!

440
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,658
What?

441
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,901
That was too fast.

442
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,919
Do it again. Right here!

443
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
No more!

444
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,812
If what will do tomorrow works,

445
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,480
I'll give you countless of that as you ask!

446
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,641
You said that.

447
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,020
I'd better record it.

448
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,240
Say it one more time.

449
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
No.

450
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,440
- Love.
- Huh?

451
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,560
I planned to invite Pat.

452
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,686
I'll ask her to help me dress up.

453
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,350
But she didn't pick up my call.

454
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,693
Same here.

455
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,206
I called Deane, and she didn't pick up mine.

456
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,505
Is there something odd going on?

457
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,560
It seems odd.

458
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,405
Maybe, there's lots of clients at her tattoo shop!

459
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,952
You should try texting her.

460
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,998
Alrighty!

461
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,954
- To Deane?
- Yep.

462
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,454
Deane...

463
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,160
See us at this location, 10 A.M. tomorrow.

464
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,360
Also, take Pat with you.

465
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,958
Hee-hee!

466
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,607
- I think she'll reply soon.
- Umm.

467
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,828
It's late now.

468
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,040
Should we go to bed?

469
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,220
Nah. Do it one more time.

470
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,916
Who said "I can do it"?

471
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,422
I can!

472
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,819
But with you in front of me,

473
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,014
I don't think a soul can bear it.

474
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,280
I'll go to bed now.

475
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,600
One more!

476
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,320
- No.
- One more!

477
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,000
- No.
- One more, please!

478
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,440
- Please.
- I'm so sleepy. I can't.

479
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm gonna sleep.

480
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,081
So cruel!

481
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,120
Can I just cuddle you then?

482
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
No!

483
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,257
I don't care. I'm doing it anyway.

484
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,960
You're so heavy.

485
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,360
Not at all.

486
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,624
I'm not heavy at all.

487
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,754
Sleep tight.

488
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,804
You too.

489
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,640
So naughty!

490
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,000
Hey.

491
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,960
So she was drunk-vowing that?

492
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Deane!

493
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,601
Is it really going to work?

494
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,720
Who told you that?

495
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,531
Umm?

496
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,779
Well.

497
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,240
I did.

498
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,760
We have to give God an offering.

499
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,640
If you want to withdraw a vow,

500
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,360
offer the God's favorites

501
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,226
and state your desire to withdraw it.

502
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,055
Is it really gonna work?

503
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,920
You two have to try it to find out.

504
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,343
Shall I try it right now?

505
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,680
- Oh!
- I'll hit you first.

506
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,575
You young lady!

507
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,120
I was just kidding.

508
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,408
So stunning.

509
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,088
That's my girlfriend!

510
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,720
I like her.

511
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Who? Me?

512
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,753
My daughter's girlfriend!

513
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,351
Dear God,

514
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,330
I may withdraw the vow I unconsciously did.

515
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,343
I've finally found someone I love.

516
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,776
And I've learned to love myself.

517
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,200
Please break the vow I carelessly made

518
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,170
and pave the way for both of us.

519
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,236
I assure it is true.

520
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,618
Please allow both of us to have an intercourse.

521
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,539
Sadhu!

522
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,561
I promise to love her as I love myself.

523
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,994
I got goosebumps.

524
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:32,793
Sadhu.

525
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,480
Please give them permission,

526
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,950
so they could get what their love deserves.

527
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,048
Sadhu.

528
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,520
Did you pay respect?

529
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,246
- I did.
- I did!

530
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
What are you up to?

531
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Eating.

532
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,198
And it's so yummy!

533
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,025
Eating what? I can't see anything edible.

534
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,993
I'm reading.

535
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,637
Is it fun?

536
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Yes.

537
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Rain.

538
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,160
Huh? What are you doing?

539
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,183
What do you want?

540
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,957
Should we try it out?

541
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,161
Try what?

542
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,179
Try... doing something
we've been waiting for a long long time.

543
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Everything's okay?

544
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,064
Good, Mom!

545
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,348
I'm sorry, dear.

546
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,985
As an audience, I'm excited.

547
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,720
Okay, I'm leaving!

548
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,216
My mom's always been like that.

549
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,680
Shall we continue?

550
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,321
Hold on!

551
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,859
Is something gonna fall on my head this time?

552
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,031
- Is it you, the cloth?
- Come here, kiddo.

553
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,560
Good morning.

554
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,383
- Oh!
- How was last night?

555
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Everything's good?

556
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,675
Rain, was everything alright?

557
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
If you don't feel alright, tell me.

558
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,880
I'll throw this one away for you!

559
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,240
Mom!

560
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,036
- I'm your child!
- Umm!

561
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,120
Was it okay, Rain?

562
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
Of course.

563
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,400
Umm.

564
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,861
Thank you for going through all those with me.

565
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,540
No worries! You're the only child I have.

566
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,148
You're my happiness.

567
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,981
All I want to see is your happiness, dear.

568
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,271
Give me a hug!

569
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,320
- I love you the most!
- I love you, too.

570
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,448
Thank you so much, miss.

571
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,226
You can call me Mom.

572
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
I wanted another daughter just now!

573
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,280
Rain, call her Mom.

574
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,317
But call me baby, okay?

575
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,800
Yes, Mom.

576
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,440
But I'll call you...

577
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,360
- Kiddo!
- Hey!

578
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,160
Mom, look at her!

579
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,320
- Oh.
- I agree with her.

580
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,320
Hey!

581
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,305
Are you my real mom?

582
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Poor me.

583
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,858
Come here.

584
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,640
- Oh.
- Mom!

585
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,720
Am I a third-wheel?

586
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,685
- No.
- Don't say that.

587
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Ouch!

588
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,759
Deane!

589
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,213
Deane, come and have breakfast.

590
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,009
Where has she been?

591
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:09,938
Oh!

592
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,291
She's not here.

593
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,150
Where would she go?

594
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,232
Not in the tattoo studio.

595
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,232
Deane!

596
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,120
Oh!

597
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,160
Where have you been, huh?

598
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,320
I bought lots of your favorites!

599
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,088
Umm.

600
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,680
Will you get bored staying with me every day?

601
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,985
Why did you say that?

602
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,570
How can I get bored
of visiting my beloved one daily?

603
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,600
Mm!

604
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
What a naughty girl!

605
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,920
You don't want one for your own?

606
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,385
Of course, I want one.

607
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,773
I want you all for myself.

608
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,081
What does it mean?

609
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,611
Here you go.

610
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,718
A bracelet?

611
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,611
Yes.

612
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
Are you proposing?

613
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,432
Wait up!

614
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,890
Will you be my girlfriend?

615
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,617
Huh?

616
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,461
Umm!

617
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,480
Huh?

618
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,501
Umm!

619
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,600
Oh!

620
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,062
Are they cute?

621
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,810
So cute!

622
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,593
- You like it?
- Yes, I do.

623
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:39,320
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

624
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,354
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

625
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,661
♫ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♫

626
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:58,188
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

627
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,640
Make a wish,

628
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,000
so you can blow the candles.

629
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,560
Do it.

630
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,240
- Make it quick!
- Everyone's waiting.

631
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,032
Do it.

632
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,439
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

633
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,040
Thank you all!

634
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,130
Why are you making that face?

635
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,663
You thought we forgot?

636
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,975
How could I forget you, my friend?

637
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,666
Don't be mad.

638
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,880
This is your favorite one,
chocolate Genoa cake.

639
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,840
Thank you.

640
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,223
Hope those tears are from joy.

641
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,039
Thank you, Rain.

642
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,960
Yes.

643
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,693
From now on, you'll have me, Rain, and Deane

644
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,006
by your side.

645
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,676
Though our love can't replace someone's,

646
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,473
let ours fill a part of you.

647
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,840
- Don't cry.
- You're like a crybaby.

648
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,280
Rain, thank you.

649
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,695
Most importantly, you. Thank you, Deane.

650
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,137
Let me bless you.

651
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,973
From today onwards,
you'll have me.

652
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,224
And thank you for being part of my life.

653
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
I love you.

654
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,599
I love you, too.

655
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,521
"I love you, too."

656
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,400
"I love you."

657
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,548
- What now?
- Stop that!

658
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,649
You two are in love so are we!

659
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,744
Yes!

660
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,160
- When...
- When can we have the cake?

661
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,160
We're waiting for you. Cut it!

662
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,522
- Let's have some cake!
- Come on.

663
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,003
This is mine!

664
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,240
This is mine!

665
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,393
No, it's mine!

666
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
You're mine!

667
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,960
You're mine!

668
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,724
Happy birthday.

669
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,480
Thank you.

670
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,200
I love you the most!

671
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,346
I love you, too!

672
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,597
What?

673
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,334
Are you jealous of them?

674
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,640
Nothing.

675
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,877
What a naughty kid!

676
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,520
Every disappointment leaves scars and endless pain.

677
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:48,703
Endings depend on you.
You can lock your heart and let the pain linger

678
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,120
or allow someone to break down your wall

679
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,143
and unlock your locked heart.

680
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,600
Rain.

681
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,288
I have something for you.

682
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,400
What is it?

683
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,513
Love!

684
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,897
I'll put it on for you.

685
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,371
When did you buy it without me knowing?

686
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,720
I won't tell you!

687
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,600
Is it cute?

688
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,920
Nothing is more adorable than you.

689
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Are you serious?

690
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,400
I am!

691
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,440
I mean what I mean!

692
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,895
Love, this is a picture of history.

693
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,880
To have Deane and Rain this close in the frame!

694
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,640
Don't get any closer!

695
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,880
Oh...

696
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,263
No! No!

697
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,400
Help me!

698
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,840
- What about me, Love?
- Take care of your girlfriend!

699
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,348
Don't do it!

700
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,559
Come here!

701
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,278
Everyone, I have something to say.

702
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,080
Say it.

703
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,567
Tonight, the special night
that has all of us together.

704
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,600
As it's my special day,

705
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,765
I'd like to say... Thank you so much

706
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,100
for all these times;

707
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,308
whether good or bad.

708
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,920
I love you all to the moon and back!

709
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,113
Love you!

710
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,110
Do we have to...

711
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,716
Nah.
