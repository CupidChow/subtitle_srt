1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,319
(Previously)
- We've adjusted the storyboard and... - Stop.

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:04,792
I just think we should
go with the first draft.

3
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:06,215
What a waste of time.

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,529
Rain, you need to take a break.

5
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:10,629
I'm sick of this. I'll quit.

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,779
Rain!

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:13,939
We...

8
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:17,519
I'm sorry to hear you just lost your job.

9
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:21,549
I will never be in love again!

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,859
We're closed today.

11
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:28,339
Can I be more than just a friend?

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,129
I have a job offer for you. Are you in?

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,009
A job?

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,389
What job? When can I start?

15
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:36,639
I'm sorry, Rain.

16
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,698
I'm happy to meet you again.

17
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:42,719
If love takes away our senses,

18
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,880
I'm probably running toward a typhoon

19
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:49,759
that's ready to tear everything apart.

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,100
"Unlock Your Love"
(Episode 2)

21
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,399
[B Mine, Jiratchaya Komontut as Love]

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,079
[Near, Inthira Thammajaroen as Rain]

23
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,879
[Chacha, Rita Ramnarong as Deane]

24
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,799
[Cake, Nawaporn Chansuk as Pat]

25
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:20,879
[Ging, Areeya Pholphutrakul]

26
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,639
[Mata, Pattariyakorn Luangkungwankij]

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,515
Love doesn't always need a reason.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,259
Your feelings alone are enough.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
[7 years ago]

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,796
Professor.

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,480
Miss!

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,940
Miss Waruree.

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,320
You are not allowed to do this.

34
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:38,144
And you're allowed to do this?

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,147
Why do I have to accept
something that's unfair?

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,878
What's so unfair?

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,469
My grades, performances, and scores
have always been better than Siriphorn's.

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,860
It should've been me
who got the scholarship.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,268
It's what the results say.

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,108
You should be more mature
and accept the reality.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,090
Don't just be mad and put the blame on me.

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,240
What are you doing?

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,462
- Comforting her.
- Don't!

44
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,573
- Why not?
- We're close to her, though.

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,140
That's why you shouldn't do it.

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,540
She doesn't like anyone
seeing her vulnerable.

47
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,800
Anyone would be vulnerable because of that.

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
But she doesn't like it.

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,720
No, come on.

50
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,380
We're late.

51
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,410
What are you waiting for?

52
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,880
Sit down.

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,920
Why?

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,790
Why didn't you let me do it?

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,298
Why what?

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,550
Who are you talking to?

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,106
I mean recently.

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,517
Why didn't you let me comfort her?

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,500
What's wrong with you?

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,830
Why do you care about her so much?

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,830
Tell me.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,100
Fine.

63
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Well,

64
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,638
I've seen her since high school.

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,935
And?

66
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,680
She's always had a tough time
since she was young.

67
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,240
Her parents divorced.

68
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,970
Both of them remarried
and have a new family.

69
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,640
So?

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,200
So...

71
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,770
So what?

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,000
She doesn't want me to tell this to anyone!

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,744
Come on, Pat.

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Am I just nobody?

75
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
I'm your friend.

76
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,880
Come on, buddy.

77
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,822
- Tell me.
- Jeez, fine.

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,560
She...

79
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,469
has always been left to be alone.

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,800
So, she needed to be strong
to go through those times.

81
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,983
Why wouldn't she like it
when someone comforts her?

82
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,531
I don't think she's been comforted before,

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,181
and she might find it strange.

84
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm not so sure.

85
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,360
I just know she doesn't like it.

86
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,564
Why do you ask?

87
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,356
- Huh?
- What's with you?

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,696
Why do you care about her?

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,107
Nothing. Just curious.

90
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,064
That's sus.

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,603
Are you telling me...

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,549
No way.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,075
What?

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,701
You like her?

95
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,920
No.

96
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,965
Love!

97
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,972
You like her, don't you?

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,300
Since when has a
grumpy girl been your type?

99
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,080
When I confessed my love,

100
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,320
why didn't you accept it?

101
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,644
Come on, that doesn't mean
I'll like every grumpy girl.

102
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,819
Watch your mouth, honey.

103
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,505
Why do you like her?

104
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,043
I don't know.

105
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,365
Oh, I'm sorry.

106
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,946
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,360
Are you new here?

108
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,430
Just walk straight,
turn left, and you'll see your building.

109
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,570
Okay?

110
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,360
Hey!

111
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,030
Yes?

112
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,240
Yes.

113
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,920
Head straight, turn left,
and your building will be right there.

114
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,040
Okay.

115
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,300
Calm down. Get a grip.

116
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,189
Thank you.

117
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,930
Love.

118
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,577
Hey, Love.

119
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,840
Love!!!

120
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,767
Why would you shout?

121
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
You were spacing out!

122
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,280
What were you thinking about?

123
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,510
Nothing important.

124
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,860
Why do I need to tell you?

125
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm your friend, girl.

126
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,320
Am I your friend?

127
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,893
Wow, so it's over between us?

128
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,480
Hey.

129
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,360
Anyway, why do you like her?

130
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,007
'Cause... I like her.

131
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,497
It was love at first sight.

132
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Huh? That's it?

133
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,150
Why does it have to be hard?

134
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,880
I just like her,

135
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,793
and my heart doesn't
want to be mine anymore.

136
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,920
So corny, buddy.

137
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
You're giving me a headache.

138
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,020
Stop it.

139
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
You jealous, babe?

140
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Stop it.

141
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,800
- You're jealous?
- Stop it now.

142
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,160
- Enough.
- Are you jealous of me?

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,880
I liked you because I was so lonely.

144
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,920
That's why I lost my consciousness.

145
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
My whole world was in pink.

146
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,560
- But it's over.
- Okay, Miss Pat.

147
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
Miss Pat's regained consciousness now.

148
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,040
You made the first move.

149
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,680
Just forget about it!

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,360
I had no consciousness!

151
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,640
How did I do that?

152
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,760
- Why are you doing this to me, Bas?
- What did I do?

153
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
What more do you want?

154
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,474
What? How would you explain
what I saw yesterday?

155
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
What are you talking about?

156
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,200
How dare you say that?

157
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,418
What did I do to you?

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,400
Don't be ridiculous.

159
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,080
- Leave.
- You know how much I love you.

160
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,080
Thanks. Now, leave.

161
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,760
- What was it?
- Leave, Rain.

162
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,400
- What were you guys talking about?
- Stop messing with me.

163
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,760
- Explain it to me!
- We're over. It's over.

164
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,960
It is over, okay?

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,611
- Just leave.
- Bas!

166
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
- Just go!
- Please, I'm begging you.

167
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
- Let me go!
- Please.

168
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:33,500
- Please.
- It's over. We've talked.

169
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,502
Just leave!

170
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,948
Bas! Don't leave me.

171
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,640
- Please don't leave me.
- Let me go!

172
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
- I can give you anything...
- Let go of me!

173
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,480
I'll say the truth for your sake.

174
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,160
I don't love you.

175
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,525
I was just making you do my work.

176
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,331
You're so annoying.

177
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Please.

178
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,666
Pretend you didn't see me.

179
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,783
But...

180
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,680
Please just walk past me

181
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,120
as if no one's here.

182
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,128
You look a lot stronger.

183
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,774
That version of you

184
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,705
and this very present one...

185
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,353
Have you experienced something nice yet?

186
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,740
Hey, you can't be smiling now.

187
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,357
Don't you feel guilty?

188
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,017
Rain,

189
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,393
smiling doesn't mean I don't feel bad.

190
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:13,290
It's just that... I'm
happy to meet you again.

191
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,080
Right?

192
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,595
Okay.

193
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,542
Let's talk about our project.

194
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,694
It's about promoting a tattoo shop.

195
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,240
What styles do you want,

196
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,480
as well as the mood and tone?

197
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,819
It's a minimal tattoo shop.

198
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,773
About the ads, I want something artistic.

199
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,569
As for the mood and tone...

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I haven't thought about it yet.

201
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,742
You can just ask Love.

202
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,079
She knows my style.

203
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,689
As for the photos...

204
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
She'll take care of them.

205
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,093
Choose nice ones and send them to her.

206
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,520
Right, I can take every kind of picture...

207
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,454
Have you thought about the promotion?

208
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,380
Nope.

209
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,607
Please take care of it.

210
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,326
Basically, I just want it
to bring in more customers.

211
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,830
When you're out of ideas,

212
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,109
ask her.

213
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Right.

214
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,194
If you need any more
information, let me know.

215
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,560
- I can...
- What's your budget?

216
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
- So that I can manage to use it.
- Oh.

217
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
About the budget,

218
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
it's unlimited.

219
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,467
I'll take care of it.

220
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Don't get involved.

221
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,640
It's my shop.

222
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
I can deal with it.

223
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,486
I just want to help you out.

224
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,245
I don't want any help with this.

225
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,515
Thanks,

226
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,280
but no.

227
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,440
Hey, she means well.

228
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,603
How could you talk to her like that?

229
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,960
Whoa,

230
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,087
you know how to show sympathy for others?

231
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:51,920
Hey.

232
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,720
Yeah?

233
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,440
Take it easy, guys.

234
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,040
Calm down, Deane, Rain.

235
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,405
I'm going to the toilet.

236
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm coming with you!

237
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,400
Easy, guys.

238
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,445
Mm.

239
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,202
Do you think it's cool to be so rude?

240
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,981
Huh?

241
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,770
What's rude?

242
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,683
I was just being frank.

243
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,468
Being frank and thoughtless are different.

244
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,541
Whoa, you're teaching me now.

245
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,260
Are you so good, huh?

246
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,463
Alright,

247
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,554
you may start working on it tomorrow.

248
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,308
You have one week.

249
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,447
Let's go, Love.

250
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,888
Rain, it's nice working with you and...

251
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,948
See you!

252
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,750
Let's go.

253
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,905
- Come on, Love.
- See you.

254
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,185
Get home safely.

255
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,384
Come on.

256
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,640
Pat.

257
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,058
Are you okay?

258
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,844
It's alright.

259
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,568
Fine.

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,540
It's alright, so you're shedding tears?

261
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,165
It's the dust.

262
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,006
Whatever you say.

263
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,523
Be careful who you're falling with.

264
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,970
How could you let her be so rude to you?

265
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,960
I don't know.

266
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,280
Maybe it's because I like her.

267
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,871
Giving someone everything
won't make them love you more,

268
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,930
but it makes you love yourself less.

269
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,780
You're probably right.

270
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Pat, please,

271
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,060
love someone without hurting yourself.

272
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,750
There's no love without pain.

273
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,360
I'm just willing to love them

274
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,440
even knowing the hurt that lies ahead.

275
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,697
Willing to love them

276
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,054
even knowing the hurt that lies ahead?

277
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,180
So corny, Pat.

278
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,320
"Lovelydovey"?

279
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,433
Doveyyyyyyy.

280
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,880
You little puppy,

281
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,080
I gave you some meat
'cause I knew you were hungry.

282
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,486
How can someone be so cool
even when she's in pain?

283
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,933
Making bread in a minute!

284
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,798
Life is like taking a staircase.

285
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,180
There's always another step.

286
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,933
All I can see is a building,

287
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
but there's no one here.

288
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,440
The sky's clear today,

289
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,426
but it's probably raining
in someone's heart.

290
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Every cloud has a silver lining.

291
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,760
- Please.
- It's over. We've talked.

292
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,747
Just leave!

293
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,280
Bas! Don't leave me.

294
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
- I can give you anything...
- Let go of me!

295
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,063
I'll say the truth for your sake.

296
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,556
I don't love you.

297
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,371
I was just making you do my work.

298
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,920
You're so annoying.

299
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,533
Pretend you didn't see me.

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,646
But...

301
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,461
Please just walk past me

302
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,912
as if no one's here.

303
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,160
Is it so hard to be punctual?

304
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,040
Calm down, Rain.

305
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,570
Take it easy.

306
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,720
Do I look upset?

307
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,972
Oh, no. You're so calm.

308
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,623
You look absolutely calm

309
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,871
and gorgeous.

310
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,320
Hey.

311
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,205
You need a key to open them.

312
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,184
Strength wouldn't do anything.

313
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
What took you so long?

314
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,830
Do I really have to work with her?

315
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,920
Obviously.

316
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,946
Hey.

317
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Take it easy, guys. Don't fight.

318
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,810
Or you can fight inside.
That will be better.

319
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,946
No.

320
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,413
Why not?

321
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,143
We can't open the doors.

322
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Why can't we?

323
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,680
You're the owner; you must have the key.

324
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,570
I am the owner, but I don't have it.
So, we can't open them.

325
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Stop pissing me off.

326
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,248
Please stop, guys.

327
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,929
Hi, guys. Has it been long?

328
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,180
I bought you guys some soy milk
and fried dough on my way here.

329
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
What time is it?

330
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,618
10 A.M.

331
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,470
What time did we agree to meet?

332
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
9.30.

333
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
That's right.

334
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,142
And you were stopping by to buy snacks?

335
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,081
You're causing us problems.

336
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,932
I know.

337
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,151
I'm sorry, Rain.

338
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,571
Can that bring back my time?

339
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,518
Rain, I'm sorry I'm late.

340
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,551
I will be more punctual next time.

341
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,897
Please stop being upset with me.

342
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,780
Then...

343
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,855
I promise to always bring you a smile.

344
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,196
Don't let this happen again.

345
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,964
Okay.

346
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,186
Please let me promise you.

347
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Are you good now?

348
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,070
Get in already.

349
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Please, it's getting hot.

350
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,560
Okay.

351
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,600
What kind of angle do you want?

352
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,877
Right here?

353
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,303
There?

354
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,763
Over there?

355
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,902
Or here?

356
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,521
Can you be serious for once?

357
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,514
I am serious.

358
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,270
I've always taken everyone seriously.

359
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,664
Whatever angle is fine.

360
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,810
Okay.

361
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,920
So...

362
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,213
Hey.

363
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,480
You're so pretty.

364
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,923
Go away if you're not taking it seriously.

365
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,600
I don't want you to feel stressed.

366
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,490
You'll enjoy your work

367
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,323
if you're feeling happy.

368
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,183
Do you need help?

369
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,664
- This one...
- Do me a favor and sit there.

370
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,200
You're bothering me.

371
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,574
And... stay still.

372
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,415
I won't be able to do anything, then.

373
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,358
There's so much dust in here.

374
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,290
Can you sweep the floor over there?

375
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,279
We'll have the maid do it.

376
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,000
We don't have a maid,

377
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,240
or even a customer.

378
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,856
I'll hire one.

379
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,840
Okay. I'll find one.

380
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:01,720
Hey,

381
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,600
do you think they'll make it?

382
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,364
Of course.

383
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,723
Trust me. They'll make it.

384
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,065
What can guarantee that?

385
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
I can.

386
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,960
If I fail,

387
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
all of me

388
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,328
is yours.

389
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,851
Do you always flirt with that line?

390
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,779
No, I don't usually flirt.

391
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,963
But if I really like them,

392
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,676
I'll make my move.

393
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,016
I hope you succeed, then.

394
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,465
And?

395
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,679
What?

396
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,805
Keep working.

397
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,072
I am.

398
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
It's my hobby.

399
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,760
Here come some dumplings.

400
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,480
You have no right
to make changes to my work.

401
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,600
I think this color's better.

402
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,803
What did you use to determine it?

403
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,322
My feelings.

404
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,848
Your feelings?

405
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,770
Seriously? That's your reason?

406
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,850
Art is always created from emotions.

407
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,010
If you like it, that's enough.

408
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,070
It's different when you like it

409
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,790
and when you're being headstrong.

410
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,883
If you don't need my opinions,
just do it yourself.

411
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,489
I think this color's really better.

412
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,393
Suit yourself.

413
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
I don't like it.

414
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,013
So, don't mess with my work again.

415
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,408
Well, Rain...

416
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
I'm sorry.

417
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,160
Come on, smile for me.

418
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,895
You look better with a smile.

419
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,185
Smile.

420
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Come on.

421
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,880
Do your work, Love.

422
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,418
Give me a smile.

423
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,088
Come on, here's how you smile.

424
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,858
Look.

425
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,038
Smile.

426
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,178
Smile for me.

427
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,054
Come on, smile.

428
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
What happened?

429
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,000
She hit the roof.

430
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
- This early?
- Yeah.

431
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:33,304
Whoa.

432
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,370
Should we intervene?

433
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,043
Let's leave them alone.

434
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:41,148
I'm kinda worried.

435
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:43,102
It's okay.

436
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,920
Good?

437
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,445
I prefer this one.

438
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,340
Enough!

439
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,743
- One more.
- I'm full.

440
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,643
- I'm full.
- Just pretend.

441
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,960
Pretend to eat it.

442
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,680
Come on.

443
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,062
Just pretend.

444
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,460
What makes you feel
like you need to be so harsh

445
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,910
to protect yourself?

446
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,540
What have you been through?

447
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,050
Wait, that's Rain.

448
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Give it to me.

449
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,993
Do you know anyone in this photo?

450
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,998
I know the owner.

451
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,098
Why?

452
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,006
Let's do something fun.

453
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,863
- Is it really good?
- Yes.

454
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,731
Okay.

455
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,724
Rain!

456
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,360
Hi.

457
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,864
What a coincidence!

458
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,375
Rain...

459
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,704
Is this your plan?

460
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,020
What's wrong with it?

461
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,500
How are you doing, Rain?

462
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,185
How can she be?

463
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,204
She's broke, that's all she can be.

464
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,480
That's why she's just a bill sticker.

465
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,200
Hey,

466
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,896
she designed all of these.

467
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,662
And she's not just a bill sticker.

468
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,583
Stay out of this.

469
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,894
It's hard to believe

470
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,782
that a former creative officer
is now doing such a crappy job.

471
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,065
What do you mean by a crappy job?

472
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,440
Deane, hi.

473
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,490
Why are you here, kiddo?

474
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,860
I'm here with my co-worker.

475
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,400
It's been a long time.

476
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,791
You're still so cool.

477
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Do you know her?

478
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,854
Yeah, for some time now.

479
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,120
- Are you doing great?
- Yes.

480
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,775
- You?
- I'm doing alright.

481
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,793
What?

482
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,520
Did it hurt?

483
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,388
Are we giving you a hard time?

484
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Does it seem so?

485
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,456
It seems like you are having a hard time.

486
00:30:05,496 --> 00:30:08,853
Rain, you're still such a smart mouth.

487
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,447
Anyway, just so you know.
The only thing you have left

488
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
is that smart mouth of yours!

489
00:30:14,903 --> 00:30:18,160
Your former position is now mine.

490
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,270
If you wanna return to work,

491
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,462
there are still some vacancies

492
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,655
for...

493
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,560
housekeepers!

494
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,380
You're so proud of my leftovers, huh?

495
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,800
A leftover man and a leftover job.

496
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,502
I'm happy that you
guys are so proud of that.

497
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,010
I'll just consider it charity
for some ungrateful brats.

498
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,120
You bitch!

499
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,960
- Fern!
- Pat.

500
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,420
- Yes?
- Is there a temple around here?

501
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,495
I want to make some merit.

502
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,719
Sure. I'll take you there.

503
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,920
- Stop it!
- Let me go, Arm.

504
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,400
She deserves a slap!

505
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,633
Enough! Leave!

506
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,100
Excuse me, then.

507
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,840
- Let's have a meal together later.
- Sure.

508
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,500
I'll text you.

509
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,820
I'll wait for that.

510
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,097
What?

511
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,003
Let's eat. You hungry?

512
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,937
Not anymore.

513
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,024
What?

514
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,067
You told me you were hungry.

515
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,475
I'm not anymore.

516
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,220
What's wrong with her?

517
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,527
Come on,

518
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,775
I'm hungry.

519
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,435
Ask someone else to join you.

520
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,100
I don't have to do that.

521
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,852
She's already done it.

522
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,200
[Let's have a meal together this Saturday]

523
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
I'm not letting you.

524
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,602
Why not?

525
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,903
Are you jealous?

526
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,842
Mm.

527
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
You can't just say, "Mm," to me.

528
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,795
I am jealous.

529
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,628
Can I?

530
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,960
Let's eat.

531
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,493
No.

532
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,240
You wanna eat me, then?

533
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,772
Yes.

534
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:12,273
Come on.

535
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,939
I don't want food.

536
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,000
Fine. Okay.

537
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,452
Rain, let's go.

538
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,125
- Come on.
- Please do it again.

539
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,535
Just walk past me

540
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,337
as if no one's here.

541
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,119
Come on.

542
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,240
Come with me.

543
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,249
You didn't hear me?

544
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
I did,

545
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,065
but please don't argue with me.

546
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,820
Tears don't look good on you.

547
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,303
Come on.

548
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,088
Let's eat something delicious.

549
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,560
Okay?

550
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:47,508
Come on.

551
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,230
I'm not hungry.

552
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,289
But you need to eat.

553
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,533
So that you have
energy to finish your work.

554
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,219
Okay?

555
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,807
Come with me.

556
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Let's go.

557
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,670
We're here.

558
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,810
It's my favorite place.

559
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Are you sure the food's great?

560
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,278
It's tasty.

561
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,273
It better be.

562
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,967
Thank you.

563
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,280
Thank you.

564
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,482
Here.

565
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,560
This is for you.

566
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,940
Why's that?

567
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,919
'Cause you were crying over spoiled beef.

568
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,005
You think it's funny?

569
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,115
I don't want you to feel bad.

570
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,248
You're Rain, but allow the rain
in your heart to stop sometimes.

571
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,520
What are you doing?

572
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,020
I'm protecting you from rain

573
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,353
so that you don't get soaked alone.

574
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,480
Kiddo.

575
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,247
Let's dig in.

576
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,733
This one is amazing.

577
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,930
It's very tasty.

578
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,440
Here.

579
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,650
It's fatty; I don't want to gain weight.

580
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,031
I'm craving som tam more.

581
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,470
Sure.

582
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,821
It's gonna be so flavorful.

583
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,236
Have some.

584
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,819
Is it good?

585
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,390
It's alright.

586
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,400
I never make mistakes with food.

587
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,282
Rain!

588
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,822
Some ice cream to cool you down?

589
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,739
No.

590
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,084
Please have some.

591
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,800
Come on. Just have some.

592
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,848
- Ahhh.
- I said no.

593
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,577
How bad.

594
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,183
You look so good,

595
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,869
but you're just gonna melt away.

596
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Jeez, give me.

597
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Do you wanna cry?

598
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,372
I don't want to cry over those people.

599
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,867
Rain,

600
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,480
you don't cry for someone else,

601
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,080
but you cry
to release the pain you're holding inside.

602
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,883
Tears don't signify weakness.

603
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:12,520
They simply remind you
that you're still human with emotions.

604
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,400
You can just cry.

605
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,083
I can't hear you.

606
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,940
Be as loud as you want.

607
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Just please let me be
right here by your side.

608
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:15,041
Come here.

609
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:16,178
- Huh?
- I'm doing it for you.

610
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,978
All done.

611
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,080
Rest up.

612
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,730
Warm yourself up with some blankets, too.

613
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,952
See you tomorrow.

614
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,932
Thanks a lot for today.

615
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,691
Drive home safely.

616
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,280
Text me when you arrive.

617
00:40:33,818 --> 00:40:34,664
You care about me?

618
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Hurry and leave.

619
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Bye-bye.

620
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,574
See you.

621
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,320
[I'm home, Rain]

622
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,800
[Don't forget to take
paracetamol before bed]

623
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,960
[I've put it in your bag]

624
00:41:19,502 --> 00:41:22,502
[How did you know I'd get sick?]

625
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,811
While taking your helmet off,

626
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,732
I felt the heat from your forehead.

627
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
[While taking your helmet off,
I felt the heat from your forehead]

628
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,320
Go to bed now.

629
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,009
Please don't get sick.

630
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,582
Or else, we won't get to meet tomorrow.

631
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,600
[Or else, we won't get to meet tomorrow]

632
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,211
What's with that smiley face, dear?

633
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,911
It's nothing, Mom!

634
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,150
I'm fine.

635
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,160
Liar.

636
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,280
Hey, Mom!

637
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,621
I'm your daughter!

638
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,394
My bad.

639
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,100
I almost forgot I had a daughter.

640
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,820
Come on, Mom!

641
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Mom, can you give me a hug?

642
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,160
What's wrong?
You want a hug out of the blue?

643
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,015
I love you. That's why.

644
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,120
Whoa, that's even weirder.

645
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,589
Saying you love me?

646
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,120
Are you trying to get my money?

647
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,386
Mom!

648
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,160
You always say that!

649
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,996
I think I'm in love.

650
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,119
Aw!

651
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,762
Hey, you're finally in the game?

652
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,480
Look, the doctor and her meds are ready.

653
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,120
If you're hurt, just give me a call.

654
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,240
Come on, Mom!
You're always ready, huh?

655
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,870
I didn't want to stress you out.

656
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,927
Anyway,

657
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,066
who's that?

658
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,968
Just someone...

659
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,702
who's grumpy

660
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,866
and bad-tempered,

661
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,519
but sweet.

662
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
She's sensitive,

663
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,720
but she always seems strong.

664
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,529
So you wanna give her a hug?

665
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,737
How crazy in love you are.

666
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:42,280
How warm you are.

667
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,891
Stop it, Mom!

668
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,702
You're exaggerating!

669
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,600
But she's...

670
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,355
But she's...

671
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,958
not single?

672
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,744
No, Mom!

673
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:02,375
It's just...

674
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,905
I'm scared.

675
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,873
I'm scared of disappointment

676
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,283
and sadness.

677
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,490
I don't want to make
her feel uncomfortable.

678
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,520
I'm just scared of everything.

679
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,345
And...

680
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,712
I'm scared of losing her.

681
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,241
Should I just let it be
like this and do nothing?

682
00:44:28,151 --> 00:44:32,797
Listen, love is unpredictable.

683
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,941
You're in love today,

684
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,629
but there's no guarantee
if you'll get that love in return.

685
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,583
The only thing you can do
is love her the best you can.

686
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,230
Just try your best in your own way.

687
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,021
If things don't turn out as you'd hoped,

688
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,720
you might be sad,

689
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,085
but you'll never regret
the effort you put in.

690
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,518
Got it?

691
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:03,760
- Are you a guru or something?
- Of course I am.

692
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,465
Whoa, here's your reward, ma'am.

693
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,016
Hey.

694
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,300
- Can I see her face?
- No!

695
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Not yet.

696
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,501
- Why not?
- I consider it unlucky.

697
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
Jeez, you're the unlucky one.

698
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,707
Ouch, that hurts.

699
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
Mom!

700
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,320
Should we be comedians?

701
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,911
- That sounds great.
- I think we'll nail it.

702
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,280
Can I get a hug?

703
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,089
Thank you for your advice, Mom.

704
00:45:34,605 --> 00:45:37,393
I am Cupid.

705
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,160
That's why I named you Love.

706
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,531
Hey, don't embarrass yourself.

707
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,008
You're Love.
You can't be afraid to be in love.

708
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,612
Don't ever be scared.

709
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,280
Go for it.

710
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,931
When you fall, I'll be there to take you.

711
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,160
- Okay?
- Okie.

712
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,920
Go for it.

713
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,960
- I'm going for it!
- Give me five.

714
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:57,760
Yay!

715
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,400
Give me a hug.

716
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,242
- I love you the most.
- My girl's finally gonna be in love.

717
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,229
Aw, you think so?

718
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,014
A tasty meal has helped someone
stop crying over spilled milk today.

719
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,999
Hey, will Love make it?

720
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,840
- Obviously.
- Really?

721
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,120
Obviously, she won't.

722
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,740
Look what time it is.

723
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,480
Here are some soy milk
and fried dough, Rain.

724
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,420
Love, come here.

725
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,058
Does that look good?

726
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,400
What do you think?

727
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,360
Are you okay with it?

728
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,478
I like it, though.

729
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,548
Mm.

730
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,160
I think we should add another one here.

731
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,320
Okay. Let's do that.

732
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,120
Something's off.

733
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,561
Let's go inside.

734
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,640
Okay.

735
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
Open it, owner.

736
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,440
I won't let you cry by yourself anymore.

737
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,137
(Next Episode)
So, where's the customer?

738
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,360
We got a customer!

739
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,000
- Yay!!
- Yay!!

740
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,132
I am independent

741
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,720
and not ready to be taken.

742
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,697
If you don't want to get hurt,

743
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,560
don't cross the line.

And you?

I'm into you.
