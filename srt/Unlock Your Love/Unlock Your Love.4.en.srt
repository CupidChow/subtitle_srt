00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,000
(Previously)
So, where's the customer?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,160
We got a customer!

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,800
- Yay!
- Yay!!

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,932
I am independent

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,520
and not ready to be taken.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,560
If you don't want to get hurt,

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,000
don't cross the line.

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,720
What's going on between you?

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,360
And you?

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,920
Why are you with Pat?

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,894
What do you mean?

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,386
I'm into you.

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,200
"Unlock Your Love"

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,560
[B Mine, Jiratchaya Komontut as Love]

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,240
[Near, Inthira Thammajaroen as Rain]

[Ging, Areeya Pholphutrakul]

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,800
[Mata, Pattariyakorn Luangkungwankij]

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
I don't have time to love anyone.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,640
I don't even know how to love myself.

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,200
You won't understand me.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,920
Just let me help you.

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,400
Let me love you.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,120
If you can't love yourself,

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,280
please take the love I have for you.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,720
Here's 200 baht.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,200
How could you do this, Toh?

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,240
You're so easy.

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,600
You already fell for me.

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
I thought it'd be harder.

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,320
That bitch is stupid.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,600
She's only good at studying.

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,120
But when it comes to love,
she's absolutely stupid.

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,036
Toei,

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,680
how can you be such a shithead?

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Hey, Rain.

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,200
That's too much.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,888
Of course, you're so smart
and good at everything.

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,642
That's why I look so
stupid when I'm with you.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,120
Let's go, babe.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,200
- Please.
- It's over. We've talked.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,202
Just leave!

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,588
Bas! Don't leave me.

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
- I can give you anything...
- Let go of me!

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,480
I'll say the truth for your sake.

48
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,160
I don't love you.

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,320
I was just making you do my work.

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,771
You're so annoying.

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,760
Rain.

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
Can you lend me some money this month?

53
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,569
My family hasn't given me an allowance.

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
My mom got sick,

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,185
so I gave it to her for the treatment.

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Don't worry, Rain. I'll return it to you
as soon as possible.

57
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,793
Please.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
What's this, Arm?

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,760
She's my friend.

60
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,080
Can you just stop lying to me?

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,230
I've given you everything.
Wasn't it enough?

62
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,200
Am I not enough or anything?
Just say it.

63
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,280
Rain, I'm sorry.

64
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
It's just my first time.

65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,040
First time, you said?

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,160
You're going to let it happen
for the second time?

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,000
I promise it's not gonna happen again.

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
Please forgive me.

69
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,480
Please.

70
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,680
Oh...

71
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,844
Rain? Why are you here?

72
00:03:27,313 --> 00:03:28,916
You're about to take a shower?

73
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:30,520
Who's there, Arm?

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,560
Rain!

75
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,000
Hi.

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,339
I'm sorry to hear you just lost your job.

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
I don't want to get hurt again.

78
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
I promise I will never hurt you.

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,480
It's not about you, Love.

80
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,240
What do you mean?

81
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
You shouldn't be the
one making this promise.

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,800
It's me. I shouldn't love you
or anyone else again.

83
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,880
If love doesn't happen, I won't get hurt.

84
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Rain...

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
I gotta go now.

86
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Just because you were hurt before,

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,960
you're giving up the chance to be happy now
and in the future?

88
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,280
And are you sure

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
happiness will last forever?

90
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
Can you truly say forever exists?

91
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
You can't, can you?

92
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,520
It doesn't exist, Love.

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
But changes do.

94
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,440
They keep hurting me.

95
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
But...

96
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
I'm tired, Love.

97
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
I don't want to be hurt again.

98
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
Do you understand me?

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Stop pestering me.

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm not even good
enough for you to like me.

101
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Rain!

102
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,858
- Deane.
- Yes?

103
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Don't you think that was weird?

104
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
What do you mean?

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,440
It seemed like...

106
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
they were on a date.

107
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
And?

108
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,160
I don't know!

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,960
You love to learn
about people's affairs, don't you?

110
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,400
You're suddenly blaming me?

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,080
Just go.

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
What's that?

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,120
I'm tired, Love.

114
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,403
Stop pestering me.

115
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,600
Where's the remote?

116
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Want some?

117
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,200
Thanks.

118
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Are you okay?

119
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,960
Wanna see a doctor?

120
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
A shaman?

121
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,880
Mom!

122
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,972
Am I really your daughter?

123
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
What is it?

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,920
Wanna tell me?

125
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,240
I'm all ears.

126
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,920
It's completely broken, Mom.

127
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,703
What?

128
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
You just got in the game.

129
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,576
You're kicked out already?

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,360
Mom!

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Noob.

132
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,560
That's mean.

133
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,800
And what did you do?
Why is it like this?

134
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
She's probably not
ready to be in love again.

135
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
I don't know.

136
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,080
Why?

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,240
She was hurt by her past love, wasn't she?

138
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,240
How did you know that?

139
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,920
Well...

140
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,920
Do you think people
who don't know how to love themselves

141
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,320
have ever experienced true love?

142
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,153
What's with you?

143
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,200
And you? What's next?

144
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
I just said,

145
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,000
"If you can't love yourself,

146
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,640
please take the love I have for you."

147
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,400
- What's so funny?
- You're unbelievable.

148
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,440
No wonder why she said no.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,800
You think so?

150
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
I didn't hurt her, though.

151
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,640
Why should I deal with the consequences
of something I didn't do?

152
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Love,

153
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,800
It's not quite like that.

154
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,440
It was just not the right timing.

155
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,762
The right timing?

156
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,760
Yeah.

157
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,840
If you rush it,

158
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,360
you'll end up forcing her
rather than being nice to her.

159
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,920
I'm all confused now.
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,823
Okay, so...

161
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,080
If I've been promising for 10 years

162
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,880
to take you on a trip
for getting the best exam score,

163
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
but never actually did,

164
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,080
would you believe me

165
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
if I said it again today?

166
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,880
No, who would fall for you?

167
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,160
But what if I really mean it this time?

168
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
- Please believe me.
- Come on, Mom. I won't buy it.

169
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,160
You've always lied to me.

170
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,360
I know, right?

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,400
How can someone
who has always been lied to and let down

172
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,880
believe that this love
won't hurt them again?

173
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Me.

174
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,115
My actions,

175
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,840
manners,

176
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
and eyes.

177
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Everything from me.

178
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
It's time.

179
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,309
Time will prove everything you do.

180
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,720
It will show how steady
and strong your love is.

181
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,375
Let time work its magic,

182
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,710
and she'll see

183
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,956
that you're different

184
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,990
and not gonna disappoint her again.

185
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
- Okay.
- Let's have dinner.

186
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,960
- I made boiled eggs in sweet brown sauce.
- Aw, I'm hungry now.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,040
I'll give you 3 eggs.

188
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,535
No one is kinder to me
or loves me more than you do.

189
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,950
- For sure.
- Am I right?

190
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Give me a hug.

191
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,074
I'm here.

192
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
Where is she?

193
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,268
The place's all dark.

194
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,432
She's taking a nap here.

195
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,727
Jeez, this woman!

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,183
Oh, you're burning up.

197
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Deane.

198
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,741
Deane...

199
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,029
How could you let it be this bad?

200
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,240
Jeez.

201
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,974
It's so hard to open you.
You're so special, huh?

202
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,060
Here.

203
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,135
This is for you.

204
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,954
Why's that?

205
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,120
'Cause you were crying over spoiled beef.

206
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,121
You think it's funny?

207
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
I don't want you to feel bad.

208
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,335
You're Rain, but allow the rain
in your heart to stop sometimes.

209
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,320
What are you doing?

210
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,788
I'm protecting you from rain

211
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,063
so that you don't get soaked alone.

212
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,487
- What is this?
- Let's grab some dolls.

213
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:39,882
You like it?

214
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,422
Yeah, I do.

215
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
I like it a lot.

216
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,840
Nonsense.

217
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,210
Give it a shot.

218
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,378
The next thing you know,
you might be addicted.

219
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,960
You need to choose the perfect shoes

220
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,593
so that they won't hurt you, okay?

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,241
Do you feel more comfortable now?

222
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,266
Come on!

223
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,523
- Jeez!
- Miss,

224
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,002
hitting it that hard won't do anything.

225
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,902
I know. I just wanted to do it.

226
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,575
My apology.

227
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,480
I'm sorry. I'm not in a good mood.

228
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,915
It's okay. Be my guest.

229
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,108
- Thank you.
- No worries.

230
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,612
What's wrong with you, Rain?

231
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,444
You can't stop thinking of her.

232
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,840
"Someone's ex, but my new love."

233
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,483
He's my ex, jeez.

234
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,923
So annoying.

235
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,080
"Escape the hot weather.

236
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,827
Spending time alone
can bring you happiness, too."

237
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,640
Okay. Let's say it's a vacation.

238
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,024
Deane.

239
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,890
Are you feeling better?

240
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,449
Do I still have a fever?

241
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,381
No.

242
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,920
So,

243
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
why are you turning red?

244
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Or...

245
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,160
you caught a cold from me?

246
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,680
I'm not sure about that,

247
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,920
but I think I'm addicted to you.

248
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
Are you okay with this?

249
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,121
So, what brought you here?

250
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:29,280
You're going to work
at Praew's resort tomorrow, aren't you?

251
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,040
Yeah.

252
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,815
What could it be?
She got ditched, obviously.

253
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,423
I don't think she just got ditched.

254
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,322
We should say she got dumped.

255
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,262
Right, look at her.

256
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,288
Come on, aren't you guys my friends?

257
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,280
Friends don't comfort one another.

258
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,480
We only rub it in.

259
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,789
Fine, thanks.

260
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,480
It's alright.

261
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,788
Over there.

262
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,835
No.

263
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,560
What about over there?

264
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,920
- No.
- Pale and pretty.

265
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,520
- Nope.
- You're not getting anyone.

266
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,040
What do you want?

267
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,619
I don't want anything!

268
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,160
I want Rain, you know? I want her!

269
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,459
Rain who?

270
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Rainy?

271
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,560
No, I want Rain.

272
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,160
She doesn't want you!

273
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Want me instead?

274
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,680
Ew, no.

275
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,536
Stop it. That's so wrong.

276
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,160
I was just kidding.

277
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,480
Come on, Love.

278
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,920
What's meant to be
yours will always be yours.

279
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,974
If it's not, it will never be.

280
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,360
Don't force it, girl.

281
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,825
Why would you say that?

282
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,724
Soothe yourself with some biscuit sticks.

283
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,880
Right.

284
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,240
No, I want fries.

285
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,520
What lovely weather!

286
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,453
It's been so long since I experienced this.

287
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,087
Should I plant some more flowers?

288
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
That sounds good.

289
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,114
- Took me so long to align our schedules.
- Right.

290
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
I'm a star, you know.

291
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,887
Jeez.

292
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,630
Why are you taking a photo of me?

293
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,000
I hired you to promote my resort
with your photos.

294
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,800
Well, I can just promote you, too.

295
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,358
You're single, pretty, rich, and smart.

296
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,360
Perfect.

297
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,320
So, can I flirt with you?

298
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,672
That's too wrong.

299
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,072
- That's so creepy.
- You're right.

300
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
So familiar.

301
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,800
Very familiar.

302
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,320
Ew.

303
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,960
You're not in?

304
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,680
No!

305
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,360
You have a customer today?

306
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,200
Yeah, she's been here since yesterday.

307
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,032
It seems like
she's going through heartbreak.

308
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,901
Shit!

309
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,054
How can this world be so small?

310
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,898
Just my thought brought her here?

311
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
What should I do?

312
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,248
Were we too loud?

313
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
We're ruining her vibes.

314
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,440
My rooms are soundproof,

315
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,280
but we better keep it down.

316
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,215
Okay.

317
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,480
Let's talk somewhere else.

318
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,328
- Sure. Let's get inside.
- Okay.

319
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,248
Show me the room.

320
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,448
- Let's see how amazing it is.
- Wanna see my garden?

321
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,960
- I've planted a garden.
- For real?

322
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,880
It's stunning.

323
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Hi, Rain.

324
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,276
It's been a while.

325
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,380
I've missed you.

326
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,357
How did you find me?

327
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,543
Look how noticeable you are.

328
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,018
It's not that hard to find you.

329
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,102
You followed me here, didn't you?

330
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
No.

331
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,519
I've been tracking you by GPS.

332
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,457
Love!

333
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,440
I'm sorry.

334
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,800
No, we didn't do anything.

335
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,724
Okay. I see.

336
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,173
Welcome.

337
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,160
Thank you.

338
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Why did you follow me?

339
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
I didn't.

340
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,260
There's plenty of seats.

341
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,461
Go sit somewhere else.

342
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,585
This seat's available.

343
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,004
I'd like to sit here.

344
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,381
Here are your drinks.

345
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,800
Do you know her?

346
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,360
Yes.

347
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,215
Are you here together?

348
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,920
No, we're not.

349
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,520
She ran away from me,

350
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,713
so I'm taking her back.

351
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,346
Who ran away from you?

352
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,519
Say the truth.

353
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,230
You did.

354
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,727
You turned down both my love and my calls.

355
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,239
You didn't answer my
texts and weren't at home.

356
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
So mean.

357
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,520
I told you I wasn't into you.

358
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,984
I'm well aware of that,

359
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,785
but I'll change your mind.

360
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,000
Hey, Love.

361
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,980
Well,

362
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,960
I love you, too.

363
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,400
Rain, wait up!

364
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,724
Sit down right here.

365
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,730
Sit.

366
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Why? What's wrong?

367
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
Why would you tease her like that?

368
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,439
I didn't. I was serious.

369
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,280
It's just that she doesn't like me.

370
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,320
Seriously? You couldn't tell?

371
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,720
Tell what?

372
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,640
It's not that she doesn't like you.

373
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,647
She's just scared.

374
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,439
- Of me?
- Yes.

375
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,360
Why's that?

376
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,400
Do I look like a scammer or something?

377
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,820
No.

378
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,480
If you want to be with someone serious,

379
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,745
you need to be more mature and serious.

380
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,440
Like, for real.

381
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,798
How?

382
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,319
Good evening, Rain.

383
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,633
What's with you?

384
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,433
I'm being serious.

385
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
I want to be more mature

386
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,200
and serious.

387
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,166
Whatever.

388
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,240
Two glasses of wine, please.

389
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,850
Do you know how to drink it?

390
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,513
I need to mature
and experience the taste of adulthood.

391
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,720
Thank you.

392
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,776
Did you take the wrong pill?

393
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,451
You've got some moves.

394
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,928
Cheers to adulthood.

395
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Are you sure you can drink it?

396
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,289
Argh!!

397
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,675
It's so harsh.

398
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,237
Aw, Love.

399
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,038
What's so funny?

400
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,160
Kiddo, you can't even drink it.

401
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,860
Well,

402
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,199
they say it's the taste of adulthood.

403
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,560
That's not how you do it.

404
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
And how do I do it?

405
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,920
There are no lessons for it.

406
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,725
Why is it so hard to be serious?

407
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,257
Then,

408
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,438
can you teach me?

409
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,556
Are you sure about that?

410
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,840
Yeah!

411
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
Let's see who'll finish it first.

412
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,461
Are you sure?

413
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,195
Wait, don't tell me...

414
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,014
you can't drink it, either.

415
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,360
You're underestimating me.

416
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,080
If you want me to teach you,

417
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,840
you need to drink it with me tonight.

418
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,576
Finish your drink.

419
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,520
Come on!

420
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,555
Let's do it!

421
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,552
Love,

422
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,910
wine should be sipped slowly.

423
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,333
Fine, I'll do it.

424
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,259
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

425
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,363
Whoa!

426
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,720
You ate.

427
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,240
You still have a lot
more to work on, kiddo.

428
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,995
I'd rather have the steak.

429
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,035
Water might be the best choice.

430
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,885
You still have so much wine.

431
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,418
I'll give it to you.

432
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,260
So, are you drunk?

433
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,720
A little bit.

434
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,360
I wanted to be serious,

435
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,080
but ended up being hilarious.

436
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,263
Why do you wanna be serious now?

437
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,480
I want you to know

438
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,560
that I'm serious.

439
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,913
I'm not toying with your feelings.

440
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,405
- But...
- Take your time.

441
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,948
I can wait for you my whole life.

442
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,200
I've been waiting for you for 7 years now.

443
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,623
I'm fine with waiting a little longer.

444
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,468
What made you like me?

445
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,240
Like, the reason?

446
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,280
There isn't.

447
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,854
There are no reasons.

448
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,440
You had me at hello

449
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,634
when I saw you at the college

450
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,309
while you were talking to the professor.

451
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,102
It felt like...

452
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,320
everything stopped,

453
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,522
and you've been the
only one I see ever since.

454
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,005
No matter how far we are apart,

455
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,800
you've always been the only one I see.

456
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
Can you see anything?

457
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,560
What?

458
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,737
Can you see yourself in my eyes?

459
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,982
They belong to you.

460
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,563
They've always been.

461
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm sleepy now.

462
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
I'll go to bed.

463
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,760
Goodnight.

464
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,693
Goodnight.

465
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
See you.

466
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
I'll wait for you.

467
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Morning, Rain.

468
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,960
Why are you here?

469
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
What are you doing?

470
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,605
Nothing.

471
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,678
Let's go.

472
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,508
Where to?

473
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,781
Be my model.

474
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,732
- No.
- Come on.

475
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,840
I like those.

476
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,290
The pictures?

477
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,720
Obviously.

478
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,931
Here's your drink.

479
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Thanks.

480
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
It's cooled me down.

481
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,760
Are you tired?

482
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
A little bit.

483
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,240
Here's some water.

484
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,162
Thanks.

485
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,911
I'm sorry for today.

486
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,847
I didn't want you to just stay in the room.

487
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,600
When you're tired,

488
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,800
nature knows the best way to heal you.

489
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,643
Why?

490
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Love, it'll give you an itch.

491
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,280
It won't.

492
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,400
I can just scratch it later.

493
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,098
It's dirty.

494
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,812
It is,

495
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,891
but it's comfortable.

496
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,640
Come on.

497
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Lie down.

498
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,195
Rain,

499
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,895
if something's too heavy for you,

500
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,969
you can share it with me.

501
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,995
Why are you so kind?

502
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,870
I'm always mean to others.

503
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,231
It's alright.

504
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,162
I'll be kind to you.

505
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,920
Love!

506
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,374
Your heart's beating so fast.

507
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,075
I'm excited.

508
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
How cute.

509
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,445
You love me now?

510
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,720
Oh,

511
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
it's raining!

512
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
- Let's get out of the rain!
- Let's go!

513
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,950
What is this?

514
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,102
Come on.

515
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,240
Deane, I'm here!

516
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
Hi.

517
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,400
Hello.

518
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,960
Did you book an appointment?

519
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,840
Yes, I scheduled it with Deane personally.

520
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,067
I see.

521
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,284
Kiddo,

522
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
the room's ready.

523
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,440
You can wait for me there.

524
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,760
- Sure.
- We should talk, Deane.

525
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,730
I'll be right there after you.

526
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,180
Why didn't you tell me
you made an appointment?

527
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,797
I forgot to.

528
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,123
You did?

529
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,880
What if I made another appointment
for someone else?

530
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,360
But you didn't.

531
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,080
Why are you so upset?

532
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,600
Why didn't you tell me, then?

533
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,194
Why did I need to?

534
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,920
- Do I have to tell you everything?
- Yes!

535
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,620
- Literally everything?
- Yes!!

536
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,640
It was just sex.
I don't have to tell you everything.

537
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
Hey, Deane.

538
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,195
How could you say that?

539
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,793
It's who I am.

540
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,360
What's wrong with you?

541
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,800
Deane,

542
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,280
I heard you guys talking so loudly.

543
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,960
Is it because of me?

544
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,320
It's not, kiddo.

545
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,240
Don't worry.

546
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,080
Are you sure it's not about me?

547
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,841
Yes.

548
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,240
Let's get you a tattoo.

549
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,609
Okay? Let's go.

550
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,920
"Are you sure it's not about me?"

551
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,684
- I gotta go now.
- Okay.

552
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,777
Get home safely.

553
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,143
- Tell me when you get there.
- Okay.

554
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,151
I'm leaving, Pat.

555
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,134
Goodbye.

556
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,200
You walked to me just then.

557
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,480
Is something wrong?

558
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,588
No.

559
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,720
What's wrong?

560
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,520
It's nothing.

561
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Someone's in denial.

562
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,320
I'm not.

563
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
You're not,

564
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,759
but you won't say you're jealous.

565
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,480
Is it fun

566
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,434
toying with my feelings?

567
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,480
(Next Episode)
Can I be the one for you?

568
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,360
Will you be my girlfriend?

569
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,320
Hi, babe.

570
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,873
It's her ex.

571
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,603
Happy 10th anniversary!

572
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,491
I love you, babe.

573
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,160
Happy birthday, Deane.

574
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,680
I'm wishing you all the happiness!

575
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,120
I can't beat your ex anyway.

576
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,600
What have you done?

577
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,680
Are you back together?

578
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,120
How could you be this stupid, Pat?

579
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,863
How could you ask for love
from someone who doesn't want to love you?

580
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,474
Love, what's wrong?

581
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,800
I can't breathe.
