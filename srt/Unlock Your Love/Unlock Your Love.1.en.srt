1
00:00:01,187 --> 00:00:03,888
You might fall for someone
because you find them kind

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:06,114
or adorable.

3
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:10,422
Oftentimes, love can surprise us

4
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:14,907
when you fall for...

[Oil, Teerapat Prakobkarn]

21
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:28,547
And when they made love...

22
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:32,618
Fern, come to my office.

23
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:39,769
You're doomed, Fern.

24
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,670
She's so early.

25
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:44,101
Rest in peace, my friend.

26
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,844
You can do it, Fern.

27
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:48,830
You got this.

28
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:59,643
What did you do?
How could you submit this to the client?

29
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:01,816
The words are misspelled,
and the caption doesn't match the briefing.

30
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:03,532
Did you check before submitting it?

31
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,506
Should I send you to kindergarten?

32
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,212
I didn't intend to do that.

33
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:10,304
I'm really sorry.

34
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,465
Get yourself together
before you have nothing to do, Fern.

35
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:15,409
Okay.

36
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:18,257
Get it fixed.

37
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:21,543
Okay.

38
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:28,772
I don't care about what people think of me

39
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:32,973
as I do everything reasonably and fairly.

40
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:36,696
And it's led me to good things.

41
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,292
She got me again!

42
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,592
It's always me!

43
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:47,932
Be right back.

44
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:49,372
Luck is on your side.

45
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,761
Good luck, girl.

46
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:00,752
Hi, everyone. I'm Kitty.

47
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:02,852
Hello, Miss Kitty.

48
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:03,662
- Hello.
- Please take a seat.

49
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:05,382
- Please.
- Let's get started.

50
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:08,412
From your latest feedback,
we've adjusted the storyboard

51
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:09,387
- and...
- Stop.

52
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:11,944
I don't wanna hear that kind of stuff.

53
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:14,981
You don't have to tell me more
about this project.

54
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:16,020
I'm sorry?

55
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:21,385
I mean, you don't need to do it anymore.

56
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:24,194
Are you calling off your project?

57
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,052
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.

58
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:27,372
That'd be horrible.

59
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:31,132
I just think we should go with the first draft.

60
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:33,492
The first one we talked about.

61
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:36,932
It seems to fit the concept best.

62
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:38,650
One more thing,

63
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:41,473
whatever comes first is always better.

64
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,252
Do you agree, Miss Rain?

65
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:45,452
What a waste of time.

66
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,012
Excuse me?

67
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:49,852
It was a waste of time, Miss Kitty.

68
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:51,812
I understand if you want to
make changes to your project,

69
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:52,982
but this is already the 5th draft.

70
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:54,692
- At first, you said...
- Stop it, Rain.

71
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:56,697
Boss...

72
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,620
- Wait outside.
- Boss, but it's...

73
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:01,904
I said wait outside.

74
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:09,586
I'm sorry for that, Miss Kitty.

75
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:33,697
Rain, Boss needs you...

76
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:36,061
She didn't let me finish.

77
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:37,172
Hey.

78
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:39,569
It's an emergency.

79
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:41,760
What emergency? Spill the tea.

80
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:44,907
Something terrible is about to happen.

81
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:46,454
Serves her right!

82
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,754
She deserves it.

83
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:50,162
Here comes the trouble.

84
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:53,332
Miss Kitty's so upset
and said she wouldn't work with Rain.

85
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:55,612
Serves her right.

86
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:58,206
She's even upset with her client.

87
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:00,090
Acting like a pro

88
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,785
when all she can be is...

89
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:04,402
What's that?

90
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,667
A burden.

91
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,092
A bird?

92
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:10,972
That's not it!

93
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:13,932
- A burden, girl.
- That's harsh!

94
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:15,402
It's not.

95
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:16,555
What a snob.

96
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,441
She deserves it.

97
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:25,892
Boss.

98
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,092
Rain, you're very skilled,

99
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:31,013
but it's not right to be upset with your client.

100
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:33,513
You have to hold yourself back.

101
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:35,525
What do you want me to do?

102
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:37,412
She keeps changing her words.

103
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:39,136
It's wasting our time.

104
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:42,212
Rain, she's our client anyway.

105
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:43,828
You must be respectful.

106
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:47,555
What you did has no positive impact
on our company.

107
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,148
It's not my fault.

108
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:52,527
You know how long I've been doing this project.

109
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,900
Rain, you need to take a break

110
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:57,955
and reflect on your behavior.

111
00:06:58,372 --> 00:06:59,932
We can talk
once you've acknowledged your mistake.

112
00:07:00,092 --> 00:07:02,096
- Boss, but...
- Let's call it a day.

113
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:04,012
I'm tired of this.

114
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:04,652
Please leave.

115
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:14,247
Clients are always right, they say.

116
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:16,640
I'm sick of this. I'll quit.

117
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:18,972
Are you alright, Rain?

118
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,612
Of course, I am.
It doesn't matter if I'm not.

119
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:24,812
That's good.

120
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:26,172
I'm sick of her.

121
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,896
All she does is order me around.

122
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:29,240
It's like I'm her emotional garbage.

123
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:30,732
Exactly.

124
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:35,452
We're finally free from that snob!

125
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,734
I'm also sick of her.

126
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:39,736
She's always fussy.

127
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,212
Whenever she got bad feedback
from the clients,

128
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,034
she made it our fault.

129
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,374
Is that right?

130
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:48,083
But I think she's talented,

131
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:50,754
despite her sharp tongue.

132
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,532
I don't think Boss is firing her.

133
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:56,690
Girl, I'm telling you.

134
00:07:56,932 --> 00:08:00,854
No one here is better than the two of us.

135
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:02,553
- Right?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:06,762
Since she's not here anymore,

137
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,012
let's celebrate.

138
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:11,572
I have a date with my boyfriend.

139
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,076
You're always with your guy.

140
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:15,372
What about you?

141
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,092
I'm also occupied.

142
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:19,420
Jeez,

143
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:20,505
I don't care.

144
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:23,376
This pretty boy can celebrate alone.

145
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:24,892
Bye, girls.

146
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:30,377
Sometimes life gives us signs,

147
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:33,137
but it's up to us to notice them.

148
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:48,452
- Oh.
- Hi, Deane.

149
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,812
You're always bugging me.

150
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,922
I learned it from you.

151
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:56,461
What? I'm the good guy.

152
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:03,772
I'm leaving, Deane.

153
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:05,501
- I'll come back later for more tattoos.
- Okay.

154
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:08,524
See you.

155
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:18,707
What kind of client was that?

156
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,006
She even kissed you.

157
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:22,292
Are you guys together?

158
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:25,172
Hey, leave if you're here to bug me.

159
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,486
The door's that way.

160
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,272
I was just kidding.

161
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,000
Anyway...

162
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,794
Don't you want to commit to anyone?

163
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,264
Nope.

164
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,057
It's fine as is, isn't it?

165
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,096
There's no obligation,

166
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,455
and I don't need to care about others' feelings.

167
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,957
So you enjoy being single?

168
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,225
I don't know.

169
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,739
Everyone who says that
always has a lover in the end.

170
00:09:50,408 --> 00:09:51,201
Stop it.

171
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:52,824
Are you hungry?

172
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:54,408
- Let's go.
- Okay.

173
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:55,888
Get up.

174
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,248
- The usual place?
- Yeah.

175
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:07,944
Arm!

176
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:13,288
Oh...

177
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:15,343
Rain? Why are you here?

178
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:17,412
You're about to take a shower?

179
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,608
Well, I...

180
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:22,088
Who's there, Arm?

181
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:25,850
Rain!

182
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:27,223
Hi.

183
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:30,768
Well...

184
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:33,608
We...

185
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:34,669
We what?

186
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,207
It's obvious.

187
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:39,106
What a stupid question.

188
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:43,786
I'm sorry to hear you just lost your job.

189
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:50,843
What?

190
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:52,608
You just lost your job?

191
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:55,464
It's not as important as this situation.

192
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:56,915
I...

193
00:10:59,288 --> 00:10:59,941
Get out.

194
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:02,552
Rain...

195
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:04,039
Let me explain.

196
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:05,168
Get out!

197
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:07,787
Rain.

198
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:08,808
Let go of me!

199
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:10,134
- Let me explain, Rain.
- Don't touch me.

200
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:11,848
- I can explain.
- Let me go!

201
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:13,747
Remember, Arm.

202
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:15,968
No matter how pitiful I am,

203
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,933
I won't share my boyfriend with anyone.

204
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:19,542
It's disgusting.

205
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:23,378
Rain, there's nothing between us.

206
00:11:23,688 --> 00:11:24,524
Get out.

207
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:27,193
Don't leave any of your stuff here.

208
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:29,979
Rain!

209
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:32,968
Why would you call her?

210
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:34,358
Why would you come here, then?!

211
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,360
Who would I get money from now?

212
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:40,608
What do we do?

213
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:24,224
It was too far.

214
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,495
I wanna do it with you here.

215
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:33,193
Nice to meet you.

216
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:35,058
You're Pe?

217
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:39,218
Nice to meet you...

218
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:41,088
I'm Deane.

219
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:43,281
Deane.

220
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:47,848
Is this seat available?

221
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:51,321
You mean here

222
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:53,048
or...

223
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:54,675
right here?

224
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:59,694
If it's here,

225
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:01,601
is it still available?

226
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:07,743
Right here, it's under repair.

227
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:09,800
It's been hurt a lot.

228
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:11,928
Not ready to operate.

229
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:15,164
That's bad.

230
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:17,484
If you want to repair it,

231
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,102
let me know.

232
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,826
I won't charge you.

233
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:24,794
Anyway, there'll be some fees.

234
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,368
Was I invisible to her?

235
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:54,607
Here.

236
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:56,266
What?

237
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:59,579
In case you want her.

238
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:01,905
No.

239
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:03,877
Not my type. Take it back.

240
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:06,826
What's your type, then?

241
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:10,964
I'm not telling you.

242
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:15,488
- And you?
- What?

243
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:16,899
You're planning to be single forever, huh?

244
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:18,105
Jeez.

245
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:20,315
Give me a break.

246
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:21,848
I'm tired.

247
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,332
I want to go to bed now.

248
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:24,970
You've been hurt, haven't you?

249
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:27,360
Nonsense.

250
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,288
I'm worried about you.

251
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:34,658
I want you to be in love again.

252
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:40,088
Your past love didn't work out,
but that doesn't mean you're failing again.

253
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:42,102
Stop it.

254
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:44,779
I'm okay with my life now.

255
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:48,519
You're afraid of love now?

256
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,688
Of course.

257
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:54,328
When we love someone, we'll love them,

258
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:55,556
love them,

259
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:58,528
and forget to love ourselves.

260
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:01,248
No.

261
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:04,133
You just haven't found good love.

262
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:13,041
Good love teaches you to love your partner

263
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:14,803
and yourself more.

264
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:18,775
It'll make you want to be a better person.

265
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,431
What a guru.

266
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:30,135
- Hi.
- Hi.

267
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:32,608
You're teaching others now?

268
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:36,567
- We call that...
- You're an expert, huh?

269
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:39,152
- an armchair expert.
- Whoa.

270
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:41,138
It's me, your sis.

271
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:43,008
I'm an only child, babe.

272
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:45,488
- Fine, whatever.
- Let's...

273
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,118
Let's find a table.

274
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:48,528
- Let's go.
- Alright.

275
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,190
- Let's go.
- Okay.

276
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:52,576
Your friend?

277
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:54,788
- Take this.
- No.

278
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,455
Give her a shot.

279
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:57,848
Come on.

280
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,568
Come on. I've reserved this table.

281
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:05,088
Take your seat.

282
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:15,792
Thank you.

283
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,328
Thank you.

284
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:23,852
Deane, these are my high school friends.

285
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,396
This is Wawa,

286
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,146
a future top makeup artist.

287
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:32,645
She's almost there.

288
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:34,512
Almost what?

289
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:36,682
Almost didn't make it.

290
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:37,892
Jeez,

291
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:41,768
once I become famous,
I'll dump you all!

292
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:46,288
Come on, you'll have no one left then.

293
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:47,568
- Exactly.
- Right?

294
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,625
Do I have to keep you guys near?

295
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,008
Fine.

296
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:52,968
Let's do that, then.

297
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:56,527
This is Bowie.

298
00:16:58,248 --> 00:16:59,248
She's on the art team at my firm.

299
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:01,976
Art?

300
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:03,768
The art team she's in...

301
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:05,506
You know their motto?

302
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:06,914
It's...

303
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:08,408
"Let's paint the town red!"

304
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,888
Come on, you're always like this.

305
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,022
Stop it, Wawa.

306
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:17,128
What a bad joke.

307
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:19,867
Anyway,

308
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:21,946
who's this?

309
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,571
Into men or women?

310
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:27,208
Is my kind alright?

311
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,408
I'm actually fine with anyone

312
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,448
as long as they're good in bed.

313
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,528
Aw!

314
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:39,168
- I'm taking that position, then!
- Hold on.

315
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,329
Calm down.

316
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,527
Take it easy.

317
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:45,537
- This is Deane, the friend I told you.
- I see.

318
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:46,728
She's a tattoo artist.

319
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:48,248
Okay.

320
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:50,448
Please spare her.

321
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:52,728
Where should I?

322
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:53,808
Here?

323
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:54,968
Here?

324
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,969
Or right here?

325
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:59,648
Stop! You're hungry or what?

326
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:01,817
- Your type is over there.
- Where?

327
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,848
Over there.

328
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:05,609
- The left one.
- The bartender?

329
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:08,031
- Aww!
- You want everyone, huh?

330
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:09,674
He seems alright.

331
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:14,848
- My type's right there.
- Yeah, he's there.

332
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,672
I'm going to the toilet.

333
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,040
Sure.

334
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,728
Cheers, Deane.

335
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:25,584
Cheers.

336
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:28,639
- Cheers.
- Nice to meet you.

337
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:33,768
It's so strong.

338
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:37,168
It's very strong.

339
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,848
I like it.

340
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:54,760
How long can someone be so foolish

341
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,688
and fall for lies over and over again
because of love?

342
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,560
Hey, I saw you with someone.

343
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,742
Did she fall for you already?

344
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,563
Obviously, you know who I am.

345
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,343
She's easy.

346
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,624
I was just a bit clingy and told her I miss her,

347
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
and now she can't live without me.

348
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,395
Jeez, you're sick.

349
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,880
I didn't think she'd be this easy.

350
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,080
Here's 200 baht.

351
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,792
You're literally good at everything.

352
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,644
I want more.

353
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,920
- I don't have any.
- What do you mean?

354
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,550
That's all I have.

355
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,983
How could you do this, Toh?

356
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,400
You guys are gross.

357
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,773
Why?

358
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
You're so easy.

359
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,455
Easy?

360
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,128
You already fell for me.

361
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
I thought it'd be harder.

362
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,968
Let's go.

363
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,267
Come on.

364
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,857
Babe, here's your work.

365
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,147
How could you finish this, babe?

366
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,120
That bitch is stupid.

367
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,440
She's only good at studying.

368
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,985
But when it comes to love,
she's absolutely stupid.

369
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,080
Use her to do my work again, then.

370
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,333
Sure. I can do anything for you, babe.

371
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,316
Toei,

372
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,480
how can you be such a shithead?

373
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,022
Hey, that's my girlfriend.

374
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,200
Your girlfriend?

375
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,110
And you're just a mistress?

376
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,394
Babe, she's being rude to me.

377
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,560
Hey, Rain.

378
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,880
That's too much.

379
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,568
Of course, you're so smart
and good at everything.

380
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,322
That's why I look so stupid when I'm with you.

381
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,779
Let's go, babe.

382
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:16,435
Rain,

383
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
what are you doing?

384
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,190
I'm working.

385
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,622
Is there anything I can help?

386
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,308
Rooting for me is simply enough.

387
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,065
Rain.

388
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,262
Can you lend me some money this month?

389
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,129
My family hasn't given me the allowance,

390
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:33,641
and I have activities
to attend at the university.

391
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,383
Did you spend all I've given you?

392
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:41,095
My mom got sick,

393
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,945
so I gave it to her for the treatment.

394
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,093
Don't worry, Rain. I'll return it to
you as soon as possible.

395
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:47,814
Please, Rain.

396
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,008
Please.

397
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,692
Let me think for a bit.

398
00:21:53,414 --> 00:21:54,303
Come on, Rain.

399
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:55,770
Please.

400
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:57,633
Please, babe.

401
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,295
Okay.

402
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:02,479
That's why I love you.

403
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,961
What are you doing?
Do you need a hand?

404
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,669
I'm a skilled writer, by the way.

405
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,760
Go ahead. There are 3-4 pages I have to finish.

406
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:14,269
That's not a problem.

407
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,360
I just want to type while we're arm in arm.

408
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,240
Oh...

409
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,324
Rain? Why are you here?

410
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,470
You're about to take a shower?

411
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,523
Well, I...

412
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:30,040
Who's there, Arm?

413
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,772
Rain!

414
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,123
Hi.

415
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,419
I'm sorry to hear you just lost your job.

416
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,806
What?

417
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,619
You just lost your job?

418
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,043
I'm so dizzy.

419
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,838
Shit.

420
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,577
My life's shit.

421
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,068
My job's shit.

422
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,378
Even love's shit.

423
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,064
What's wrong with my life?

424
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Just you watch,

425
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,211
I will never be in love again!

426
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
A thunder

427
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:51,801
and a strong wind?

428
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,308
That means the heaven heard my plea!

429
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:58,305
May those who want to be a part of my life

430
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,155
be unfitting.

431
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,400
May whatever will happen to us

432
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,082
cause us to sever all the ties!

433
00:24:29,155 --> 00:24:30,604
7?! I'm gonna be late for work!

434
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:36,793
Rain, you're unemployed.

435
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:41,823
I look like a mess.

436
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,822
I could've been strangled.

437
00:24:45,955 --> 00:24:48,810
How can I be so unlucky all my life?

438
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:03,274
Hello?

439
00:25:04,155 --> 00:25:06,731
Rain, good morning!

440
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,934
Hi, sis. Are you there?

441
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,560
Yeah, what?

442
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:16,755
Jeez, I've been abroad for ages.

443
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:18,865
Don't you miss me?

444
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:21,527
I do! What is it?

445
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:25,268
I have a job offer for you. Are you in?

446
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:27,220
A job?

447
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:29,447
What job? When can I start?

448
00:25:29,835 --> 00:25:30,679
Whoa,

449
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:33,090
it's like you're unemployed.

450
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:35,875
Yeah.

451
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:39,243
What happened?

452
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:41,154
How come you're unemployed?

453
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:44,087
Well, I am.

454
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:47,055
That's good. 10 A.M. tomorrow,

455
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:49,018
meet me at your regular cafe.

456
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:51,731
Wait, what's the payment?

457
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:54,308
Unlimited.

458
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:55,875
See you tomorrow.

459
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:04,050
At least something good's happening.

460
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:22,638
I'm here, Pat.

461
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:26,665
Jeez, I thought you'd never show up.

462
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,155
Fine, see you then.

463
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,069
Stop.

464
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,373
Sit down, Love.

465
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:32,083
Just kidding.

466
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:34,738
Jeez, you're back and already upset, huh?

467
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:37,835
Is it a cultural difference or something?

468
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,261
Watch your mouth.
I shouldn't have helped you.

469
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:43,035
Well,

470
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:45,262
about the job,

471
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:46,761
is Rain in?

472
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:53,035
Can't you stop asking me about her, huh?

473
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:54,235
That's sus.

474
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:55,515
No.

475
00:26:55,895 --> 00:26:56,628
It's nothing.

476
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:00,195
Is she in, though?

477
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:02,137
I won't tell you that

478
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,920
until you take me to Deane!

479
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:08,141
You're asking for your girl already?

480
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,592
Speaking of that,

481
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:11,915
she's so fine.

482
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:13,485
Is she into girls?

483
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:16,130
Yeah.

484
00:27:18,195 --> 00:27:19,035
What kind of girls?

485
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,195
Cute, pretty,

486
00:27:21,235 --> 00:27:23,302
natural, with a Western style,

487
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,475
with a Korean look, independent,

488
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:27,756
- or like...
- Come on!

489
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,262
Any girl, I guess.

490
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:30,315
I don't know.

491
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:31,915
- Any girl?
- Yeah.

492
00:27:31,955 --> 00:27:32,569
What about...

493
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:35,267
I don't think so.

494
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:36,095
See?

495
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,179
You're always like this.

496
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:39,739
I was kidding.

497
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:41,715
No, you can't.

498
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:44,228
I'm serious with her.

499
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:45,886
Are you?

500
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:48,060
I'll keep that in mind.

501
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:49,911
- But Deane's...
- Stop.

502
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:53,195
I'm not ready to hear any difficulties.

503
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:56,150
Disappointment is possible,

504
00:27:56,315 --> 00:27:57,736
but it's impossible for me.

505
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:01,368
Get ready to be disappointed, then.

506
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:06,428
One sec.

507
00:28:09,235 --> 00:28:10,235
Yes, Deane?

508
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:13,522
- Yes.
- Deane?

509
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:15,892
Okay. I'm coming.

510
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:18,275
I'm picking my friend up.

511
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:23,530
Right, my friend's coming, too.

512
00:28:24,155 --> 00:28:24,820
Can we come?

513
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:27,018
Okay.

514
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:28,328
See you.

515
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:29,315
Bye.

516
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,395
Can I have her number?

517
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:34,373
- Come on!
- Please!

518
00:28:34,795 --> 00:28:36,424
Ask her for it!

519
00:28:37,355 --> 00:28:39,230
But we gotta go now.

520
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:40,638
- Come on.
- To see Deane?

521
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:42,593
- Yes, girl. Let's hurry.
- Let's go, then.

522
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:44,735
Let's go!

523
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:47,515
- Oh...
- Come on, hurry!

524
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:49,498
She's waiting for us!

525
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:50,835
Go now.

526
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:17,225
We're closed today.

527
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,590
Love?

528
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,070
You're early.

529
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,030
Come on.

530
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,435
Pat.

531
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,450
Pat...

532
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,160
Pat!

533
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,147
Gosh, you're so loud!

534
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,833
You didn't answer me.

535
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm afraid I can't hold myself back.

536
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,488
What?

537
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:09,290
There she is,

538
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,476
my sweet pie.

539
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,620
Huh?

540
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,045
Jeez, you're giving me a headache.

541
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,301
- What's wrong?
- Come on.

542
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,325
Deane!

543
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,640
This is how she looks?

544
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,301
Aw, she held my hand!
She has feelings for me.

545
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,128
You're annoying her.

546
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,958
Jeez.

547
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,427
Who's this?

548
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,306
Deane, this is Pat, my friend.

549
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,140
She's helping us with the project.

550
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,930
I see.

551
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,951
- Pat, this is...
- Deane!

552
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,479
Nice to meet you, Pat.

553
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,440
Aw, nice to meet you, too.

554
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,251
Can I be more than just a friend, though?

555
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,981
Sure!

556
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,407
You can be my client.

557
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,515
Gosh, that's harsh.

558
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,137
I liked it, though.

559
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,148
Jesus Christ.

560
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,680
What?

561
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,280
You're jealous, babe?

562
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,842
- Are you jealous?
- Me?

563
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
- Jealous?
- I'm jealous of you?

564
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,678
Jealous? What?

565
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,480
Are you guys a thing?

566
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,956
Can I say it?

567
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
Yes, say it now.

568
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,280
Spill the tea.

569
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Well...

570
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,170
Hey.

571
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,263
This is for you.

572
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Why are you giving me this?

573
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320
I like you.

574
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,920
What?

575
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Why?

576
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,810
Are you not into women?

577
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,532
Look, I can be a man.

578
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,600
Look at this.

579
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,119
I like you, dude.

580
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,670
Hold on.

581
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,303
This is odd.

582
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,430
Why is it so hard?

583
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,488
Is it hard for you to be my girlfriend?

584
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,365
It's actually not.

585
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,861
Why don't you be, then?

586
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,378
'Cause...

587
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,640
I don't feel that way with you.

588
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,160
Why don't you?

589
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,070
Am I not pretty enough?

590
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
Am I not sexy enough?

591
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,600
That's not it.

592
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,506
Is it because I'm not handsome?

593
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,796
That's not it. I mean...

594
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,043
I...

595
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,648
just don't feel that way with you,

596
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,135
but that doesn't mean you're not pretty.

597
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,600
It is hard.

598
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,254
Why are you doing something that's not yourself?

599
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,228
I mean...

600
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,661
If someone's gonna like you,

601
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,407
it should be because you are you,

602
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,764
not because you're pretending
to be someone else.

603
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,892
You can't be that person for that long.

604
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,760
Because I'm me,

605
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,120
no one likes me.

606
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,760
That's not true.

607
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,409
You're kinda cranky, though.

608
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,643
Hey!

609
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,440
I mean,

610
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,002
I kinda like you.

611
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,320
You're funny.

612
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,960
What do you mean?

613
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
You said you didn't like me,
but now you do?

614
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
It's confusing.

615
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,376
I like you as a friend.

616
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,640
Can I?

617
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,228
Well...

618
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,998
Let's be friends.

619
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Give me a minute.

620
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
Okay, deal!

621
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,507
Deal!

622
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,746
I just happen to have no friends.

623
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,517
Okay.

624
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,600
Don't leave me.

625
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,027
Okay.

626
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Promise?

627
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,859
- Promise.
- You'll never leave me?

628
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,840
Never.

629
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,200
No matter what,

630
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,317
don't ever stop being friends with me.

631
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,797
Got it.

632
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,850
Okay.

633
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,260
I'm hungry.

634
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,707
Join me for lunch.

635
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,764
Sure.

636
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,021
Can I finish this first?

637
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,014
No.

638
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,680
- Just one item.
- No.

639
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,120
I'm very hungry. I need to eat now.

640
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
I'll help pack your stuff.

641
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Let's have lunch.

642
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,486
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

643
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,527
That...

644
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,564
- Your camera?
- Yeah.

645
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,385
- Take me some photos.
- Sure.

646
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,812
Make me prettier than everyone.

647
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,265
Can I drop this?

648
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,349
- Don't!
- Come on.

649
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,403
Stop it.

650
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,595
That's my biggest mistake ever.

651
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,989
What's so funny, Deane?

652
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,448
You're funny.

653
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,154
It was so easy for you
to make a confession.

654
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,098
Wasn't it too frank?

655
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,145
Why would you make it hard?

656
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,295
If you like someone, just let them know.

657
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,174
What if you don't like them?

658
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,973
Can you just say so?

659
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Why?!

660
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,000
You don't like me?

661
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,375
What about the project?

662
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,361
It's done.

663
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,360
Pat's taken care of it. Tomorrow at 10 A.M.

664
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,387
- Okay.
- Don't be late.

665
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,511
Don't die, get sick, or ditch me.

666
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,641
Don't you dare be late.

667
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,720
Why?

668
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,960
Because Rain's very serious about punctuality.

669
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,266
10 A.M. means 10 A.M. sharp.

670
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,863
What if we're late?

671
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,203
It suddenly got cold.

672
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
I'm wearing this.

673
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,880
What?

674
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,200
Alright.

675
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,836
- 10 A.M. sharp.
- Got it.

676
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,040
Rain!

677
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,356
I'm here.

678
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,960
Pat, I've told you several times
how important punctuality is to me.

679
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,977
What time is it?

680
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,150
What time is it?

681
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,191
I forgot to adjust the watch.

682
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,615
How bad.

683
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,920
I'm sorry.

684
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,326
I'm just a bit late.

685
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,472
Five minutes late is still late,

686
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,205
but it's been 15 minutes.

687
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,440
I'm sorry.

688
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,688
Please calm down.

689
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,160
Where are your clients?

690
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,445
Are they not here?

691
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,878
I instructed them not to be late.

692
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,282
I'm not wasting any more time.

693
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,440
Rain!

694
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,600
I'm sorry, Rain.

695
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:18,679
I'm sorry for being late.

696
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,203
Why are you so late?

697
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:24,426
What took you so long?!

698
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:25,655
Bad traffic!

699
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:27,534
She's upset now!

700
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:32,424
Hey, how come you're still smiling?
You're late.

701
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:35,341
You should spare some time
to go to an appointment.

702
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:38,518
You can't just make excuses for it.

703
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:40,141
It's an appointment.

704
00:37:40,181 --> 00:37:41,410
Punctuality is important.

705
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:43,763
How come you don't know this?
It's so basic.

706
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:47,455
It's been less than 20 minutes.

707
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:49,021
20 minutes?

708
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:50,501
It's been 20 minutes already.

709
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:52,894
Those who are late always use this excuse.

710
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,040
Late is late.

711
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:56,701
There's no exception.

712
00:37:58,021 --> 00:37:59,565
Well, everyone.

713
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,181
Let's take it easy.

714
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,301
Should we order some drinks?

715
00:38:03,341 --> 00:38:05,237
- Right!
- It's so hot outside.

716
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:07,261
We'd like to order, please.

717
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:09,261
Also, turn down the A/C.

718
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:11,182
Make this place freezing cold.

719
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:13,068
Make it 18 degrees, please.

720
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:15,256
16, please!

721
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:21,487
Hey, you can't be smiling now.

722
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:23,278
Don't you feel guilty?

723
00:38:24,381 --> 00:38:25,138
Rain,

724
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,514
smiling doesn't mean I don't feel bad.

725
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:32,409
It's just that... I'm happy to meet you again.

726
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:40,181
Right?

727
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,176
We're working together.

728
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:09,461
Rain, have some!

729
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:10,981
Here you go!

730
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:11,766
It's not funny.

731
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,063
Gosh, Rain.

732
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:20,528
I'm not doing it until they apologize.

733
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:32,381
Sorry.

734
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:34,412
Keep it to yourself if it's not sincere.

735
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,474
I'm sorry for being late.

736
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:48,952
Fine.

737
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:50,899
You should apologize when you're wrong.

738
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:51,901
That's all.

739
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:53,261
Right.

740
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:58,212
Your work better be as good as your nagging.

741
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,021
Hand it over to someone else
if they can do better.

742
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:03,311
Calm down, guys.

743
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:06,268
Let's freshen up with some drinks.

744
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:08,351
I'm also sorry. Please calm down.

745
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:21,841
Yeah.

746
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:24,092
Let's call it quits.

747
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:30,444
For the sake of Love.

748
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:34,613
So?

749
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:45,472
It's nice working with you
and seeing you again, Rain.

750
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:27,732
It's raining again.

751
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:32,829
So?

752
00:41:33,092 --> 00:41:35,675
Checking girls out? Just like Deane.

753
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,036
What? How did you know that?

754
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,629
It's obvious.

755
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,529
What is obvious?

756
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,398
You want to comfort, hug her,

757
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,280
and be by her side.

758
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:52,580
That's too much, sis.

759
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,195
Why don't you comfort her?

760
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,490
She's been crying for hours.

761
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,070
Do you know what's going on with her?

762
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,360
It's what everyone's going through.

763
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,134
Confused?

764
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,262
Right?

765
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,440
You're not a nosy person, are you?

766
00:42:12,786 --> 00:42:14,141
She was dumped.

767
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:17,123
She's been crying so hard.

768
00:42:17,757 --> 00:42:18,836
It's your chance.

769
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:20,073
Comfort her.

770
00:42:22,677 --> 00:42:23,677
I better not.

771
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,903
Let the rain continue.

772
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,511
I don't think it's a good idea
to comfort her now.

773
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,822
I gotta go.

774
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,894
If love takes away our senses,

775
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,695
I'm probably running toward a typhoon

776
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,960
that's ready to tear everything apart.

777
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
But I'm not afraid of it;

778
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,706
I'm ready and willing
to face that powerful storm.

779
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,480
(Next Episode) You have no right
to make changes to my work.

780
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,840
Art is always created from emotions.

781
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,397
Rain!

782
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,000
What a coincidence!

783
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,040
You're so proud of my leftovers, huh?

784
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,000
A leftover man and a leftover job.

785
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,010
I'll just consider it charity
for some ungrateful brats.

786
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
You bitch!

787
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,012
Tears don't signify weakness.

788
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:28,058
They simply remind you
that you're still human with emotions.

789
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
I'm protecting you from rain

790
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,160
so that you don't get soaked alone.

791
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,142
I promise to always bring you a smile.

792
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,266
Giving someone everything
won't make them love you more,

793
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,967
but it makes you love yourself less.

794
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,403
Please, love someone
without hurting yourself.

795
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,329
There's no love without pain.

796
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,233
I'm just willing to love them

797
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,617
even knowing the hurt that lies ahead.
