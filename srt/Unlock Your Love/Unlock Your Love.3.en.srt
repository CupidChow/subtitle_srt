00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,960
(Previously) You have no right
to make changes to my work.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Art is always created from emotions.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,960
Rain!

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,680
You're so proud of my leftovers, huh?

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,600
A leftover man and a leftover job.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,760
You bitch!

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,443
Tears don't signify weakness.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,480
They simply remind you
that you're still human with emotions.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,840
I'm protecting you from rain

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,600
so that you don't get soaked alone.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,855
I promise to always bring you a smile.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,031
Giving someone everything
won't make them love you more,

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,770
but it makes you love yourself less.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,320
Please,

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,360
love someone without hurting yourself.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,160
There's no love without pain.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,080
I'm just willing to love them

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,360
even knowing the hurt that lies ahead.

[8.00 A.M.]

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,615
Hey, stop pressing that keyboard.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,188
I can't.

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,600
I've posted all the ads yesterday,

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,267
and it's done nothing.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,577
There must be something wrong.

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,738
There must be!

33
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,832
Here's your breakfast, guys!

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,573
- Jeez.
- Gosh, Love!

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
What's wrong?

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Why the long faces?

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,476
Where have you been?

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,120
I was buying some soy milk,
fried dough, grilled pork,

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,880
ham and cheese croissants,
and rice porridge for you guys.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,600
Come on.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,850
Dig in.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,145
We must be full of energy
when the customers come.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
Let's dig in.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
When the customers come?

45
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,160
Customers who?

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,465
Where?

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,400
Come on, guys.

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,920
Everything takes time.

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,520
Pat's just posted the ads, hasn't she?

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,320
Yeah.

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,190
What's meant to be yours,
no matter how long time's passed,

52
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,880
will still be yours.

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,118
Don't worry. They'll come.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,232
Fine.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,160
[2.00 P.M.]

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,983
Love.

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,756
Yeah?

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,840
What's meant to be ours...

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,393
Where is that thing? When will it come?

60
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,280
Sometimes, waiting doesn't work.

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,771
Therefore, we should fight to get it.

62
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,710
- Let's go, guys.
- What are you doing?

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,177
Handing out some flyers.

64
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,520
Come on.

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,640
Handing out the flyers?

66
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,760
Come on.

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,237
We can just post ads. Pat's doing it.

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,903
Come on, Rain.

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,240
A traditional way might work way better.

70
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,064
Come on.

71
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,040
- No. Won't you ask the owner first?
- Deane!

72
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,938
- Come with me.
- I'm the owner.

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm not going.

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,640
I'm the owner's future girlfriend.

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,200
It's a no.

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,627
Fine, Misses.

77
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,078
Make yourself at home.

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
- Us?
- Let's go.

79
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,338
- Me?
- You're coming.

80
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,240
- Come on!
- No! It's hot.

81
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,600
It's not. It'll only take a few minutes.

82
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,160
- It is!
- It's not. Come on.

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,600
- It won't be long!
- You can do it, guys.

84
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,855
We'll be back.

85
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,055
Bye-bye.

Thanks.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,920
Just a moment, Rain.

89
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,203
Why?

90
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,640
Rain, sit down.

91
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,338
What are you trying to do?

92
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
Come on. Sit down.

93
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,737
I'm changing your shoes.

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,175
It's okay. I'm fine.

95
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,240
It's okay, but I'm not fine.

96
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,160
- Come on.
- I'm not changing.

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,487
- Don't argue with me. Come on.
- Love!

98
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,390
It'll take a few seconds, Rain.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Let me.

100
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,967
Love!

101
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,340
Who would take care of you if you got hurt?

102
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,055
I can take care of myself.

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,578
This side, too.

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,706
You need to choose the perfect shoes

105
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,221
so that they won't hurt you, okay?

106
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
They fit you perfectly.

107
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,810
All done.

108
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,440
Do you feel more comfortable now?

109
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,280
Love me... Oh!

110
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,829
Trust me, and you won't be let down.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,666
Fine.

112
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,680
Rain!

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,193
- Excuse me, do you want one?
- Here you go, miss.

114
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,603
- Excuse me, do you want one?
- Excuse me.

115
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,177
- Thank you.
- Here you go. Thank you.

116
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,920
Excuse me, we're newly open.

117
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,031
Thank you.

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,950
See? I told you.

119
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,160
- It'll do nothing.
- It'll do something!

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,320
Come on, I'll help you.

121
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,000
Give it to me.

122
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,952
I wanna leave. It's hot!

123
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,320
It won't be long.

124
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,212
It's still 3 P.M., Rain.

125
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,398
I'm buying you
some yummy ice cream later.

126
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,145
We're back.

127
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,573
Jeez, look at you.

128
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,972
What?

129
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,207
- It's hot!
- What?

130
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,713
Here, have some water.

131
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,244
So, where's the customer?

132
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,399
Hey, it's not gonna work as soon as we do it.

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,432
We just came back.

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
You want the results now, huh?

135
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,560
Of course, I'm your client. I need results!

136
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,920
You want your money back now or what?

137
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,680
- Can you do that, then?
- Do you want it, then?

138
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,878
Guys, take it easy.

139
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,720
Do I look so upset?

140
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,893
The upset one is her, not me.

141
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,120
I'm not! Don't tell me to calm down.

142
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,707
Fine, guys.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,760
Just calm down.

144
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,160
I'm the upset one.

145
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,530
Let's take it easy.

146
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,600
[Hi, saw your promotion;
will I get a 50% discount after posting a review?]

147
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,180
- Guys!
- What?!

148
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
A customer texted us!

149
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,954
- Let me see!
- Come on.

150
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,129
Show me.

151
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,268
Where is it?

152
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,977
When a customer texts us,

153
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,016
will you always come this close to me?

154
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,040
Of course.

155
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,690
But if you're not answering her now,

156
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,263
- I'm firing you!
- Fine!

157
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,920
"Hi."

158
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,821
"Which promotion would you like to get?"

159
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,945
- To confirm?
- Yeah.

160
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,480
Rain.

161
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,560
[I'll decide when I go there tomorrow at 3 P.M.]

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
We got a customer!

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,417
- Yay!
- Yay!!

164
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
Whoa!

165
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,400
Yay!!

166
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,960
We did it!

167
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,675
Well...

168
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,988
Yay!

169
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,760
- Let's go!
- Yay!

170
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,491
Let's have a BBQ party!

171
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:01,640
- Let's go!
- Let's go!!

172
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

173
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,480
- Deane's paying, though.
- Yes, she is.

174
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,760
- You're the owner, so you should treat us...
- No, I'm not treating her.

175
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,280
- You're the owner, though.
- Hey! Deane! You're treating us!

176
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,440
- Deane, please!
- Deane, please treat us!

177
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,755
Need a lift, sis?

178
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,914
I'm the only child with no sisters.

179
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,904
So, you want me to be more than that?

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,032
Are you blushing?

181
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Blushing what?

182
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,315
Why do I have to?

183
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,293
You're not flirting with me.

184
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,870
What if I am? Will you blush?

185
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Just leave.

186
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,633
Come on, I'm giving you a lift.

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,503
No need. I can go home by myself.

188
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,457
Love.

189
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,750
It's okay. I'm taking you there.

190
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,080
It's not a big deal.

191
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,000
Gosh,

192
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,200
stay still.

193
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,658
How naughty.

194
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,355
Are all elders naughty?

195
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,080
Hey!

196
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,808
Just kidding.

197
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,489
You're all set now. Let's go.

198
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,375
Here.

199
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,180
- Come on. It's no big deal.
- This girl.

200
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,280
Let's go.

201
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,760
Take a seat.

202
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,742
- I'd like...
- I know what you like.

203
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,680
I'll order it for you.

204
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Just a moment.

205
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,695
- Here's yours, Rain.
- Hey!

206
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,092
How did you know what I liked?

207
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,195
I just care about you.

208
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,760
That's funny.

209
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,916
Pat told you, didn't she?

210
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,169
- Pat?
- Yeah.

211
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
She knows nothing

212
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,724
except when it comes to her crush.

213
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,360
How did you know I like rainbow shaved ice?

214
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,424
I won't tell you.

215
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,557
It's a secret.

216
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,870
I'm not buying it.

217
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,334
How is it?

218
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
It's yummy!

219
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,235
Can I try some?

220
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,240
Wanna try mine?

221
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,832
No.

222
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,556
It's good, though.

223
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,941
Love!

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,764
Good?

225
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Yours is also good.

226
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,352
I wanna try yours.

227
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,840
Fine.

228
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,798
How did you know what I like or want?

229
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,600
I just use my heart.

230
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,680
That's all.

231
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,870
Actually, when you like someone,

232
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,961
you'll care about them.

233
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,084
The shaved ice here is yummy.

234
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,407
I almost forgot how happiness tastes.

235
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,500
Eat up, then.

236
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,668
Here.

237
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,841
Thank you.

238
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,600
Rain!

239
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,014
Just a second.

240
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,816
Your shoes.

241
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,282
Thanks. These are a lot more comfortable.

242
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,586
You mean you're comfortable?

243
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,680
My feet.

244
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,473
I'll clean them for you.

245
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,706
It's okay. You don't have to do that.

246
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,880
- I can't. They're all dirty now.
- It's okay. I don't mind that.

247
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,407
But I do.

248
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,350
Don't, then. It'll bother you.

249
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,430
Love!

250
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,680
Just kidding.

251
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,118
I don't wanna stress you out.

252
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Just leave.

253
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,286
It's been a long day.

254
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,400
It's alright.

255
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,513
Spending time with you
has wiped away all my fatigue.

256
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,120
Why's that?

257
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,065
Well, all your complaints were worse.

258
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,840
Hey, Love!

259
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,823
I'm leaving.

260
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,235
It's about to rain.

261
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,410
Right? I'm leaving, then.

262
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,312
- Mm.
- Bye-bye.

263
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,871
See you.

264
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,815
I'll let you keep my shoes, then.

265
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,820
Can you keep my heart, too?

266
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,273
That's funny.

267
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Leave now!

268
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,970
Fine.

269
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,680
- Text me when you're home.
- Okay.

270
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,920
Don't get into an accident, you naughty.

271
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,560
Okay.

272
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,120
By the way, Rain.

273
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,760
Thank you for your smile today.

274
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,040
[I'm home, Rain; are you going to bed now?]

275
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,520
"I'm about to.

276
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,324
What is it?"

277
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:33,160
[I'm about to; what is it?]

278
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,920
"Just wanted to say sleep tight."

279
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,240
"If you do dream,

280
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,253
please dream about me."

281
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,975
"You silly kiddo!"

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,600
[You silly kiddo!]

283
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Can I come in?

284
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Sure, Mom.

285
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,185
You haven't taken a shower?

286
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,965
Here's some milk.

287
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,960
- Thanks.
- Place it down.

288
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,490
Let me see your face.

289
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,200
Whoa, what a happy face.

290
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,830
'Cause you're in love, right?

291
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,040
Stop it, Mom!

292
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,219
Don't stop me. You look so happy.

293
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,427
How was your day? Good?

294
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,590
Well,

295
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,361
it was alright.

296
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,520
That's nice.

297
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,250
Anyway,

298
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,710
do you think she likes me?

299
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,200
Can I be frank?

300
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,760
How would I know?

301
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,637
Come on, Mom.

302
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,800
Honey, when you love someone,

303
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,012
just ask them if they have feelings for you.

304
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,598
You can't ask me.

305
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,248
Hey, I need to catch up on my favorite series.

306
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,735
Don't stay up late.

307
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,600
Take a shower and drink the milk, okay, goofball?

308
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,900
- Okay.
- Give me a kiss.

309
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,673
- Night-night.
- Night-night.

310
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,114
The first customer comes at 9 A.M.

311
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,447
Okay. Got it.

312
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
And this is...

313
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,384
a sandwich for you.

314
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,637
Thank you.

315
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,200
[3 hours later]

316
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

317
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,400
Our admin will let you know
the aftercare via our chat later.

318
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,880
Okay.

319
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,471
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

320
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,521
- Take care of your tattoo.
- Okay.

321
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,687
Am I using you?

322
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,050
You're tricking me into loving you.

323
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,333
You're fake sleeping?

324
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,483
No. I was sleeping,

325
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,208
but your perfume woke me up.

326
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,948
You kiddo.

327
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,520
I'm 26, not a kid!

328
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,914
That's still a kid to me.

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,228
Don't you like someone younger?

330
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,760
I do, but...

331
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,400
not the one that flirts too much.

332
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,160
That hurts.

333
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,863
It's okay. I can bear it.

334
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,430
Tired?

335
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,153
You're going home late.

336
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,520
Are your dad fine with that?

337
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,075
Yeah.

338
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,020
You can leave now.

339
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
I'll finish all of these.

340
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,042
You're not coming with me?

341
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,065
No, I'm occupied.

342
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,320
Deane, sorry I'm late.

343
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,480
I've just finished the meeting at work.

344
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,936
It's okay.

345
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,781
Come take a seat, kiddo.

346
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,928
What tattoo are you getting?

347
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,980
Well...

348
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,360
I'll leave that to you.
I just want your design.

349
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,475
Sure.

350
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,520
Wait a moment.

351
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,953
No, I'm not leaving.

352
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,920
I'll stay.

353
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,040
You're off work now. I'm not paying you overtime.

354
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,680
It's okay. I just want to stay.

355
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,141
Why?

356
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,842
Well, I'll finish up the accounting records.

357
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,042
Are you sure it's just that

358
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,409
and not something else?

359
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,800
Well...

360
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,907
What if it's something else?

361
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,280
You're actually pretty scary
when you get jealous.

362
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,200
I'll do my job now.

363
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Put this on.

364
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,898
Does it hurt?

365
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,621
Not at all.

366
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,360
Your touch is so soft and gentle
as everyone says.

367
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,501
"As everyone says"? Who are they?

368
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,010
I'm not telling you.

369
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,840
Alright.

370
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,309
Get home safely, kiddo.

371
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,133
I can't give you a lift today.

372
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,219
Have to deal with something.

373
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
It's okay.

374
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,260
I'll text you when I'm home.

375
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,404
That should be mine.

376
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,123
Sorry?

377
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,920
"Text me when you're home."

378
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,489
It should be from me.

379
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Come on!

380
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,360
Alright, get home safely.

381
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,925
- Okay.
- Let me know when you're there.

382
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,274
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

383
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,933
"Text me when you're home."

384
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,290
"Bye-bye."

385
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,360
Jeez.

386
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,680
"Kiddo."

387
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,040
What's up with you?

388
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,400
What's with your hair?

389
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,200
You were eavesdropping on us?

390
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,813
I wasn't.

391
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,426
I was paying attention

392
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,200
to every detail you said.

393
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,910
You jealous?

394
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,735
I am.

395
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,328
Can I?

396
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:29,721
I am independent

397
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:32,309
and not ready to be taken.

398
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:35,126
If you don't want to get hurt,

399
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:38,269
don't cross the line.

400
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:45,507
Does it hurt so bad?

401
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,400
I'd like to try it.

402
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Go home.

403
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,640
- Ouch!
- Now.

404
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,640
I'll give you a lift.

405
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,744
Come on.

406
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,736
Fine.

407
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:00,793
- Don't forget anything.
- You kept me waiting.

408
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,160
You took forever!

409
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,880
Well, I'm done.

410
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,438
- We're not turning off the lights?
- I'll ask the housemaid to do it.

411
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:09,120
Let's go.

412
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,817
You're home, miss.

413
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
You're not coming in?

414
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,334
I don't have cats.

415
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,800
You can just look at me.

416
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,886
I'm afraid I won't get to just "look" at you.

417
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,122
Here.

418
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,120
Fine.

419
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,074
Let me know when you change your mind.

420
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,985
You kiddo!

421
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,880
Fine. I'm leaving.

422
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,891
Drive safely.

423
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,929
When you're home,

424
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,720
don't text me. It's not my business.

425
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
Bye. Boo!

426
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,480
Woosh!

427
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,520
Deane! It's meal time!

428
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,320
I got us a lot of stuff today.

429
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,080
Would you like to have the soy milk or me?

430
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,122
Hello! Good morning!

431
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,520
Your "I-miss-you" sandwich is here.

432
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,600
Your sweet soy milk is here!

433
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Come and have a meal.

434
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,480
Come on!

435
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,960
Come here.

436
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,863
Deane, I'm exhausted
from replying to our customers.

437
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,320
Can you recharge me with a big hug?

438
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,440
Please!

439
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
That's love.

440
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,299
Without pain, disappointment, or heartbreak,

441
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,050
it's not love.

442
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,125
I'm sorry, Pat.

443
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,162
I'm not ready to be in love.

444
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Maybe I'm already in love,
but I just don't know it yet.

445
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,657
"Bubble milk tea..."

446
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,392
I'm here.

447
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,840
Is it so hard to be on time?

448
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,200
It is very hard.

449
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,914
You seem busy these days.

450
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
What's going on?
You're always nowhere to be found.

451
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,640
Well, everything's fine. I'm always home.

452
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
Liar!

453
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,480
Can't you keep your voice down?

454
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,044
We're not that far.

455
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,487
Love,

456
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,875
you look pretty suspicious

457
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,930
and seem to have your head in the clouds.

458
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,028
Don't tell me...

459
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
you're in love.

460
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:10,772
Yeah.

461
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Seriously?

462
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,560
I was just guessing.

463
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,153
- Let me see!
- No.

464
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:16,680
Hey, come on.

465
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,542
You can't.

466
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,878
- I mind it.
- Mind what?

467
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,473
They say if your friend sees your crush,

468
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
you won't succeed.

469
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,574
And you're single.

470
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,528
You'll tell everything to Wawa.

471
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,200
Suit yourself, then.

472
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,045
When you're heartbroken, don't ever call us.

473
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,315
Gosh, come on.

474
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,120
I'll tell you when she's my girlfriend.

475
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,600
Anyway, I'm meeting Wawa today.

476
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,880
We're finding our targets.

477
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,959
Wanna join us?

478
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,415
No.

479
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,571
I'm behaving myself,

480
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,996
trying to be nice.

481
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,517
You two should go.

482
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,436
Fine.

483
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,360
You'll get hurt if you're too confident
right from the start.

484
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Got it.

485
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,760
You're late. Catch up on your work.

486
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,557
Let me see.

487
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,411
What is it?

488
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,490
Bubble milk tea. Read.

489
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,099
"Dreamy Bubble Milk Tea."

490
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,471
I see. It's milk tea.

491
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,680
[The rainbow of Rainy in my heart]

492
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,106
"The rainbow of Rainy in my heart"?

493
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,280
You kiddo!

494
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,400
[You kiddo!]

495
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,825
"You don't like it?"

496
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,640
[You don't like it?]

497
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,300
"No."

498
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,334
"Aw, don't you find it cute?"

499
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,960
[Aw, don't you find it cute?]

500
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,457
"I'm not 'Rainy in my heart.'"

501
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,200
[I'm not "Rainy in my heart"]

502
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,217
"Then, can you love me in your heart?"

503
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,080
[Then, can you love me in your heart?]

504
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,320
"Stop joking."

505
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,280
[Stop joking]

506
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,280
"What if I'm not joking?"

507
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,720
[What if I'm not joking?]

508
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,960
"You're jiggling, then."

509
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,400
[You're jiggling, then]

510
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,520
"Whoa, what a joke."

511
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,600
[Whoa, what a joke]

512
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,937
"Why? Do I look so mad all the time?"

513
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,640
[Why? Do I look so mad all the time?]

514
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,000
"I'd rather not talk about that."

515
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,960
[I'd rather not talk about that]

516
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,200
"We'll see!"

517
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,200
[We'll see!]

518
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,600
"Are you free tomorrow?"

519
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,680
[Are you free tomorrow?]

520
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,640
"Well, it depends on who's asking."

521
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,720
[Well, it depends on who's asking]

522
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,160
"If it's me, are you free?"

523
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,760
[If it's me, are you free?]

524
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,240
"It depends on the activity, too."

525
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,960
[It depends on the activity, too]

526
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,520
"Let's have a meal together."

527
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,720
[Let's have a meal together]

528
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,480
"Mm..."

529
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,720
[Mm...]

530
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,161
"Alright, then. You're coming."

531
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,080
"I'll pick you up at your place tomorrow at 10 A.M."

532
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
[I'll pick you up at your place tomorrow at 10 A.M.]

533
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,440
"I didn't say yes!"

534
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,640
[I didn't say yes!]

535
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,120
"You said 'Mm...' It's a yes for me."

536
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,600
[You said "Mm..." It's a yes for me]

537
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,560
Don't be late. Don't ditch me.

538
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,000
Sleep tight.

539
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,071
"You can dream

540
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,240
about me, though."

541
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,080
[You can dream of me, though]

542
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,512
She's forcing me.

543
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,659
I don't wanna come!

544
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,114
Gosh,

545
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,800
your aura's taking up the whole place.

546
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,933
'Cause I'm pretty, slaying, and shining!

547
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,760
- There's one more.
- What is it?

548
00:31:30,857 --> 00:31:31,680
Weird!

549
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,748
Jeez, you bitch!

550
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,403
I'll keep your mouth shut.

551
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Stop it.

552
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,549
So, where's Love?

553
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,409
Where can she be?

554
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,436
When a friend's gone, that means...

555
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,840
She has a boyfriend?

556
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,629
Come on, Wawa. You're making no sense.

557
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,640
A girlfriend?

558
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,600
Yeah. I think so.

559
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,600
She's always on her phone, smiling.

560
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,560
Do you know who she is?

561
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,294
Oops.

562
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,465
I don't.

563
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,525
Jeez, you were getting my hopes up.

564
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,200
I think her name has something to do with the sky.

565
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,758
The sky? Who?

566
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,600
Like, Birdie, Robin, or Phoenix?

567
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,040
Is one of them correct?

568
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,800
Girl, she'll tell us when she's ready.

569
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,719
Just you wait.

570
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,080
Let me know as soon as you know it.

571
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
- Obviously.
- Cheers.

572
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,880
You're always so curious.

573
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,528
Cheers to our friendship.

574
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,127
It's not so fun without Love.

575
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,880
It'll be just the two of us from now on.

576
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,741
Who's gonna treat us, then?

577
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,725
Gosh, Rain.

578
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,476
What have you done?

579
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,080
You're not going on a date!

580
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,480
Is it a date?

581
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,305
You know how to be punctual now?

582
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,360
I know you don't like it when I'm late.
That's why.

583
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,960
Make sure you do this at work, too.

584
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,759
Is it just us?

585
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,405
Yeah. Are you okay with that?

586
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,124
Well...

587
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,857
"Well"?

588
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,681
Why don't you invite the others, too? It's odd.

589
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,231
Odd?

590
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,557
How odd?

591
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,755
- It's...
- "It's..."

592
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,800
It's like a date.

593
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,280
If you think it's a date,

594
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,172
then this is our third date.

595
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,895
Just go now. I'm hungry.

596
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,360
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

597
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
I'll do it myself.

598
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,440
I'm here!

599
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,840
- Let's have...
- Let's go.

600
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,070
Where to?

601
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,610
Are you closed today?

602
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,080
Yeah, I don't feel so good.

603
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,875
Are you ill? What's wrong?

604
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,760
Want a pill? Are you okay?

605
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,600
Let's eat something and take a pill.

606
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,695
It's okay.

607
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,560
That won't help.

608
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,635
I'd rather have something else.

609
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,057
Deane.

610
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,327
Don't joke with me.

611
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,546
I want...

612
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,098
Go ahead and do it.

613
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,444
I'm serious.

614
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,160
- Ouch!
- You should play hard to get.

615
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,554
I don't need to,

616
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,691
or I'll miss a chance.

617
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,542
Whatever. Let's go.

618
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,880
Where to?

619
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,240
Just go.

620
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,480
- Where to?
- Come on. You'll know it.

621
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,336
Come on. Go.

622
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,760
Where are we going?!

623
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,364
You'll know it. Let's go.

624
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,513
Come on.

625
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,201
Come on in.

626
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,495
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

627
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Have a seat.

628
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,874
What?

629
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,240
Why are you sitting here?

630
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,680
I just want to.

631
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,280
No, it's not comfortable.

632
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,615
I'll move to that side.

633
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,480
Hey, no. Let's just sit together.

634
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,052
I don't like to be alone.

635
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:00,960
Please.

636
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,264
Mm.

637
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,019
- May I serve your water, miss?
- Sure.

638
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,538
Thank you.

639
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,143
Here's your water.

640
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
Thank you.

641
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,895
Whoa.

642
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Thank you.

643
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,080
Do you want black pepper?

644
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,148
No.

645
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,320
What about chili sauce and ketchup?

646
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:37,347
Yes.

647
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,320
Here you go.

648
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,240
Can you cut it?

649
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,160
Want me to do it for you?

650
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,080
It's okay. I can do it.

651
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,493
Okay.

652
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,513
I can just do nothing now.
She's doing everything for me.

653
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,516
What's on your mind?

654
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,800
Nothing.

655
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,120
Rain.

656
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,218
Just a second.

657
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,422
Why are you giving it to me?

658
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,599
They say we often share our favorites
with someone we like.

659
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,240
Is it good?

660
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,422
- I haven't had it yet.
- I see.

661
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:44,713
So? Good?

662
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,671
Really?

663
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,000
- It's good.
- You like it?

664
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,587
- The steak?
- Yeah.

665
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,000
Just finish your dish.

666
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,237
This kid.

667
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,846
So pretty.

668
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,520
You're taking me on a date without telling me?

669
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
Who said it's a date?

670
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,890
I'm just taking you here.

671
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,879
Are you done now?

672
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,040
I'm hungry.

673
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,438
- This way.
- Oh.

674
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
I'm hungry!

675
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,040
- Let's eat.
- Fine.

676
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:23,319
What should we eat?

677
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
You decide.

678
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,431
- Whoa.
- I'm fine with anything.

679
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,859
So many options.

680
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,365
Let's go for shabu-shabu.

681
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,185
Won't we be too full?

682
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,295
Too full?

683
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,440
What about sushi?

684
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,320
I just had it.

685
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,923
You just had it?

686
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,989
Then, let's go for ramen.

687
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,308
- But it's hot.
- Deane!

688
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,000
- What?
- You said you were fine with anything!

689
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,747
I am. You can decide. Anything.

690
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,960
Anything means...

691
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,520
nothing!

692
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,516
So,

693
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,240
eat me.

694
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,751
Nom-nom.

695
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,400
Can I?

696
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
You won't get enough of me.

697
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,251
So, what do you wanna eat?

698
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,177
I'm hungry.

699
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Ice cream?

700
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,374
It's hot out here.

701
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,628
Uh...

702
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,520
No need to think.

703
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,960
Just follow me.

704
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,940
- Let me see.
- What do you want?

705
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,016
- Milk.
- Chocolate and milk, please.

706
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,449
Took you so long!

707
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,520
- Well, I'm fine with anything.
- You're so picky!

708
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,440
"Anything," but...

709
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,518
We're having ice cream now.

710
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,364
What?

711
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,537
Plaster art!

712
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,896
I wanna paint it.

713
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,480
Okay. Let's go.

714
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,690
You forgot your bag.

715
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And your phone. Let's go.

716
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,640
Let's go.

717
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,074
Rain, let's do this.

718
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,332
Come on.

719
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,181
- No, I don't know how.
- Come on. It'll only take a few minutes.

720
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,730
Love, I don't want to.

721
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Just a few minutes.

722
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,153
You know how to do it?

723
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,730
No.

724
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,870
What?

725
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,491
Here. Give it a shot.

726
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,090
Give me your bag.

727
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
How do I hold it?

728
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,349
Hold it here.

729
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,602
Watch your hand.

730
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,270
Here.

731
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,040
Aim it at the doll.

732
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Which color do you want?

733
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,200
It's fine. I can do it.

734
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,640
Here, in case you hurt yourself.

735
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,872
- I'll do it.
- Okay, then.

736
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,209
Show me.

737
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,800
Love!

738
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,892
I got it!

739
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,071
Good job!

740
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,480
Excuse me. She hit that one.
Can you pick it up for us?

741
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,560
- Aww.
- Aww, thank you!

742
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,800
I'm over the moon!

743
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,320
Love, can you shoot one for me?

744
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,680
- Are you sure?
- Quickly!

745
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,480
Alright.

746
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,400
Love!

747
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,640
- Almost!
- You missed it.

748
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,200
- I want the pink one.
- Whoa.

749
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
You're choosing the color, too?

750
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
The pink one.

751
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,057
I missed it.

752
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,850
Will I get it?

753
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,920
You can do it.

754
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
- I missed it.
- You couldn't.

755
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,840
I hit the pink one.

756
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,954
- Hey!
- Whoa!

757
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,324
- It's your turn, Rain.
- Sure thing!

758
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,207
Hey,

759
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,400
do people your age
know about this activity?

760
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,622
Of course.

761
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,680
So,

762
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,080
you're pretty old.

763
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:55,153
Hey!

764
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,200
I'm not as old as you.

765
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,524
So cute!

766
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
- Here.
- Is it cute?

767
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,283
It is.

768
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,439
The figurine.

769
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,953
You can't just give me a compliment, can you?

770
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,802
So, you can keep it.

771
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,280
Why me?

772
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,720
Well...

773
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,138
It's a gift from me... on our first date.

774
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,384
Nonsense.

775
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,440
Who said it's a date?

776
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,840
Someone's in denial.

777
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,044
It's done.

778
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,181
What?

779
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,120
I wanna do that!

780
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,300
- The claw machines?
- Yes!

781
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,993
I want them!

782
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,880
Take me there, please!

783
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,284
Okay. What about this one?

784
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,480
Miss, can we leave our figurine here
for a few minutes?

785
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,485
Please pack it in a bag.
We'll take it later.

786
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:51,795
Alright.

787
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,100
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hold on.

788
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,000
- Hurry!
- Okay. Let's go.

789
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,360
Come on, Rain.

790
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,588
- What is this?
- Let's grab some dolls.

791
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
You like it?

792
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,139
Yeah, I do.

793
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
I like it a lot.

794
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,089
Nonsense.

795
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,964
Come on, Rain.

796
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,360
Give it a shot.

797
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,414
The next thing you know, you might be addicted.

798
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,400
No. I'd rather spend the money
on buying something else.

799
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,663
Both require money,
but the other way can guarantee me an item.

800
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,487
It's not the same.

801
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,960
Both require money,

802
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,245
but this one also requires effort and patience.

803
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,153
Wanna try?

804
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,384
Why do we have to make it so hard?

805
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,520
It's not hard

806
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,040
if you put in your effort.

807
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,598
Give it a shot.

808
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,264
Come on.

809
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,434
Here.

810
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,880
Let's give it a try.

811
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,600
It's a lot of fun.

812
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,458
What a waste of money.

813
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,693
Up higher.

814
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,456
There. Try it now.

815
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,520
Aw.

816
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,360
- See?
- That was close!

817
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,600
That was really close.

818
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,263
Let's do it again.

819
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,710
I have a lot more.

820
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,475
Here.

821
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:17,892
Hand it over.

822
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,423
I will never give up.

823
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,040
Watch me, Love.

824
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,682
Okay.

825
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,421
You can do it this time.

826
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,320
Yay!!

827
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,520
Well done, Rain!

828
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,040
- Good job! You're amazing.
- Let me grab it!

829
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,396
Let me see.

830
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,682
Isn't it adorable?

831
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
It really is.

832
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,080
Thanks for taking me out for some fun.

833
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,157
You don't need to thank me.

834
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,648
It's not my duty.

835
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,163
I just want to do it for you.

836
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,741
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

837
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,678
What's going on between you?

838
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,978
What are you celebrating?
You didn't tell me.

839
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,353
We're not celebrating.

840
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,958
- I'm just taking her to...
- We just ran into each other.

841
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,080
So you took her here or what?

842
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
Give me the same answer.

843
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,720
And you?

844
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,390
Why are you with Pat?

845
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,576
So, are things great?

846
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,200
It's my business.

847
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,129
- Fine.
- I just took her out

848
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,324
to see if there's something interesting.

849
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,679
Interesting...

850
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200
Her?

851
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,593
Hey, come here.

852
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,921
Stop talking.

853
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,280
I can just talk about you guys forever.

854
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,000
Got it?

855
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,460
I gave up, pal.

856
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,882
- Okay.
- Good job.

857
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,643
And where are you headed next?

858
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,551
- We'll head back to the shop.
- What?

859
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,528
- What?
- What about my dolls?

860
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,376
I'm no longer in the mood.

861
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,354
Let's just leave.

862
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,531
- Bye.
- Deane!

863
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,950
Love, you troublemaker!

864
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,080
Goodbye, Rain.

865
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,323
Deane, wait up!

866
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,440
Leave?

867
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,000
Why?

868
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,156
Nothing. I just want to leave.

869
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,400
No.

870
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,520
Why couldn't you tell them
we're here together?

871
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,400
Why did I need to? It's nothing.

872
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,722
If it's nothing, why couldn't you just say it?

873
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,343
- Is something wrong?
- No.

874
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,920
I have nothing to do with it.

875
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,840
Fine, then.

876
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,113
What?

877
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,045
Why are you upset?

878
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,000
They'll misunderstand

879
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,640
that we have feelings for each other.

880
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,364
You don't, but I do.

881
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,468
You couldn't tell?

882
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,520
Were you just pretending not to know?

883
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,514
What do you mean?

884
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,480
This.

885
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,436
What do you mean by "this"?

886
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,986
I'm into you.

887
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,360
I like you, Rain.

888
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,680
Don't joke with me, Love.

889
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,880
I don't have time for this.

890
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,480
And what's with your life?

891
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,396
What's with my life?

892
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,320
Look, I got suspended from work
despite all the hard work I put in.

893
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,760
My ex-boyfriend cheated on me with a colleague
who constantly insults and belittles me!

894
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,540
I've been trying to figure out
what I did wrong to deserve this.

895
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,107
You did nothing wrong.

896
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,793
That's right.

897
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,759
I did nothing wrong.

898
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,040
So why do I deserve this?

899
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,360
Why do I always have to be
the one hurting and in pain?

900
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,640
Rain.

901
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,201
So,

902
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,952
I don't have time to love anyone.

903
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,840
I don't even know how to love myself.

904
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,400
You won't understand me.

905
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,120
Just let me help you.

906
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,600
Let me love you.

907
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,320
If you can't love yourself,

908
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,480
please take the love I have for you.

909
00:49:33,946 --> 00:49:35,473
(Next Episode)
You caught a cold from me?

910
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,640
I'm not sure about that,

911
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,206
but I think...

912
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,559
I'm addicted to you.

913
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,400
You followed me here, didn't you?

914
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,451
I've been tracking you by GPS.

915
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,560
I'm not toying with your feelings.

916
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,290
I can wait for you my whole life.

917
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,633
It's like everything stops,

918
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,961
and you've been the only one I see.

919
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,267
It was just sex.
I don't have to tell you everything.

920
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,840
Is it fun

921
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,520
toying with my feelings?
