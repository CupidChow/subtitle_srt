(Previously) Your smile has wiped away
all the tears you've shed.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,465
I'm always here for you.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,720
I'd like to cancel all the projects
I assigned to Rain.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,480
Sure.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,811
Rain, oops.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,240
Rain, you bitch.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,715
Let go of your past.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,198
You deserve a better lover.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,484
Give yourself a chance.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,901
Just because you've had
bad love a hundred times,

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,715
that doesn't mean the
next one will be bad as well.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,181
Love is like taking risks.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,951
At the very least, you get
to love someone, though.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,040
I want to die!

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,440
- No!
- No!

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,160
- No!
- Stop it!

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,240
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,080
For being mean to you that day.

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,320
I'll prove it to you.

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,080
I'll prove that I'm serious with you.

Come on.

42

I'm hungry.

43

Can't I just eat?

44
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
Just go find something to eat then.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,807
Usually, someone does that for me.

46
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,907
This is not usual.

47
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,752
I'm finding a way to make it normal again.

48

- Dean, help me please!

49

You're better now?

- I miss you so much.
- That's enough!

53
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,960
That's enough, no need to kiss.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,280
Well, well.

55
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,360
Just a bit, can't I?

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
And what do you want to consult with me?

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,058
Tell me.

- Anything you cook for me.
- But it's burnt.

No worries. Anything you cook is delicious.

- It's okay.
- Mmm...

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,525
I'll go get a mop.

Let me get a mop.

Okay?

81
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Jeez, it happened again.

82

Certainly, no.

I missed it again, didn't I?

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I ruined it...

87
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,680
It's okay.

88
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,925
That's the story.

89
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,240
Hey, I have a question.

90
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,833
Are you asking for advice
or just flexing?

91
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm here for your advice, of course!

92
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Can't you see?

93
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,200
I can't and don't want to.

94
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,040
No!

95
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,440
Don't you see that every time we try,

96
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,874
there's always something in our way!

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,680
Why so?

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't get it.

99
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,920
Or Rain is not really ready for that?

100
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,560
Maybe.

101
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,838
In the past, she has been through a lot.

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,286
But I never forced her!

103
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,618
Umm...

104
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,840
Whatever!!

105
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,920
- That always happens.
- Hey.

106
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,720

I'm not feeling good at all.

111
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,398
What should I do?

112
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,760
About what?

113
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,241
What are you talking about?
I'm not following!

114
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,280
Of course, it's about Love.

115
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,405
What should I do?

116
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,938
About Love...

117
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,210
What did she do?

118
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,557
Did she do something to you, sis?

119
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,760
Why didn't we get to fourth base yet?

120

Something gets in our way
every single time!

121

Why is it so hard to make love?

122
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,720
What should I do?

123
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,901
Oh, Rain. Come here.

I'm so sorry.

129
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,640
Are you in so much pain?

130
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,600
Rain, it's okay.

131
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,928
I'll dress the wound for you.

132
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,902
Hurry up.

133
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,162
Are you asking for attention?

134
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,480
Is it fun?

135
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,400
It is.

136
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,512
Is it as fun as being with me?

137
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,048
Nothing beats that.

138
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,360
- Really?
- Yes.

139
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Wanna read it together?

140
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,928
I can't see you clearly.

141
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,806
Clearer now?

142
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,640
Ouch...

143
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,739
Love!

144
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,532
Are you okay?

145
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,120
I'll get you next time.

146
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,080
Don't say that.

147
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,284
Get our hopes up.

148
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,971
Love!

149
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,695
Sis!

150
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Seriously,

151
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,600
do you really want to make love with Love?

152
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,800
I surely do!

153
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,760
Okay, I can see it in your eyes.

154
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,559
Or she just doesn't?

155
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,198
- Hmm.
- I'm not sexy enough?

156
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
My arms are chubby?

157
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,029
My legs are chunky?

158
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,760
Or it has something to do
with my small boobs?

159
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,153
I don't... think so.

160
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,997
You two are identical!

161
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,536
Identical what?

162
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,198
I mean, you and Love.

163
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,908
You both want to...

164
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,228
but it just doesn't happen!

165
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,400
Am I right?

166
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
Why did you know?

167
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Love!

168
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,307
Rain!

169
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,920
I couldn't handle it anymore!

170
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,527
Me neither!

171
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,634
Aw, the heaven's teasing you.

172
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,360
Did you guys make a vow somewhere?

173
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,662
Aargh!

174
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,745
- I can't bear it anymore!
- I can't bear it anymore!

175
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,476
- Dean.
- What?

176
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,462
The first customer will come at 10.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,715
10 in the morning.

178
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,008
Roger that, girl.

179
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Have you come to this place before?

180
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,789
Yes.

181
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,529
It's Dean's favorite.

182
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,880
Dean, long time no see!

183
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,840
- Madam.
- Are you dating?

184
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,198
- Huh?
- 3 girlfriends?

185
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,237
Oops, no.

186
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,880
One is more than enough!

187
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,323
Really? Which one?

188
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,840
Guess it.

189
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,115
How well do you know
your regular customer?

190
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
This one is your friend.

191
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,289
Crossed out.

192
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,720
This one seems to be easily annoyed.

193
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,692
You're right about that.

194
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
- So right.
- Crossed out.

195
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,353
This one seems to have a character. Nice.

196
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,546
I think it's her.

197
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,440
You're so good at this.

198
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,879
You deserve this title, madam!

199
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,240
That's wrong.

200
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
- Huh?
- I'm not your girlfriend.

201
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,360
I'm trying to make you be mine.

202
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,472
Wait. You look so familiar.

203
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,904
- Me?
- Yes.

204
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Oh, I know it.

205
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Did you do it?

206
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Do what?

207
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,440
You were crying here, feeling heartbroken,

208
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,320
so I told you to pray
at the shrine for a lover.

209
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,943
Girl!

210
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,644
Stop it before glasses in my club
become broken like your heart.

211
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,608
I'm so sorry.

212
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,940
You seem so drunk.
Are you heartbroken?

213
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,661
Why?

214
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,295
Why did I always attract bad people?

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,213
Life is freaking tough.

216
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,349
Life is uncertain.

217
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,062
You can't be 100% sure of it.

218
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,901
Even my liquor tastes awful some days.

219
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,642
Though it tastes bad,

220
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,600
it's still much better than being tricked.

221
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,283
How can you be so sure
that it doesn't affect me?

222
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:17,629
How can you go around
and justify others' pain?

223
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,716
Pain doesn't stay forever.

224
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,666
One day, you might find someone
who makes you happy.

225
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,597
Like I do.

226
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
This is what lifts my heart.

227
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,133
Well.

228
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,492
If you want a lover,
go pray at the shrine at the back.

229
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,462
Lots of students get ones.

230
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,560
Love ones?

231
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Diseases.

232
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,320
I'm just kidding. Lovers, for sure!

233
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,920
Then why don't you pray it for yourself?

234
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,840
Why should I do that for a headache?

235
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,934
You're right!

236
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,680
Being single isn't that bad, though.

237
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,765
It feels better this way, right?

238
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,615
Listen.

239
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,538
Pain isn't something
we should be afraid of.

240
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,120
It's something we need to face.

241
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,160
Though you don't love anyone,
pain still comes around.

242
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,120
Hey.

243
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Hey! Hey! Hey!

244
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,370
Make one more shot of this for her.

245
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
It's on the house,

246
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,993
okay?

247
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:33,033
- Thank you, madam.
- Alright, I'll be back.

248
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,800
So did you get a lover?

249
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,418
Is she?

250
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,160
Spill it.

251
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,530
Is she your girlfriend?

252
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,047
Am I right?

253
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,920
You really can tell?

254
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,560
Sacred things are magical.

255
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,199
You're designated to have one.

256
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,640
Should I go vow for one?

257
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm so jealous seeing couples!

258
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,467
Don't forget to redeem your vow to the God.

259
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,440
The God loves female dancers.

260
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,520
Vow?

261
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,611
Did you make a vow?

262
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,600
I didn't!

263
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Let's get our seats.

264
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,035
Guys!

265
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,714
Have your seat.

266
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,922
Thanks.

267
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,200
Water, please.

268
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,504
Weird. You're not drinking tonight?

269
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,320
Nah, I have someone to take care of.

270
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,280
Can I toast with you?

271
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Sure.

272
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Impressive.

273
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,948
Dean, what are you doing!?

274
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,680
What's wrong?

275
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,400
You kissed me!

276
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,959
Hmmm!

277
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,065
Excuse me, miss.

278
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,160
Are you two at the talking or dating stage?

279
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,480
I can't really tell.

280
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,154
Dating? She doesn't even love me!

281
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,139
Hey.

282
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,520
If I don't love you,
I wouldn't be here, don't you think?

283
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,305
Forgive me, please.

284
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Please.

285
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,080
Please?

286
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,805
Forgive me now.

287
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,573
Please?

288
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,830
Huh?

289
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,880
Okay, are we good now?

290
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,240
Cheers!

291
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,492
Cheers.

292
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,640
Are we all good now?

293
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Yeah?

294
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,640
Watch your steps.

295
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,825
Hold on.

296
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,360
- Are you alright?
- Where to, guys?

297
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
Are you two heading home now?

298
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,160
Let's go home.

299
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Let's head back inside.

300
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,000
We have to leave now.

301
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Shall we continue at my room?

302
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,000
- No, I wanna dance in there!
- This is enough!

303
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,520
I'll bring you home, okay?

304
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,640
- Okay?
- That's not fun at all.

305
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,225
Stop it. You can't even walk normally!

306
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,124
I surely can!

307
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,400
Pat, go home.

308
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,840
- Love!
- Huh?

309
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,120
You have to send my
sister home safely, okie?

310
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,240
Sure.

311
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,000
She's my girlfriend.

312
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,680
- Get home safely, both of you.
- Okay.

313
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm leaving now.

314
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,440
- See you.
- Rain, bye-bye!

315
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,600
Go, go.

316
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,110
Dean... Oh!

317
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Are you alright?

318
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,960
- Let's go home.
- Watch your legs.

319
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Love.

320
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
What's up, good girl?

321
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,200
I think I should go check the shrine.

322
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,931
Okay.

323
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,977
I remember that I didn't
make a vow for a lover.

324
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,000
But I didn't remember what I said...

325
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,755
It's stuck in my head.

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,213
Let's go see it then.

327
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,880
Umm.

328
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,572
Rain, are you okay?

329
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,809
- Alright.
- I'm just a little drunk.

330
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,640
Love!

331
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,280
I recalled it! I walked here
but didn't see the shrine.

332
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,680
There it is, like madam said.

333
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,800
I knew it. I didn't ask for a lover.

334
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,777
My life's shit.

335
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,268
My job's shit.

336
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,578
Even love's shit.

337
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,304
What's wrong with my life?

338
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Just you watch,

339
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
I will never be in love again!

340
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Thunder?

341
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
And strong wind?

342
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,908
That means the heavens heard my plea!

343
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,320
I knew it. I didn't ask for a lover.

344
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
You can recall it now?

345
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,530
I was drunk walking here,

346
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,040
and I said, "Just you watch,
I will never be in love again!"

347
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,241
But now, you have me!

348
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,800
I love you.

349
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,520
Yes, I do have you.

350
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,747
I love you, too!

351
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,772
Drunk Rain is like this, huh?

352
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,005
I am not drunk!

353
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
- Love!
- What?

354
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,202
I don't think that's all I said.

355
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,038
I also said...

356
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,259
May those who want to be a part of my life

357
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,120
be unfitting.

358
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,360
May whatever happens to us

359
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,120
cause us to sever all the ties!

360
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,942
Rain!

361
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,376
I was so mad back then!

362
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,040
What should we do now?

363
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,746
We'll never break up! No breakup!

364
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,360
I'll be with this person!

365
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,263
Love, be serious!

366
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,349
I'm asking holy spirits here.

367
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,880
They may have some mercy on us.

368
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,243
Or should we come back
when you are drunk?

369
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,940
No, that won't work!

370
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,266
I have an idea!

371
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,144
Come with me!

372
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,303
Wait! Where are you heading to?

373
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,240
Home! Alright?

374
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,560
No.

375
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,033
What about the issue here?

376
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,800
You can redeem your vow later.

377
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,277
Let's go to my house. Hurry up!

378
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,760
Why yours?

379
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,165
I think someone can help us fix it.

380
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,280
And that person's at my house.

381
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,048
Hurry up now!

382
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,029
Let's go.

383
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,182
Come.

384
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,993
Let's go.

385
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Pat, you're home now.

386
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
I'm so sorry

387
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,488
for hurting you, unknowingly.

388
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,040
It's just because of my fear.

389
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Are you awake?

390
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,930
Are you okay?

391
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
Be careful.

392
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,664
Pat...

393
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,112
Wait...

394
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,120
Come on.

395
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,840
You're pretty hefty, shawty.

396
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,271
Get some blanket first.

397
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,284
Oh!

398
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,767
Pat!

399
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,000
Can you not leave?

400
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,680
Please stay.

401
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,256
What a naughty girl.

402
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,785
How can you still be so bubbly

403
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,282
after all these things?

404
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,215
Pat!

405
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,080
Can...

406
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,120
Can you not leave?

407
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,160
Please stay.

408
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,728
Pat!

409
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,891
Pat!!

410
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,499
Don't leave me.

411
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,200
Love!

412
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,600
Why did you bring me home this late?

413
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,360
When is it appropriate then?

414
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,960
Any other time?

415
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,760
What will your mom say
if she sees me now?

416
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,200
Rain,

417
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
my mom's already in bed.

418
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,103
She'll wake up again tomorrow morning!

419
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,727
No...

420
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,515
Come, come.

421
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,769
Love, your mom will hear us!

422
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,244
What are you looking at?

423
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:00,640
My girlfriend!

424
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
And so what?

425
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,760
Well...

426
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,842
It totally reflects you.

427
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,254
A lively exterior,

428
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,927
a calm interior

429
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,163
that shows a hint of fear.

430
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,269
If you can read me that clearly,

431
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,599
how can't you read my mind
that says, "I love you"?

432
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,560
This is not a thing we read,

433
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,504
it's a thing we hear from another.

434
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,805
I'm right here.

435
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,876
I love you, Rain.

436
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,142
I love you, too.

437
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,960
Hungry?

438
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
A little.

439
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Nah, your stomach said otherwise.

440
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Wanna eat something?
I'll go make it for you.

441
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,520
At night, we should have...

442
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,697
"We should have..."

443
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,167
Food's served!

444
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,212
Oh, that looks tasty!

445
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,266
You're right.

446
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
But I mean you.

447
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,280
Love!

448
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,880
How was it?

449
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Not bad!

450
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,800
Sure!

451
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,193
Join me.

452
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,905
Alright.

453
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,040
That's delicious!

454
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,000
Noodles?

455
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,320
You!

456
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,920
Go finish yours.

457
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,080
♫ I know it's you when we're close ♫

458
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,779
- ♫The more we talk... ♫
- Love!

459
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,458
Huh?

460
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,400
Who told you to sing while eating?

461
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,329
What's wrong?

462
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,331
You'll get an older girlfriend!

463
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,254
Smiling?

464
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,580
Your smile is so suspicious.

465
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,200
So now, I have an...

466
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,280
Love!

467
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,162
That hurts!

468
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,680
- Awww.
- I'm done with the noodles.

469
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,520
Oh, my love!

470
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,739
- Oh...
- Don't touch me! It hurts!

471
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,320
- Hurt what? Just a touch.
- It hurts.

472
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,171
- Hmmm.
- It hurts.

473
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,280
- Love!
- What?

474
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,309
I'm being mad at you!

475
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,827
I'll love you

476
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,520
for the next 40-50 years.

477
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,387
Please forgive me.

478
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,440
Forgive me.

479
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,954
- Forgive me now.
- Huh?

480
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,396
Huh?

481
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That's me.

482
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,739
Yes.

483
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,920
Why do you have photos of me?

484
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,219
Well, I took them.

485
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,545
But why?

486
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,829
I just liked you,

487
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,840
so I took pictures of you.

488
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,880
Liked?

489
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,514
Yes.

490
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,516
I did like you.

491
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,240
I really do like you!

492
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Thanks.

493
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
What is that for?

494
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,920
Thanks for being with me until now.

495
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,720
Bas! Don't leave me.

496
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,120
- I can give you anything...
- Let go of me!

497
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,626
Pretend you didn't see me.

498
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,800
But...

499
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,640
Please just walk past me

500
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,080
as if no one's here.

501
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,040
It's raining again.

502
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,279
It's your chance.

503
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,600
Comfort her.

504
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
I better not.

505
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,223
Let the rain continue.

506
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,831
I don't think it's a good idea
to comfort her now.

507
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:03,317
I'm sorry, Rain.

508
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,573
I'm happy to meet you again.

509
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,462
I promise to always bring you a smile.

510
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,720
I'm protecting you from rain

511
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,073
so that you don't get soaked alone.

512
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,720
You can just cry.

513
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
I can't hear you.

514
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,140
Be as loud as you want.

515
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
Just please let me be
right here by your side.

516
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,600
Why are you so kind?

517
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,320
I'm always mean to others.

518
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,271
It's alright.

519
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,202
I'll be kind to you.

520
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,633
I'm not toying with your feelings.

521
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,623
I can wait for you my whole life.

522
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,680
It felt like...
everything stopped,

523
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,962
and you've been the
only one I see ever since.

524
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,359
It's nothing to be thanked for.

525
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,209
That's something I've wanted to do.

526
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,720
And I can finally do it.

527
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,920
Eh?

528
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
I have something to show you.

529
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,897
Come with me.

530
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,216
- Where to?
- Just follow me.

531
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,267
Come on.

532
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,920
This is my favorite spot!

533
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,546
I've never shared it with anyone.

534
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,763
Why are you sharing it with me now?

535
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,924
You're my girlfriend, Rain.

536
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,008
The sky's so beautiful.

537
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,385
Umm.

538
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,482
Right.

539
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,819
So pretty.

540
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
Magnificent.

541
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,037
We'll overcome all the things

542
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,157
we've been through together.

543
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,121
I'll be right here for you as always.

544
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,780
Thank you for being here at the right time.

545
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,937
Umm.

546
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Let's ask my mom for some advice

547
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
on what we should do tomorrow.

548
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,199
She's such an expert!

549
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,398
I won't give up on you

550
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,508
when we've still not done that!

551
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,608
Love!

552
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,560
I'm just kidding!

553
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,791
You kiddo!

554
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,097
I can't really give up on you!

555
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,720
Me neither!

556
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,658
Your quota is full.

557
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,117
It's full now?

558
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,000
Please. Please.

559
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,300
Dean, is that you?

560
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,747
Not me then who?

561
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,479
Here you are.

562
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,100
Cold iced milk tea to refresh yourself.

563
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
It's good!

564
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,340
Thank you.

565
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,046
Thought I brought someone else home!

566
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,960
You usually do that?

567
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,706
Hmm?

568
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,880
I'm not telling you.

569
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,372
Come on.

570
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,286
Don't do that, okay?

571
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,760
You have me now.

572
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,472
Don't go get drunk like this

573
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,031
without me!

574
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Get it?

575
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Why should I listen?

576
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,795
I'm worried about you.

577
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,232
You don't need to work today.

578
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,295
Of course.

579
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,160
Naughty kid!

580
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,692
What did I do?

581
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,529
Shall we throw back to that moment?

582
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,520
You're gonna play with my feelings again?

583
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
You know I love you,

584
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,243
so you're gonna smash my love into pieces?

585
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,395
I'm not playing around this time.

586
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,085
Especially, with this.

587
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,418
And it can't be anyone.

588
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,320
Have some food and take some rest.

589
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,572
I'll pick you up.

590
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,600
Where to?

591
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:56,795
You'll know.

592
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,650
What's wrong with her?

593
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,230
You sleep like a child.

594
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,091
Why are you smiling?

595
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,490
I'm smiling for my girl.

596
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,235
You should get up now.

597
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,560
Let's go see your mom.

598
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Come on.

599
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,040
No! One more moment, please!

600
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,440
Don't be a cry-baby. Get up!

601
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,960
Get up now.

602
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,168
Mom, what are you cooking?
Smells so good.

603
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,880
Mom!

604
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,480
Oh?

605
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
What is it?

606
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
The stove's still on.

607
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,320
- Oh, it's all burnt!
- Whoa!

608
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,043
Turn it off first.

609
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,919
Mom!

610
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,240
Is she out to the supermarket?

611
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,209
Usually, she turns the stove off
before leaving.

612
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,710
But this was on.

613
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,000
- I'll go check another room.
- Okay.

614
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,000
Mom!

615
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,968
Love, your mom's not here.

616
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,393
- I'll go check in her room.
- Okay.

617
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Mom!

618
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
Mom!

619
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Auntie!

620
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,680
Love, your mom's here!

621
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Mom!

622
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,624
Rain, where is she?

623
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,037
- Rain, where?
- Hurry up!

624
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,240
- Love!
- Mom!

625
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,654
Mom!!

626
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,780
Mom!

627
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,760
Mom, are you okay?

628
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,440
- Mom! Mom!
- Love, calm down.

629
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,800
Mom, wake up!

630
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,200
Do you hear me?

631
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,640
- Love, calm down.
- Mom!

632
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,140
I'll call the ambulance.

633
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,184
Mom!

634
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,320
Mom!!

635
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,600
- Hello.
- Rain!

636
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,240
- Wake up!
- Someone's fainting.

637
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,678
Mom, wake up now!

638
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,200
- Mom, wake up.
- The patient is female.

639
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,560
Mom, please wake up.

640
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,240
Mom, do you hear me? Mom!

641
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,793
- Okay, thank you.
- Mom, wake up!

642
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,463
- Thank you.
- Mom!

643
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,600
Mom, wake up! Can you hear me?

644
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,040
How would I live without you?!

645
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,840
(Next Episode)
Pat!

646
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,760
Pat, what's wrong?

647
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,905
You can cry.

648
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
You have me.

649
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,680
You're not alone anymore.

650
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,541
If we follow what Mom says, will it work?

651
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,360
What if we can't really do it,

652
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,000
will you break up with me?

653
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:55,032
I just want to be by your side,

654
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,600
where you can always
turn around and see me.
