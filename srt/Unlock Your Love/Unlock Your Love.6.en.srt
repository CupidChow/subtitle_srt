00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,240
(Previously)
Can I be the one for you?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,120
Will you be my girlfriend?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,080
Hi, babe.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,633
It's her ex.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,363
Happy 10th anniversary!

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,251
I love you, babe.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,920
Happy birthday, Deane.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm wishing you all the happiness!

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,880
I can't beat your ex anyway.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,360
What have you done?

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,440
Are you back together?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,880
How could you be this stupid, Pat?

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,623
How could you ask for love
from someone who doesn't want to love you?

[Mata, Pattariyakorn Luangkungwankij]

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,805
Deane.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,480
Yeah?

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
What have you done?

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,060
What's this?

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,897
Are you back together?

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,590
No.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,080
No?

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,200
She's just here to say goodbye.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,491
Things are still the same.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,283
Why are you doing this?

31
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,383
I'm just teasing you.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,920
We're still friends, aren't we?

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,040
Are you...

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
still in love with me?

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,720
Don't do this, Mai.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,880
If you think I still have feelings for you,

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,248
why would you hurt me by doing this?

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,906
Well,

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,298
don't you think it's too mean

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,880
to invite me to your wedding?

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,564
After the wedding, I'm moving to the U.K.

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm here to say goodbye,

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,990
and I also want you to
be with me on that day.

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,837
I'm just scared I'll never see you again.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,324
I also want to be with you,

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,280
but who would I be at the wedding?

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,431
Don't you think you've hurt me enough?

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,160
I can't do what you've asked me to.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,406
I want to see you happy.

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,630
And...

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,381
I'm sorry for being a
terrible lover before.

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,520
What?

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,751
Why did you do that, then?

54
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,897
If you didn't like her, just say so.

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,720
Right.

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,691
You didn't need to ignore her like that.

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,649
Deane,

58
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,822
don't let your past
keep you from finding new love.

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,409
What should I do?

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,414
I know how to love,

61
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,427
but I don't know how to make it last.

62
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,899
Hey,

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,911
we all carry scars to heal from.

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,368
No one can tell you how to cure them.

65
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,653
You have to learn from them yourself.

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah.

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
She's right.

68
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,644
Don't you have feelings for Pat?

69
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,560
All this time,

70
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,680
you weren't serious with her?

71
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,232
It's not like that.

72
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,253
What is it, then?

73
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,395
Why did you do this?

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,783
I don't know.

75
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,929
I don't know what I've done.

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,920
Are you scared?

77
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Scared of what?

78
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,840
Of being hurt like before.

79
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,440
Is it because of me?

80
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm sorry for the pain I gave you.

81
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,440
It wasn't your fault.

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,760
You'd always been a good lover.

83
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
And so what?

84
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm still all by myself.

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,745
I couldn't make anyone stay.

86
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,867
That's not it, Deane.

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
You were trying to make
the wrong person stay.

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,870
The person who didn't want to be with you.

89
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,900
No matter how hard you'd try,

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
I'd still leave you.

91
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,651
How would I know who I should keep?

92
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,834
How can I be in love without fear?

93
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,700
Deane,

94
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,267
listen.

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,040
Just because you've had
bad love a hundred times,

96
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,760
that doesn't mean the
next one will be bad as well.

97
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,316
Love is like taking risks.

98
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,464
It's uncertain,

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,175
uncontrollable,

100
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,840
and unpredictable.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,080
All you can do is try your best.

102
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,800
You might get hurt.

103
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,800
At the very least, you get
to love someone, though.

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,835
Let go of your past.

105
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,958
You deserve a better lover.

106
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,004
Give yourself another chance.

107
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
I gotta go now.

108
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,300
Bye-bye.

109
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,267
Goodbye.

110
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,760
I'll see you later.

111
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Cheers?

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Come on.

113
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,011
You won't stop.

114
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
- Come on.
- Come on.

115
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,120
Let's drink.

116
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,580
Fine.

117
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
So... we're leaving.

118
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Thanks a lot

119
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
to both of you.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,553
No worries.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,160
Remember what we talked about.

122
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
You got this.

123
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay.

124
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,480
- You can wait for me outside, Rain.
- Okay.

125
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,760
Good luck.

126
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Don't try to do something stupid.

127
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,909
Jeez.

128
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,880
What's wrong?

129
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,105
Are you okay?

130
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I don't know.

131
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,815
Are you worried about Pat?

132
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,707
Yeah.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,602
And...

134
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,975
something else, too?

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What is it?

136
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,880
Is it about Arm or work?

137
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,520
Hear me out first.
Don't be sad just yet.

138
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,200
I just want my job back.

139
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,480
And your ex, too?

140
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,566
Look,

141
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,754
I have a gem right before me,

142
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,280
why would I want something I threw away?

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,100
That wasn't enough. Another kiss, please.

144
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
There you go!

145
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,800
Don't press your luck.

146
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Can I eat you?

147
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,640
Love!

148
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,501
Yes?

149
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
I love you, too.

150
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,400
I didn't say I loved you.

151
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,160
You said, "Love!"

152
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Jeez.

153
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,120
Rain,

154
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
about your work,

155
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,057
go give it a shot.

156
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Prove to your boss that you've changed

157
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,530
and you're the perfect fit for your role.

158
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,560
Do you think I can do it?

159
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,720
I believe you can.

160
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,440
If it doesn't work, just try again.

161
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
I'll be right by your side.

162
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,112
So...

163
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,800
let's go home.

164
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,262
Okay.

165
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,635
But...

166
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,041
where should we stay?

167
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,687
At your place?

168
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,200
Why?

169
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,800
Mom's at home.

170
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
You kiddo!

171
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
Come on. Let's go home.

172
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,560
The power went out.

173
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,880
What happened?

174
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,360
Thanks to the plug safety.

175
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:19,280
Right.

176
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,520
It shut the power off.

177
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
- Yeah.
- Right.

178
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,904
So...

179
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,583
Shall we continue?

180
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Continue what?

181
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,520
Well...

182
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,831
You haven't answered me.

183
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,684
This is my answer.

184
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,400
Ouch!

185
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm sorry!

186
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,197
Your hair's in my bracelet.

187
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,440
- It hurts.
- I'm taking it out.

188
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,516
Love!

189
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,920
It won't come out.

190
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,040
Wait, Rain!

191
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,307
Does it hurt?

192
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,782
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

193
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,977
That doesn't hurt badly like feelings.

194
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,418
All done.

195
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,934
Well,

196
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,657
it's not easy to try something yummy.

197
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,520
Don't you think it's weird?

198
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,680
Like...

199
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
How weird?

200
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Forget it.

201
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,200
Anyway,

202
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,430
is it better having me with you?

203
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,369
Mm.

204
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,560
Thus, when it rains,

205
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,310
remember that
I'll always hold an umbrella for you

206
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,100
so that you won't get soaked alone.

207
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,160
Understand?

208
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,581
Thanks, Love.

209
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,953
So, do your best tomorrow.

210
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,526
No matter what,

211
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,919
I'll be right there for you.

212
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,680
Okay?

213
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,320
Let's go to bed.

214
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,235
Let go of your past.

215
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,718
You deserve a better lover.

216
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,004
Give yourself another chance.

217
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,120
Woosh!

218
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,120
Deane! It's meal time!

219
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,000
I got us a lot of stuff today.

220
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,760
Would you like to have soy milk or me?

221
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,842
Hello! Good morning!

222
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,200
Your "I-miss-you" sandwich is here.

223
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,280
Your sweet soy milk is here!

224
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Come and have a meal.

225
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,160
Come on!

226
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,640
Come here.

227
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,543
Deane, I'm exhausted
from replying to our customers.

228
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,960
Can you recharge me with a big hug?

229
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,120
Please!

230
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,173
It was just sex.
I don't have to tell you everything.

231
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,266
Is it fun

232
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,225
toying with my feelings?

233
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,000
Happy birthday, Deane.

234
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,480
I'm wishing you all the happiness!

235
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
I can't beat your ex anyway.

236
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,240
Just because you've had
bad love a hundred times,

237
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,000
that doesn't mean the
next one will be bad as well.

238
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,480
Love is like taking risks.

239
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:29,313
At the very least, you get
to love someone, though.

240
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,920
Oh, Rain.

241
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Are you still working here?

242
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Hello.

243
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,200
I apologize for what I did that day.

244
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,920
As an employee, I sincerely apologize.

245
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,333
But why did it take you so long?

246
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,686
Don't you think it's too late?

247
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,200
Wait, that's right.

248
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,880
If you knew, you wouldn't
have remained just an employee.

249
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,680
I'm really sorry.

250
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,680
Miss Kitty.

251
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,451
So you're finally here. Good.

252
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,880
I'd like to cancel all the projects
I assigned to Rain.

253
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,240
Sure.

254
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,240
So you're firing her?

255
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,880
No, miss.

256
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,040
What?

257
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,485
Why would you keep someone
who knows no manners?

258
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,920
It's up to my decision.

259
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,000
But I'm not okay with this.

260
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,560
It's an internal issue.

261
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,480
Plus, some of the high-quality projects
we submitted were completed by her.

262
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,023
Alright, then.

263
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,280
I'd like to stop working with both of you.

264
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,246
Okay?

265
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,681
Yes, miss.

266
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,560
Boss...

267
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm really sorry for everything.

268
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,160
This, too.

269
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,920
Why would you be sorry for?

270
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
What have you done wrong?

271
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,501
I...

272
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,560
You've done nothing wrong today.

273
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,720
You just lost a client because of me.

274
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
That's totally fine.

275
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,840
If our work's excellent,
clients will return.

276
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,167
I sincerely apologize, Boss.

277
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,106
Alright,

278
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,836
I'll accept your apology

279
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,400
so that you'll feel better.

280
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,200
Okay.

281
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,160
Anyway, I have something to tell you.

282
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
And so do I.

283
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,560
Okay.

284
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,818
You may start first.

285
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,071
Well,

286
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,819
can I have another chance?

287
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,120
After all this time, I've learned so much,
and I'm eager to continue improving myself.

288
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,792
Do you know why I suspended you?

289
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,915
Because I was being
headstrong to the client?

290
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,237
No.

291
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,870
Because you couldn't control yourself

292
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,216
and were self-centered.

293
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,958
Do you know what's the scariest part?

294
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,160
It's being self-centered.
It takes your chances away.

295
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
You're right.

296
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,983
I didn't even listen to you.

297
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,200
I'm really sorry.

298
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,884
From now on,
I promise it will never happen again.

299
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,240
I'm willing to have you back.

300
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,360
You're letting me come back?

301
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,060
I think you've learned from your mistake.

302
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,600
On top of that, we urgently
need a quality employee like you.

303
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,560
- Come here!
- Ouch!

304
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,744
- Fern!
- Let me go!

305
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,760
- Ouch!
- You bitch!

306
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,760
Stop it, Fern!

307
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,000
- Let go of me!
- Fern, Boss is coming!

308
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,440
Don't you have eyes?

309
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,320
What's this?

310
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,680
Well, I do have eyes,

311
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,960
and I've decided that he's the one.

312
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,120
He's mine!

313
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,520
- Fern!
- You can't find yourself one?

314
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,200
You couldn't, either!

315
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,280
It's fun having an affair with
someone taken. You know that.

316
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,240
Botan!

317
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,360
Stop it there.

318
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,200
Don't butt in!

319
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,640
You wanna die or what?

320
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Let go of me now!

321
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,320
If you want me to stay out of this,
submit your resignation letter.

322
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,663
Rain, oops.

323
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,120
Rain, you bitch.

324
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,480
Are you doing great?

325
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,760
Yeah.

326
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,680
Boss, it's not my fault.

327
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,968
She just snatched my hair out of the blue.

328
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,680
Out of the blue?

329
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,975
How could a cheater say that?

330
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:01,720
Your man made the first move.

331
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,560
You bitch!

332
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,080
I said stop right now!

333
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,520
Boss, it's not my fault!

334
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,860
It's not mine, either.

335
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,680
I'm not wrong for tasting better!

336
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,617
You bitch!

337
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,040
If you don't stop, just quit.

338
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,320
Boss, I'd like to go now.

339
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,424
I'll begin my work tomorrow.

340
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,977
Thank you very much.

341
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,913
Right...

342
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,320
Both of you, get a grip

343
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,696
and think if this fight's
worth that man you want.

344
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,480
That trash, Arm.

345
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,920
He doesn't know how to
love anyone but himself.

346
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,440
Both of you, go deal with your business.

347
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,816
If it's not settled,
just don't come here again next month.

348
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
- Boss!
- Boss!

349
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,640
Boss, I apologize on their behalf.

350
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,007
They both didn't mean to make this happen.

351
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,665
I'll give them some lessons,

352
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,120
and I ensure you this won't happen again.

353
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,560
What do you have to do with this?

354
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,300
Nothing, but I don't want
my friends to get fired.

355
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,040
Go back to your work, then.

356
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:19,646
Yes, Boss.

357
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,200
Go back to your work.

358
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,480
What's keeping you here?

359
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,080
How did it go?

360
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,416
Was everything okay?

361
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,778
Yeah, it was.

362
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,600
See? I told you you could get through it.

363
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,241
How did you know that?

364
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
What if I couldn't?

365
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,278
I know you could.

366
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,459
Life is just the weather.

367
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
How?

368
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,158
Unpredictable and unstable?

369
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,244
Yeah, life's unpredictable.

370
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,278
Just like the weather.

371
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,288
Although it's unstable,

372
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,191
it doesn't mean it'll rain forever.

373
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,417
Just like you today.

374
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,560
Your smile has wiped away
all the tears you've shed.

375
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,426
Stop that.

376
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Thanks.

377
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,357
No worries.

378
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,497
It's not a big deal.

379
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,160
Let's take photos.

380
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,520
Don't take a photo of me.

381
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,029
Just get the views.

382
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,320
Alright, then.

383
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
Love!

384
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,040
Stop it.

385
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,211
Come on, that was cute.

386
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Come here.

387
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Are you tired?

388
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,760
- Mm.
- Let me give you a massage.

389
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,040
So?

390
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,787
Does it feel good?

391
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,524
You're kinda good at this.

392
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,336
Well...

393
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,558
Can I get a reward?

394
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,840
What reward?

395
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,485
Well...

396
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Love!

397
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,108
That wasn't for me.

398
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,601
It was for you.

399
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
- A reward for me?
- Yes.

400
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,680
A reward for doing a great job today.

401
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,240
You've finally gone through that hard time.

402
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Thanks.

403
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,285
- Love.
- Hm?

404
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,263
Has Pat been in contact?
She hasn't replied to my text.

405
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
No.

406
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,560
I was about to ask you, too.

407
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,160
I've warned her

408
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,000
to choose someone who wouldn't hurt her.

409
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I don't think Deane meant to do that.

410
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,640
I think she also needs some time

411
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,560
to accept the truth and herself.

412
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,560
I'm worried about Pat.

413
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,120
Should... we go see her tomorrow?

414
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,190
Sure.

415
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,584
Okay.

416
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Stop it.

417
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,740
It's on my nose.

418
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,977
What?

419
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,800
- Love!
- What?

420
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,391
There you go!

421
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,184
Stop it.

422
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,400
This feels so good.

423
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,720
Morning, kiddo.

424
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Morning.

425
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,560
What's for breakfast?

426
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,217
Sandwiches.

427
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,280
Are you hungry?

428
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
A little bit.

429
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,831
Give me a second.

430
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,040
I'll just eat this while waiting.

431
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,099
Stay tuned to try my sandwiches.

432
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,560
I'm sure you'll fall in love with it

433
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,043
just like how you did with me.

434
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,960
Whatever, Love.

435
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,720
Hurry up. I'm starving.

436
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,720
Got it.

437
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,600
Almost done.

438
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,214
Almost there.

439
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Give me a moment.

440
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Alright!

441
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Let me try some.

442
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,240
They look so nice.

443
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,880
- How is it?
- Mmm!

444
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,683
It's so good.

445
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,760
The bread's so soft.

446
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,997
Let me try it.

447
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,049
Whoa,

448
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,720
it's really soft.

449
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,880
Love!

450
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,440
Jeez.

451
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,360
Just kidding.

452
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,193
It's so yummy. Who made that?

453
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,485
You're the best, my Love.

454
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,040
Rain...

455
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,560
What's wrong?

456
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,608
I... want to wake up with you every morning

457
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,498
and see you every day.

458
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,019
Are we on the same page here?

459
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,040
Rain!

460
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,000
That's it. I'm taking a shower.

461
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,480
Let's go see Pat.

462
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,721
Can I join you?

463
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,680
No!

464
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,838
Please.

465
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, yeah.

466
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Hey!

467
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,960
What's with you?

468
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,120
I've been busy.

469
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,840
I've starved for days now.

470
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,619
It's time to go all out!

471
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,600
I can't take care of you today. I'm alone.

472
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,080
I'll just leave you here.
Just so you know.

473
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,760
Love's nowhere to be found again.

474
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,280
She's not here today.

475
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,280
Aw, there's too much love. [I'll be
the source of your smile every day]

476
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,120
You're right.

477
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,520
Who's that? She looks good.

478
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,120
A senior from university days.
She's been her crush for ages.

479
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,480
She's missed so many chances,
but she's going for it this time.

480
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,040
She loves challenging tasks.

481
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,200
Who would be as easy as you?

482
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,555
Gosh, why would you make life complicated?

483
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,640
Just keep it simple.

484
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,560
Breathing alone is already difficult,

485
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,640
just give up if finding
a man is difficult, too.

486
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,360
And do you have a boyfriend?

487
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,280
No,

488
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,200
but I've never been lonely.

489
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,915
- Gosh.
- Oops.

490
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,154
Who's that?

491
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,481
I gotta go now.

492
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,629
I've got a new target.

493
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Wawa!

494
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,320
- You always leave me alone!
- It's your treat.

495
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,356
I need to find myself a boyfriend now.

496
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,240
Oh...

497
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,520
Gosh,

498
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,000
is this a house or a tomb, Pat?!

499
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,660
Love!

500
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,600
Look at her.

501
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,109
What's wrong with you, Pat?

502
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,240
I'll eat until I die!

503
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,160
I'll let soda hurt my stomach,

504
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,000
just like how she hurt my feelings!

505
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,973
Rain, don't!

506
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,525
Fine.

507
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,160
I don't want to see the light.

508
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,600
Just let this love makes me blind.

509
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,554
- You're driving me crazy.
- Love!

510
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,440
Deane's so mean!

511
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,000
Come on, Pat.

512
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,480
You knew how it would end,

513
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:03,546
but you just kept going.

514
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,520
Look at you now.

515
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,240
She's still in love with her ex!

516
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,040
Come on.

517
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,160
She's actually not in love with her ex.

518
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,053
What do you mean?!

519
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,352
She doesn't have feelings for her ex.

520
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,838
She just still can't get over the pain.

521
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,772
We all have scars to heal from.

522
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,480
You just need to get over them.

523
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,455
You can't even do it for yourself.

524
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,304
You both need time to heal from your scars.

525
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,680
Just don't use someone
else to do that for you.

526
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,640
Got it?

527
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:57,880
- Jeez, Pat.
- Jeez.

528
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,720
- Don't cry.
- I wanna die.

529
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Why is it so hard to be in love?

530
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,960
I want to die!

531
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,400
- I don't wanna live anymore.
- Pat!

532
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,600
- No!
- No!

533
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,520
Pat!

534
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,170
- No!
- Stop it!

535
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,398
Hey, stop!

536
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:18,160
- Love!
- Stop it!

537
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,316
Jesus.

538
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
Pat!

539
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,920
Deane?

540
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,560
Please let me in.

541
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,080
It's so hot out here.

542
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,160
Who asked you to be here?

543
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,440
Just leave if it's too hot.

544
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,032
No one did. I just came on my own.

545
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,899
Pat!

546
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,440
It's so hot.

547
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,880
I'm also hungry.

548
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,600
I bought you some food.

549
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,040
Can you please eat with me? I'm starving.

550
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,160
No.

551
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,000
It's so hot out here, Pat.

552
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,811
Please let me in.

553
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,855
No.

554
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,760
Pat!

555
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,160
Ouch.

556
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,180
Deane!

557
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,113
Deane.

558
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
What's wrong?

559
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,876
Deane!

560
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,520
Pat.

561
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
You called me. Did you need anything?

562
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,080
I'm sorry.

563
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,586
You're sorry for what?

564
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,223
For letting me fall for you

565
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,375
or for not liking me back?

566
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,425
For...

567
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,320
being mean to you that day.

568
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,880
I'm sorry.

569
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,256
It's okay if you're still mad.

570
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,160
I'll prove it to you.

571
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Prove what?

572
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,287
Well,

573
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,280
I'll prove that I'm serious with you.

574
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,200
It's not gonna be easy,

575
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,680
'cause I'm not into you anymore.

576
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,213
I'll make you fall for me, then.

577
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,120
Pat!

578
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Are you sure?

579
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,080
Mm.

580
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,320
- Ouch!
- Love!

581
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,281
You're bleeding!

582
00:38:20,321 --> 00:38:21,360
I'll dress the wound for you.

583
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,064
- Are you okay?
- Yes, but...

584
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
I'm missing it again?

585
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,699
Later. Let's dress your wound first.

586
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,492
I'm sorry.

587
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,078
Let me see.

588
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,280
I'm totally fine.

589
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,520
- Love!
- It doesn't hurt.

590
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,720
Just stay still.

591
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,780
- It doesn't hurt. Let's not use it.
- You're bleeding.

592
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,400
- I don't want that.
- Love!

593
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,240
Don't move.

594
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
You kiddo.

595
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,352
See? It's bleeding.

596
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,518
Be gentle.

597
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,536
That's what a stubborn kid deserves.

598
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,969
Love,

599
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,080
just stay still.

600
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,200
Let me finish.

601
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,349
We'll see.

602
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,008
Be gentle, Rain.

603
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
I'll blow the pain away.

604
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,400
Done.

605
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,800
- Love!
- Yes?

606
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,344
That look of yours seems suspicious.

607
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,268
Is it feeling alright?

608
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,187
Yes.

609
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,253
But... I wasn't okay with what happened.

610
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,428
What do you mean?

611
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,280
Shall we finish it up?

612
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,040
Love!

613
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,480
Please.

614
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
- Ouch!
- Ouch!

615
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Are you okay?

616
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,128
Does it hurt?

617
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,555
A little bit.

618
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,920
- What about you?
- I'm good.

619
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,720
Why is it so hard to get to do it?!

620
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,395
Right, why is it so hard?

621
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,067
- Love, I think it's weird.
- Yes?

622
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,880
- Mm.
- Mm.

623
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,570
It'll happen one day.

624
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,080
You kiddo!

625
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,488
Pat!

626
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,040
What's the meal for today?

627
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
Nothing.

628
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,040
(Next Episode)
Can I please join you?

629
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,960
Sure.

630
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,000
Aw, heaven's teasing you.

631
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,440
Did you guys make a vow somewhere?

632
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
Did you do it?

633
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,080
Do what?

634
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,027
You were crying here, feeling heartbroken,

635
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,868
so I told you to pray
at the shrine for a lover.

636
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,040
Love!

637
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,960
I knew it. I didn't ask for a lover.

638
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
That's me.

639
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,920
Why do you have photos of me?

640
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,320
'Cause you're my lover.

641
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,360
We'll get through everything together.

642
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,149
Can you not leave?

643
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,400
Please stay.

644
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,720
Auntie!

645
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,480
Love, your mom's here!

646
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,600
Mom!

647
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,960
Mom, wake up!

648
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,400
How would I live without you?!
