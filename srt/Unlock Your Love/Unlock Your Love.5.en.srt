00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,840
(Previously)
You caught a cold from me?

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm not sure about that,

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,920
but I think I'm addicted to you.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,000
You followed me here, didn't you?

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,851
I've been tracking you by GPS.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,960
I'm not toying with your feelings.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,690
I can wait for you my whole life.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,033
It felt like everything stopped,

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,361
and you've been the
only one I see ever since.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,667
It was just sex.
I don't have to tell you everything.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,240
Is it fun

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,920
toying with my feelings?

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,800

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Love!

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,454
Your heart's beating so fast.

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,155
I'm excited.

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
How cute.

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,525
You love me now?

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,800
Oh,

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
it's raining!

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
- Let's get out of the rain!
- Let's go!

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,030
What is this?

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,182
Come on.

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,778
Dry your hair so that you won't get a cold.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Come on.

32
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:33,761
Here.

33
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Thanks.

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Rain,

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,512
can you dry my hair, please?

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,683
You're mature now. Do it yourself.

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,544
Please.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,040
It's not that big of a deal.

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Please.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,280
Come on.

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Turn around.

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,455
You're so sweet!

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,107
That's it.

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,840
So...

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Come here.

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,920
I'll do it for you.

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
No, I can do it myself.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,880
It's okay. I'll do it.

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Has it been a long day for you?

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,520
Well, yeah.

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,720
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Why would you be?

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,200
For taking you out into the sun, wind,

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,409
and even rain.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,130
It's totally fine.

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,640
It's been a long time since I did that.

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,134
Did you like it?

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Of course.

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,250
I mean,

60
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
do you like me?

61
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,418
Do you enjoy spending time with me?

62
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,160
Do you?

63
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,853
Then...

64
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,080
Will you be my girlfriend?

65
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,560
What?

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
You don't want to?

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,521
It's not like that.

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,000
It's not that easy being together.

69
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,500
We need to talk about it first.

70
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,190
Why are you making it hard?

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,800
No matter what relationship it is,

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,160
we'll have to get to know more
about each other anyway.

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,760
Aren't you afraid of getting hurt?

74
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,295
I am,

75
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,842
but... no matter what our relationship is,

76
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,840
if we're not meant to be together,

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll get hurt anyway.

78
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,600
But if we're dating...

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,238
It'll be clearer, Rain.

80
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,186
It's clear that I've chosen you

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,141
and will settle down with you.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
And...

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,160
have you made your decision?

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Sure!

85
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,887
It's always been you.

86
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
So...

87
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,040
can I be the one for you, too?

88
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,240
Hm?

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Love!

90
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,720
It's okay.

92
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,540
- Is your camera alright?
- It's okay, Rain.

93
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
It's fine.

94
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,872
I'm not worried about the camera,

95
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,920
but I'm sad that I lost that opportunity.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You silly kid!

97
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,078
And do you love this kid?

98
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,760
So... are we dating now?

99
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,234
Yeah.

100
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,447
Yeah?

101
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,170
We're girlfriends.

102
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,744
That wasn't enough. Can I have more?

103
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,530
Love!

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,200
That felt so good. Another one?

105
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,159
Love, that's enough!

106
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,760
My cheeks hurt now.

107
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,185
They don't!

108
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,686
Love!

109
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Stop it.

110
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,160
Go check your camera.

111
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,345
It's not my fault if you don't.

112
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,657
You're right.

113
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,703
Leave now! That's enough.

114
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,389
What? No.

115
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,673
I'm staying the night.

116
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,868
Please let me.

117
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,872
When we're back,
I'll let you stay the night at my place.

118
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,370
No, I wanna stay this night with you!

119
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,563
- And...
- Just leave!

120
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,800
Come on, it won't be long.

121
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,151
No, just go.

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,880
Jeez.

123
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,760
Calm down, Rain.

124
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,200
You'll die if your heart beats too fast.

125
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,813
Kids these days are so cheeky.

126
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,280
Good morning, baby.

127
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,218
Thanks.

128
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
Let's see if it's yummy.

129
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Whoa, this is good.

130
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:01,753
I'll make it for you every day.

131
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Rain,

132
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,520
can I ask you something?

133
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Are you going back to your company?

134
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,623
Am I stressing you out?

135
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
It's okay.

137
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,755
I've been thinking about it all the time.

138
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,150
You should go back, then.

139
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,611
It's rare to find someone with your talent.

140
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
You're exaggerating.

141
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,137
If I were that good,
I wouldn't have been suspended like this.

142
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,880
We all make mistakes,

143
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,049
but we learn from them and grow.

144
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,200
Do you think I can do it?

145
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,243
Of course.

146
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,378
I'm right here for you.

147
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Love.

148
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Rain!

149
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,000
What? Can't I kiss you?

150
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
I want more.

151
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,680
Look at you. Are you blushing?

152
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,222
Just eat! That's your food.

153
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Can I have yours?

154
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,450
Will it fit?

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,937
Certainly.

156
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
There's plenty of room in here.
Of course, it fits.

157
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,065
Alright.

158
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,280
Let's go.

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,645
Hey.

160
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,780
What?

161
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,846
Rain...

162
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,234
Love, what's wrong?

163
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,570
Rain...

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Are you okay?

165
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,268
I can't breathe.

166
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,666
There's not enough oxygen.

167
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
I'm calling the ambulance.
Hang in there.

168
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,400
Don't!

169
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,000
- You are enough.
- What?

170
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,440
I'm good now.

171
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,160
That was nonsense.

172
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,833
You better watch out.

173
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,819
Hi, there, Love.

174
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,225
You came here all lonely,

175
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,920
but you're now leaving with a girlfriend.

176
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,480
Aw, are you jealous?

177
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm not, but she might.

178
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,875
I'm sorry, baby.

179
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
Stop it. Let's go.

180
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,142
Don't forget to give me your photos.

181
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Got it.

182
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
I'm leaving, then.

183
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,543
Get home safely.
Take care of your girlfriend, too.

184
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,129
- Got it.
- Good.

185
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,968
- Get home safely.
- Okay.

186
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,705
Goodbye, Rain.

187
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,400
See you again next time.

188
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,413
- Goodbye. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

189
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,640
Goodbye.

190
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Go now, kiddo.

191
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,281
Hold me tight, or you might fall.

192
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,747
You're going too far.

193
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,926
See you.

194
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:50,779
Hi, girl.

195
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,103
You busy?

196
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,440
Yeah. I'm working.

197
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,120
What is it?

198
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,200
It's Love.

199
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,880
Spill the tea.

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,399
You're not busy now?

201
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,160
It's my job to be nosy, too.

202
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,591
Well, Love...

203
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,280
Wait.

204
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,297
Hang on. Wawa's calling me.

205
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,720
Gosh, Bowie!

206
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,240
What's the tea?

207
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,280
That guy last night was so hot!

208
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,868
He satisfied my needs for this whole month.

209
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,080
You're always like this.

210
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,000
What? You're here, too?

211
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,440
What's the tea?

212
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,754
It's Love.

213
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,280
Spill it.

214
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,840
She just spent last night with her girl!

215
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,040
Oh, my gosh!

216
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,040
And?

217
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,391
That's all I know.

218
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,480
- What? Praew!
- Praew!

219
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,200
How would I know?

220
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
I wasn't in the room with them.

221
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,520
Gosh, you're so annoying.

222
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,560
Anyway,

223
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
they left the room together this morning.

224
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,200
They were fighting at night,

225
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,059
but they're in love in the morning.

226
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,852
That's their style.

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,120
What style?

228
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,400
It's the love-hate relationship.

229
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,600
It's her thing.

230
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,621
I gotta go now. I've got a customer.

231
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,640
Fine.

232
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,920
Talk to you later.

233
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,997
Hello.

234
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,615
What?

235
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,755
They just hung up.

236
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,120
I still know nothing.

237
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,028
Last night was amazing, though.

238
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,930
Deane, I'm here.

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,581
Is she not here?

240
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,973
She is, but she's busy.

241
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,920
Kiddo!

242
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,958
Why are you here so early?

243
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,793
I bought you some soy milk on my way here.

244
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
I think it's gonna be yummy.

245
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,392
As yummy as you?

246
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,635
Deane!

247
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,330
Don't joke with me like that.

248
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,363
Thanks.

249
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,160
Go to work now. You'll be late.

250
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,480
I'm leaving, then.

251
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,030
- Okay.
- Bye.

252
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Goodbye, Pat.

253
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,120
Bye.

254
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Wanna share some with me?

255
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,823
So?

256
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,520
Or...

257
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,990
do you wanna eat me?

258
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:28,560
Hm?

259
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,040
Hi, there.

260
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
What's going on?

261
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,101
What's between you guys?

262
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,813
Well, it's nothing.

263
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,481
Really, Pat?

264
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,707
Yeah, it's nothing between us.

265
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,618
Fine.

266
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,880
- This one looks nice.
- Yeah.

267
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,400
- Add this.
- Sure.

268
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,700
Hi, babe.

269
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,598
Hi, Love. Are you doing great?

270
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,960
I am.

271
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,465
Can we talk?

272
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,080
Why are you making that face?

273
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Who is she?

274
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,490
It's better if you don't know.

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,410
Come on, Love.

276
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,840
Is she her sister?

277
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,113
It's her ex.

278
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,200
Pat,

279
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,426
we're not open today.

280
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,703
Close the place and go home.

281
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,468
Babe!

282
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,003
Happy 10th anniversary!

283
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,891
I love you, babe.

284
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,624
Spend forever with me, okay?

285
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,487
Deane...

286
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,800
Yes?

287
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,920
You...

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What's wrong?

289
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm seeing someone else.

290
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,543
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,063
I can't be with you anymore.

292
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,860
Let's break up.

293
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,234
Is...

294
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,587
It's not true, right?

295
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,364
Are you kidding me?

296
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,413
Are you?

297
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,007
Babe,

298
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,706
are you kidding me?

299
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,174
Tell me it's not true.

300
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,513
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,160
I don't have feelings for you anymore.

302
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,560
I can no longer be with you.

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,565
But...

304
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,691
who is it?

305
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,324
Are they taking good care of you?

306
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,706
What have I done wrong?

307
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,510
Tell me so that I can fix it.

308
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,556
You've done nothing wrong.

309
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,869
Why are you leaving me, then?

310
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,153
I just can't be with you anymore.

311
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,093
It's been 10 years!

312
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,923
I don't have feelings for you anymore!

313
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:04,760
- Let me go.
- Tell me.

314
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
- I can do anything for you.
- Let go of me!

315
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
I said let me go!

316
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,050
Babe...

317
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,423
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I'm really sorry.

319
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,140
That's how it went.

320
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,280
And I've never seen her in love ever since.

321
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Are you okay?

322
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,897
10 years?

323
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,177
That's so long.

324
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,733
Do you think she's gotten over her yet?

325
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,259
I don't know.

326
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,194
I have no idea what she would do.

327
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,360
What's wrong?

328
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
I don't know.

329
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,240
Part of me understands her,

330
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,680
but another part is worried.

331
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,341
What do you mean?

332
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,835
I can win over a hundred people,

333
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,960
but that's the old flame.

334
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,306
I don't think I can beat her.

335
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,647
You might do, though.

336
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,865
Girl,

337
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,400
if I did, I wouldn't
have ended up like this.

338
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,800
An old flame never dies, you know?

339
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,080
I'll be gone for 2 weeks,
taking Mom and your siblings on a trip.

340
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,800
You can use my card to get anything.

341
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Love you.

342
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,835
Your dad?

343
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,526
You know everything, huh?

344
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,638
Yeah.

345
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,346
He's going on a trip
with his former family.

346
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,680
Me?

347
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,864
All alone as always.

348
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,843
I'm used to it now.

349
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,116
Alone?

350
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,560
Alone, you said?

351
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,560
Don't you see me sitting right here?

352
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,706
So, remember,

353
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,479
I'm always here for you.

354
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,924
Whatever.

355
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,360
Are you home yet?

356
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,211
Text me when you get home.

357
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,000
I think I gotta go now.

358
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,199
Mom needs me.

359
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Which mom?

360
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,840
Your mom needs you?

361
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,778
Yeah, it's really my mom.

362
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,965
Mom? You're being suspicious.

363
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,145
She's my mom!

364
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,080
- Not someone else.
- That's just so suspicious.

365
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,640
It's nothing. I'm leaving.

366
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,200
Whatever. Get home safely.

367
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,920
You better not get drunk somewhere.

368
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,760
See you.

369
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,720
- See you.
- Good luck.

370
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,891
Deane!

371
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Let's eat.

372
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,048
Why are you here so early?

373
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,707
Someone told me
to get off work early yesterday.

374
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,395
If I'm late,

375
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,415
you'll dock my pay!

376
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,920
So, you're worried about that?

377
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,773
Thought you were worried about me.

378
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,141
Well...

379
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,960
I am.

380
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,549
Hey,

381
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,320
are you really okay?

382
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,661
She's my ex.

383
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,226
Well...

384
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
I'm actually not,

385
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,025
but I think I can still go on.

386
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
And what if you can't anymore?

387
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
I'll just run away.

388
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,720
You'll just give up that easily?

389
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,852
Thought you hated losing.

390
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,920
I can never win an old flame.

391
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
In case I won't get to do it anymore.

392
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,151
Hey!

393
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,550
You can't just kiss me and walk away!

394
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,280
[Have you figured it out yet? I'm waiting]

395
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,838
Are you tired?

396
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,077
Very much.

397
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,550
- Can you cheer me up?
- There you go.

398
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,723
That wasn't enough.

399
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,133
- You want more?
- Yeah.

400
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,530
Deane.

401
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,360
Deane!

402
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Deane!!

403
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,692
What's wrong?

404
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,192
Nothing.

405
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,079
You just kissed me and walked away.

406
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,678
I'll accept food as your apology.

407
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,080
Can I have another kiss, then?

408
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
I'll give you everything.

409
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,482
Don't press your luck.

410
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,770
I'm not!

411
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,560
I want you.

412
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,154
Tomorrow's your birthday.

413
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,655
Is there anything you want?

414
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,560
How did you know that?

415
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,760
I'm smart.

416
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,958
Did you see my ID card or something?

417
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,960
That's creepy.

418
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,120
Gosh, how would I do that?

419
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,960
It's Facebook.

420
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,147
Jeez,

421
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,040
I thought I mattered.

422
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,820
Who said you don't?

423
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,264
And do you want anything?

424
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,304
I don't.

425
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,710
I'm too old.

426
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,076
How can someone old be this cute?

427
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,120
That's too far, dear.

428
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,200
I love you. That's why!

429
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,720
Should we throw a party here
and invite Love and Rain?

430
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,508
Yeah, that sounds alright.

431
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,878
We haven't celebrated
since we opened up this place.

432
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,205
- Let's just throw a party.
- Got it. One sec.

433
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,480
[Love]

434
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,684
Love!!!

435
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,490
What is it?

436
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,600
You sound so happy. That's weird.

437
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,483
I'm busy. Can't go with you.

438
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,348
Come on.

439
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,720
You thought I'd ask you to do something?

440
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,012
Yes.

441
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,991
That's so fake.

442
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,520
Nothing's real.

443
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,280
It's true, though.

444
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,759
So... how could I help, Miss Pat?

445
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,640
I'm not asking you to do anything.

446
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,360
Just wanna invite you
to Deane's birthday tomorrow.

447
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,272
Oh, it's her birthday tomorrow.

448
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,120
Hey, you forgot my birthday?!

449
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,990
Aw, who would forget your birthday?

450
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,878
You're my beloved friend.

451
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,080
You did!

452
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,320
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,600
Where's the party, though?

454
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,453
Here, at her shop.

455
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,505
Alright, got it.

456
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
So...

457
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,080
I'll bring Rain, too.

458
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,127
What's going on between you guys?!

459
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,360
Right.

460
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,427
Well...

461
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,720
I won't tell you.

462
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,800
I want it to be a surprise.

463
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,300
See you tomorrow.

464
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,779
Alright, bye.

465
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
You want some?

466
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:09,017
What's that?

467
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,310
Look like shrimp paste.

468
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,120
You're having bread with shrimp paste?

469
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Who was that?

470
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,105
It was Pat. She invited us
to Deane's birthday party tomorrow.

471
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,048
Please come with me.

472
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,776
Sure.

473
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,835
Is it cute?

474
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yes.

475
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,285
- The bread?
- Mm.

476
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,208
Just kidding.

477
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,834
You're the cutest.

478
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,440
Try it.

479
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,080
What do you want by doing that?

480
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,400
Energy.

481
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,324
That's not fair.

482
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,160
I want some energy, too.

483
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,200
Love!

484
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Come on.

485
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,688
Here.

486
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,093
This one's so fun.

487
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
This is for kids.

488
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,680
I'm not a kid anymore.

489
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,634
It's not for kids.

490
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:49,861
It's just a lovely story.

491
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,720
It's about to end already.

492
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,280
How would I know the whole story?

493
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,291
I guess you'll have to tell me about it.

494
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,324
Sure. I'll spend this whole night doing so.

495
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,560
Jeez.

496
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,639
Here.

497
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,200
Hi, guys.

498
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,320
Aw, Rain!

499
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,760
Missed you!

500
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,872
Wait.

501
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,840
Hold on.

502
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,680
What's this? What's happening?

503
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,880
Easy.

504
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,640
What did you do to get the baddest one?

505
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,580
Hey!

506
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
- What?
- We'll see.

507
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,526
So, you guys are...

508
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
dating?

509
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,887
Mm?

510
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,080
So, you're dating?

511
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,280
- Mm?
- Are you guys dating?

512
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,697
Yeah.

513
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:41,880
Oh, my God!

514
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,280
When did you start dating?

515
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,560
Why didn't you tell me?

516
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,790
What were you saying?

517
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,831
Hm?

518
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,217
You covered my mouth.

519
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,520
So, you guys are in a relationship?

520
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,436
You're making things difficult for me.

521
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,468
Well,

522
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,248
stop being scared.

523
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,326
What are you waiting for?

524
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,680
Did she just trick you or something, Rain?

525
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,927
Did she do black magic on you?

526
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,920
Let me check.

527
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,090
- Pat!
- Pat! It's not like that.

528
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,749
I didn't do black magic on her.

529
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,240
She just took my heart.

530
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:29,800
Stop it there. Just go get your snack.

531
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,146
- Deane.
- Yes?

532
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,508
Happy birthday.

533
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,240
- Here's your present.
- Thanks.

534
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,600
Happy birthday.

535
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,418
- Aw, thanks a lot.
- That's mine!

536
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,434
- Yeah?
- Yeah, that's mine, too.

537
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,580
- Okay.
- Put them away.

538
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,920
Cheers to Deane's 32nd birthday!

539
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,953
- Yay.
- Come on.

540
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:47,560
Hold on.

541
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,480
I'm 30, not 32.

542
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,646
Her 30th birthday!

543
00:32:50,686 --> 00:32:53,799
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

544
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
Deane.

545
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,080
Oh, you're with the others?

546
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,953
Come here, kiddo.

547
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,160
Hi, Rain.

548
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,663
It's been a while. I've missed you.

549
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah.

550
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,560
- She's even faker than my face.
- What brought you here?

551
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,280
It's your birthday,

552
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,450
so I'm here to give you a present.

553
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,520
I hope you like it.

554
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,240
Thank you.

555
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,755
- Open it up.
- Now?

556
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:23,600
I'm opening it now.

557
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,120
- I chose it for you.
- Let's check it out.

558
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,560
That's so cool.

559
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,495
- I like it.
- Please wear it.

560
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,268
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

561
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,520
Rain, how are you doing?

562
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
I'm going great.

563
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,920
It's so lonely at work without you

564
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,306
'cause we have no one to talk about.

565
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,168
I mean, no one to talk to about work.

566
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Oh? Yeah.

567
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,040
I also think the client
was really mean to you.

568
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,590
If I were you, I wouldn't let her win, too.

569
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,890
It's alright. It's been long already.

570
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,160
So, are you going to Fern's wedding?

571
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,129
What?

572
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,435
Oops.

573
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,766
I thought you already knew.

574
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
She's getting married?

575
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,120
With Arm?

576
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,966
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,992
It's alright. I'm fine.

578
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,960
Since it's Deane's birthday,

579
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,600
let's celebrate for her again.

580
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,383
Come on, guys.

581
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
- You just love to drink, huh?
- Come on.

582
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,680
- Come on.
- Alright.

583
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,702
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

584
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,499
May I join you?

585
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,951
Mai...

586
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,166
Mai?

587
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
It's you again, Love.

588
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,520
Hi, Botan.

589
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,445
When I was gone,
you were chasing after your dream?

590
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,353
Didn't we agree to meet tomorrow?

591
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Why are you here today?

592
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,905
It's your birthday and our anniversary.

593
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,123
How would I forget about that?

594
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,640
Come here.

595
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,240
Why is she back?

596
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,360
Keep going if you want to, but I'm out.

597
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,120
It was 10 years.
I don't stand a chance.

598
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,680
I'm setting my surprise up.

599
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,000
Okay.

600
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,000
Okay.

601
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
What's going on?

602
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,155
Things just keep coming.

603
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:26,857
I'll feed you.

604
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,557
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

605
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,520
- ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫
- ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

606
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,339
- ♫ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♫
- ♫ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♫

607
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,800
- ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫
- ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

608
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,673
- Yay!
- Yay!

609
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,120
Happy birthday, Deane.

610
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,480
I'm wishing you all the happiness!

611
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,117
Blow out the candles.

612
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,726
- Yay.
- Yay!

613
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Thanks.

614
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,360
I have something to ask you, too.

615
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,560
What is it?

616
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,320
Can I be by your side
and take care of you forever?

617
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,405
Deane,

618
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,980
give me the answer when you're ready.

619
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Don't leave just yet.

620
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,400
Enjoy the cake together first.

621
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,920
Why didn't you answer me?

622
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,840
What's your problem again?

623
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,560
Just say it if you don't like me.

624
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,400
Why would you ignore me?

625
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,760
Tell me your problem.

626
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,053
So, you're not answering me?

627
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,720
Oh,

628
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,420
is silence your answer?

629
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,280
I can't beat your ex anyway.

630
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,923
- Pat!
- Pat, where are you going?

631
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,141
- Pat, where are you going?
- I just need some time alone.

632
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,565
Deane.

633
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,240
Yeah?

634
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
What have you done?

635
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
What's this?

636
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,257
Are you back together?

637
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,110
No.

638
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,603
No?

639
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,391
Why did you do that, then?

640
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,537
If you don't like her, just say so.

641
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,360
Right.

642
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,331
You didn't need to ignore her like that.

643
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,457
I'll be out of town for 2 weeks.

644
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,319
Take care.

645
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,840
Love you.

646
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,040
From Dad.

647
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,875
Dad!

648
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,436
Dad!

649
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,880
Where is he?

650
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
Something came up.

651
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,318
Money's on the table in my room.

652
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,360
Love you.

653
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,680
Dad, it's my birthday. Let's...

654
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,440
Happy birthday, dear.

655
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,470
I love you.

656
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,300
[Wishing you happiness]

657
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,600
"Love"?

658
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,092
Dad,

659
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,776
I'm leaving tomorrow.

660
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,161
Can you pick me up?

661
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
Oh...

662
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,354
You're on a trip with the others?

663
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,793
It's okay.

664
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
I'll find a ride myself.

665
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,350
Hello?

666
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
I love you.

667
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,864
Yes, girl?

668
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,457
You've been gone for long.

669
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,414
How may I help you?

670
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,822
I missed you.

671
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,320
That's not you.

672
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,625
There must be something you want me to do.

673
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,915
You always know everything.

674
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,960
I'm leaving tomorrow.

675
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,270
Can you pick me up at the airport?

676
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,065
What about your dad?

677
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm just used to it now.

678
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,297
You should be, too.

679
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,051
I always get ditched.

680
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,920
Don't be sad. I'll give you a lift.

681
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,360
Can we go meet my friend after?

682
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,200
I have work to do.

683
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,760
Which friend?

684
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,567
It's Deane. I think you know her.

685
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
You might've seen her before.

686
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,454
She's opening up a tattoo shop,
so we have something to discuss.

687
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,346
How could she be this cool?

688
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,560
We're closed today.

689
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,440
Can I be more than just a friend?

690
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,280
I am independent

691
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,680
and not ready to be taken.

692
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
If you don't want to get hurt,

693
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,640
don't cross the line.

694
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,013
It was just sex.
I don't have to tell you everything.

695
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,106
Is it fun

696
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,065
toying with my feelings?

697
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,456
I can't beat your ex anyway.

698
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,000
How could you be this stupid, Pat?

699
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,063
How could you ask for love
from someone who doesn't want to love you?

700
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,688
Why don't you love yourself?

701
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,880
Why don't you?

702
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,560
Why?!

703
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,600
(Next Episode) Your smile has wiped away
all the tears you've shed.

704
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,345
I'm always here for you.

705
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,600
I'd like to cancel all the projects
I assigned to Rain.

706
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,360
Sure.

707
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,691
Rain, oops.

708
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,120
Rain, you bitch.

709
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,595
Let go of your past.

710
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,078
You deserve a better lover.

711
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,364
Give yourself a chance.

712
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,781
Just because you've had
bad love a hundred times,

713
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,595
that doesn't mean the
next one will be bad as well.

714
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,061
Love is like taking risks.

715
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,831
At the very least, you get
to love someone, though.

716
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,920
I want to die!

717
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,320
- No!
- No!

718
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,040
- No!
- Stop it!

719
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,400
Are you sure?

720
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,480
Mm.
