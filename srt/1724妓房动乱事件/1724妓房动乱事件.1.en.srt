What took you so long?

40
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,723
Pedestrian delivery service
for ten long years!

41
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,231
Satisfaction guaranteed!

42
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,130
You useless scoundrels!

43
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,038
You said the same thing
ten years ago!

44
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,941
Lady, did I come to the wrong house?

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,516
Go and scoop some rice!

46
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,614
Bong-dal,
go find that show off.

47
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,019
How the hell can I?

48
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,625
Tell him I want another round!

49
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,819
Didn't you see the little birds
flying around your head earlier?

50
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,122
Little birds?

51
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,237
I did see a little bird alright.

52
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,043
You dumb ass.

53
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,838
Drink, please!

54
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,217
Here, here!

55
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,316
Okay!

56
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,926
Bong-dal!

57
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,933
A beautiful flower has sprung up
in this filthy place.

58
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,133
Find out what she's doing here.

59
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,637
Stop acting like the boss,
you good-for-nothing!

60
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,339
I told you not to hit me
on the head!

61
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,946
We're out of booze!
Go get some!

62
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,112
Who do you think you are?

63
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,014
Why are you getting on my case?

64
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,014
You lost the fight!

65
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,420
You fool!

66
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,825
What?

67
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,830
You're such a loser.

68
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:36,832
What?

69
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,833
Go get the booze before
you get on my bad side.

70
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,110
Granny!

71
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,625
How could you afford
a girl like that?

72
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,723
As long as she's here now,
what does it matter.

73
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,333
I'm already thinking
about marrying her

74
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,639
What?

75
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,934
You're dead
if you even look at her.

76
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,037
Then I quit!

77
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,618
What the?

78
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,327
Your eyes are spinning
in their sockets.

79
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,230
What? Thinking of stealing me away?

80
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,839
I've already got a cartload of girls
who worship the ground I walk on.

81
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,936
You weren't such
a bad fighter back there.

82
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,611
Oh, It's no big deal.

83
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,817
I only get it on when my guys
need my help.

84
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,517
You mean fighting?

85
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,217
You better watch
how you talk to me.

86
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,721
I'm your elder.

87
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,233
Then are you proud of being
a petty gangster at your age?

88
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,230
They call me Thunder.
What about you?

89
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,932
What does a dishwasher like me
need a name for?

90
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,540
Call me whatever you like.

91
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,938
How about Dishy?

92
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,338
What?

93
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,005
Dishy, short for dishwasher.

94
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,117
Since you're not the ugliest girl
on the block.

95
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,918
You jerk.

96
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:35,816
Hey.

97
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,722
You're not the smartest guy
on the block.

98
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,325
Everyone around town knows my name.
You'll be safe with me.

99
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,926
I'll look after you from now on.

100
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,328
Do you like me?

101
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,238
You have a great sense of humor,
don't you know.

102
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,036
'I love you with all my heart'
is stamped on your forehead.

103
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,744
Do you take your clothes off
just anywhere?

104
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,812
What's there to hide
between me and you?

105
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:11,519
I see you must've been around some.

106
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,129
I wish I could take a hot bath.

107
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,833
A bath?

108
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,737
Why?

109
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,840
Nothing.

110
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,240
Take a bath, if you want...

111
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,207
That's an imitation made in China.
Pretty, huh?

112
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,408
I told you we're in a hurry.

113
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,213
Oh, so you want the tax now?

114
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,720
Can't you just call it
a charitable neighborhood contribution.

115
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,923
Can I pay it
next month instead then?

116
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,324
Thunder,
should I teach him a lesson?

117
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,724
This will make up for this month!

118
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,332
Hey, that's really expensive!

119
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,934
He's completely lost his mind.

120
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,335
I'm going to kill them all!

121
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,633
What's going on?

122
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,839
Granny, what happened?

123
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,438
We were cheated.

124
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,308
Cheated? Out of what?

125
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,213
They made a wrong delivery.

126
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,116
There's another Bright Moon
in Pil district.

127
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,122
Buggers should've just left her.

128
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,419
Then where the hell is our new girl!

129
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,925
You mean they took Dishy?

130
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,227
Those crooks!

131
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,729
How many Bright Moons
are there?

132
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,530
Take this, boy.

133
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,332
Hi, I'm Hong-jae!

134
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,234
Look at this place.

135
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,142
Furnace's gang is passing by.
You wanna go see them, too?

136
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,806
Their outfits are incredible.

137
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,417
Oh goodness,
this brothel is a dump.

138
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,518
Know why he's called Furnace?
He can shoot fire from his mouth.

139
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,025
Big Head's dome is so huge
that if he rams you...

140
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,028
you'll have your own bulging head
for three generations.

141
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,924
But if you compare them
to Odd Ears of Yangjoo,

142
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,525
they're just amateurs.

143
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,730
His punch is so fast that you're
dead before you even see it coming.

144
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:44,240
One guy didn't even know
he was dead for three days.

145
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,338
If Odd Ears is legendary,
then Man-deuk of Pildong is mythic.

146
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,109
I saw him in person once.
Want the short or long version?

147
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,717
Stop talking hogwash again.

148
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,414
So he fights 150 members
of the Frog Gang by himself.

149
00:10:56,555 --> 00:11:00,423
His punch is so fast that they were in
the afterlife before they knew it.

150
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,417
What's wrong?

151
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,222
Heard of Bright Moon tavern
in Pil district?

152
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,524
Want the short version
or the long one?

153
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,031
- The short version.
- No.

154
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,625
Then tell me the long one.

155
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,036
I don't know.

156
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,836
Furnace's gang is coming!

157
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,235
Furnace's gang!

158
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,143
Furnace's gang!

159
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,434
Boy.

160
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,733
Serve drinks.

161
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,741
Serve drinks.

162
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,639
Goddammit it, too rude.

163
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,539
What?

164
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,712
Your words are too rude.

165
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,019
We're not open so leave.

166
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,021
If you have elders before you,
you should rise to your feet quickly.

167
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,330
Leave it. We should be polite
at other people's places.

168
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,030
Who's the boss here?

169
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,141
You are being asked a question.

170
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:28,440
There can't be a worse day than this.

171
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:35,214
Great landscape, bright sunlight
and a sweet aroma.

172
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,013
This is the perfect spot for a grave.

173
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,627
Don't you think?

174
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,628
That wasn't bad at all.

175
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,233
Your posture was all wrong

176
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,531
but now I see that
you are indeed a fighter.

177
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,538
I see that you must've drank a lot.

178
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,042
But I'm having a very bad day,

179
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,647
so why don't you just leave.

180
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,015
We cant just leave it at that,
don't you think?

181
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,114
He's nothing but a petty thug,

182
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,813
- I shall...
- What?

183
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,321
Hey, how about a fight with me?

184
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,625
I don't believe this.

185
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,028
I don't fight for the fun of it.

186
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,635
You're really cute.

187
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,043
You're right, it's no fun.

188
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,514
I'm Odd Ears of Yangjoo.

189
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,613
I will wager you Yangjoo district.

190
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,929
A real man bets everything he has.

191
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,223
Come and fight.

192
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,442
Sir, please stop.

193
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,444
Damn it!

194
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,117
Do you want to give up?

195
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,821
You know, I'm a pro at getting hit.

196
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,726
Let's start now.

197
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,234
Dummy, focus on the feet
when you fight.

198
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:32,933
Not your feet.

199
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,121
Sir!

200
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,925
Are you okay?

201
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:01,930
Sir!

202
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,034
Sir!

203
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,632
That's strange.

204
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:14,340
Nobles call this the 'twelve quadrant
apoplectic head trauma'.

205
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,447
Say it with simple words.

206
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,515
He passed out.
He'll wake up, though.

207
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,412
When?

208
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,812
Ten years.

209
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,010
Ten years?

210
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,122
If he was hit ten years ago,
he'd be waking up any day now.

211
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,416
What is he saying?

212
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,919
What did he say?

213
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,924
If possible, try to keep him here.

214
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:37,627
Because if you move him
his brain might wobble.

215
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,441
Why are you looking at me like that?

216
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,439
What's wrong with you?

217
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,042
Everybody here saw it.

218
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,307
I was minding my own business.

219
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,911
I didn't ask to fight.

220
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,623
My name is Chil-gap.

221
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:02,124
I will serve you from now on.

222
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,421
Boss!

223
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,231
I think you've made a mistake.

224
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,130
I don't need any men.

225
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,737
I don't need that Yangjoo
or whatever territory.

226
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,239
Just give me ten coins and go away.

227
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,235
Our boss cherished his promises
more than his own life.

228
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,744
Since he promised to
give you Yangjoo,

229
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,110
we will serve you from now on.

230
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,511
Boss!

231
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,715
Wait...

232
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,717
You guys are completely broke,
aren't you?

233
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,722
Our boss always said that
a true fighter in our country is...

234
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,923
Hey, I won't take less
than five coins.

235
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,029
He'd like us to serve you
just as we served him.

236
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,927
So you must inevitably be our boss.

237
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,727
Now we dedicate our lives to you!

238
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,426
Our new Boss!

239
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,730
Boss!

240
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,140
Boss, our Yangjoo Gang's
territory goes

241
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,434
I don't accept it!

242
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,136
From Namtaeryoung to Anyang...

243
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,711
Boss!

244
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,415
I have something
to tell you in private.

245
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,715
Boss! Boss!

246
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:15,231
You want me to go to the
national gangster assembly?

247
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,732
You expect me to study at my age?

248
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,136
You don't need to study.

249
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,833
But if you don't attend,

250
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,035
then the delicate balance of power
that has been maintained collapses.

251
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,238
Here, it must be so hard studying.

252
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,511
My name is Hong-jae,
but people call me Red.

253
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,619
Red!

254
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,117
The Boss comes first.

255
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,520
What? Boss?

256
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,823
Don't worry about that pig!

257
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,524
Wait!

258
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,635
I'll take care of
such matters.

259
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,738
So everyone studies for himself.

260
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,839
It's at the Bright Moon
in Pil district.

261
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,138
If you don't go, a
bloody war will start.

262
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,542
Where did you say?

263
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,615
At Bright Moon
in Pil district.

264
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,026
You said your name is Thundy, right?

265
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,424
As a general rule,
a boss must look like a boss.

266
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,532
Hold on.

267
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,532
I'm only going to this congress,
that's all.

268
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,829
Careful!

269
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,434
How dare you lay your hands on him!

270
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,433
I won't eat him alive.

271
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,940
You've promised me.

272
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,443
I don't make promises.
Just tell me your order.

273
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,842
Then why didn't you leave
when I told you last time?

274
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,915
There is a man named Big Gun.

275
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,418
He was called Man-deuk
when he was still a slave.

276
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,019
Man-deuk?

277
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,417
The one who fought 150 members
of the Frog Gang?

278
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,921
187 members to be precise.

279
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,124
I don't know why
they initiated this congress.

280
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,821
Can't I just go back?

281
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,931
One more thing.

282
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,424
Never call him 'Man-deuk'
or there will be bloodshed.

283
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,740
You're all insane.

284
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,943
Anyway,
how should I address you?

285
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:05,839
'Oi! '

286
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,746
Or just 'Chil-gap'.

287
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,109
Okay.

288
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,510
- Oi!
- Yes, Boss.

289
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,811
I'm not going.

290
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,522
I was just kidding.
It's this way, right?

291
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,720
If it wasn't for that tavern
I wouldn't go, damn it.

292
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,532
Bright Moon

293
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,717
I'm Cyclops of Jegi.

294
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,622
My special move is poking out eyes
and eating them raw.

295
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,121
Don't ask anything else.

296
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,921
I'm Big Head of Inwang.

297
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,123
What are you looking at?

298
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,229
I'll chew you to pieces.

299
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,528
Get out of my way!

300
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,040
I'm Furnace of Paju.

301
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,241
Let's not have any trouble.

302
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,641
Want me to rip your head open?

303
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,209
Sir!

304
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,927
Odd Ears of Yangjoo has arrived.

305
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,738
Please take this seat.

306
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,807
- What's wrong?
- Posture!

307
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,213
Big Gun of Pil district has arrived.

308
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:56,816
Posture!

309
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,334
Big Gun,
Odd Ears is suffering from

310
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,935
a ten-year coma of temporariness.

311
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,413
In other words, he's flying in the air
and utterly groundless.

312
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,417
Our Thunder Boss here
has come in his place.

313
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,718
That's too bad.

314
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,025
I told him to be careful
about what he eats.

315
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,526
Is everyone comfortable?

316
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,229
Yes, comfortable!

317
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,528
Well...

318
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,542
Find out what happened
to Odd Ears.

319
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,735
Yes, sir!

320
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,617
This is the new courtesan
at Bright Moon.

321
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,316
What did you say your name was?

322
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,719
I am called Dishy.

323
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,617
What's a dishwasher like me
need a name for?

324
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,226
Call me whatever you like.

325
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:16,125
As delicate as a dish
with skin like porcelain.

326
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,835
They are like brothers to me.
Greet them.

327
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,133
The reason I called
for this assembly is that

328
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,235
we can no longer come like the wind
and evaporate like the dew.

329
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,138
We must now leave our traces behind.

330
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:04,906
But the forces trying to eradicate us
are taking control of the court.

331
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,419
It's not at a threatening level yet,
since I have some influence.

332
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,723
But the upper and lower among us...

333
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:21,226
We must become organized so that
the authorities can't mess with us.

334
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,732
This is frustrating.
So you mean we should pick a king.

335
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,336
- Watch it!
- You wanna die?

336
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,530
Watch what you say.
How can you speak of a king?

337
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,838
A king?

338
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,817
Yes, to put it simply, a king.

339
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:46,319
Shouldn't Odd Ears be here
if we are to decide on that?

340
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,220
Also...

341
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,917
I can serve a boss but not a king.

342
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,027
That's enough. This is too much.

343
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,424
Odd Ears isn't even here,
so let's keep it short.

344
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,531
The guy with
the biggest balls should lead.

345
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,326
You do it, Big Gun.

346
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,239
Who the hell do you think you are,
you wannabe?

347
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,833
Screw you.

348
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,942
You wanna die?

349
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:07,936
Wanna step outside?

350
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,013
Being dead is lonely.

351
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,410
You said you're called Thunder?

352
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,811
What, Man-deuk?

353
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,320
Never call him 'Man-deuk'.
Or there will be bloodshed.

354
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,824
Man-deuk?

355
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:28,731
You're here in Odd Ears' place,
so what do you think?

356
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,830
So you're telling me
to work under you, Man-deuk...

357
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,032
Boss, please!

358
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:41,339
Then what will I get in return?

359
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,108
In return? What do you want?

360
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,116
I want that chick.

361
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:51,923
Crazy jerk.

362
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,716
Do you want to die, you fool?

363
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,623
I'm going to smash
your head in with this.

364
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,025
You're really asking for it.

365
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,625
You want this chick?

366
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,541
The chick...

367
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,012
Do I look like I'm laughing?

368
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,014
Do I look that comical to you?

369
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,529
Dammit!

370
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,829
Good-for-nothing loser.

371
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:49,445
Dishy, he wants you.

372
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,511
You libertines climb such heights
to play a joke on a humble girl.

373
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:02,022
I worry that you will not
be content with me.

374
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,327
I'm afraid that my lowly body

375
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:11,231
cannot satisfy your
desires forged in paradise.

376
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,633
What a turn on.

377
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,211
I bet she tastes good.

378
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,324
She looks ripe.
Let's pluck her.

379
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,320
Boss!

380
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,311
What's wrong?
Scared?

381
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,719
Hold on!

382
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,919
We've made yourselves too excited
on such a pleasant day.

383
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,526
My servants will inform you
when we'll meet again.

384
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,443
Get out of my sight!

385
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,421
Come on, you had a good time.

386
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,426
Asking for a woman in our world
is no different from declaring war!

387
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,530
Then is Dishy Man-deuk's girl?

388
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,633
Are you asking
because you don't know?

389
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:06,328
I thought you said gang stuff
and fighting was your day job?

390
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,439
Then go ahead and fight!

391
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,235
Mapo district won't be safe anymore.

392
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,437
Odd Ears!

393
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,038
What the?

394
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,545
Boss!

395
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,309
Did I tell you to go?

396
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,909
Hey, Bong-dal!

397
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,418
That mother fucker seemed
like a Bunco.

398
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,523
That mother fucker!

399
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,319
How could that fucker!
Hit on your girl?

400
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,927
You sons of bitches!

401
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,428
Shut your dame mouths!

402
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,125
Who are you to tell me
that mother fucker!

403
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,234
Fucker...

404
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,926
Shut up, you Basterds!

405
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,730
What the fuck does
Odd Ears want?

406
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,635
Odd Ears!

407
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:57,718
Boss, please open your eyes.

408
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,521
What is this slap in the face?

409
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,824
What will happen to Yangjoo

410
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,729
if you leave me alone with
that bird-brained good-for-nothing?

411
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:14,132
Boss, please say something.

412
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,736
Do I have to trust in him?

413
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,437
To hell with this!

414
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:26,107
Why don't you tell the whole town
that Thunder is a scoundrel!

415
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,012
Am I a good-for-nothing?

416
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:32,514
Fine, I'm a good-for-nothing!

417
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:39,221
No, Thunder is considered a loyal,
good-hearted fighter of Mapo district.

418
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,228
Bong-dal, don't you have
anything to say?

419
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,225
Damn it, do you think I like
this pantomime?

420
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,940
Why don't you just
leave me out of this farce!

421
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,640
Step outside, you ungrateful houseboy.

422
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,937
Let's put an end to everything.

423
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,911
I said step outside, you bootlicker!

424
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,618
I said step outside!

425
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,210
Let's fight, you brown-noser!

426
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,925
Hit me! Come on!

427
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,120
Go ahead and hit me.

428
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,126
Didn't you order me
to step outside, Boss?

429
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,127
What?

430
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,732
I don't believe this.

431
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,746
Odd Ears' men
didn't seem so weak to me.

432
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,711
Then fight them,
what's the problem?

433
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,923
Economics is the issue.

434
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,826
I think Man-deuk has sided
with a high official to pay people off,

435
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:48,928
and he's given Man-deuk the license
to distribute alcohol nationwide.

436
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:53,428
The groups in support of Odd Ears
may turn on us any day.

437
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,837
Do you know Thunder?

438
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,615
He's just a passing wind in the night.

439
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,912
A passing wind, you say...

440
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:15,014
All bark and no bite.
I have no memory of him.

441
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,920
You're quite good with words.

442
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,427
Do you like cockscomb flowers?

443
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,438
The most vivid flowers in nature...

444
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,330
I've caught him!

445
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,811
But they flourish like weeds...

446
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,015
He's an informer
in the Mapo market.

447
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,216
Cyclops!

448
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,024
Big Head!

449
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:50,820
Furnace!

450
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,123
Hey, big mouth.

451
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,425
Do you know Thunder?

452
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,533
Of course!

453
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,831
I've known him
since he was a baby.

454
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,835
It was March 3rd of...

455
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,439
You idiot.

456
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,133
Just answer 'yes' or 'no'
to the question.

457
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:06,438
Yes.

458
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:07,839
Do you know Odd Ears?

459
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,212
Yes.

460
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,615
How do Odd Ears and Thunder
know each other?

461
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,418
Can I tell you the long version?

462
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,526
When I talk, you see,
I need to explain the details.

463
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,120
Do as you like.

464
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,725
It's getting late.

465
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:33,030
I already made your bed.

466
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,541
We never sleep.

467
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,735
It might rain.

468
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,633
Please let us
just love one another!

469
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,329
Go ahead and love.

470
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,143
Both of them are crazy.

471
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,125
Do you have a reservation?

472
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,922
I don't.

473
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,529
- Excuse me.
- Mommy!

474
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,627
Dishy?

475
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,530
You're not Dishy.

476
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,440
Be quiet.

477
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:20,243
Damn it.

478
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,836
What are you doing here,
you lunatic?

479
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,633
Dishy!

480
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,740
I had a tough time getting here.

481
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,137
Smile for me, why don't you.

482
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,612
A lowlife like you can't come in here.

483
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,911
Leave before I scream for help.

484
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,519
Come on,

485
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,713
at least we can be together
for one night.

486
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,624
- You wouldn't.
- Over here!

487
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,818
Are you crazy?

488
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,821
I came here to give you something.

489
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,333
I just can't get rid of you.

490
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,837
Yeah, I knew you'd like it.

491
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,139
Look here!

492
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,541
Okay, okay.

493
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:04,808
I'll just go so don't scream.

494
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,916
Bye.

495
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,608
My god...

496
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,812
Over there!

497
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,026
Catch him!

498
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,341
It's you!

499
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,044
Rumors are everywhere.

500
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,443
About what?

501
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,012
That you're going to fight Man-deuk.

502
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,316
What? But that's not true.

503
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,516
Anyway, be careful.

504
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,011
That's my advice as a friend.

505
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,122
A friend?

506
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,322
Hey, wait right there!

507
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,518
Scallywag.

508
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,937
Have you been
stuffing your face?

509
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,236
I didn't eat a thing, dammit!

510
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,318
Where have you been?

511
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,515
I just went to check out
the enemy's movements.

512
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:23,719
Boss, the whole Yangjoo family
is depending on you.

513
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,530
No matter what people say,

514
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,029
we're a gang that
takes care of its people.

515
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,434
It's not that much different
from governing a country.

516
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,537
And compared to that,
a mere chick...

517
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:41,443
If you say 'chick' one more time,
you'd better watch out.

518
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,507
I'm sorry, sir.

519
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,814
We cannot risk the gang's future
over one woman.

520
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:49,817
On top of which,
she's only a courtesan.

521
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:01,222
A courtesan is a flower
that one must not love.

522
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,935
Dammit, then what do you
expect me to do?

523
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,236
I've already fallen in love.

524
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,143
Dammit.

525
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,206
Give me just one day to plan!

526
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,707
Then I'll arrange a meeting
with Dishy.

527
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,617
Really?

528
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,319
This is Dishy's schedule.

529
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,025
Strip.

530
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,331
She'll wake up at 5am to prepare for
a courtesan initiation ceremony at 11am.

531
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,626
Our operation begins...

532
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,730
...here!

533
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,928
Four or five noble
libertines will gather

534
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,538
to go on a boat trip.

535
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,640
Turn around.

536
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,136
This is our operations map.

537
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,416
Dishy will follow this road.

538
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,415
We will be here.

539
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,418
What? Feel any pain?

540
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,817
No, sir.

541
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,217
Expand the map.

542
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:08,323
We follow this road and hide here.

543
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,026
We intercept Dishy's route right here.

544
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:15,236
We instigate an accident
at this commonly congested area.

545
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:18,432
After we kidnap
one of the libertines...

546
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,906
Let's have some fun.

547
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,912
I must discover whether or not
you're really a courtesan.

548
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,918
Who is your benefactor?

549
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,520
I don't know his name yet.

550
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,315
You don't know his name?

551
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,717
So does that mean
you have someone in mind?

552
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,722
Yes, there is someone
deep in my heart.

553
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:44,628
All the best libertines are here,
so you can forget about him.

554
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:48,135
I've already fallen in love.

555
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,136
Love?

556
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,934
- Where is it?
- Where exactly?

557
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,339
Deep inside me.

558
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,811
Let's see!

559
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,310
Is your love here?

560
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,718
Throw it away!

561
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,021
It's deeper.

562
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,022
Is your love here?

563
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,924
Throw this away, too!

564
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,329
Now for some excitement!
Let's have the background music!

565
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,638
Take it off! Take it all off!

566
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,804
Take it off! Take it all off!

567
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,415
Take it off! Take it all off!

568
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,118
Take it off! Take it all off!

569
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,415
Take it off! Take it all off!
Take it off!

570
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:48,329
You bunch of dirty scoundrels!

571
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,028
They're acting like crazy men
out there.

572
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,830
Just ignore them.

573
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:54,938
I have my hands full.

574
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,635
Nowhere to hide under the open sky
or upon the ocean, so with this...

575
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,116
Untie their ropes.

576
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,312
I said untie the ropes!

577
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:11,922
Are you cold?

578
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,316
Yes!

579
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,516
Shut up, you rogue.

580
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,019
Hey, Dishy.

581
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,630
Do you want to marry me right here?

582
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,924
What? Don't you trust me?

583
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:31,533
Has your brain gone soft from fighting
or were you born stupid?

584
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,342
You don't get what I'm saying?

585
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:38,512
You're resisting me
on purpose, aren't you?

586
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,819
I'll say it once again.

587
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,518
Don't get in my way.

588
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,123
I don't want to put up
with someone like you.

589
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,424
Why?

590
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:55,723
Because I'm a lowlife?

591
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,029
So you know yourself well then.

592
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,539
Hey!

593
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,033
Then why are you
carrying this with you?

594
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,312
- Why would she carry this everywhere?
- Jerk.

595
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,917
You like me, don't you?

596
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:22,225
Satisfied?
Now get out of my face.

597
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,030
Untie them!

598
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:40,434
I'm out of here!

599
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,511
Hey!

600
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,508
Thunder!

601
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,508
Thunder!

602
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,512
Bye!

603
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,919
You better trail them.

604
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,222
How about we just kill them!

605
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,218
Have fun on the boat?

606
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,618
The water was a little cold.

607
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,715
Hey, Chil-gap.

608
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,726
Relax, I'm here alone.

609
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:36,826
Can I call you my friend, Thunder?

610
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:45,841
I didn't spend much time in school,
so I don't have many friends, Man-deuk.

611
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,811
How valiant.

612
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,911
I feel all-powerful before
I sleep with her,

613
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,919
but I feel forlorn after
I sleep with her.

614
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,519
I'll give you Dishy.

615
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,025
But I want Odd Ears in exchange.

616
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,236
It's 10,000 in coins.

617
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,841
You won't be disappointed.

618
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,741
To hell with it.

619
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:30,018
Oh boy.

620
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,518
Sounds like a lot.

621
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:38,624
You guys definitely play
the game at a different level.

622
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,229
Fine, it worked out.

623
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,925
I wasn't really interested
in your fight anyway.

624
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:49,332
But you know what
my mother always told me?

625
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,637
She said to treat customers
like gods.

626
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,344
Whether they've come for a single drink
or a whole bowl of soup,

627
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,913
treat them like gods.

628
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,113
Man-deuk, I'm really grateful.

629
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,017
Now for the first time
I understand what she meant.

630
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,925
I don't know what kind of person
Odd Ears is,

631
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,323
but he's sleeping in my house,
just like a god.

632
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:15,329
And how can I give up a god, huh?

633
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:19,632
Man-deuk, come swing by my place.

634
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,129
I'll serve you like a god too.

635
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,709
A lot of snow will fall this winter.

636
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,716
Too bad you won't get to see it.

637
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,420
Then let's fight
on the first day of snow this winter.

638
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,422
Think I'm scared?

639
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:48,425
Visit your mom's cheap grave
before the first snow falls.

640
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:50,733
What, you spineless dog?

641
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:51,732
Boss!

642
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:56,233
Come here, you twisted degenerate!

643
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,340
Be patient, boss!

644
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:01,043
That damn rat!

645
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:08,017
Why the hell is he so worried
about Odd Ears?

646
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,616
When Man-deuk's gang steps outside
their own territory,

647
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:15,418
They can't compete with
Odd Ears' power and money.

648
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,526
Stone head!

649
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:20,423
Show it to him.

650
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,634
Eleven salt warehouses,
five icehouses,

651
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,327
twenty-one grain warehouses,

652
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,632
and two gold storerooms.

653
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:34,637
If you cash them all in,
it's about 1,500 coins worth.

654
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,411
So I'm getting into a fight
over 1,500 coins worth of property?

655
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,517
It may be hard to believe, but yes.

656
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,518
Oh no.

657
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,338
Why don't you taste it too?

658
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,343
Yes, sir.

659
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:19,617
My son was one of the men humiliated
by Odd Ears' gang on the river.

660
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,118
Do you know what kind of person
my son is?

661
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,420
He's the only son to continue
my family line.

662
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:32,824
You better understand why I picked
you over Odd Ears.

663
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,736
Shall I taste it?

664
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,240
You idiot.

665
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,515
Twin orchids.

666
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,921
'Two hearts', 'Two convictions'

667
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,220
'The love between two people...

668
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,829
shall be understood by them only.'

669
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,624
I know that much.

670
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,725
I see that you like to fight.

671
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,429
I like fights too.

672
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,313
Think you're ready to fight us?

673
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,719
Did your men get scared
and run away?

674
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,226
You don't fight with numbers,
you fight with your brain, idiot.

675
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,625
Just throw in the towel.

676
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,635
Why are you so calm?

677
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,938
We're the Yangjoo Gang.

678
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,524
Have you eaten yet, sir?

679
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,523
This is Thunder!

680
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,633
Boss!

681
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,134
First row, protect Odd Ears!

682
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:15,431
Yes, sir.

683
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,441
To your positions!

684
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,314
No weapons.

685
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,220
No biting.

686
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,325
No spitting.

687
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,427
No eye-poking.

688
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,425
No cursing.

689
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,224
- Oh, come on.
- How can we not curse?

690
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,630
- Let's curse.
- Yeah.

691
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,734
Okay, sir.

692
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:48,734
Anyway, a fare fight
to the end, okay?

693
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:49,839
- Okay.
- Of course.

694
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,838
Miscreants.

695
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,943
- You're all dead meat.
- You're gonna die.

696
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,237
How dare you swing
your piggie legs at me?

697
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,341
Go and stuff your face
with pigs' trotters at home!

698
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,033
Do I look like a pushover to you?

699
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,236
Do I look like a pushover,
you weakling!

700
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,014
You cheaters!

701
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:35,111
Why are you hold my leg!

702
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,314
Come on!

703
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:48,030
You sons of bitches!

704
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,126
The Big Head who can make
three generations bulging head!

705
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:52,030
Furnace!

706
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,729
Crush his testicles!

707
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:00,834
That's going too far.

708
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,922
Furnace!

709
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,428
Big Head!

710
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:29,732
You son of unwed parents!

711
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,236
No!

712
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,619
Stop!

713
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,627
The little birds!

714
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,533
Let's take a break.

715
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,931
Everyone, timeout!

716
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,335
Boss, how is your fist?

717
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,031
Don't even ask.

718
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:10,812
You grabbed my goddamn balls!

719
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:16,016
Not bad, it's been a while
since I've feared for my life.

720
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,517
You guys aren't so bad after all!

721
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:21,818
It would've been great if you'd ruled
the world with Man-deuk.

722
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,616
This here is my world,
you numbskulls!

723
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,427
- Shall we continue the fight?
- Absolutely.

724
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:31,629
Are you up to it?

725
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,134
Watch their legs.

726
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,733
You can see it all
if you just observe their legs.

727
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,842
Fight!

728
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:41,937
Attack!

729
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:21,813
Boss! Boss!

730
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:26,010
Some scum named Chun-soo
had a knife and Odd Ear...

731
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,020
Hurry! Quickly!

732
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,920
You bastards!

733
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,219
Lowest of the low.

734
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,827
What? A knife?

735
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,135
What do you want?

736
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,531
Who are you?

737
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,029
Try and get past me!

738
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,231
You crazy bitch...

739
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,904
Swines.

740
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,835
Boss!

741
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:19,239
Whoever messes with
this gentleman will die!

742
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,215
You filthy trash.

743
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,818
I really didn't know.

744
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:32,012
Please forgive me.
I really didn't know.

745
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:33,815
Dammit.

746
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,422
Don't ever come into Mapo again,
got it?

747
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:41,425
Yeah.

748
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,531
Get lost.

749
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:44,834
Get out of here!

750
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,137
You call yourselves
Yangjoo gangsters?

751
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,708
After screwing up like this?

752
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:02,716
If you can't risk your life
to protect your boss,

753
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,513
then die by my hands
or leave the gang.

754
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,422
Let go.

755
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,724
They're useless.

756
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,134
Chil-gap.

757
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:24,438
Mo-jil, Bong-pal, and ll-seok,
it's not their fault.

758
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:32,310
I don't know how it is in your world,
but these guys...

759
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,916
are no different from Odd Ears.

760
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,216
Dammit.

761
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,822
It's a war, Boss.

762
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:53,729
A war?

763
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,634
Man-deuk, that scumbag.

764
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,841
Is this Man-deuk's brewery?

765
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,610
Boss, not here.

766
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,106
What, are you chicken?

767
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,714
If you attack the brewery,
it will be an unavoidable all-out-war.

768
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,614
You do it your way.

769
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:18,727
I'll do it my way.

770
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,532
Smash them all.

771
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,636
Yes, sir!

772
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,513
Dammit.

773
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,215
I guess we can't
deal with it quietly now.

774
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,318
You imbecile.

775
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:52,526
Furnace, Big Head, Cyclops.

776
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,728
Where the hell are they?

777
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,026
Are they plotting something
behind my back?

778
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:03,530
And who the hell
is that wretched thug?

779
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:09,140
Is Excellency Song
plotting with them?

780
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,008
Excellency Song has arrived.

781
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,917
What the hell is happening?

782
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,721
I have a good idea.

783
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:31,425
What idea can you have
in that tiny brain of yours?

784
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,929
I'll do the thinking.

785
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:38,234
I told you to clean out the trash
that stands in my way.

786
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:42,936
You dumb idiot.

787
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:52,621
Dammit.

788
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,722
Come here.

789
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,723
Come here, you harpy.

790
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,918
Let me see your face.

791
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,828
Come here.

792
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,934
You, come here.

793
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,730
Come here and let me smell you.

794
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,737
You sluts.

795
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:14,040
How dare you run away
when I'm calling you?

796
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,805
Come here, you trollop.

797
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,608
Let's have some fun.

798
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,016
You hussy.

799
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,420
Me, Man-deuk!

800
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:33,427
I was born with nothing,
and struggled through hell.

801
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,327
Yes, I am Man-deuk!

802
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,230
I came this far
to be who I am today!

803
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,633
Do I look defeated to you?

804
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,640
Do I look pitiful to you?

805
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,715
You've drank a lot, sir.

806
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,218
Please bring this
useless fight to an end.

807
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:05,126
You should be begging me
to save Thunder, right?

808
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,727
An owner can read his dog's mind

809
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:12,728
when he sees his mutt's eyes
looking up at him.

810
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:15,531
It's a very endearing moment.

811
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:19,637
Look straight into my eyes.

812
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:23,035
Am I your owner?

813
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:27,614
You're a dog who would bite
your owner's hand and worse.

814
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,916
That drives me mad!

815
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:34,211
Dishy, I'll ask you one more time.

816
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,222
Who is Thunder?

817
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,638
You ask what kind of person
Thunder is?

818
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:57,012
He's like a tiny grain of sand
swept in by the ocean.

819
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:01,314
So why are you wasting
your energy on him?

820
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,418
Like sand...

821
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:09,717
Before that grain of
sand goes out to sea again,

822
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,528
I will kill him.

823
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,522
They will definitely return.

824
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,127
Are you scared?

825
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,325
Chil-gap.

826
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,634
This place may look
poverty-ridden to you,

827
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,336
but my mother lived here.

828
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,639
My mother...

829
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,309
Dammit.

830
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:12,812
If you want to leave me,
then take Odd Ears with you and go.

831
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,516
No, Boss.

832
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:30,034
Is there something wrong?

833
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,535
No.

834
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:05,439
You've suffered greatly
because of me.

835
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:07,840
Where is Odd Ears?

836
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,606
He came like the wind
and disappeared like...

837
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,113
Keep it short.

838
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,612
He's in Mapo district.

839
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:22,822
Sir, welcome back!

840
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,121
Your Excellency,
please heed my words.

841
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:33,729
There are rumors that the nation's gangs
are plotting treason.

842
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,237
Please make the order
to arrest them at once.

843
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:39,240
Is that such an easy thing to do?

844
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:44,108
There are also rumors that someone
in the court is supporting them.

845
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,708
I heard your son
also suffered at their hands.

846
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,111
There are things that we should speak of
and things that shouldn't be spoken.

847
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,217
My son, are you here?

848
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:54,516
Yes, Excellency.

849
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,522
There are indeed disagreements
among the gangs,

850
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:00,424
but they are living within
the lores of the underworld.

851
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,331
They wouldn't go so far
as to plot treason.

852
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,327
If you start ordering arrests,

853
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,926
I'm afraid that the government might
fall into chaos over this war.

854
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:13,740
I think it might be best
to just stand back and wait.

855
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,923
You're getting prettier by the day.

856
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:13,933
You're getting dumber by the hour.

857
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,332
What did I do wrong?

858
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:24,312
Thunder, listen very carefully.

859
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,909
This will be the last time we meet.

860
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,014
No, it must be the very last.

861
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,314
Are you that afraid of Man-deuk?

862
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,321
Thunder!

863
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,426
You're in deeper than you think.

864
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,421
They will kill you.

865
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:44,231
I'm not afraid of dying.

866
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,531
Don't risk your life for me.

867
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,638
I'm not worth it.

868
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,338
So leave quickly.

869
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:56,809
You said that
I was a lowlife, right?

870
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,113
I know I'm a worthless person.

871
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,913
I've lived a worthless
life until this day.

872
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,520
But when I'm with you,
I'm different.

873
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:10,420
Trust me.

874
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:16,628
As long as you're with me,
as long as you trust me,

875
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:20,133
I can be the best man
in this world.

876
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:31,108
While you're with me,
while you're watching me,

877
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:35,417
that's the man I want to be.

878
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,710
That's how I want things to be.

879
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:47,915
Thunder.

880
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:54,122
By now, Big Gun,
I mean Man-deuk...

881
01:08:56,565 --> 01:09:00,831
has gathered every swordsman he can
and they're on their way to Mapo.

882
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:03,931
What?

883
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:10,102
Please forget about me and go.

884
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:17,512
Did someone follow you?

885
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:40,132
Hurry and go.

886
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:44,713
Go!

887
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,407
Get out of here.

888
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:57,726
Dishy, run!

889
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,826
Man-deuk, you cheating scum.
You're using blades?

890
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,114
All I need is one punch.

891
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:29,512
Come and fight me, you rat.

892
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,731
As long as you trust me,

893
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:55,036
I can be the best man
in this world.

894
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:04,709
While you are with me,
while you're watching me,

895
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:09,417
that's the man I want to be.

896
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,737
Fighting.

897
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:33,412
That's something a mutt like you

898
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,813
who lives on rotten meat
can't understand.

899
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:48,323
Kill me and let Thunder live.

900
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,226
I'll be your property
if that's what you want

901
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,438
but please let Thunder live.

902
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:04,110
You're just making Thunder
even more pitiful.

903
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,607
Shall I kill her
and let you live?

904
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,716
Look here, Thunder.

905
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:24,731
Being the leader of a gang
is like governing a country.

906
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:30,429
What happened to the pack of dogs
that follows you around?

907
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:37,102
It's too late for you to understand.

908
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:11,212
On your knees!

909
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:16,211
I don't kneel before anyone
who isn't my boss.

910
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:21,122
Oh, really?

911
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,936
Oh goodness.

912
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,138
Oh goodness, Odd Ears.

913
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:42,544
Oh goodness.

914
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,512
Oh goodness, Odd Ears.

915
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:51,813
What happened to you?

916
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,717
Is this finally the end for you?

917
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:57,917
Oh goodness, Odd Ears.

918
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,631
I have a big event coming up,

919
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:10,329
so I don't want to see
any more blood.

920
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:15,037
Everyone knows that Thunder
is under my thumb now.

921
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:24,414
Hand over everything Yangjoo owns
by tomorrow morning.

922
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:30,817
This is a final act
of desperation.

923
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,326
Oh poor you, Odd Ears.

924
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,329
Dammit.

925
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:42,130
Oh, life is so worthless.

926
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,239
Life is so unfair.

927
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:27,014
Sir, I have one request.

928
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:31,415
Please let me have Thunder's body.

929
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:33,316
Look at you.

930
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:35,919
I will give you his
shriveled remains.

931
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:41,725
Bury him in a sunny place.

932
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,902
I met Odd Ears and became
a human being.

933
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:07,511
I met Thunder and wanted to serve
someone who could become a king.

934
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:15,619
What is wrong with having a dream
like that at my age?

935
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:24,533
Thunder was a man
even greater than that.

936
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,433
I don't regret a thing.

937
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,208
It must have been our destiny
to come this far.

938
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:45,315
After serving Odd Ears and Thunder,

939
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,428
I am to live in silence.

940
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:14,306
If it wasn't for your request,
he would be dead.

941
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:18,319
I won't forget your graciousness.

942
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:22,412
You should never forget.

943
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:30,130
You should understand now what
it means to be someone's dog.

944
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:34,834
The magnificent celebration
will start soon.

945
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,133
Now you will fall in love
with me as well.

946
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:53,915
The Yangjoo Gang will disband
after today.

947
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:57,216
What are you talking about?

948
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:02,126
I lived happily sharing my loyalty
and camaraderie with you all.

949
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:07,033
But in a world
of knives and corruption

950
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,831
it is hard to maintain
the way of the fist.

951
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:11,734
Our boss...

952
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:18,804
We couldn't protect our boss.

953
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,111
We have nobody to depend on now.

954
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:32,523
Odd Ears said that he
started with only 10 coins.

955
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,226
Let's all start a new life.

956
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:18,539
Please forgive me.

957
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:23,606
I have nothing to say.

958
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,912
How can I lift my face up
to the sun?

959
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,416
Please forgive me.

960
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,012
But...

961
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:39,115
with my fists I wanted
to play a role in this world.

962
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,424
I need to finish what I started.

963
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,926
I feel wronged and resentful.

964
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:52,338
Now I understand what
you've been talking about.

965
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:58,708
Please give me one more chance.

966
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:04,010
All the men have left,
and all the keys are gone.

967
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:11,116
I'm sorry. I truly am.

968
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,224
But I will bring them back.

969
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:19,126
I will bring them all back.

970
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:26,138
Now I can do anything
that you tell me to do.

971
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:31,206
If you tell me
to eat this dirt and die, I will.

972
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,915
Boss! Boss!

973
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:36,017
Please don't do this.

974
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:41,115
Please help me one more time.

975
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:42,323
Boss.

976
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:46,325
Damn, we cant just lose like this.

977
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,137
Boss.

978
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,605
I will fight alongside you.

979
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:09,110
So shall we.

980
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:19,918
Don't you want to take control?

981
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:26,727
Yes, my friend.

982
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,127
However...

983
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:32,440
you must forget about that woman.

984
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,007
I promise with my life...

985
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:44,813
that no matter what...

986
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:49,523
I will take over the
Bright Moon in Pil district.

987
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:02,125
Post it all over the country.

988
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:09,235
The Fight of All Fights
Man-deuk vs. Thunder

989
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:14,608
Congratulations.

990
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:20,014
I'm only upset
that it's a little late.

991
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:24,925
Do you all also like
cockscomb flowers?

992
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,323
I like pumpkin flowers.

993
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:35,835
I like cockscomb flowers.

994
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:41,041
Cockscomb flowers.

995
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:45,303
Cockscomb flowers are vibrant.

996
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:28,222
She's too beautiful a woman
for one person to possess.

997
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:33,021
Then...
share her with me.

998
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,229
From today...

999
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:47,836
every gang in each territory
shall be disbanded

1000
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:51,503
to merge with the Big Gun Gang.

1001
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:54,206
Hurray!

1002
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,517
Big Gun! Big Gun!

1003
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:23,043
Man-deuk!

1004
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:27,210
Man-deuk!

1005
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,218
Man-deuk!

1006
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:32,819
The shriveled remains are here.

1007
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:34,114
Open the door!

1008
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:39,219
Boss, I'll handle the trivial stuff.

1009
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:15,320
Man-deuk, let's see who is really
the best fighter of the land.

1010
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:18,632
I'll risk everything I own.

1011
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:23,530
Crazy lunatic!

1012
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:27,732
Today's celebration will
also be your funeral.

1013
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:39,915
You shouldn't do that!
Man-deuk!

1014
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,723
Hey, Man-deuk!

1015
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:45,223
Calling you Boss feels so sickening!

1016
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,624
Man-deuk, you dirty swine!

1017
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:48,821
What's happening?

1018
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:50,828
The whole posse is here, dummy!

1019
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,826
How dare they!

1020
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,928
Prince!

1021
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,941
I heard that there will be
a great fight today so I came to watch.

1022
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:04,911
It's going to be a frightening match.

1023
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:11,309
Let's make a bet.

1024
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:14,817
If Man-deuk wins,
I will forget your involvement.

1025
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:21,224
If Thunder wins,
prepare for the road to death.

1026
01:28:23,264 --> 01:28:25,630
Let's begin the fight.

1027
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:28,230
Heed my command!

1028
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,631
Today, it seems that many people

1029
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:34,640
have come to watch the fight
between Thunder and Man-deuk.

1030
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,901
No man shall intervene,

1031
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:40,810
only the two of them
shall fight today!

1032
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:44,816
What do you mean exactly by that?

1033
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:47,512
You're here too?

1034
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:51,916
Watch closely to learn
how real men fight.

1035
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,121
The Fight of All Fights
Man-deuk vs. Thunder

1036
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:09,041
Fine, I accept your challenge.

1037
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:10,705
Everyone, step aside!

1038
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:25,121
This is neither a legend nor a myth!

1039
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:33,530
It's a historic fight between
the greatest fighters of the age!

1040
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:35,135
That's the problem!

1041
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:40,229
I'm so excited
it's hard for me to explain!

1042
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:44,604
The heroes are getting into position!

1043
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:48,409
Now the fight finally begins!

1044
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:30,915
That little!

1045
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,821
You coward!

1046
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:51,702
You useless lowlife!

1047
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:58,018
Man-deuk, you traitor!
It's not over yet!

1048
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:26,613
Get up, you coward!

1049
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:31,516
Coward?

1050
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:20,627
Dammit!

1051
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:22,030
Pick it up, you candy-ass.

1052
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:14,715
You're dead meat, you vermin.

1053
01:33:15,456 --> 01:33:20,416
Just die won't you?

1054
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:48,817
I feel all-powerful
before I sleep with her,

1055
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:52,123
but I feel forlorn
after I sleep with her.

1056
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:53,021
You make me sick.

1057
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:09,442
He won!

1058
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:13,804
Someone write about this fight
in all its detail later!

1059
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:16,109
Let's get out of here for now!

1060
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:29,223
Chil-gap, thank you.

1061
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:45,311
You jerk! You said you were
going to protect me!

1062
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:47,008
But you just walk away like that?

1063
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:50,310
Dammit.

1064
01:34:53,454 --> 01:34:55,012
Chil-gap!

1065
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:06,824
Dishy!

1066
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:10,730
Wait!

1067
01:35:12,173 --> 01:35:14,038
You can't take her away so easily.

1068
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:17,801
Don't you have something
to finish up with me?

1069
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:21,403
Hey, can't you see the state
of my face?

1070
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:23,107
Let's finish this later.

1071
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:26,617
Hey, how about you and me fight.

1072
01:35:26,754 --> 01:35:28,312
And the victor wins Dishy.

1073
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:32,416
You rascal.

1074
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,120
Okay, let's finish this right now,
you wannabe.

1075
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:37,226
There's only one king in this land.

1076
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:39,332
And there's only one king
of fighters.

1077
