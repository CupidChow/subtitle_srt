1
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,840
There are some here too.

2
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,240
Come and get it, quick!

3
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,560
Come over here!

4
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,720
There are more on this side.

5
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,560
They're all mine.

6
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
They're all mine.

7
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,720
All of these are mine.

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,560
Give it back to me.

9
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,240
Mine.

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,240
I'll kill you.

11
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,200
I'll kill you.

12
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,920
I'll kill you.

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,000
They're all mine.

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,880
They're all mine.

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,120
Go to hell!

16
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,360
Don't fight with me.

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,400
Jiu Ye, go to hell!

18
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,760
Jiu Ye.

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
Have you forgotten Jiu'er?

20
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
How can you be so cruel?

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,160
Jiu'er, why is it you?

22
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,200
Why are you here?

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,080
Why are you like this, Jiu'er?

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,200
Jiu Ye.

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,840
Why do you want to kill me?

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,720
Don't you love Jiu'er anymore?

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,800
You betrayed me.

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,160
You.

29
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
If I could kill you once,

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,120
I can kill you a second time.

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,160
Enxi.

32
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,120
Where's the stuff?

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,000
Where is it? Where is it?

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,080
The stuff.

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Where is it? Where is it?

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,960
Enxi.

37
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
My stuff is gone.

38
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,320
My stuff is gone.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,880
Where's the compass?

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
Did you take it? Did you take it?

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
I can't find the stuff.

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
I've looked everywhere, can't find it.

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,640
You took it.

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,800
You took it, Jiu Ye. I didn't.

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,720
I didn't steal it. I can't find it.

46
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,080
You took it. Give it back.

47
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,160
I didn't take it.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,520
Jiu Ye.

49
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,080
Jiu... you.

50
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,440
Jiu Ye.

51
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,080
Jiu Ye.

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,320
Give me the compass.

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,800
It's our turn to get rich.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I don't have the compass.

55
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,960
Don't come closer.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,320
I don't have the compass.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,720
Don't come closer.

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,880
Jiu Ye.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
I told you before,

60
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,520
someone wants to steal your stuff.

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Cui En.

62
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,440
Jiu Ye, you're awake.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,520
Jiu Ye.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,520
I found some mushrooms in the woods.

65
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,320
I made some soup.

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,240
Drink it while it's hot.

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,720
Enxi.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,720
Thank you for your hard work.

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,080
Not at all.

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,640
Thanks to Jiu Ye for saving me yesterday.

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,000
Of course I had to save you.

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,440
You're always loyal to me.

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
I didn't just save you.

74
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,160
I'll take you to enjoy wealth and glory.

75
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,800
Thank you, Jiu Ye.

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,720
Then I'll get back to work.

77
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,040
Jiu Ye.

78
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,920
Look.

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,480
Azure Dragon Ridge.

80
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,040
That's right.

81
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,640
That's it.

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,040
Let's go.

83
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,480
You should eat something.

84
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,160
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

85
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,200
Your body can't take it.

86
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,040
Hai... Haiyue.

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,320
This trip probably won't end well for us.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,720
No, no.

89
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
That's not what I meant.

90
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,200
I mean,

91
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
on this trip,

92
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,200
we don't know what will happen next.

93
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,040
Did I say something wrong again?

94
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I know what you mean.

95
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
No, you don't.

96
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,040
I have a lot I want to tell you.

97
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
I'm afraid if I don't say it now,

98
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,760
I won't get another chance.

99
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,320
Haiyue.

100
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,040
I... I've been an orphan since I was little.

101
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,520
I've never seen my parents since birth.

102
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040
But I was lucky.

103
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,760
Sometimes villagers gave me food.

104
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,480
Sometimes I dug through trash

105
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
to find something to eat.

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,760
I survived, somehow.

107
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,880
Later, traffickers sold me as a blood slave.

108
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,480
I thought that was my fate.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,520
I'd die in there sooner or later.

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,200
But luckily, I met Brother Jin.

111
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,200
And met Chief Luo.

112
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
And then I met you.

113
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,040
I felt I wouldn't die anymore.

114
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,480
I even found a family.

115
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,920
Haiyue.

116
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm not as good as you.

117
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
You know how to hunt ginseng.

118
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,920
You can heal people.

119
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,040
You're even a chieftainess.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,760
If Brother Jin hadn't helped me,

121
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,320
I'd be nothing now.

122
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,440
Haiyue.

123
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,760
I...

124
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,800
I...

125
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,080
I just want to keep looking at you.

126
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,320
Seeing you smile makes me so happy.

127
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,920
I just want to stay by your side.

128
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,880
Watching you.

129
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,440
Yan Baobao.

130
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,480
You have to keep your word.

131
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,440
From now on, you must always look at me.

132
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,640
Stay by my side.

133
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
Don't leave me, not even a step.

134
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,680
Here.

135
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,960
Brother Jinzi.

136
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,000
Where should we go next?

137
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,760
Azure Dragon Ridge.

138
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,080
Jiu Ye, look.

139
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,320
The shelter Jin Shisan built last time.

140
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,840
I see it.

141
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,120
Go a bit further and you'll reach
Azure Dragon Ridge.

142
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,080
I checked the terrain here
early this morning.

143
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,520
The area stretches for over
ten kilometers.

144
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,680
It's all cliffs and steep walls.

145
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,320
But there's something unusual
about this place.

146
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,320
Baobao.

147
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,560
Do you remember the Homage
of the Forest?

148
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,440
It's when every plant and tree

149
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,640
grows in the same direction.

150
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,520
That's right.

151
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,080
It's like this for miles
all around.

152
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,200
Even more amazing than when
we dug up the Shenlong Incense.

153
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,080
It's even more astonishing.

154
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,440
They say the Ginseng King
is about to appear.

155
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,640
It comes once every sixty cycles.

156
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,440
Looks like the Ginseng King
will show up soon.

157
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,200
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

158
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,400
Go!

159
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,080
What a pity.

160
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,080
Jiu Ye.

161
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,280
Drop your gun.

162
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Tingxuan, my nephew.

163
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,400
What are you doing?

164
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,640
You old bastard.

165
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,880
You're hard to kill.

166
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,000
Even poison couldn't finish you.

167
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,200
What poison?

168
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,440
Underworld Mushroom.

169
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,640
To send you down
the road to hell.

170
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,640
Shame about that pot of soup.

171
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,440
But killing that witch Enxi
was worth it.

172
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,520
It was worth it.

173
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,760
Nephew.

174
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,080
Look here.

175
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,000
Your father and I were sworn brothers.

176
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,400
I watched you grow up.

177
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,560
What do you want?

178
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,080
Tell your uncle.

179
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,080
What do I want?

180
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,880
You ask me what I want?

181
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,640
I want you to give Jiu'er
back to me.

182
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,640
Can you do that?

183
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,640
You killed her.

184
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,880
You killed her yourself.

185
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,760
Nephew.

186
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,000
All for a woman?

187
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,440
Do you really know her?

188
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,400
Do you understand her?

189
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,280
She doesn't know
what love is.

190
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,520
She only cares about
your family name.

191
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
If you were poor,

192
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,640
she wouldn't even look at you.

193
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,440
Bullshit!

194
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,520
Listen, old man—

195
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm the only one
in her heart.

196
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,080
Only me.

197
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,000
We agreed—

198
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,440
Once we found the ginseng,
we'd run away together.

199
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,640
Yang Laoba.

200
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,840
You raised a lovesick fool.

201
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
Do you know why

202
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,520
the position went
to your sister?

203
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Because you're useless,
just useless.

204
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,640
You—

205
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm the true heir
of the Yang family. Say it!

206
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,320
You're useless. Say it!

207
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,440
Who am I?

208
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,560
Who am I?

209
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,440
I'm the Yang family heir.

210
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,520
You're the Yang family heir.

211
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,000
You're the Yang family heir. I am—

212
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
You're the Yang family heir. I am—

213
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,760
I am—go to hell!

214
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,760
Enxi.

215
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,960
Enxi. Enxi.

216
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,440
Enxi, what's wrong?

217
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,440
I'll find a way
to save you, sister.

218
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,760
Sis.

219
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,640
Don't bother.

220
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
You're so smart—

221
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,320
You know there's no saving me.

222
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,000
Come on, get up.

223
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,200
Get up.

224
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,880
Sis.

225
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,080
I'm sorry.

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,400
I was wrong.

227
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,840
Yang Tingxuan.

228
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,280
Yang Tingxuan.

229
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,200
Yang Tingxuan, wake up!

230
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,440
You drank too much again.

231
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,200
Yang Tingxuan, wake up.

232
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,000
Wake up.

233
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,200
Wake up!

234
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,640
Brother.

235
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Brother.

236
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,440
Brother, wake up!

237
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,840
Brother.

238
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Brother.

239
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,640
Brother.

240
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,880
Mom and Dad died young.

241
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,080
It's always been just us
since we were kids.

242
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
We suffered so much
from others.

243
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,400
I won't let them
step on us anymore.

244
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
We're all born human.

245
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,520
Why should we be
less than anyone else?

246
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,840
I refuse to accept this fate.

247
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,760
I'll decide my own destiny.

248
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,080
I want to rise above
all of them.

249
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
I want—I...

250
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,440
Mm.

251
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,640
Enxi.

252
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,920
You're my good sister.

253
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,800
But kindness only
gets you bullied.

254
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,400
We, the two daughters
of the Cui family—

255
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
can't both be weak
and gentle.

256
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,400
I want the Cui Ginseng Shop
to thrive too.

257
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,040
Sis.

258
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,920
Sis.

259
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,560
I can see that fool
treats you well.

260
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,040
I really envy you.

261
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,760
Sis.

262
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,400
I can't stay with you
anymore.

263
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,520
Take care of yourself.

264
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,040
I didn't take good care
of you, sister.

265
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,040
Sister—sis.

266
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,560
Here.

267
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,560
I think I see Father.

268
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,280
Enxi. Enxi. Enxi.

269
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,320
Enxi. Enxi.

270
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,320
That Jiu Ye—

271
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,440
is truly ruthless.

272
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,040
Take them away.

273
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,120
Yes, yes.
