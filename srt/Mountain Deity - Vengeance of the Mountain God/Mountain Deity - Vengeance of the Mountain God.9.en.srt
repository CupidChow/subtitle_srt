1
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Jiu'er,

2
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,800
since you joined my Duan family,

3
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,800
you've never left my side.

4
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,880
Tomorrow, we enter the mountains.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,040
It'll be at least ten days, maybe half a month.

6
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,280
I'll miss you, Master.

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,360
Master.

8
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,840
Jiu'er has followed you for so many years,

9
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,600
and can't bear to leave you for a moment.

10
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,520
But for your sake,

11
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,520
and for the Duan family's honor,

12
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,680
I want to win the top prize.

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,800
Who could've known

14
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,160
Jin Shisan would show up out of nowhere.

15
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm afraid I'm too weak alone,

16
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,120
and might shame you.

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,080
So, in your opinion,

18
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,800
which family should we ally with?

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
Jiu'er, you truly understand people.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
Right now,

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
only Yang Ruyi from the Yang family

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,160
can match Jin Shisan's skills.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,760
If we join forces with the Yangs,

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,320
we might have a chance to win.

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,880
Makes sense.

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,760
I'll add one more person to your team.

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,080
Cui Enxi from Cui Ginseng House.

28
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
Cui Enxi came by this afternoon,

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,800
wanting to join my mountain team.

30
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,840
I agreed.

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,800
She's quite experienced.

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,800
She'll be your right hand.

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
Is that alright?

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,760
Whatever you say, Master.

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,480
Brothers of the Ginseng Guild,

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,240
elders and villagers,

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,280
our Grand Mountain Assembly has been held in Songling Town for years.

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,840
The Patron God set this day for ginseng hunting.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,240
It's for our guild brothers

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,280
to unite as one

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,880
and seek greater, better ginseng.

42
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,160
All these years,

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,200
the guild has been oppressed by the Luocha people.

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Things aren't as good as before.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
So, brothers,

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,720
at today's opening assembly,

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,040
no matter who wins the top prize,

48
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,160
we must revive our guild's spirit.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:36,680
Good, good, good!

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,800
Look,

51
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,400
he's Jin Buhuan's adopted son.

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,720
When Jin was Hunt Master,

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,040
he never brought him along.

54
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,160
Can he do it?

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,520
The father was strong,

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,720
but the son might not be.

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
He can say whatever he wants.

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,520
Why do you care?

59
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,440
Didn't you hear?

60
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
He talks so harshly.

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,240
Just wait till our Brother Shisan

62
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,320
finds a big wild ginseng.

63
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,440
Let's see what they'll say then.

64
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,600
Baobao,

65
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,080
remember this:

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,600
The capable speak little; good dogs don't bark.

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,320
You're the center of attention at this assembly.

68
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,240
Everyone's waiting to see

69
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,080
what the Jin family's sole heir

70
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,520
will achieve.

71
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
People only care about what the living gain,

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,800
never what the dead have lost.

73
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Look,

74
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,440
everyone here is all smiles,

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,720
so lively.

76
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,160
Who remembers

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
three years ago?

78
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,680
On this day three years ago, my Jin family

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,320
was wiped out.

80
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,880
Sorry.

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,160
I forgot today is Old Jin's memorial.

82
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,240
It's also my birthday.

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,800
Then I wish Boss Jin wins the prize this trip,

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,400
to honor Old Jin's spirit above.

85
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,400
Miss Yang,

86
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,000
thank you for letting me win.

87
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,400
Jin Shisan,

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,720
though we're both in the guild,

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
and should be allies,

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,240
I won't go easy on you.

91
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
You're gambling for fame,

92
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm gambling with my life.

93
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,240
How could we be the same?

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,720
Luo, Chief Luo,

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,440
why are we entering the mountain

96
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,120
from such a godforsaken place?

97
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,560
Stop talking.

98
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,560
It's our mountain team's rule.

99
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,560
Talking now scatters our energy.

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
We'll struggle to move on.

101
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,680
Jinzi is the Hunt Master.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,280
We go wherever he says.

103
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,120
We're here.

104
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
I'll go down first and wait for you.

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,880
Jinzi,

106
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,160
Baobao,

107
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,280
what's wrong?

108
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,280
Rolling down like a donkey isn't pleasant, huh?

109
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,720
So what?

110
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't care for

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
sliding around slowly here.

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,600
Rolling is faster.

113
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,880
How's that?

114
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,680
You alright?

115
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,560
I'm fine, I'm fine.

116
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,960
Let's go.

117
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,120
It's past noon.

118
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,800
Let's set up camp and eat first.

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,840
Alright.

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,880
Doesn't even help out.

121
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,720
Our young Hunt Master,

122
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,880
why is he so stubborn?

123
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,560
He could team up with anyone,

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,120
but he chose him.

125
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Miss Yang,

126
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,840
among all the women in the Changbai Ginseng Guild,

127
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,320
you're the most capable.

128
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,000
The Hunt Master spot at Yang Ginseng House

129
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
is best suited for you.

130
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,840
Are you saying my brother isn't capable

131
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,720
of inheriting the Hunt Master title?

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,440
No, no,

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
that's not what I meant.

134
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,600
Young Master Tingxuan is talented too.

135
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,520
Besides, you two are sisters.

136
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,720
Our guild values loyalty and righteousness most.

137
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,080
Haiyue is the youngest Hunt Master in the guild.

138
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,680
You assist her by her side,

139
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,840
so carve loyalty and righteousness into your bones.

140
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,600
Bring your bowl over.

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,120
Come eat.

142
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,080
Stop acting so aloof.

143
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,520
Brother Jinzi,

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,720
what are you doing?

145
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,000
It's our mountain tradition.

146
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
We must worship the Patron God before entering.

147
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,400
To receive the mountain god's blessing,

148
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,960
then we can start gathering ginseng.

149
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Patron God above,

150
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,720
please bless our Yang family

151
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,840
to win the top ginseng at this Grand Mountain Assembly

152
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,040
and take the lead.

153
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,200
Let's go.

154
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,520
Six-leaf ginseng was dug up here before.

155
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
We're really lucky today.

156
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,160
Could this be a ginseng cultivation spot?

157
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,400
The earth and sunlight here are strong,

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,400
but the root energy is weak.

159
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,200
This isn't a place where ginseng thrives.

160
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,600
Wait a moment.

161
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,920
There's ginseng over there.

162
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,480
How many leaves?

163
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,280
Four leaves.

164
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
Isn't that a Red Hammer?

165
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,920
It really is ginseng.

166
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,080
Our ancestors are truly blessing us.

167
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,920
It doesn't look very old, though.

168
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,480
Judging by its appearance, it's top grade.

169
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,640
Let's secure it first.

170
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,400
Don't let it get away.

171
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,840
I'll do it.

172
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,080
The ginseng ran off—I'll chase it.

173
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
This spot is sheltered and sunny.

174
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,400
Let's set up camp and rest here.

175
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,080
Alright.

176
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,480
I'll go gather some firewood.

177
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,400
I'll go too.

178
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,720
Then I'll look for some bark.

179
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,280
I'll go find some bark as well.

180
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,640
This kid...

181
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,400
Jin Zi.

182
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,600
Technically, you're the Hunt Master.

183
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,400
We shouldn't be asking this.

184
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,280
But every time your father went up the mountain,

185
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,640
he always chose the west and north slopes.

186
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,080
This time, we've taken

187
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,360
a route through the unfamiliar Wind Pass.

188
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
The mountain path is rough.

189
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,400
We're not familiar with these woods.

190
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,040
Plus, the Koreans next door

191
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,760
often come here to steal ginseng.

192
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,400
Conflicts are bound to happen.

193
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,280
So please explain to everyone

194
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,520
what your plan really is.

195
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,080
Uncle Luo,

196
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,520
you're right.

197
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,160
Everyone followed me into the mountains,

198
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,600
entrusting me with their lives and fortunes.

199
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,840
Of course, I must tell you the truth.

200
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
This time, we're here

201
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,160
for the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

202
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,840
Jin Zi,

203
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,280
So you mean

204
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,080
the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is near Wind Pass?

205
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,400
We owe this to Hai Yue.

206
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,840
Recently, our ginseng guild

207
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,280
got a wild Korean ginseng

208
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,840
from a Korean merchant.

209
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,160
I showed it to Jin Shisan.

210
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,200
Jin Shisan discovered

211
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,920
it was actually a Changbai ginseng from Guandong.

212
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,520
Korean wild ginseng and our Changbai wild ginseng

213
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,160
are from the same lineage.

214
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,160
There are subtle differences.

215
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,520
It's hard to tell them apart.

216
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
From my observation,

217
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,400
that ginseng wasn't fully matured.

218
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,200
It was dug up too soon.

219
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,920
Judging by its crown and striations,

220
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,400
it should've been a Laughing Eight Immortal.

221
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,280
The Korean merchant said

222
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,960
he got it from the Wind Pass area.

223
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,160
That's where he found the ginseng.

224
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,840
So Jin Shisan concluded

225
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,200
that the Wind Pass area

226
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,960
is due for a big ginseng harvest.

227
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,960
If we really find it at Wind Pass

228
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,840
the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng,

229
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,400
this trip will be worth it.

230
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,360
That's right.

231
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,840
As long as we find the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng,

232
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,960
we can expose the one who harmed my father.

233
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,400
Ma'am.

234
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Hello, ma'am.

235
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm from the Yang family of the Changbai Ginseng Guild.

236
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,480
I've gotten lost here.

237
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,920
Could you show me the way?

238
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,400
Hello, ma'am.

239
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
I'd like to ask for directions.

240
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,160
So kind, so kind.

241
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,840
Give it to me.

242
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,840
Give me your heart.

243
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,400
W-what did you say?

244
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,120
Your heart is so kind.

245
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Give me your heart.

246
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,760
Give me your heart.

247
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,880
Give it to me, give it to me.

248
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,400
Give me your heart.

249
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,880
Give it to me.
